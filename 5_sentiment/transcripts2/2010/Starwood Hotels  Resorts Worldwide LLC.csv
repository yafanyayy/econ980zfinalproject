I'd like to begin by reflecting on just how bleak the economic outlook was one year ago. On January 2009, incoming U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Gartner, declared that the economy was on the verge of collapse. Recently, by contrast, he said we're back from the brink and we've traveled a long way from January. And I couldn't agree more. Even at tepid recovery, we'll feel good. For the lodging business, 2009 was the worst downturn in our lifetimes. REVPAR was down over 20% for Starwood. Our competitive strengths became temporary with significant headwinds. In fact, upper upscale in Luxury hotels were hit the hardest and these segments generate over 95% of our profits. Our owned hotels saw a 55% drop in EBITDA and the dollar strength as a safe haven currency added to the operating declines outside of the U.S.  REVPAR comparisons were worse than the second quarter with REVPAR off an eye-popping 30-plus percent. During the summer, we saw the beginning of stabilization. Leisure travels showed signs of life, with weekend occupancies rising and REVPAR improving to minus 20% in the third quarter. By the way, before 2009, none of us ever expected to use the words improving and minus 20% in the same sentence. In our group business, the third quarter also brought signs of stabilization and cancellations and net production. Starting in October, short-term group bookings and corporate transient travels started to improve, leaving our REVPAR trends Q4 at only minus 7%.  We believe there's light at the end of the tunnel, as businesses following patterns similar to the recovery post 9/11. But we remain prepared for a challenging 2010. Just like prior cycles, ADR improvements will lag the general environment.  Recall as the economy began to slow down in December of 2007, our business didn't drop off until December of 2008. We would expect that similar lag on the way out, as group and corporate rates are priced looking backwards. And finally, as excited as we are about our strong results in Q4, they were the results of less negative, not positive, REVPAR growth.Looking ahead, it is safe to declare that our headwinds of 2009, Luxury Brands, owned hotels, global footprint and even foreign exchange will soon be tailwinds.  Moreover, supply growth in North America will drop below 1% in 2011 and beyond, which means we're bullish on rates during the recovery cycle.  Looking further out, we foresee other important reasons to be confident in Starwood's performance. As we shed hotel assets, we will yield cash and transform our company to a business model that generates long-term growth without major capital needs. And the transformation taking place in rapidly growing markets around the world implies a huge secular growth in demand for our high-end brands.So with that as context, I'd like to cover five topics: First, a quick review of the fourth quarter and a look back on our accomplishments in 2009; second, a discussion of our recent business trends and implications for 2010; third, our efforts to own the upswing as business rebounds; fourth, a reminder of why we remain bullish about our long-term secular growth prospects; and fifth, a quick review of how we're pulling our four financial levers to create value for our shareholders.So let's start with my first topic. Our fourth quarter results and a review of our 2009 accomplishments. We were able to beat EBITDA expectations by roughly $50 million. That includes a $25 million securitization gain that was not part of our original guidance. We also beat EPS by $0.29 per share, including that gain. After four quarters of beating expectations, solely by cutting costs, it's refreshing to see the beat come from both lower costs and better-than-expected topline results. Each of our brands performed well in the quarter. As we've been predicting for some time, guests are coming back to Luxury. With higher occupancy, REVPAR for this segment was down roughly 3%. Regionally, Asia-Pacific stood out with REVPAR plus 1%. Yes folks, you heard correctly, that was plus 1%, but it does include 600 basis points of foreign exchange tailwind.  So looking back on 2009, if I were to put a headline on the year, it would be: As the world fell apart, we got busy. Simply put, we did not let this crisis go to waste and Starwood is in the best shape ever. What have we accomplished in 2009? I'll cover that across four areas: Finance, operations, growth and innovation. First, we put our financial house in order, reducing total debt by roughly $1.1 billion from its peak in April. We ended the year with less than $3 billion in debt, beating our target, and that despite the delay of the $200 million tax refund into 2010.  We sold several assets including Bliss, the St. Regis retail space and the W San Francisco, at an average multiple of 20x EBITDA, generating proceeds of $300 million. We also worked with our Vacation Ownership team to generate $315 million in cash. The remaining $500 million was the result of operating cash flow and our deal with American Express.Vasant and his team also worked diligently to de-risk the Company through maturity management. Through debt reduction, as well as, two bond offerings and a tender, we now have no maturities due over the next two years and have reduced our 2012 and 2013 maturities to roughly $500 million each.  We also took a hard look at our Vacation Ownership business. Let me start by saying that I am convinced that we have a world-class team at SVO, along with some of the best resorts and brands in the industry. Nonetheless, in light of future expectations about the business, we spent much of the fourth quarter reviewing our projects. As a result, we recorded a $362 million impairment charge. This charge reflects decisions to stop new development of current landholdings, curtail further development of existing projects and reduce prices to increase the velocity of cash generated from our inventory. Second, in 2009, we pushed ourselves to improve overhead in operations. We completed the AVA process creating run rate SG&A savings of over $100 million. At the property level, our Lean Operations team beat their goal of 50% flow-through [ph] margins. At the same time, each our brands achieved record scores for guest satisfaction. For revenue management, we rolled out our analytical tools to 80 new properties. The tool improves forecasting, so we can better manage our mix and push for higher rates. In properties where this is implemented, we typically see a market share jump of about 2%. We also initiated efforts to make the most of our salesforce. As a result, we now have a truly global salesforce, allowing better sales support across regions and aligned with global customers. We use SPG promotions like free weekends to drive business to the properties, to bring in new members and to grab share of wallet from existing guests.  Finally, by rationalizing brand standards and better procurement, we're reducing costs for our owners and partners. Third, during 2009, we kept growing. The bottom of the cycle is actually a great time to open new hotels. It means we have the newest and best product on the block in the first ending of an up cycle. To that end, we opened 83 hotels in 2009 and signed contracts to open 77 more. We expect 2010 to be the third straight year of 8% plus gross unit additions.  Meanwhile, over the last five years, we've been cleaning up the Le Méridien and Sheraton Hotel portfolios, which means we eliminated 20% of the hotels in the system that were not up to brand standards.  We also reached several other milestones, including; our 500 hotel in North America, our 150th in Asia, our 50th in China and our 25th Westin in Asia. Starwood is on the cusp of two more milestones that highlight our global presence. Over the coming months, we'll open our 1000th hotel in our 100th country.And fourth, as the innovation leader in the lodging industry in 2009, we kept the hammer down on our innovation agenda. We reached 40 Aloft properties in the brand's first 18 months. That marks the fastest growth in the history of select serve. We also launched Element, our first all LEED certified brand. To support these new brands, along with Four Points by Sheraton, we created a dedicated select serve organization to focus on the future growth we expect from this segment. We rolled out the Link Sheraton at 95% of our properties around the world, and guest uptake has been terrific with over 50% of our guests using the Link. That's more, by the way, than use the gym, the bar or eat breakfast.  Coupled with a cool $6 billion spent over the past three years upgrading Sheraton, we're proudly relaunching the brand this year. I'll share some more Sheraton stats with you in a few minutes.  So as you can see, I meant it when I said we got busy in 2009. Now I'll move on to my second topic for the day, recent trends and their implications for 2010. Leisure travel continues to rebound after the depths of 2009. Group is improving with new leads up in the mid-teens. Business travelers have returned as witnessed by improving Monday to Thursday occupancies. New York, a good leading indicator, saw occupancy levels of roughly 88% in Q4. That's just short of the peak of 88.5% in 2007.  These trends bode well for 2010 as compared to even one quarter ago. But as I mentioned before, we remain cautious. The trajectory of the economic recovery is still fragile. And we know rate takes a while to build even when business turns, so REVPAR will not turn positive right away. Based on what we see unfolding today, we expect worldwide company operated REVPAR to be between flat and plus 5% in 2010 and REVPAR to our owned hotels to be roughly flat year-over-year.  Vasant will share in greater detail on recent trends by region and our baseline for 2010. So that leads me to my third topic; Why Starwood is well positioned to own the upswing in 2010? First of all, the tailwinds we described earlier should help in an up market. We were hit on all sides in 2009. The decline in Luxury, drop in demand in major urban markets where we own hotels, and international footprint exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations. As the world economy rebounds, this should bounce back. Second, our portfolio of hotels has never been stronger. We've been painting the proverbial house, building, opening and renovating our properties. So as of today, 60% of our hotels are either brand-new or freshly renovated. And let me mention a few openings, as these iconic properties will redefine their markets, such as the St. Regises in Atlanta and Mexico City, the Ws in Barcelona and South Beach, the Westins in Hyderabad and Mumbai, the Alofts in Dallas and Abu Dhabi and the Sheratons in San Juan and Chongqing.Speaking of Sheraton, we're putting the finishing touches on our three-year revitalization program. Bear in mind, Sheraton is the most recognized hotel brand in the world. And as I mentioned earlier, over $6 billion has already been spent, with an additional $4 billion in new development plans through 2012.  We've opened 65 new hotels, renovated 100 others, redesigned over 300 lobbies and rolled out over 100,000 new Sweet Sleeper Beds. We also pulled the Sheraton flag off 40 hotels that could not meet our standards. That includes the Sheraton Manhattan. This hotel will operate as an unbranded property, so we can take our time to explore options with partners to either renovate or redevelop the property.So what are the results for this revitalization? Measures for guest satisfaction and to return and meeting planner satisfaction are at historic highs. We feel great about where the brand is today and invite you to revisit Sheraton. And to drive awareness for the brand's relaunch, we're in the early stages of Sheraton's biggest marketing campaign ever.  Finally, we're also continuing our top line efforts from 2009, improving revenue management, optimizing our salesforce and leveraging our powerful SPG program.  All of these factors together, will ensure that we will indeed own the upswing, which brings me to my fourth topic: Our long-term growth prospects. As I look back, we responded aggressively to the downturn. But we continue to see ourselves, we always continue to see ourselves as a growth company. Put in another way, the crisis may have delayed but it did not alter our growth strategy. If anything, our view is that the crisis has shown just how unstoppable the trend in wealth creation is around the world, as 3 billion people enter the global economy. Asia represented 75% of global growth last year, with China and India's rate dipping to 6% to 7%. Some expect that more than 70% of the world's growth over the next decade will come from emerging or should I say, rapidly growing markets. This represents a once-in-a-lifetime secular, not cyclical, growth opportunity for infrastructure, including high end hotels.  For us, as the world's most global hotel company, this cannot be better news. Today we're already witnessing the first recovery in the post-World War era where the U.S. is pulled by strength of the emerging markets. And as middle classes are formed and people travel outside of their native countries, they'll look to brands they know well. And the potential numbers of new international travelers is staggering. We estimate that by 2015, 400 million Chinese and Indians will have sufficient incomes to travel abroad. That was 400 million, seven times the number of international travelers who visited the U.S. last year.  Meanwhile, as companies globalize their operations, their demand for global branded hotels will also grow. At Starwood, for example, we recently outsourced much of our IT to India, which is generating hundreds of incremental trips there.These trends underscore while we continue to pursue a quality global growth. We're already the global leader in foreign five-star categories, with over half of our hotel properties outside the U.S. and over 80% of our 85,000-room pipeline to be built in international markets. Asia-Pacific is far and away, our largest source of future growth with 50,000 rooms in that pipeline. The majority of our signings since the financial crisis began have been outside the U.S., which we believe reflects the beginning of a long-term secular growth trend. Great properties strengthened brands which sets the stage for more new hotels.So now for my fifth and final topic. I wanted to remind you of the four financial levers and how we're creating value for our shareholders. The first lever is driving REVPAR growth. Just a few minutes ago, I outlined our efforts to accelerate REVPAR growth and take advantage of the bounce back we should see in our business.  The second lever is cost containment. We achieved significant cost savings over the past year and a half as we streamlined the company. Having made these sometimes painful changes, we're committed to keeping our lean cost structure. The third lever is pipeline growth. Our development team is working hard around the world to reignite growth as capital markets and confidence allow. We kept our discipline, preferring to walk away unless we have the right deals with the right partners, in the right places. And as a result, our pipeline as a percentage of existing rooms, is still the highest in the industry, skewed outside the U.S. in the four and five-star categories.  The fourth lever lies in our balance sheet. We continue to transform Starwood's business mix to be over 80% fee-driven, unlocking the value of our assets. We own at least 21,000 high-end hotel rooms and continue to test the market for asset sales. Monetizing our timeshare inventory and completing the Bal Harbour project are two more ways we can generate incremental cash over the coming years. This transformation should generate substantial after-tax proceeds that not only allow us to pursue growth opportunities but also return large amounts of cash to our shareholders. What will remain is a large and growing fee-based and franchise business, which we regard as one of the best business models in the capitalist world.  Growth is generated by unit additions, REVPAR increases and incentive fees. The contracts are 20 years or more. With limited capital requirements, the business is a free cash flow machine. So let me end my prepared remarks by repeating three key takeaways. First, we're cautiously optimistic about the near-term business environment. Two, we're working hard to own the upswing. And three, we're bullish about long-term growth.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Vasant."

Over the next few minutes, I'll cover three topics: The current state of our business around the world, more color on our 2010 outlook and an update on our liquidity and leverage enhancement program. The big story of the fourth quarter was the return of the business traveler. We exceeded our REVPAR expectations as late-breaking. In particular, corporate transient business was stronger than we had anticipated around the world, and the recovery trend accelerated as the quarter progressed. In North America, REVPAR improved from down 11% to 12% in October, November, to down 6.5% in December and down 3% in January at company-operated hotels. This major improvement was entirely different occupancy, which runs from being flat to up one point in December, to up over six points in January. And most of the occupancy increase was driven by weekday room nights, which grew 6% to 7% in December and January. Leisure transient room nights remained consistently positive, offsetting group declines. Rates continues to lag, but periods of compression in December and January allowed us to improve rate realization from negative 12% in October to negative 9% in January. Year-over-year comparisons have also helped as we lapped the sharpest declines from prior year. Last year at this time, our group business was heading downhill fast. But now we have seen a few positive trends. In Q4, lead volume was up 15%, the first increase since the financial crisis broke. Cancellations in Q4 was down 50%. Although December group production was still well below last year, bookings into 2010 were up over 50% and bookings in the first half of 2010 were up over 100%. So our booking window has shortened dramatically. In addition, businesses have started to confirm meetings that had been put on hold. Corporate renegotiations are ending better than we might have expected a few months ago. They're hearing from our corporate customers that cuts in travel are behind them. Companies want to get their people back on the road, drumming our business and motivating their teams.Internationally, we're seeing similar trends, with the sharpest phase of recovery in Asia. Local currency REVPAR at company-operated hotels in Asia ran from negative 10% and 6% in October and November to positive 7% and 12% in December and January, a 20-point swing over the past four months, as occupancy jumped from up three points to being up nine points, while the rate decline in local currency moderated from minus 14% in October to minus 7% in January.  The recovery was broad-based across Asia, led by China. The only market that lags is Japan. Following the recovery was in the quarter, for the quarter business, up 20% in transient and up over 60% in group over the last year. Europe, Africa and the Middle East REVPAR were down 2% in December, January, after being down 12% in October, November. Once again, occupancy turned positive and rates declines moderated. The trend in Europe tracks the U.S. In Africa and the Middle East, the UAE, where you have a sizable business, was hurt by the debt crisis in Dubai.  While Latin America is also recovering, it was our weakest region. South America is coming back strongly as H1N1 affects Spain. But Mexico, which is tied closely to the U.S., remains weak. In summary, across the world, there are clear signs of a recovery followed by late-breaking transient, in particular, corporate business. That said, it is important to point out that we're digging out of a deep hole. While REVPAR in Q4 exceeded expectations, it was still down 10% in constant dollars worldwide.In our Vacation Ownership business, the trend towards stabilization continued. Doors [ph] and closed rates are holding up. Pricing is under some pressure. By limiting capital allocated to this business, cutting costs and the two securitizations completed last year, SVO generated over $300 million in cash flow, contributing meaningfully to debt reduction that we achieved. During the fourth quarter, we made a series of decisions, in line with our future strategy for this business. We have decided not to develop some sites but we owned the land and had been investing to obtain permits and start construction. These projects have been written down to our best estimate of the fair value of the land. At some other projects where we have been completing current phases, we decided not to develop future phases. This requires us to write down the value of the land, as well as some infrastructure that would have benefit at [ph] future phases. These decisions resulted in the write-down of $255 million of SVO inventory and fixed assets.  Also, we're reducing prices at some projects to step up the pace of sales, requiring an adjustment of $17 million in cost of sales. This $17 million is recorded in the Vacation Ownership expenses line on the P&L. So this piece of the write-off is not recorded in the restructuring line but in the Vacation Ownership expenses line. Finally, based on these decisions, as well as our future expectations for the business, we wrote off $90 million out of the 240 million in goodwill we had on our books for SVO from its acquisition in 1999. We are pleased with the cash the business generated last year and remain focused on running this business for cash in the foreseeable future.So what does all this tell us about 2010? As you can see, what will make or break 2010 is the strength of late-breaking, in particular, corporate transient business and our ability to improve revitalization as the quality of business improves. Group, obvious lags and group phase, while recovering from some sharp declines, would not point to a robust year.  My definition, late-breaking business is hard to forecast. As such, it is very difficult to look four quarters out with any reliability.  In the final analysis, the pace of recovery in 2010 will depend on the long-standing and still evident correlation between REVPAR growth and GDP/corporate profit growth by region and country.While it's tempting to extrapolate the most recent trend all the way through 2010, we think it would not be prudent to do so this early in the year for several reasons. Firstly, we lapped the steepest declines in the first two quarters. Comparisons gets somewhat tougher in the second half. Second, GDP growth right now is above [ph] trend, with inventory replenishment, fiscal and monetary stimulus. Will this be sustained as we enter the back half?  Countries like China, India, Australia and Brazil are all taking steps to prevent their economies from overheating. Good things cooled down a bit in some of our fastest growing markets. And finally, we have taken a massive hit on rates. What will be the pace of rate improvement? It's too early to tell. The world remains an uncertain place with many unknowns.  That said, viewing expectations for a global recovery in GDP, corporate profits and our recent trends, we have substantially upgraded our REVPAR outlook for 2010, from flat to down 5% to flat to up 5% in constant dollars at company-operated hotels worldwide. In developed markets, we do not expect much growth. North America could be flat to down 3% and Europe, only up modestly, flat to up 3%. Positive REVPAR growth will be driven by emerging markets: Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. There, we own more than 20% of our fees in 2009. Assuming Asian economic growth remains robust, Asia could grow 5% to 8% in local currencies. Similar growth rates are likely in Latin America, mostly due to the sharp decline the region experienced last year from H1N1. Mexico remains a key risk; a weak economy hurting business travel, crime and lingering H1N1 effects, hurting leisure travel.  But South America is a bright spot, with its significant commodity exports to fast-growing Asia. Africa and the Middle East could grow 3% to 6%, assuming the situation in the Gulf stabilizes and oil prices hold up.Exchange rates are currently a tailwind. The rates remain at current levels. Dollar REVPAR could be 100 basis points higher globally. It is unclear that Forex will remain a tailwind. Expectations are that the dollar could strengthen further versus the pound, the euro and the yen. Our exposure to the euro and the yen is partially hedged, which will mitigate some of the earnings impact of dollar strength. We would expect management and franchise fee growth to track REVPAR growth globally.Our owned hotels, as you know, are concentrated in developed markets: North America, Europe and Mexico. As such, we expect owned REVPAR to be flattish, down 2% to up 2% in local currencies. Occupancies are likely to be positive but rates will stay negative. With flat REVPAR and occupancy is up, we will need to continue to work hard to limit cost growth. Our intent remains to offset raging [ph] expense inflation with various productivity and procurement programs as we did in 2009. However, 2010 will be another year of declining owned EBITDA.We substantially scaled back our SG&A, down $100 million from 2008 run rates. We believe we are now rightsized and are holding the line on headcount, except in growth markets like Asia, Africa and the Middle East. However, with salary adjustments, incentive compensation resets, the negative impact of a weak dollar and a couple of other items moving in the wrong direction, SG&A in 2010 will be up 3% to 5%. On an operating basis, our Vacation Ownership business will be down $40 million or so versus 2009. $23 million of the reduction would be from securitization gains which we will not have in 2010 due to the change in accounting rules. We also did two securitizations last year. As a result, interest income this year will be $15 million to $20 million lower. This $40 million or so decline in vacation ownership operating results is offset by a $40 million add back from the adoption of FAS 166, 167. In 2009, operating income from vacation ownership and residential was around $118 million. Our range for this year is essentially the same with the accounting change included.At the midpoint of the zero to up 5% REVPAR range and a plus 2% to minus 2% range for owned hotels, baseline company EBITDA would be $750 million. Each point of REVPAR adds or subtracts $15 million in EBITDA. For an apples-to-apples comparison to 2010, you have to adjust 2009 down by around $20 million for asset sales and the deflagging of the Sheraton Manhattan. The FAS 166, 167 addback in 2010 as I just outlined, is awashed with the reduction in financing income at SVO. So where's the $775 million in 2009? The $750 million scenario is a $25 million decline, almost entirely from owned EBITDA.  To get to EPS, our D&A, depreciation and amortization is down about $10 million or so due to asset sales. Our book interest expense is up by about $20 million from the accounting change. With a 22% tax rate, the $750 million scenario for EBITDA translates to $0.63 of EPS.Moving on to liquidity leverage and cash flow. Our liquidity and leverage enhancement program is largely complete. That is down below $3 billion from over $4 billion. Our year-end leverage ratio was at 4x, well below the covenant level of 5.5x.  We started the year with $2.9 billion in debt maturing through 2013. We end the year with slightly over $1 billion in maturities through 2013 and no maturities until 2012. All maturing debt in 2010 and '11 has been paid down. Our financial flexibility has been substantially enhanced. In the first half of 2010, we will be working with our bank group to extend the maturity of our revolver beyond 2011. In the fourth quarter, we generated $400 million from the sale of the Fifth Avenue retail shops at a 20 multiple of '09 EBITDA; Bliss at a 30 multiple and a securitization that generated a $23 million gain; all accretive transactions.  In 2010, we'll spend $250 million in hotel capital. Investment capital spending will be $100 million as we undertake some ROI projects which were on hold. Maintenance and IT spending will be $150 million as we step up spending on technology. We're scaling back capital spending at SVO again as projects are completed. With the securitization plan in Q4 2010, SVO will generate over $150 million in cash flow, more than adequate to cover capital deployed at Bal Harbour. Bal Harbour capital is estimated at $140 million but could be lower as we receive deposits from additional condo sales. Both inquiries and contract activity at Bal Harbour have picked up meaningfully after the turn of the year.  Cash generated in the Hotel business will be sufficient to cover cash interest and taxes. So on an operating basis, we will be cash flow neutral in 2010. We are still expecting to receive our tax refund from the IRS sometime in 2010. Assuming we receive $200 million plus from the tax refund, after paying dividends and before any additional asset sales, that should come down another $100 million to $200 million by the end of the year. In summary, we're entering what we believe will be a multi-year upswing with a great cost structure, excellent liquidity, a strong balance sheet and of course, the best brands, pipeline and global footprint in the hotel business. As Frits indicated, we feel very good about the long-term outlook for our business.  With that, I'll turn this back to Jay."

In terms of your bullwhip effect, I like that turn of phrase. We've been talking internally about some degree of pent-up demand. And we've certainly seen that on projects that companies were planning and then put on hold or meetings or conventions that they normally held each year, but they held off on.

We've talked in the past and continue to express a desire to pursue an asset-light strategy. The reality of the matter is, though, that this is not a great time to be selling assets. What we would be looking for today is a multiple of peak EBITDA, somewhere in the double figures. And given the decline in EBITDA, that would be a very high multiple today. And we may get it, we may not. In fact, if you look at the sales we made in 2009, we were, in fact, able to average over 20x EBITDA for what we sold. To the second part of your question, in terms of reinvestment, I think there are two areas where we would be investing. The first, and most importantly, is making ourselves the best operator of global hospitality brands around the world, which means investing in IT technology and support so that we can bring as much value as possible for our owners and partners. The other thing that we're going to explore on a selective basis is if this is not a great time to sell assets, but we have hotels that could be shaped up and perform better by having put some capital in. And I'm thinking about, for example, the ballroom at the Phoenician, as an example. Those might be projects that we would undertake in the next couple of years as a way to try to put the properties we have for sale in the best shape possible. And then in terms of investment grade for share repurchase, we would like to get to investment grade. And I think, only after that, we'd really think seriously about significant share repurchase."

And we felt like given the $6 billion that's been invested behind the Sheraton brand over the last three years and the additional $4 billion that will be put against developing this brand over the next three years, this property really just didn't hold up in terms of guest satisfaction in the physical plant. And I say that, acknowledging sincerely, that the work that our team has done to keep guests happy over the last few years has been terrific.

Now the formula for those properties is slightly different than in North America. They're really great hotels.

And as the year has emerged, people decided that in fact, there is an opportunity. We've come back and seen some very short window bookings that Vasant referred to earlier. I think on the business transient side, it's just as simple as this. For business to work, people have to get out and travel. And I think in our business, as in many others, we spent the last year and a half working very hard to reduce our costs.

I'd like to begin by reflecting on just how bleak the economic outlook was one year ago. On January 2009, incoming U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Gartner, declared that the economy was on the verge of collapse. Recently, by contrast, he said we're back from the brink and we've traveled a long way from January. And I couldn't agree more. Even at tepid recovery, we'll feel good. For the lodging business, 2009 was the worst downturn in our lifetimes. REVPAR was down over 20% for Starwood. Our competitive strengths became temporary with significant headwinds. In fact, upper upscale in Luxury hotels were hit the hardest and these segments generate over 95% of our profits. Our owned hotels saw a 55% drop in EBITDA and the dollar strength as a safe haven currency added to the operating declines outside of the U.S.  REVPAR comparisons were worse than the second quarter with REVPAR off an eye-popping 30-plus percent. During the summer, we saw the beginning of stabilization. Leisure travels showed signs of life, with weekend occupancies rising and REVPAR improving to minus 20% in the third quarter. By the way, before 2009, none of us ever expected to use the words improving and minus 20% in the same sentence. In our group business, the third quarter also brought signs of stabilization and cancellations and net production. Starting in October, short-term group bookings and corporate transient travels started to improve, leaving our REVPAR trends Q4 at only minus 7%.  We believe there's light at the end of the tunnel, as businesses following patterns similar to the recovery post 9/11. But we remain prepared for a challenging 2010. Just like prior cycles, ADR improvements will lag the general environment.  Recall as the economy began to slow down in December of 2007, our business didn't drop off until December of 2008. We would expect that similar lag on the way out, as group and corporate rates are priced looking backwards. And finally, as excited as we are about our strong results in Q4, they were the results of less negative, not positive, REVPAR growth.Looking ahead, it’s safe to declare that our headwinds of 2009, Luxury Brands, owned hotels, global footprint and even foreign exchange will soon be tailwinds.  Moreover, supply growth in North America will drop below 1% in 2011 and beyond, which means we're bullish on rates during the recovery cycle.  Looking further out, we foresee other important reasons to be confident in Starwood's performance. As we shed hotel assets, we will yield cash and transform our company to a business model that generates long-term growth without major capital needs. And the transformation taking place in rapidly growing markets around the world implies a huge secular growth in demand for our high-end brands.So with that as context, I'd like to cover five topics: First, a quick review of the fourth quarter and a look back on our accomplishments in 2009; second, a discussion of our recent business trends and implications for 2010; third, our efforts to own the upswing as business rebounds; fourth, a reminder of why we remain bullish about our long-term secular growth prospects; and fifth, a quick review of how we're pulling our four financial levers to create value for our shareholders.So let's start with my first topic, our fourth quarter results and a review of our 2009 accomplishments. We were able to beat EBITDA expectations by roughly $50 million. That includes a $25 million securitization gain that was not part of our original guidance. We also beat EPS by $0.29 per share, including that gain. After four quarters of beating expectations solely by cutting costs, it's refreshing to see the beat come from both lower costs and better-than-expected top line results. Each of our brands performed well in the quarter. As we've been predicting for some time, guests are coming back to Luxury. With higher occupancy, REVPAR for this segment was down roughly 3%. Regionally, Asia-Pacific stood out with REVPAR plus 1%. Yes folks, you heard correctly, that was plus 1%, but it does include 600 basis points of foreign exchange tailwind.  So looking back on 2009, if I were to put a headline on the year, it would be: As the world fell apart, we got busy. Simply put, we did not let this crisis go to waste and Starwood is in the best shape ever. What have we accomplished in 2009? I'll cover that across four areas: Finance, operations, growth and innovation. First, we put our financial house in order, reducing total debt by roughly $1.1 billion from its peak in April. We ended the year with less than $3 billion in debt, beating our target, and that despite the delay of the $200 million tax refund into 2010.  We sold several assets including Bliss, the St. Regis retail space and the W San Francisco, at an average multiple of 20x EBITDA, generating proceeds of $300 million. We also worked with our vacation ownership team to generate $315 million in cash. The remaining $500 million was the result of operating cash flow and our deal with American Express.Vasant and his team also worked diligently to de-risk the company through maturity management. Through debt reduction, as well as two bond offerings and a tender, we now have no maturities due over the next two years and have reduced our 2012 and 2013 maturities to roughly $500 million each.  We also took a hard look at our vacation ownership business. Let me start by saying that I am convinced that we have a world-class team at SVO, along with some of the best resorts and brands in the industry. Nonetheless, in light of future expectations about the business, we spent much of the fourth quarter reviewing our projects. As a result, we recorded a $362 million impairment charge. This charge reflects decisions to stop new development of current landholdings, curtail further development of existing projects and reduce prices to increase the velocity of cash generated from our inventory. Second, in 2009, we pushed ourselves to improve overhead in operations. We completed the AVA process, creating run rate SG&A savings of over $100 million. At the property level, our Lean Operations team beat their goal of 50% flow-through margins. At the same time, each our brands achieved record scores for guest satisfaction. For revenue management, we rolled out our analytical tools to 80 new properties. The tool improves forecasting, so we can better manage our mix and push for higher rates. In properties where this is implemented, we typically see a market share jump of about 2%. We also initiated efforts to make the most of our sales force. As a result, we now have a truly global sales force, allowing better sales support across regions and alignment with global customers. We used SPG promotions like free weekends to drive business to the properties, to bring in new members and to grab share of wallet from existing guests.  Finally, by rationalizing brand standards and better procurement, we're reducing costs for our owners and partners. Third, during 2009, we kept growing. The bottom of the cycle is actually a great time to open new hotels. It means we have the newest and best product on the block in the first ending of an up cycle. To that end, we opened 83 hotels in 2009 and signed contracts to open 77 more. We expect 2010 to be the third straight year of 8% plus gross unit additions.  Meanwhile, over the last five years, we've been cleaning up the Le Méridien and Sheraton Hotel portfolios, which means we eliminated 20% of the hotels in the system that were not up to brand standards.  We also reached several other milestones, including; our 500 hotel in North America, our 150th in Asia, our 50th in China and our 25th Westin in Asia. Starwood is on the cusp of two more milestones that highlight our global presence. Over the coming months, we'll open our 1000th hotel in our 100th country.And fourth, as the innovation leader in the lodging industry in 2009, we kept the hammer down on our innovation agenda. We reached 40 Aloft properties in the brand's first 18 months. That marks the fastest growth in the history of select serve. We also launched Element, our first all LEED certified brand. To support these new brands, along with Four Points by Sheraton, we created a dedicated select serve organization to focus on the future growth we expect from this segment. We rolled out the Link Sheraton at 95% of our properties around the world, and guest uptake has been terrific with over 50% of our guests using the Link. That's more, by the way, than use the gym, the bar or eat breakfast.  Coupled with a cool $6 billion spent over the past three years upgrading Sheraton, we're proudly re-launching the brand this year. I'll share some more Sheraton stats with you in a few minutes.  So as you can see, I meant it when I said we got busy in 2009. Now I'll move on to my second topic for the day, recent trends and their implications for 2010. Leisure travel continues to rebound after the depths of 2009. Group is improving with new leads up in the mid-teens. Business travelers have returned as witnessed by improving Monday to Thursday occupancies. New York, a good leading indicator, saw occupancy levels of roughly 88% in Q4. That's just short of the peak of 88.5% in 2007.  These trends bode well for 2010 as compared to even one quarter ago. But as I mentioned before, we remain cautious. The trajectory of the economic recovery is still fragile. And we know rate takes a while to build even when business turns, so REVPAR will not turn positive right away. Based on what we see unfolding today, we expect worldwide company operated REVPAR to be between flat and plus 5% in 2010 and REVPAR to our owned hotels to be roughly flat year-over-year.  Vasant will share in greater detail on recent trends by region and our baseline for 2010. So that leads me to my third topic; Why Starwood is well positioned to own the upswing in 2010? First of all, the tailwinds we described earlier should help in an up market. We were hit on all sides in 2009. The decline in Luxury, drop in demand in major urban markets where we own hotels, and international footprint exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations. As the world economy rebounds, this should bounce back. Second, our portfolio of hotels has never been stronger. We've been painting the proverbial house, building, opening and renovating our properties. So as of today, 60% of our hotels are either brand-new or freshly renovated. And let me mention a few openings, as these iconic properties will redefine their markets, such as the St. Regises in Atlanta and Mexico City, the Ws in Barcelona and South Beach, the Westins in Hyderabad and Mumbai, the Alofts in Dallas and Abu Dhabi and the Sheratons in San Juan and Chongqing.Speaking of Sheraton, we're putting the finishing touches on our three-year revitalization program. Bear in mind, Sheraton is the most recognized hotel brand in the world. And as I mentioned earlier, over $6 billion has already been spent, with an additional $4 billion in new development planned through 2012.  We've opened 65 new hotels, renovated 100 others, redesigned over 300 lobbies and rolled out over 100,000 new Sweet Sleeper Beds. We also pulled the Sheraton flag off 40 hotels that could not meet our standards. That includes the Sheraton Manhattan. This hotel will operate as an unbranded property, so we can take our time to explore options with partners to either renovate or redevelop the property.So what are the results of this revitalization? Measures for guest satisfaction, likelihood to return and meeting planner satisfaction are at historic highs. We feel great about where the brand is today and invite you to revisit Sheraton. And to drive awareness of the brand's re-launch, we're in the early stages of Sheraton's biggest marketing campaign ever.  Finally, we're also continuing our top line efforts from 2009, improving revenue management, optimizing our sales force and leveraging our powerful SPG program.  All of these factors together will ensure that we will indeed own the upswing. Which brings me to my fourth topic: Our long-term growth prospects. As I look back, we responded aggressively to the downturn. But we continue to see ourselves, we always continue to see ourselves as a growth company. Put another way, the crisis may have delayed but it did not alter our growth strategy. If anything, our view is that the crisis has shown just how unstoppable the trend in wealth creation is around the world, as three billion people enter the global economy. Asia represented 75% of global growth last year, with China and India's rate dipping to 6% to 7%. Some expect that more than 70% of the world's growth over the next decade will come from emerging, or should I say, rapidly growing markets. This represents a once-in-a-lifetime secular, not cyclical, growth opportunity for infrastructure, including high-end hotels.  For us, as the world's most global hotel company, this could not be better news. Today we're already witnessing the first recovery in the post-World War era where the U.S. is pulled by strength of the emerging markets. And as middle classes are formed and people travel outside of their native countries, they'll look to brands they know well. And the potential numbers of new international travelers is staggering. We estimate that by 2015, 400 million Chinese and Indians will have sufficient incomes to travel abroad. That was 400 million, seven times the number of international travelers who visited the U.S. last year.  Meanwhile, as companies globalize their operations, their demand for global branded hotels will also grow. At Starwood, for example, we recently outsourced much of our IT to India, which is generating hundreds of incremental trips there.These trends underscore while we continue to pursue a quality global growth. We're already the global leader in foreign five-star categories, with over half of our hotel properties outside the U.S. and over 80% of our 85,000-room pipeline to be built in international markets. Asia-Pacific is far and away, our largest source of future growth with 50,000 rooms in that pipeline. The majority of our signings since the financial crisis began have been outside the U.S., which we believe reflects the beginning of a long-term secular growth trend. Great properties strengthened brands which sets the stage for more new hotels.So now for my fifth and final topic. I wanted to remind you of the four financial levers and how we're creating value for our shareholders. The first lever is driving REVPAR growth. Just a few minutes ago, I outlined our efforts to accelerate REVPAR growth and take advantage of the bounce back we should see in our business.  The second lever is cost containment. We achieved significant cost savings over the past year and a half as we streamlined the company. Having made these sometimes painful changes, we're committed to keeping our lean cost structure. The third lever is pipeline growth. Our development team is working hard around the world to reignite growth as capital markets and confidence allow. We kept our discipline, preferring to walk away unless we have the right deals with the right partners, in the right places. And as a result, our pipeline as a percentage of existing rooms, is still the highest in the industry, skewed outside the U.S. in the four and five-star categories.  The fourth lever lies in our balance sheet. We continue to transform Starwood's business mix to be over 80% fee-driven, unlocking the value of our assets. We own at least 21,000 high-end hotel rooms and continue to test the market for asset sales. Monetizing our timeshare inventory and completing the Bal Harbour project are two more ways we can generate incremental cash over the coming years. This transformation should generate substantial after-tax proceeds that not only allow us to pursue growth opportunities but also return large amounts of cash to our shareholders. What will remain is a large and growing fee-based and franchise business, which we regard as one of the best business models in the capitalist world.  Growth is generated by unit additions, REVPAR increases and incentive fees. The contracts are 20 years or more. With limited capital requirements, the business is a free cash flow machine. So let me end my prepared remarks by repeating three key takeaways. First, we're cautiously optimistic about the near-term business environment. Two, we're working hard to own the upswing. And three, we're bullish about long-term growth.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Vasant."

The big st",2250,"Thank you, Frits and good morning, everyone. Over the next few minutes, I'll cover three topics: The current state of our business around the world, more color on our 2010 outlook and an update on our liquidity and leverage enhancement program. The big story of the fourth quarter was the return of the business traveler. We exceeded our REVPAR expectations as late-breaking. In particular, corporate transient business was stronger than we had anticipated around the world, and the recovery trend accelerated as the quarter progressed. In North America, REVPAR improved from down 11% to 12% in October, November, to down 6.5% in December and down 3% in January at company-operated hotels. This major improvement was entirely different occupancy, which runs from being flat to up one point in December, to up over six points in January. And most of the occupancy increase was driven by weekday room nights, which grew 6% to 7% in December and January. Leisure transient room nights remained consistently positive, offsetting group declines. Rates continues to lag, but periods of compression in December and January allowed us to improve rate realization from negative 12% in October to negative 9% in January. Year-over-year comparisons have also helped as we lapped the sharpest declines from prior year. Last year at this time, our group business was heading downhill fast. But now we have seen a few positive trends. In Q4, lead volume was up 15%, the first increase since the financial crisis broke. Cancellations in Q4 was down 50%. Although December group production was still well below last year, bookings into 2010 were up over 50% and bookings in the first half of 2010 were up over 100%. So our booking window has shortened dramatically. In addition, businesses have started to confirm meetings that had been put on hold. Corporate renegotiations are ending better than we might have expected a few months ago. We're hearing from our corporate customers that cuts in travel are behind them. Companies want to get their people back on the road, drumming our business and motivating their teams.Internationally, we're seeing similar trends, with the sharpest phase of recovery in Asia. Local currency REVPAR at company-operated hotels in Asia ran from negative 10% and 6% in October and November to positive 7% and 12% in December and January, a 20-point swing over the past four months, as occupancy jumped from up three points to being up nine points, while the rate decline in local currency moderated from minus 14% in October to minus 7% in January.  The recovery was broad-based across Asia, led by China. The only market that lags is Japan. Following the recovery was in the quarter, for the quarter business, up 20% in transient and up over 60% in group over the last year. Europe, Africa and the Middle East REVPAR were down 2% in December, January, after being down 12% in October, November. Once again, occupancy turned positive and rates declines moderated. The trend in Europe tracks the U.S. In Africa and the Middle East, the UAE, where you have a sizable business, was hurt by the debt crisis in Dubai.  While Latin America is also recovering, it was our weakest region. South America is coming back strongly as H1N1 affects Spain. But Mexico, which is tied closely to the U.S., remains weak. In summary, across the world, there are clear signs of a recovery followed by late-breaking transient, in particular, corporate business. That said, it is important to point out that we're digging out of a deep hole. While REVPAR in Q4 exceeded expectations, it was still down 10% in constant dollars worldwide.In our Vacation Ownership business, the trend towards stabilization continued. Tours and close rates are holding up. Pricing is under some pressure. By limiting capital allocated to this business, cutting costs and the two securitizations completed last year, SVO generated over $300 million in cash flow, contributing meaningfully to debt reduction that we achieved. During the fourth quarter, we made a series of decisions, in line with our future strategy for this business. We have decided not to develop some sites but we owned the land and had been investing to obtain permits and start construction. These projects have been written down to our best estimate of the fair value of the land. At some other projects where we have been completing current phases, we decided not to develop future phases. This requires us to write down the value of land, as well as some infrastructure that would have benefited future phases. These decisions resulted in the write-down of $255 million of SVO inventory and fixed assets.  Also, we're reducing prices at some projects to step up the pace of sales, requiring an adjustment of $17 million in cost of sales. This $17 million is recorded in the Vacation Ownership expenses line on the P&L. So this piece of the write-off is not recorded in the restructuring line but in the Vacation Ownership expenses line. Finally, based on these decisions, as well as our future expectations for the business, we wrote off $90 million out of the 240 million in goodwill we had on our books for SVO from its acquisition in 1999. We are pleased with the cash the business generated last year and remain focused on running this business for cash in the foreseeable future.So what does all this tell us about 2010? As you can see, what will make or break 2010 is the strength of late-breaking, in particular, corporate transient business and our ability to improve revitalization as the quality of business improves. Group, obvious lags and group phase, while recovering from some sharp declines, would not point to a robust year.  My definition, late-breaking business is hard to forecast. As such, it is very difficult to look four quarters out with any reliability.  In the final analysis, the pace of recovery in 2010 will depend on the long-standing and still evident correlation between REVPAR growth and GDP/corporate profit growth by region and country.While it's tempting to extrapolate the most recent trend all the way through 2010, we think it would not be prudent to do so this early in the year for several reasons. Firstly, we lapped the steepest declines in the first two quarters. Comparisons gets somewhat tougher in the second half. Second, GDP growth right now is above [ph] trend, with inventory replenishment, fiscal and monetary stimulus. Will this be sustained as we enter the back half?  Countries like China, India, Australia and Brazil are all taking steps to prevent their economies from overheating. Good things cooled down a bit in some of our fastest growing markets. And finally, we have taken a massive hit on rates. What will be the pace of rate improvement? It's too early to tell. The world remains an uncertain place with many unknowns.  That said, viewing expectations for a global recovery in GDP, corporate profits and our recent trends, we have substantially upgraded our REVPAR outlook for 2010, from flat to down 5% to flat to up 5% in constant dollars at company-operated hotels worldwide. In developed markets, we do not expect much growth. North America could be flat to down 3% and Europe, only up modestly, flat to up 3%. Positive REVPAR growth will be driven by emerging markets: Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. There, we own more than 20% of our fees in 2009. Assuming Asian economic growth remains robust, Asia could grow 5% to 8% in local currencies. Similar growth rates are likely in Latin America, mostly due to the sharp decline the region experienced last year from H1N1. Mexico remains a key risk; a weak economy hurting business travel, crime and lingering H1N1 effects, hurting leisure travel.  But South America is a bright spot, with its significant commodity exports to fast-growing Asia. Africa and the Middle East could grow 3% to 6%, assuming the situation in the Gulf stabilizes and oil prices hold up.Exchange rates are currently a tailwind. The rates remain at current levels. Dollar REVPAR could be 100 basis points higher globally. It is unclear that forex will remain a tailwind. Expectations are that the dollar could strengthen further versus the pound, the euro and the yen. Our exposure to the euro and the yen is partially hedged, which will mitigate some of the earnings impact of dollar strength. We would expect management and franchise fee growth to track REVPAR growth globally.Our owned hotels, as you know, are concentrated in developed markets: North America, Europe and Mexico. As such, we expect owned REVPAR to be flattish, down 2% to up 2% in local currencies. Occupancies are likely to be positive but rates will stay negative. With flat REVPAR and occupancies up, we will need to continue to work hard to limit cost growth. Our intent remains to offset raging [ph] expense inflation with various productivity and procurement programs as we did in 2009. However, 2010 will be another year of declining owned EBITDA.We have substantially scaled back our SG&A, down $100 million from 2008 run rates. We believe we are now rightsized and are holding the line on headcount, except in growth markets like Asia, Africa and the Middle East. However, with salary adjustments, incentive compensation resets, the negative impact of a weak dollar and a couple of other items moving in the wrong direction, SG&A in 2010 will be up 3% to 5%. On an operating basis, our Vacation Ownership business will be down $40 million or so versus 2009. $23 million of the reduction would be from securitization gains which we will not have in 2010 due to the change in accounting rules. We also did two securitizations last year. As a result, interest income this year will be $15 million to $20 million lower. This $40 million or so decline in Vacation Ownership operating results is offset by a $40 million add back from the adoption of FAS 166, 167. In 2009, operating income from vacation ownership and residential was around $118 million. Our range for this year is essentially the same with the accounting change included.At the midpoint of the zero to up 5% REVPAR range and the plus 2% to minus 2% range for owned hotels, baseline company EBITDA would be $750 million. Each point of REVPAR adds or subtracts $15 million in EBITDA. For an apples-to-apples comparison to 2010, you have to adjust 2009 down by around $20 million for asset sales and the de-flagging of the Sheraton Manhattan. The FAS 166, 167 add back in 2010 as I just outlined, is awash with the reduction in financing income at SVO. So what’s this the $775 million in 2009? The $750 million scenario is a $25 million decline, almost entirely from owned EBITDA.  To get to EPS, our D&A, depreciation and amortization is down about $10 million or so due to asset sales. Our book interest expense is up by about $20 million from the accounting change. With a 22% tax rate, the $750 million scenario for EBITDA translates to $0.63 of EPS.Moving on to liquidity, leverage and cash flow. Our liquidity and leverage enhancement program is largely complete. Debt is down below $3 billion from over $4 billion. Our year-end leverage ratio was at 4x, well below the covenant level of 5.5x.  We started the year with $2.9 billion in debt maturing through 2013. We end the year with slightly over $1 billion in maturities through 2013 and no maturities until 2012. All maturing debt in 2010 and '11 has been paid down. Our financial flexibility has been substantially enhanced. In the first half of 2010, we will be working with our bank group to extend the maturity of our revolver beyond 2011. In the fourth quarter, we generated $400 million from the sale of the Fifth Avenue retail shops at a 20 multiple of '09 EBITDA; Bliss at a 30 multiple and a securitization that generated a $23 million gain; all accretive transactions.  In 2010, we'll spend $250 million in hotel capital. Investment capital spending will be $100 million as we undertake some ROI projects which were on hold. Maintenance and IT spending will be $150 million as we step up spending on technology. We're scaling back capital spending at SVO again as projects are completed. With a securitization planned in Q4 2010, SVO will generate over $150 million in cash flow, more than adequate to cover capital deployed at Bal Harbour. Bal Harbour capital is estimated at $140 million but could be lower as we receive deposits from additional condo sales. Both inquiries and contract activity at Bal Harbour have picked up meaningfully after the turn of the year.  Cash generated in the Hotel business will be sufficient to cover cash interest and taxes. So on an operating basis, we will be cash flow neutral in 2010. We are still expecting to receive our tax refund from the IRS sometime in 2010. Assuming we receive $200 million plus from the tax refund, after paying dividends and before any additional asset sales, that should come down another $100 million to $200 million by the end of the year. In summary, we're entering what we believe will be a multi-year upswing with a great cost structure, excellent liquidity, a strong balance sheet and of course, the best brands, pipeline and global footprint in the hotel business. As Frits indicated, we feel very good about the long-term outlook for our business.  With that, I'll turn this back to Jay."

In terms of your bullwhip effect, I like that turn of phrase. We've been talking internally about some degree of pent-up demand. And we've certainly seen that on projects that companies were planning and then put on hold or meetings or conventions that they normally held each year, but they held off on. And I think you will see some of that bouncing back. And in fact, that's largely, I think, what explains the growth in transient and bookings for group over the last few months."

We've talked in the past and continue to express a desire to pursue an asset-light strategy. The reality of the matter is, though, that this is not a great time to be selling assets. What we would be looking for today is a multiple of peak EBITDA somewhere into double figures. And given the decline in EBITDA, that would be a very high multiple today. And we may get it, we may not. In fact, if you look at the sales we made in 2009, we were, in fact, able to average over 20x EBITDA for what we sold. To the second part of your question, in terms of reinvestment, I think there are two areas where we would be investing. The first, and most importantly, is making ourselves the best operator of global hospitality brands around the world, which means investing in IT technology and support so that we can bring as much value as possible for our owners and partners. The other thing that we're going to explore on a selective basis is if this is not a great time to sell assets, but we have hotels that could be shaped up and perform better by having put some capital in. And I'm thinking about, for example, the ballroom at the Phoenician, as an example. Those might be projects that we would undertake in the next couple of years as a way to try to put the properties we have for sale in the best shape possible. And then in terms of investment grade for share repurchase, we would like to get to investment grade, and I think only after that we'd really think seriously about a significant share repurchase."

I think the important thing that investors should know is that we, as management, don't want to have another Bal Harbour project that we would run and develop on around. So Bill, whether we would sell or maintain some ownership as we went into development with a partner, I think, depends on what kind of deal we would structure. Our point of view here was that -- and the reason we took the flag off is we wanted to take our time to do this right. And we felt like given the $6 billion that's been invested behind the Sheraton brand over the last three years and the additional $4 billion that will be put against developing this brand over the next three years, this property really just didn't hold up in terms of guest satisfaction in the physical plant. And I say that, acknowledging sincerely, that the work that our team has done to keep guests happy over the last few years has been terrific. In terms of which brand, at this point, given the location, it's too early to tell. I think with the size and with the mix of properties we have, we'd be looking at an upper upscale brand for that area and quite possibly, maintain the Sheraton flag on what comes next."

And as the year has emerged, people decided that in fact, there is an opportunity. We've come back and seen some very short window bookings that Vasant referred to earlier. I think on the business transient side, it's just as simple as this. For business to work, people have to get out and travel. And I think in our business, as in many others, we spent the last year and a half working very hard to reduce our costs.

I'd like to begin by reflecting on just how bleak the economic outlook was one year ago. On January 2009, incoming U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Gartner, declared that the economy was on the verge of collapse. Recently, by contrast, he said we're back from the brink and we've traveled a long way from January. And I couldn't agree more. Even a tepid recovery will feel good. For the Lodging business, 2009 was the worst downturn in our lifetimes. REVPAR was down over 20% for Starwood. Our competitive strengths became temporary but significant headwinds. In fact, upper upscale and luxury hotels were hit the hardest, and these segments generate over 95% of our profits. Our owned hotels saw a 55% drop in EBITDA and the dollar strength as a safe-haven currency added to the operating declines outside of the U.S. REVPAR comparisons were worse than the second quarter, with REVPAR off an eye-popping 30-plus percent. During the summer, we saw the beginning of stabilization. Leisure travels showed signs of life, with weekend occupancies rising and REVPAR improving to minus 20% in the third quarter. By the way, before 2009, none of us ever expected to use the words improving and minus 20% in the same sentence. In our Group business, the third quarter also brought signs of stabilization in cancellations and net production. Starting in October, short-term group bookings and corporate transient travels started to improve, leaving our REVPAR trends for Q4 at only minus 7%.  We believe there's light at the end of the tunnel, as business is following patterns similar to the recovery, post 9/11. But we remain prepared for a challenging 2010. Just like prior cycles, ADR improvements will lag the general environment.  Recall, as the economy began the slowdown in December of 2007, our business didn't drop off until December of 2008. We would expect a similar lag on the way up, as group and corporate rates are priced looking backwards. And finally, as excited as we are about our strong results in Q4, they were the results of less negative, not positive, REVPAR growth.Looking ahead, it’s safe to declare that our headwinds of 2009, Luxury Brands, owned hotels, global footprint and even foreign exchange will soon be tailwinds.  Moreover, supply growth in North America will drop below 1% in 2011 and beyond, which means we're bullish on rates during the recovery cycle.  Looking further out, we foresee other important reasons to be confident in Starwood's performance. As we shed hotel assets, we will yield cash and transform our company to a business model that generates long-term growth without major capital needs. And the transformation taking place in rapidly growing markets around the world implies a huge secular growth in demand for our high-end brands.So with that as context, I'd like to cover five topics: First, a quick review of the fourth quarter and a look back on our accomplishments in 2009; second, a discussion of our recent business trends and implications for 2010; third, our efforts to own the upswing as business rebounds; fourth, a reminder of why we remain bullish about our long-term secular growth prospects; and fifth, a quick review of how we're pulling our four financial levers to create value for our shareholders.So let's start with my first topic, our fourth quarter results and a review of our 2009 accomplishments. We were able to beat EBITDA expectations by roughly $50 million. That includes a $25 million securitization gain that was not part of our original guidance. We also beat EPS by $0.29 per share, including that gain. After four quarters of beating expectations solely by cutting costs, it's refreshing to see the beat come from both lower costs and better-than-expected top line results. Each of our brands performed well in the quarter. As we've been predicting for some time, guests are coming back to Luxury. With higher occupancy, REVPAR for this segment was down roughly 3%. Regionally, Asia-Pacific stood out with REVPAR plus 1%. Yes folks, you heard correctly, that was plus 1%, but it does include 600 basis points of foreign exchange tailwind.  So looking back on 2009, if I were to put a headline on the year, it would be: As the world fell apart, we got busy. Simply put, we did not let this crisis go to waste and Starwood is in the best shape ever. What have we accomplished in 2009? I'll cover that across four areas: Finance, operations, growth and innovation. First, we put our financial house in order, reducing total debt by roughly $1.1 billion from its peak in April. We ended the year with less than $3 billion in debt, beating our target, and that despite the delay of the $200 million tax refund into 2010.  We sold several assets including Bliss, the St. Regis retail space and the W San Francisco, at an average multiple of 20x EBITDA, generating proceeds of $300 million. We also worked with our vacation ownership team to generate $315 million in cash. The remaining $500 million was the result of operating cash flow and our deal with American Express.Vasant and his team also worked diligently to de-risk the company through maturity management. Through debt reduction, as well as two bond offerings and a tender, we now have no maturities due over the next two years and have reduced our 2012 and 2013 maturities to roughly $500 million each.  We also took a hard look at our vacation ownership business. Let me start by saying that I am convinced that we have a world-class team at SVO, along with some of the best resorts and brands in the industry. Nonetheless, in light of future expectations about the business, we spent much of the fourth quarter reviewing our projects. As a result, we recorded a $362 million impairment charge. This charge reflects decisions to stop new development of current landholdings, curtail further development of existing projects and reduce prices to increase the velocity of cash generated from our inventory. Second, in 2009, we pushed ourselves to improve overhead in operations. We completed the AVA process, creating run rate SG&A savings of over $100 million. At the property level, our Lean Operations team beat their goal of 50% flow-through margins. At the same time, each our brands achieved record scores for guest satisfaction. For revenue management, we rolled out our analytical tools to 80 new properties. The tool improves forecasting, so we can better manage our mix and push for higher rates. In properties where this is implemented, we typically see a market share jump of about 2%. We also initiated efforts to make the most of our sales force. As a result, we now have a truly global sales force, allowing better sales support across regions and alignment with global customers. We used SPG promotions, like Free Weekends, to drive business to the properties, to bring in new members and to grab share of wallet from existing guests.  Finally, by rationalizing brand standards and better procurement, we're reducing costs for our owners and partners. Third, during 2009, we kept growing. The bottom of a cycle is actually a great time to open new hotels. It means we have the newest and best product on the block in the first inning of an upcycle. To that end, we opened 83 hotels in 2009 and signed contracts to open 77 more. We expect 2010 to be the third straight year of 8% plus gross unit additions. Meanwhile, over the last five years, we've been cleaning up the Le Méridien and Sheraton Hotel portfolios, which means we eliminated 20% of the hotels in the system that were not up to brand standards. We also reached several other milestones, including our 500th hotel in North America, our 150th in Asia, our 50th in China and our 25th Westin in Asia. Starwood is on the cusp of two more milestones that highlight our global presence. Over the coming months, we'll open our 1,000th hotel in our 100th country.And fourth, as the innovation leader in the lodging industry in 2009, we kept a hammer down on our innovation agenda. We reached 40 Aloft properties in the brand's first 18 months. That marks the fastest growth in the history of select serve. We also launched Element, our first all LEED-certified [Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design] brand. To support these new brands, along with Four Points by Sheraton, we created a dedicated select-serve organization to focus on the future growth we expect from this segment. We rolled out the Link@Sheraton at 95% of our properties around the world. And guest uptake has been terrific, with over 50% of our guests using the Link. That's more, by the way, than use the gym, the bar or eat breakfast. Coupled with a cool $6 billion spent over the past three years upgrading Sheraton, we're proudly re-launching the brand this year. I'll share some more Sheraton stats with you in a few minutes. So as you can see, I meant it when I said we got busy in 2009. Now I'll move on to my second topic for the day, recent trends and their implications for 2010. Leisure travel continues to rebound after the depths of 2009. Group is improving, with new leads up in the mid-teens. Business travelers have returned, as witnessed by improving Monday to Thursday occupancies. New York, a good leading indicator, saw occupancy levels of roughly 88% in Q4. That's just short of the peak of 88.5% in 2007.  These trends bode well for 2010 as compared to even one quarter ago. But as I mentioned before, we remain cautious. The trajectory of the economic recovery is still fragile. And we know rate takes a while to build even when business turns, so REVPAR will not turn positive right away. Based on what we see unfolding today, we expect worldwide company-operated REVPAR to be between flat and plus 5% in 2010, and REVPAR to our owned hotels to be roughly flat year-over-year. Vasant will share in greater detail on recent trends by region and our baseline for 2010. So that leads me to my third topic, why Starwood is well positioned to own the upswing in 2010. First of all, the tailwinds we described earlier should help in an upmarket. We were hit on all sides in 2009: the decline in luxury, dropping demand in major urban markets where we own hotels and international footprint exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations. As the world economy rebounds, these should bounce back. Second, our portfolio of hotels has never been stronger. We've been painting the proverbial house, building, opening and renovating our properties. So as of today, 60% of our hotels are either brand new or freshly renovated. And let me mention a few openings, as these iconic properties will redefine their markets, such as the St. Regises in Atlanta and Mexico City, the Ws in Barcelona and South Beach, the Westins in Hyderabad and Mumbai, the Alofts in Dallas and Abu Dhabi and the Sheratons in San Juan and Chongqing.Speaking of Sheraton, we're putting the finishing touches on our three-year revitalization program. Bear in mind, Sheraton is the most recognized hotel brand in the world. And as I mentioned earlier, over $6 billion has already been spent, with an additional $4 billion in new development planned through 2012.  We've opened 65 new hotels, renovated 100 others, redesigned over 300 lobbies and rolled out over 100,000 new Sweet Sleeper Beds. We also pulled the Sheraton flag off 40 hotels that could not meet our standards. That includes the Sheraton Manhattan. This hotel will operate as an unbranded property, so we can take our time to explore options with partners to either renovate or redevelop the property.So what are the results of this revitalization? Measures for guest satisfaction, likelihood to return and meeting planner satisfaction are at historic highs. We feel great about where the brand is today and invite you to revisit Sheraton. And to drive awareness of the brand's re-launch, we're in the early stages of Sheraton's biggest marketing campaign ever.  Finally, we're also continuing our top line efforts from 2009, improving revenue management, optimizing our sales force and leveraging our powerful SPG program.  All of these factors together will ensure that we will indeed own the upswing. Which brings me to my fourth topic: Our long-term growth prospects. As I look back, we responded aggressively to the downturn. But we continue to see ourselves, we always continue to see ourselves as a growth company. Put another way, the crisis may have delayed but it did not alter our growth strategy. If anything, our view is that the crisis has shown just how unstoppable the trend in wealth creation is around the world, as three billion people enter the global economy. Asia represented 75% of global growth last year, with China and India's rate dipping to 6% to 7%. Some expect that more than 70% of the world's growth over the next decade will come from emerging, or should I say, rapidly growing markets. This represents a once-in-a-lifetime secular, not cyclical, growth opportunity for infrastructure, including high-end hotels.  For us, as the world's most global hotel company, this could not be better news. Today we're already witnessing the first recovery in the post-World War era where the U.S. is pulled by strength of the emerging markets. And as middle classes are formed and people travel outside of their native countries, they'll look to brands they know well. And the potential numbers of new international travelers is staggering. We estimate that by 2015, 400 million Chinese and Indians will have sufficient incomes to travel abroad. That was 400 million, seven times the number of international travelers who visited the U.S. last year.  Meanwhile, as companies globalize their operations, their demand for global-branded hotels will also grow. At Starwood, for example, we recently outsourced much of our IT to India, which is generating hundreds of incremental trips there.These trends underscore, while we continue to pursue, a quality global growth. We're already the global leader in foreign five-star categories, with over half of our hotel properties outside the U.S., and over 80% of our 85,000-room pipeline to be built in international markets. Asia-Pacific is far and away, our largest source of future growth, with 50,000 rooms in that pipeline. The majority of our signings since the financial crisis began have been outside the U.S., which we believe reflects the beginning of a long-term secular growth trend. Great properties strengthen brands, which sets the stage for more new hotels.So now for my fifth and final topic. I wanted to remind you of the four financial levers and how we're creating value for our shareholders. The first lever is driving REVPAR growth. Just a few minutes ago, I outlined our efforts to accelerate REVPAR growth and take advantage of the bounce back we should see in our business.  The second lever is cost containment. We achieved significant cost savings over the past year and a half, as we streamlined the company. Having made these sometimes painful changes, we're committed to keeping our lean cost structure. The third lever is pipeline growth. Our development team is working hard around the world to reignite growth as capital markets and confidence allow. We kept our discipline, preferring to walk away unless we have the right deals with the right partners, in the right places. And as a result, our pipeline as a percentage of existing rooms, is still the highest in the industry, skewed outside the U.S. in the four- and five-star categories.  The fourth lever lies in our balance sheet. We continue to transform Starwood's business mix to be over 80% fee-driven, unlocking the value of our assets. We own or lease 21,000 high-end hotel rooms and continue to test the market for asset sales. Monetizing our time-share inventory and completing the Bal Harbour project are two more ways we can generate incremental cash over the coming years. This transformation should generate substantial after-tax proceeds that not only allow us to pursue growth opportunities, but also return large amounts of cash to our shareholders. What will remain is a large and growing fee-based and franchise business, which we regard as one of the best business models in the capitalist world.  Growth is generated by unit additions, REVPAR increases and incentive fees. The contracts are 20 years or more. With limited capital requirements, the business is a free cash flow machine. So let me end my prepared remarks by repeating three key takeaways. First, we're cautiously optimistic about the near-term business environment. Two, we're working hard to own the upswing. And three, we're bullish about long-term growth.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Vasant."
341584,84102613,55312,"Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2010",2010-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone.

The big s",2256,"Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. Over the next few minutes, I'll cover three topics: the current state of our business around the world, more color on our 2010 outlook and an update on our liquidity and leverage enhancement program. The big story of the fourth quarter was the return of the business traveler. We exceeded our REVPAR expectations as late-breaking. In particular, Corporate Transient business was stronger than we had anticipated around the world, and the recovery trend accelerated as the quarter progressed. In North America, REVPAR improved from down 11% to 12% in October, November, to down 6.5% in December and down 3% in January at company-operated hotels. This major pace of improvement was entirely driven by occupancy, which runs from being flat to up one point in December, to up over six points in January. And most of the occupancy increase was driven by weekday room nights, which grew 6% to 7% in December and January. Leisure transient room nights remained consistently positive, offsetting group declines. Rate continues to lag, but periods of compression in December and January allowed us to improve rate realization from negative 12% in October to negative 9% in January. Year-over-year comparisons are also helped as we lap the sharpest declines from prior year. Last year, at this time, our Group business was heading downhill fast. But now we have seen a few positive trends. In Q4, lead volume was up 15%, the first increase since the financial crisis broke. Cancellations in Q4 was down 50%. Although December group production was still well below last year, bookings into 2010 were up over 50% and bookings in the first half of 2010 were up over 100%. So our booking window has shortened dramatically. In addition, businesses have started to confirm meetings that had been put on hold. Corporate renegotiations are ending better than we might have expected a few months ago. We're hearing from our corporate customers that cuts in travel are behind them. Companies want to get their people back on the road, drumming our business and motivating their teams.Internationally, we're seeing similar trends, with the sharpest phase of recovery in Asia. Local currency REVPAR at company-operated hotels in Asia ran from negative 10% and 6% in October and November to positive 7% and 12% in December and January, a 20-point swing over the past four months, as occupancy jumped from up three points to being up nine points, while the rate decline in local currency moderated from minus 14% in October to minus 7% in January.  The recovery was broad-based across Asia, led by China. The only market that lags is Japan. Following the recovery was in the quarter, for the quarter business, up 20% in transient and up over 60% in group over the last year. Europe, Africa and the Middle East REVPAR were down 2% in December, January, after being down 12% in October, November. Once again, occupancy turned positive and rates declines moderated. The trend in Europe tracks the U.S. In Africa and the Middle East, the UAE, where you have a sizable business, was hurt by the debt crisis in Dubai.  While Latin America is also recovering, it was our weakest region. South America is coming back strongly as H1N1 affects Spain. But Mexico, which is tied closely to the U.S., remains weak. In summary, across the world, there are clear signs of a recovery followed by late-breaking transient, in particular, corporate business. That said, it is important to point out that we're digging out of a deep hole. While REVPAR in Q4 exceeded expectations, it was still down 10% in constant dollars worldwide.In our Vacation Ownership business, the trend towards stabilization continued. Tours and close rates are holding up. Pricing is under some pressure. By limiting capital allocated to this business, cutting costs and the two securitizations completed last year, SVO [Starwood Vacation Ownership] generated over $300 million in cash flow, contributing meaningfully to debt reduction that we achieved. During the fourth quarter, we made a series of decisions in-line with our future strategy for this business. We have decided not to develop some sites where we own the land, and had been investing to obtain permits and start construction. These projects have been written down to our best estimate of the fair value of the land. At some other projects where we have been completing current phases, we decided not to develop future phases. This requires us to write down the value of land, as well as some infrastructure that would have benefited future phases. These decisions resulted in the write-down of $255 million of SVO inventory and fixed assets.  Also, we're reducing prices at some projects to step up the pace of sales, requiring an adjustment of $17 million in cost of sales. This $17 million is recorded in the Vacation Ownership expenses line on the P&L. So this piece of the write-off is not recorded in the restructuring line, but in the Vacation Ownership expenses line. Finally, based on these decisions, as well as our future expectations for the business, we wrote off $90 million out of the $240 million in goodwill we had on our books for SVO from its acquisition in 1999. We are pleased with the cash the business generated last year, and remain focused on running this business for cash in the foreseeable future.So what does all this tell us about 2010? As you can see, what will make or break 2010 is the strength of late-breaking, in particular, Corporate Transient business and our ability to improve rate realization, as the quality of business improves. Group always lags and group phase, while recovering from some sharp declines, would not point to a robust year.  My definition, late-breaking business is hard to forecast. As such, it is very difficult to look four quarters out with any reliability.  In the final analysis, the pace of recovery in 2010 will depend on the long standing and still evident correlation between REVPAR growth and GDP/corporate profit growth by region and country.While it's tempting to extrapolate the most recent trend all the way through 2010, we think it would not be prudent to do so this early in the year for several reasons. Firstly, we lapped the steepest declines in the first two quarters. Comparisons get somewhat tougher in the second half. Second, GDP growth right now is above trend, with inventory replenishment, fiscal and monetary stimulus. Will this be sustained as we enter the back half?  Countries like China, India, Australia and Brazil are all taking steps to prevent their economies from overheating. Good things cooled down a bit in some of our fastest-growing markets. And finally, we have taken a massive hit on rates. What will be the pace of rate improvement? It's too early to tell. The world remains an uncertain place, with many unknowns.  That said, view and expectations for a global recovery in GDP, corporate profits and our recent trends, we have substantially upgraded our REVPAR outlook for 2010, from flat to down 5%, to flat to up 5% in constant dollars at company-operated hotels worldwide. In developed markets, we do not expect much growth. North America could be flat to down 3%, and Europe only up modestly, flat to up 3%. Positive REVPAR growth will be driven by emerging markets, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, where we own more than 20% of our fees in 2009. Assuming Asian economic growth remains robust, Asia could grow 5% to 8% in local currencies. Similar growth rates are likely in Latin America, mostly due to the sharp decline the region experienced last year from H1N1. Mexico remains a key risk; a weak economy hurting business travel, crime and lingering H1N1 effects, hurting leisure travel. But South America is a bright spot, with its significant commodity exports to fast-growing Asia. Africa and the Middle East could grow 3% to 6%, assuming the situation in the Gulf stabilizes and oil prices hold up.Exchange rates are currently a tailwind. The rates remain at current levels. Dollar REVPAR could be 100 basis points higher globally. It is unclear that forex will remain a tailwind. Expectations are that the dollar could strengthen further versus the pound, the euro and the yen. Our exposure to the euro and the yen is partially hedged, which will mitigate some of the earnings impact of dollar strength. We would expect management and franchise fee growth to track REVPAR growth globally.Our owned hotels, as you know, are concentrated in developed markets, North America, Europe and Mexico. As such, we expect owned REVPAR to be flattish, down 2% to up 2% in local currencies. Occupancies are likely to be positive, but rate will stay negative. With flat REVPAR and occupancies up, we will need to continue to work hard to limit cost growth. Our intent remains to offset wage and expense inflation, with various productivity and procurement programs as we did in 2009. However, 2010 will be another year of declining owned EBITDA.We have substantially scaled back our SG&A, down $100 million from 2008 run rates. We believe we are now rightsized and are holding the line on headcount, except in growth markets like Asia, Africa and the Middle East. However, with salary adjustments, incentive compensation resets, the negative impact of a weak dollar and a couple of other items moving in the wrong direction, SG&A in 2010 will be up 3% to 5%. On an operating basis, our Vacation Ownership business will be down $40 million or so versus 2009. $23 million of the reduction would be from securitization gains which we will not have in 2010 due to the change in accounting rules. We also did two securitizations last year. As a result, interest income this year will be $15 million to $20 million lower. This $40 million or so decline in Vacation Ownership operating results is offset by a $40 million add back from the adoption of FAS 166, 167. In 2009, operating income from vacation ownership and residential was around $118 million. Our range for this year is essentially the same with the accounting change included.At the midpoint of the zero to up 5% REVPAR range and the plus 2% to minus 2% range for owned hotels, baseline company EBITDA would be $750 million. Each point of REVPAR adds or subtracts $15 million in EBITDA. For an apples-to-apples comparison to 2010, you have to adjust 2009 down by around $20 million for asset sales and the de-flagging of the Sheraton Manhattan. The FAS 166, 167 add back in 2010 as I just outlined, is awash with the reduction in financing income at SVO. So what’s this the $775 million in 2009? The $750 million scenario is a $25 million decline, almost entirely from owned EBITDA.  To get to EPS, our D&A, depreciation and amortization is down about $10 million or so due to asset sales. Our book interest expense is up by about $20 million from the accounting change. With a 22% tax rate, the $750 million scenario for EBITDA translates to $0.63 of EPS.Moving on to liquidity, leverage and cash flow. Our liquidity and leverage enhancement program is largely complete. Debt is down below $3 billion from over $4 billion. Our year-end leverage ratio was at 4x, well below the covenant level of 5.5x.  We started the year with $2.9 billion in debt maturing through 2013. We end the year with slightly over $1 billion in maturities through 2013 and no maturities until 2012. All maturing debt in 2010 and '11 has been paid down. Our financial flexibility has been substantially enhanced. In the first half of 2010, we will be working with our bank group to extend the maturity of our revolver beyond 2011. In the fourth quarter, we generated $400 million from the sale of the Fifth Avenue retail shops at a 20 multiple of '09 EBITDA; Bliss at a 30 multiple and a securitization that generated a $23 million gain; all accretive transactions.  In 2010, we'll spend $250 million in hotel capital. Investment capital spending will be $100 million as we undertake some ROI projects which were on hold. Maintenance and IT spending will be $150 million as we step up spending on technology. We're scaling back capital spending at SVO again as projects are completed. With a securitization planned in Q4 2010, SVO will generate over $150 million in cash flow, more than adequate to cover capital deployed at Bal Harbour. Bal Harbour capital is estimated at $140 million but could be lower as we receive deposits from additional condo sales. Both inquiries and contract activity at Bal Harbour have picked up meaningfully after the turn of the year.  Cash generated in the Hotel business will be sufficient to cover cash interest and taxes. So on an operating basis, we will be cash flow neutral in 2010. We are still expecting to receive our tax refund from the IRS sometime in 2010. Assuming we receive $200 million plus from the tax refund, after paying dividends and before any additional asset sales, that should come down another $100 million to $200 million by the end of the year. In summary, we're entering what we believe will be a multiyear upswing with a great cost structure, excellent liquidity, a strong balance sheet and of course, the best brands, pipeline and global footprint in the hotel business. As Frits indicated, we feel very good about the long-term outlook for our business. With that, I'll turn this back to Jay."

The reality of the matter is, though, that this is not a great time to be selling assets. What we would be looking for today is a multiple of peak EBITDA somewhere in the double figures. And given the decline in EBITDA, that would be a very high multiple today. And we may get it, we may not. In fact, if you look at the sales we made in 2009, we were in fact, able to average over 20x EBITDA for what we sold. To the second part of your question, in terms of reinvestment, I think there are two areas where we would be investing. The first and most importantly, is making ourselves the best operator of global hospitality brands around the world, which means investing in IT technology and support so that we can bring as much value as possible for our owners and partners. The other thing that we're going to explore on a selective basis is, if this is not a great time to sell assets but we have hotels that could be shaped up and perform better by having put some capital in; and I'm thinking about, for example, the ballroom at the Phoenician, as an example; those might be projects that we would undertake in the next couple of years as a way to try to put the properties we have for sale in the best shape possible. And then in terms of investment grade for share repurchase, we would like to get to investment grade. And I think only after that we'd really think seriously about a significant share repurchase."

And we felt like given the $6 billion that's been invested behind the Sheraton brand over the last three years and the additional $4 billion that will be put against developing this brand over the next three years, this property really just didn't hold up in terms of guest satisfaction in the physical plant. And I say that, acknowledging sincerely, that the work that our team has done to keep guests happy over the last few years has been terrific.

And I think people we're taking advantage of what they saw to be favorable rates out in future years. But at the same time, 2010 was still pretty light, and our suspicion was that people were waiting to see just what kind of a budget year 2010 would be. And as the year has emerged, people decided that, in fact, there is an opportunity. And we've come back and seen some very short window bookings that Vasant referred to earlier. I think on the business transient side, it's just as simple as this. For business to work, people have to get out and travel. And I think in our business, as in many others, we spent the last year and a half working very hard to reduce our costs.

As you may recall, rather than make predictions, we were looking at a range of scenarios for 2010. Of the many scenarios we considered, what we see today is without a doubt the good case scenario. The pent-up demand that we hoped for is materializing. And as the economy picks up steam, more businesses are shifting their focus from cost cutting to growing the top line, which means resetting travel and expense budgets and shifting gears to get back on the road after 18 months of dormancy. This holds true as we look around the world. Emerging markets, or as we increasingly call them, rapidly growing markets are exhibiting a strong V-shaped recovery. And at the same time, the U.S. and Western Europe are proving robust. But let me repeat, we are not in the business of forecasting the global economy. Visibility in our business remains very limited making it challenging to forecast one quarter out, let alone the balance of the year. We call it as we see it in real time and we plan for an array of scenarios. This approach served us well in navigating through 2009. 
So despite all the good news and the better than expected REVPAR, we still see reasons to consider less sanguine scenarios. To borrow a phrase from Warren Buffett, we should be fearful when others are greedy. We want to avoid the mistake of taking actions born out newfound optimism. After all, the global economy remains volatile. China risks overheating. Greece and the eurozone are grappling with major fiscal and philosophical issues, not to mention the mountain of U.S. government debt. Finally, volcanoes in Iceland, red shirts in Thailand and unrest in Mexico remind us that our industry is susceptible to sudden changes from many unforeseen corners.
In an uncertain world, we remain committed to financial discipline of flexibility. This means austerity in procurement, on-property costs and corporate SG&A. We simply refuse to give back the cost savings that we worked so hard to achieve. If good times continue, this will drive better flow-throughs than in prior cycles. In fact, thanks to lower costs at equivalent REVPAR levels, our EBITDA would be at least $100 million higher than before 2009. 
Our financial discipline also applies to our balance sheet. We'll continue to de-risk and delever it, thanks to operating cash flow, securitizations, proceeds from asset sales, such as the W Court in Tuscany and the long-awaited IRS tax refund.
So with that as a backdrop, I'll cover four topics today: First, a quick review of our first quarter results and implications for the balance of the year; second, some thoughts from a recent 10-day trip to India; third, a few perspectives on the bounce back of luxury travel; and fourth, a review of the five essentials of the journey, the touchstone of Starwood’s direction.
So let me start with some highlights from the first quarter and a range of expectations for the balance of the year.
We were able to beat EBITDA expectations by roughly $30 million and EPS by $0.13, owing to strong REVPAR growth. REVPAR was powered by better than expected occupancy, thanks to strong transient demand and encouragingly, in the quarter for the quarter group bookings. By the way, this was consistent with our good case scenario, which anticipated that as business environment improved, companies would scramble to set up pending meetings and events. Our good case scenario also envisioned luxury leading the charge, and this is exactly what happened. Luxury occupancy was up by almost 20% in the quarter.
Rate for the quarter was still negative in most geographies and brands, as is typical of the early stages of recoveries. Importantly though, ADRs did improve month by month through the quarter and are nearing positive territory in many markets. Coupled with our continued focus on costs, these solid top line results drove good flow-throughs and margins, even despite the challenging mix of rising occupancy and falling rates. The favorable trends that we've experienced in Q1 continued into April and bode well for the balance of the year. 
Leisure and transient demand remained firm more than offsetting group business that was canceled or not booked in 2009. Importantly, the strongest results came from our urban markets such as New York, London and Paris and in the foreign five-star categories, all Starwood sweet spots. Corporate transient revenue in London and Paris was up 43% in the quarter. 
Group production was improving quickly off a low base. Remember that last year, we had a little new bookings and a high cancellation activity. Our gross production, i.e. new bookings, is up 30% for 2010, and importantly, cancellations, block adjustments and washed [ph] arrival are down from record level last year, and in fact, are now trending below normal levels. This translates into net production, which is projected net revenue for the year and end of year being up triple digits.
LEED volumes were also up double-digits, particularly for small or near-term bookings. And the recovery is broad-based with particular strength in pharma, technology and financial services. In aggregate, 2010 group pace for the total amount of book business is approaching flat, after bottoming out in the fall of last year at minus 23%. So lodging demand continues to improve from the low-level set in 2009. Based on everything we see today and barring disruptions, we can expect positive REVPAR for the full year from each of our regions. Our newly revised mid-range scenario shows worldwide company-operated REVPAR to be between plus 5% and 8% in 2010 and REVPAR at our worldwide-owned hotels to be plus 4% to 7%. Vasant will share greater detail on recent trends by region and a revised baseline scenario for 2010. 
So with that as a backdrop, let me move on to my second topic and highlight some themes from our recent trip to India. Our 10-day whistle-stop tour included visits to 18 of our 41 hotels, 21 existing and 15 being built. In Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Jaipur, and Delhi, we saw first-hand examples of what we've been saying for a while. Put simply, the transformation taking place there and in other rapidly growing markets around the world, implies a huge secular growth in demand for our high-end brands. To look for analogies to these long-term trends, think back to the rebuilding of Europe after the Second World War, only faster and with 10 times the population. In this environment, Starwood enjoys a strong position with some of the best-known brands, long-standing relationships with the development community and as we like to call them, local smart teams that are either native or spent their careers working in these markets. The key takeaway is that this crisis may have slowed, but it certainly did not derail the unstoppable forces of globalization and the emerging middle class. 
So let's talk about the opportunity in India. And while India and China are vastly different in so many ways, lodging supply looks and feels like China five to 10 years ago. In hindsight, many corporations began investing in China in the 1970s and 80s in anticipation of growth, but only those companies who, like Starwood, stayed the course, hired local talent and forged relationships with local partners, saw their investments pay dividends in recent years. To say that India today is under-hotel-ed relative to future demand is a massive understatement. New York City alone has almost as many hotel rooms as the entire country. And today, we enjoy a larger and better footprint than our competitors. So we can grow our existing brands while introducing new brands, such as Four Points by Sheraton, Westin, and Aloft. And the travel market is still in its infancy. With roughly the same population as China, India generates just 1/4 the outbound travel. And even with the government’s incredible India campaign to promote tourism, India has only 5 million visitors versus 50 million for China. 
So today, the dearth of infrastructure and choking transportation has created enormous pressure to develop new cities outside of old ones. As countries develop, people leave villages and head for opportunities in the city. A development named new Mindspace in Hyderabad highlights this pattern of organization. One developer we worked with, worked with the government to acquire land outside the city and built 7.5 million square feet of commercial space including retail, offices, and of course, two new hotel sites, one of which already boasts a brand new Westin. This phenomenon is playing out in Navi Mumbai, outside of Mumbai, and in Gurgaon outside of Delhi and in Whitefield, outside of Bangalore.
It wouldn't surprise anyone that Sheraton was the first Western brand to open in India in 1973, with Le Méridien soon after. Decades before many of our competitors had entered the market. Both Sheraton and Le Méridien are established brands and the backbone of our brand of portfolio. We see a great opportunity to work with our key partners to build new hotels under both France. Our global development mantra of the right places, the right properties and the right partners holds true in India as anywhere. And our local smart teams understand the market and how to get things done. This is an asset that simply can't be found ion the balance sheet. 
Westin is a rising giant in India. We recently opened three new Westins in the country, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune and expect another to open later on in the coming months in Gurgaon. Developers in India understand and appreciate Starwood’s penchant for innovation and Westin’s focus on wellness, contemporary design, not to mention the Heavenly Bed our clear differentiators. The growth in the Westin is made possible by the credibility in relationships built by Sheraton and Le Méridien over several decades.
Today, we make most of our money in the upper upscale and luxury segments. But India also promises great select-service potential. Four Points by Sheraton benefits from the Sheraton halo and Aloft is a real game changer. The Aloft brand is sleek, modern and youthful and resonates with India’s tech savvy traveler. No surprise then that we already expect to open six Alofts over the coming years, with three in 2010 alone. 
On a prior call, I mentioned the incremental travel that will result from our outsourcing IT efforts to Accenture. Add to that the new demand that results from having a team of 450 people in Bangalore, now employed by a U.S. company. We spent some time with his team and they’re young, ambitious and eager to get ahead. They’ll travel increasingly for business and for leisure. When we walked through the operation center, we saw American computers, American air conditioners and employees wearing American-branded clothes. Our hotel brands resonate with this emerging middle class. To sum it up, our travels through India left us with a raft of living examples of the kind of growth we can expect from the rapidly growing markets around the world.
So now to my third topic for today. Some thoughts on luxury. As we've said many times, Starwood is the largest global operator of luxury hotels, with no fewer than 118 properties among our St. Regis Luxury Collection and W brands. Last year, this meant many challenges and headwinds as we witnessed unparalleled demand contraction from a plummeting world economy, not to mention government rhetoric about the evils of luxury travel. 
Now I wish I had a new hotel for every time I was asked whether luxury was dead. My answer was always the same. When people and business feel better about the world, they won't resist the allure of luxury. Today, the paranoia has subsided and our luxury properties are enjoying the strongest REVPAR gains of any segment. The business traveler is back and leisure travelers are rewarding themselves with vacations to our one-of-a-kind properties. Low levels of REVPAR today and slow supply growth tomorrow are setting the foundation for a multi-year recovery.
So let me share with you a few statistics to highlight the return of business to our luxury properties. 
At the Phoenician Luxury Collection Resort occupancies were up over 30% in the first quarter. With group demand coming back and the need for additional space at this hotel, we restarted the ballroom project a few months ago. We expect it to be completed and fully occupied during the hotel's peak period in the fall. Our W Hotels were our strongest performing brand in the quarter, marking occupancy gains of 28% in the U.S. Gateway cities, such as New York are seeing occupancies at near pre-crisis levels. For now, rate continues to lag, the question is for how long. 
Our St. Regis hotels are also experiencing a healthy rebound of travel and since the start of the year, we've even seen increased activity at our sales center for our Bal Harbour project. In fact, we sold over $20 million in residences year-to-date, with 35% refundable deposits. The global jet-setting crowd is starting to spend again and there are no other projects in South Florida like the St. Regis Bal Harbour. And to remind you, Starwood has the largest pipeline of upper upscale and luxury hotels in the industry. St. Regis will have 24 hotels in the system by January 2011, which doubles its footprint from 2008. And W will more than double its size between 2007 and 2011, going from 25 to over 50 hotels worldwide. I might add, we’re also pleased to see that some deals put on hold are now showing signs of life.
So with this discussion of luxury, I can't resist digressing briefly and commenting on our continued transformation to an asset-light structure. Our 21,000 owned and leased rooms lie mostly in high-barrier-to-entry urban and resort markets and are rated in the four- to five-star categories. Many of these hotels would be difficult, if not impossible, to replicate. Their asset values are therefore significantly higher than their depressed cash flows today would imply. So despite these high implied multiples, we don't feel that this is the right time to embark on a major asset sale program. 
First of all, many real estate investors today may still be hoping to scoop up assets at bargain prices. But with the amount of money piling up on the sidelines, buyers need to realize that the great distress sale of 2010 is unlikely to materialize. Second, EBITDAs are well below historic highs and poised to bounce back as high-end hotels rebound. And third, hotel assets are trading at valuations well below replacement costs.
As a case in point, lodging REITS implied valuations on a per key basis are somewhat less than $250,000 a key. Whereas the cost to borrow funds, buy land and build today would be significantly higher. So as we look at our own portfolio, we feel the right course with most assets is to wait for the market to recover further. And when it does, we expect per key values to be well ahead even with the highest quality REITS. 
I'd like to move on now to my fourth topic for today: A review of the five essentials of the Starwood journey that guide our actions and create shareholder value. I believe that companies prosper when they have a clear strategy that's well understood and that aligns management around measurable goals. By giving the strategy a name, we develop a shorthand way of describing our direction and explaining our goals to associates, partners and investors. And investor said something interesting to me just the other day. He noted that if you’d just woken up after a two-year slumber, you might not think that anything had changed. And in a sense, you'd be correct because at no point during the great lodging depression of 2009 did we stop executing on our five essentials. Some of our growth plans were slowed and our asset sales were put on hold. Other aspects of our strategy were accelerated, such as the focus on reducing costs, but the strategy remained intact. What has changed is the competitive environment and the global market. Strong companies emerged stronger. 
Starwood as the scale to invest in brand building and demand creation. It has the financial flexibility to take advantage of transaction opportunities, as well as the global presence to grow wherever demand grows. The world is also a different place with emerging economies driving global growth. So with this as a backdrop, let me quickly run you through the five essentials starting with winning with talent. 
Our 145,000 associates around the world did a terrific job managing through the crisis of 2009. Lodging is a great industry to work. In particular, when you work for a company that looks to open hundreds of new hotels for the coming years. After creating 12,000 jobs in 2009 at newly opened hotels, we expect to create an additional 12,000 jobs in 2010. 
Our second essential is to execute brilliantly. When you have the right person in the right role with the right training, you can deliver great guest experiences and build brand loyalty. As we've mentioned before, our guest satisfaction scores have never been higher, even with our careful focus on costs. And at the same time, we have made substantial changes in how we drive the top line, such as our revenue management systems and the redeployment of our sales force. 
Our third essential is to build great brands. We believe Starwood has the best portfolio of high-end brands in the industry. And we've kept the hammer down on innovation to keep our brands both distinctive and compelling. And while we may be in the early stages of the Sheraton relaunch, we're already beginning to see solid growth in market share for that brand. 
Our fourth essential is to drive global growth. India highlighted the potential for our company in a country that's just beginning to develop infrastructure, including hotels. We believe that we're uniquely able to deliver on our growth promises, relying on local smart teams that have worked in these markets for decades. Our pipeline of 85,000 rooms remains robust, as the slowdown in new additions in developing markets is being offset by a strong pipeline of new leads in our emerging markets. This pipeline represents potential room growth of almost 30%, with over 80% of those rooms to be built in markets outside of the U.S. 
Our fifth essential is to drive outstanding results for our shareholders. Throughout 2009, we were able to beat our financial targets through aggressive cost containment. As we look forward, we will continue to generate cash as we make a transition to an asset-light operating model. For example, our Vacation Ownership business is now a significant cash generator for the company. And the Bal Harbour project will absorb capital in the near term, but sales are returning and we remain on track to complete the residences and the hotel in early 2012. Overall, we can generate a lot of cash as we work towards a business that is at least 80% fee driven.
So let me wrap up my prepared remarks by saying that the recovery is playing out better than most people expected, including ourselves. While the economic recovery will probably not be a straight line, we're bullish about our growth prospects around the world. India is just one example of how Starwood is well positioned to capitalize on the infrastructure build-out as these economies develop. Luxury travel is alive and well, and has a long runway ahead of it after a deep drop off last year. And finally, Starwood’s leadership continues to execute on the five essentials that will be the key to the company's success. And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Vasant."

Clearly, the recovery we’re seeing has been stronger than we expected when we last talked to you. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the state of business around the globe and provide some more color on our Q2 and full year outlook. 
We’ll start with Asia, which as you saw was our strongest region in Q1. All REVPAR numbers I give you are in constant dollars for company-operated hotels. When we talked in February, Asia was already off to a strong start, up 11% in January. This momentum accelerated as REVPAR grew 16% in the quarter and is up 20% in April. We have strong growth across the region, driven by robust economic recoveries. Growth was especially strong in China, up 27% in Q1. The only exceptions were Japan, the economic conditions remain sluggish and more recently, Thailand, which has seen significant political uncertainty.
The return of corporate travel is of course the primary driver. In Asia as elsewhere, there was significant unanticipated late-breaking corporate business, both transient and group.  Occupancies in the quarter were up 10 points, rate was down 3%. The rate trend through the quarter improved, down 10% in January, flattish in March and now up 2% in April. Across Asia today, we operate 159 hotels, 52,000 rooms. We expect to open 30 to 35 hotels this year and have a pipeline of 50,000 rooms, which would double the size of our business over the next three to four years as these hotels open. In 2010, we expect Asia to contribute over 20% of our fees. With the largest share of our pipeline and robust REVPAR growth at existing hotels, Asia will be a major engine of our growth well into the future.
Moving on to North America, our largest region. This is the biggest upside surprise in the quarter. Company-operated REVPAR was down 3% in January, flat in February. We then saw a sharp uptick in March, up 9%, which has continued into April. As you have heard from others, the measure driver is late-breaking corporate business, both transient and group. The recovery is broad-based across sectors and across geographies. Leading indicator markets like New York, Boston and San Francisco were up in the high-single digits. Occupancy at New York hotels reached 75% in Q1, rate was down 7%. Across the U.S., the rate picture improved through the quarter from down 10% in January to down 3% in March. In April, we are seeing the first positive ADR change in North America since this downturn began.
In Q1, transient nights were up 14%, group nights were up 5%. 
Group business booked for the rest of 2010 was up substantially compared to almost no activity last year. LEEDS are up 14%, group pace for the balance of the year is rapidly approaching flat to 2009, and this business should be less susceptible to cancellations than 2009 was. Clearly, easy comparisons are helping and will help through Q2. Then the comparisons get tougher as we lap a recovery in occupancies in the second half of 2009. For this growth to be sustained, great increases are critical. So far, so good. 
In Continental Europe, a recovery is also underway. Although we did not see the sharp uptick we saw in March in the U.S., the first quarter in our European markets is a low season, and it is hard to read much into it. It is fair to say that Europe did not outperform as much as the U.S. did. In March, European REVPAR was up 5%. Business conditions are clearly recovering in major, northern and central European markets: the UK, France, Germany, Austria and the Benelux. As may be expected, things are more challenging in southern Europe. Italy is holding up okay so far. Once again, it is late-breaking corporate business that is the main driver. As travel is normalizing, we do not expect the volcanic ash disruptions to materially impact our European business in the second quarter. 
We have a great footprint in Africa and the Middle East, with 86 hotels and 22,000 rooms currently operating. We expect this region to be a major source of long-term growth like Asia. Our brands, Le Méridien and Sheraton, have been long-established and are very well-regarded. This year, we will derive 13% of our fees from this region. In the first quarter, we did not see growth here primarily due to difficult conditions in the UAE where REVPAR declined 11%. Egypt and North Africa, on the other hand, grew 11% and sub-Saharan Africa was flat. With its many national resource-veiled economies and stabilizing politics, we're very bullish about our future in this region. 
Finally in Latin America, Q1 REVPAR was down 3.6%. South America was very strong, up 10%, with Brazil up 36%, but Mexico where we have a large presence, was down 23%. Business travel to Mexico is slowly recovering in line with improving conditions in the U.S., but leisure travel to resorts on both coasts remains sluggish due to concerns about crime and perhaps cheaper rates available at comparable U.S. resorts. In Q2, Mexico will lap the huge H1N1 decline in 2009 so growth rates will turn positive. So far in April, Mexico is up 7%. Our five hotels in Chile have been impacted by the earthquake. Business is down significantly and the recovery will be slow. 
In our Vacation Ownership business, conditions continue to stabilize. Price reductions helped both close rates and price realization in several markets. We are again on track in this business to generate more cash this year, more than enough to fund Bal Harbour. As Frits indicated, we have seen a meaningful uptick in contract signings, with high deposits and good prices for condos at Bal Harbour. We remain optimistic about this project and are on track to complete construction by late 2011, early 2012. 
In summary, a global recovery is underway. It is most robust in Asia and has been sharper than expected in the U.S. over the past eight weeks. A few parts of the globe are not participating yet, Japan, Thailand, the UAE, Mexico and parts of Southern Europe. Clearly, the pace of recovery is stronger than we expected when we last talked. So what does all this mean for Q2 and the balance of the year? With April ending, it is clear that the trends are just described are continuing into the second quarter. We're also lapping the deepest declines from last year. As such, we're comfortable projecting global REVPAR growth at company-operated hotels in the double digits, up 9% to 11% in constant dollars. Exchange rates in Q2 remained a tailwind, adding 200 basis points to REVPAR as reported in dollars. At our global-owned hotels, we expect a similar REVPAR trend and forex in this case will add another 300 basis points. This gives us an EBITDA range in Q2 of $200 million to $210 million. We expect to have our first quarter of positive margin improvement since this downturn started. With owned-hotel margins, up 150 to 250 basis points in Q2. Even as the recovery takes off as Frits indicated, we remain very focused on cost control and productivity enhancements. Expected margin improvement in Q2 reflects the fact that REVPAR growth is driven primarily by occupancy, which does not flow through at the same level as ADR increases. Also 300 basis points of forex-driven top line growth does not drive margin gains, as you know.  
We should point out some other items that impact year-over-year comparisons in Q2. Net asset sales through 2009, Bliss, the W San Francisco, the Fifth Avenue shops and now the Court Tuscany. These assets contributed approximately $5 million in EBITDA in Q2 last year. Also, in the fees and Other income line last year, we recognized Other income of $7 million from a non-refundable deposit, which is non-recurring.
While we feel good about projecting the current trend into Q2, giving you a definitive view of the back half is quite another matter. The engine of the recovery so far has been late-breaking corporate business, which is hard to see four to six months out. Even for Group business, the booking window is unusually short right now. REVPAR comparisons get tougher in the back half, and exchange rates go from being a tailwind to neutral and potentially even a modest headwind. Frits also enumerated all the other risks out there. As you know, we are heavily correlated to corporate profit growth and business confidence. Anything that dents business confidence, be it a sovereign debt crisis, a double-dip recession, geopolitical issues like Iran, a spike in interest rates or other currently unexpected events, could derail this recovery. The outlook range we are providing assumes none of the above will happen, and the recovery will continue apace through the year. As such, we are raising our full year REVPAR outlook to a range of 5% to 8% from 0% to 5% in constant dollars at company-operated hotels. 
For owned hotels worldwide were going from a range of minus 2% to plus 2%, to 4% to 7%. Exchange rates will add another 100 basis points to REVPAR as reported in dollars. The midpoint of this new range is a full year company EBITDA of $810 million dollars, up from $750 million. The recovery is still nascent and visibility remains challenging. We've just come through the worst financial crisis in recent memory and all the damage from the crisis has not been repaired yet. We continue to look at the future in terms of scenarios. The outlook we have provided is our best guess based on what we know today. We will, of course, know more about the back half when we talk again in July.
Finally, a quick word on our balance sheet. We completed the last component of our liquidity and leverage enhancement program by extending our bank revolver through November 2013. This puts its expiry after our next two bond maturities in 2012 and 2013. Our liquidity position has never been stronger. We have a great bank group. Our leverage is well below covenant levels and our bond maturity profile is very manageable. Q1 is our highest cash use quarter so debt levels are up a bit. We still expect to close the year with debt down $100 million to $200 million from where we ended 2009. We close on the sale of the two Ws in New York. As planned, they will no longer operate it as Ws. At this point, further asset sales will depend on values realizable. While we remain committed to an asset-light strategy, we're only sellers today at values that reflect normalized EBITDAs or replacement costs. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to sell vacation ownership receivables on favorable terms. And we still expect to receive a much delayed $200 million plus tax refund later this year. With that, I'll turn this back to Jay."

And in fact, over the course of this quarter and the rest of this fiscal year, we'll be and are in the process of launching our largest promotion campaign in the history of Starwood around re-discover Sheraton.

I mean clearly, as you heard from our comments, and you heard from others, late-breaking business is the driver of growth so far. And so, our view was you really can't see a whole lot into Q3 and Q4 as a result of that. That's number one. And so our bias was towards not getting ahead of ourselves here. Second, comparisons, while it was still negative last year, comparisons do get tougher. So for example, in local currency terms, worldwide last year, approximately we were down 24% in Q2, down 18% in Q3, and down 9% in Q4. So there was a quarter-over-quarter 600 basis point improvement between Q2 and Q3, and then 900 basis points between Q3 and Q4. And that was as much as 10 whole points in the owned-hotel set worldwide, each quarter improvement in Q3 and Q4. So as you can see, while we're still lapping some weak numbers from last year. For the year-over-year comparisons, you'd have to see absolute increases to maintain current levels of REVPAR growth. And then finally, I mean if you look at prior recoveries, you often have this big bounce back. If you looked at, for example, March 2004 Smith Travel numbers for luxury and upper upscale, March is up 14%, April was up 11%, May was up 10%. This was in 2004. So you sort of had a double-digit second quarter and then it settled in at about 6% to 8% in the back half. We're not saying that's precisely what's going to happen. But it’ll give you a sent that, that’s sort of how these recoveries play out. So when you put it all together, no, we're not expecting big rate increases in the second half. Although as we said earlier, we did see rates turn positive in April. I think we've sort of given you our, we call it, our most-educated guess at this point."

What I can tell you is that as we looked at the renovations and the improvements by property, when we sat down with the owners and felt like we couldn't get to the brand standard from where we were on a particular property and to make a good return from our owners, that's when we would agree to part ways and take the Sheraton flag off the properties. So the best way to think about this is each of the improvements met a threshold return for our owners. And that was obviously prospective not retrospective. What happened in the middle of this obviously is this tremendous downturn, and it's hard to recalibrate. What we're very encouraged by though and what we were mentioning is great topline growth, a real strong improvement in GSI scores, and some meaningful share gains, which we think are all very encouraging for getting the return on investment for both ourselves, as well as the owners who invested."

And by that we mean markets in South America, Africa, parts of the Middle East, sub-continent and East Asia. And we’re still extraordinarily bullish on the long-term opportunity throughout those different markets. Clearly, the charge is being led by China today with over 50 hotels and another 80 being built. But we expect a market like India to look, from a growth perspective and from our own opportunities, like China in the coming years. And so, the point I was trying to emphasize is first of all, unlike the cyclical nature that we've come to see our industry, as we look at Western Europe and North America, what we see now is a real generational secular trend and change over an extended period of time. The comparison I made with Western Europe post-Second World War is just to give that sense that this isn't a five to seven year business cycle. This is a 25-year growth cycle and in many respects, we're still in the early phases of that. So, no, we remain extremely positive on the growth opportunity. That said, the other thing that I think is inevitable as economies grow rapidly is there will be fits and starts. There will be moments of oversupply. There will be periods of overheating in some markets. But over time, the trend line is so strong, and because we work with very sophisticated partners in each of those local markets, we're going to continue to make investments in our own organization and in our brands and in our ability to deliver growth for our business."

This is a question in timing and execution of the strategy. So when we announced our asset-light approach as we talked about the journey two, two and a half years ago, we certainly didn't anticipate the extraordinary downturn that we've all lived through in the last year and a half or so. And during that downturn, transaction volume in the hotel sector was up 80% or 90%, which candidly is what you'd expect. I mean I think buyers were saying: I'm only going to pick something up if it’s at a distressed price because this is likely to be an all- equity deal for me. And sellers were saying: If there’s any way I can hang on, there's going to be a better time to sell. So the bid-ask spread, if you will, was really quite wide. As we look at the market today, I think that bid-ask spread is narrowing. There are certainly transactions starting to happen. And opportunistically with things like the W Court in Tuscany, we’ve stepped into that. We expect it may take a while yet for fundamentals of properties to improve and the availability of financing on the buying side to improve further, to get values that look a lot more like they did before the downturn than they did during the downturn."

I'm going to argue paradoxically that the financial trials and tribulations around some of our W Hotels and their owners ultimately reflect the health and strength of the brand. Because if you bought a hotel for twice what it's worth today and borrowed 70% to 80% loan-to-value to do that, I think it's pretty easy to see how you’d be in a difficult situation. What's been interesting, as owners and as the financial community and as the Chapter 11 process has worked through each of these properties, at no point have we felt like there was any danger of losing the flag on a property to do that, which means anybody looking forward to gaining control of the property or anybody looking at ways of keeping control, has felt that W brand has considerable value to the real estate, which is absolutely the business we're in. In the case of the W Court in Tuscany, again, I think this is a picture of health because those were two of the very first W hotels. They're wonderful charming properties, but did not keep up with the growth and the performance of W as it went from a New York phenomenon, to a U.S. one, to a global one. And to come back to the birthplace of W and have properties like the W downtown opening and the W Hoboken there as a replacement, I think is a great example of brand health and the positive effect of what economists call creative destructions. Now would life be easier for us and our owners if the financial markets and everything and the world performance of the lodging industry had been better? Absolutely. But I think all of this reflects on, as I said, the strength of the W brand rather than anything else."

As you may recall, rather than make predictions, we were looking at a range of scenarios for 2010. Of the many scenarios we considered, what we see today is without a doubt the good-case scenario. The pent-up demand that we hoped for is materializing. And as the economy picks up steam, more businesses are shifting their focus from cost cutting to growing the top line, which means resetting travel and expense budgets and shifting gears to get back on the road after 18 months of dormancy. This holds true as we look around the world. Emerging markets, or as we increasingly call them, rapidly growing markets are exhibiting a strong V-shaped recovery. And at the same time, the U.S. and Western Europe are proving robust. But let me repeat, we are not in the business of forecasting the global economy. Visibility in our business remains very limited making it challenging to forecast one quarter out, let alone the balance of the year. We call it as we see it in real time and we plan for an array of scenarios. This approach served us well in navigating through 2009. 
So despite all the good news and the better than expected REVPAR, we still see reasons to consider less sanguine scenarios. To borrow a phrase from Warren Buffett, we should be fearful when others are greedy. We want to avoid the mistake of taking actions born out newfound optimism. After all, the global economy remains volatile. China risks overheating. Greece and the eurozone are grappling with major fiscal and philosophical issues, not to mention the mountain of U.S. government debt. Finally, volcanoes in Iceland, red shirts in Thailand and unrest in Mexico remind us that our industry is susceptible to sudden changes from many unforeseen corners.
In an uncertain world, we remain committed to financial discipline of flexibility. This means austerity in procurement, on-property costs and corporate SG&A. We simply refuse to give back the cost savings that we worked so hard to achieve. If good times continue, this will drive better flow-throughs than in prior cycles. In fact, thanks to lower costs at equivalent REVPAR levels, our EBITDA would be at least $100 million higher than before 2009. 
Our financial discipline also applies to our balance sheet. We'll continue to de-risk and delever it, thanks to operating cash flow, securitizations, proceeds from asset sales, such as the W Court in Tuscany and the long-awaited IRS tax refund.
So with that as a backdrop, I'll cover four topics today: First, a quick review of our first quarter results and implications for the balance of the year; second, some thoughts from a recent 10-day trip to India; third, a few perspectives on the bounce back of luxury travel; and fourth, a review of the five essentials of the journey, the touchstone of Starwood’s direction.
So let me start with some highlights from the first quarter and a range of expectations for the balance of the year.
We were able to beat EBITDA expectations by roughly $30 million and EPS by $0.13, owing to strong REVPAR growth. REVPAR was powered by better-than-expected occupancy, thanks to strong transient demand and encouragingly, in the quarter for the quarter group bookings. By the way, this was consistent with our good-case scenario, which anticipated that as business environment improved, companies would scramble to set up pending meetings and events. Our good-case scenario also envisioned Luxury leading the charge, and this is exactly what happened. Luxury occupancy was up by almost 20% in the quarter.
Rate for the quarter was still negative in most geographies and brands, as is typical of the early stages of recoveries. Importantly, though, ADRs did improve month-by-month through the quarter and are nearing positive territory in many markets. Coupled with our continued focus on costs, these solid top-line results drove good flow-throughs and margins, even despite the challenging mix of rising occupancy and falling rates. The favorable trends that we've experienced in Q1 continued into April and bode well for the balance of the year. 
Leisure and transient demand remained firm, more than offsetting group business that was canceled or not booked in 2009. Importantly, the strongest results came from our urban markets such as New York, London and Paris and in the foreign five-star categories, all Starwood sweet spots. Corporate transient revenue in London and Paris was up 43% in the quarter. 
Group production was improving quickly off a low base. Remember that last year, we had a little new bookings and a high cancellation activity. Our gross production, i.e. new bookings, is up 30% for 2010, and importantly, cancellations, block adjustments and washed [ph] arrival are down from record levels last year, and in fact, are now trending below normal levels. This translate into net production, which is projected net revenue for the year and in the year, being up triple digits.
LEED volumes were also up double digits, particularly for smaller near-term bookings. And the recovery is broad-based with particular strength in pharma, technology and financial services. In aggregate, 2010 group pace for the total amount of booked business is approaching flat, after bottoming out in the fall of last year at minus 23%. So lodging demand continues to improve from the low level set in 2009. Based on everything we see today and barring disruptions, we could expect positive REVPAR for the full year from each of our regions. Our newly revised mid-range scenario shows worldwide company-operated REVPAR to be between plus 5% and 8% in 2010 and REVPAR at our worldwide owned hotels to be plus 4% to 7%. Vasant will share greater detail on recent trends by region and a revised baseline scenario for 2010. 
So with that as a backdrop, let me move on to my second topic and highlight some themes from our recent trip to India. Our 10-day whistle-stop tour included visits to 18 of our 41 hotels, 21 existing and 15 being built. In Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Jaipur, and Delhi, we saw firsthand examples of what we've been saying for a while. Put simply, the transformation taking place there and in other rapidly-growing markets around the world, implies a huge secular growth in demand for our high-end brands. To look for analogies to these long-term trends, think back to the rebuilding of Europe after the Second World War, only faster and with 10x the population. In this environment, Starwood enjoys strong position with some of the best-known brands, long-standing relationships with the development community and as we like to call them, local smart teams that are either native or spent their careers working in these markets. The key takeaway is that this crisis may have slowed, but it certainly did not derail the unstoppable forces of globalization and the emerging middle class. 
So let's talk about the opportunity in India. And while India and China are vastly different in so many ways, lodging supply looks and feels like China five to 10 years ago. In hindsight, many corporations began investing in China in the 1970s and 80s in anticipation of growth, but only those companies who, like Starwood, stayed the course, hired local talent and forged relationships with local partners, saw their investments pay dividends in recent years. To say that India today is under-hotel-ed relative to future demand is a massive understatement. New York City alone has almost as many hotel rooms as the entire country. And today, we enjoy a larger and better footprint than our competitors. So we can grow our existing brands while introducing new brands, such as Four Points by Sheraton, Westin, and Aloft. And the travel market is still in its infancy. With roughly the same population as China, India generates just 1/4 the outbound travel. And even with the government’s incredible India campaign to promote tourism, India has only 5 million visitors versus 50 million for China. 
So today, the dearth of infrastructure and choking transportation has created enormous pressure to develop new cities outside of old ones. As countries develop, people leave villages and head for opportunities in the city. A development named new Mindspace in Hyderabad highlights this pattern of organization. One developer we worked with, worked with the government to acquire land outside the city and built 7.5 million square feet of commercial space including retail, offices, and of course, two new hotel sites, one of which already boasts a brand new Westin. This phenomenon is playing out in Navi Mumbai, outside of Mumbai, and in Gurgaon outside of Delhi and in Whitefield, outside of Bangalore.
It wouldn't surprise anyone that Sheraton was the first Western brand to open in India in 1973, with Le Méridien soon after. Decades before many of our competitors had entered the market. Both Sheraton and Le Méridien are established brands and the backbone of our brand of portfolio. We see a great opportunity to work with our key partners to build new hotels under both France. Our global development mantra of the right places, the right properties and the right partners holds true in India as anywhere. And our local smart teams understand the market and how to get things done. This is an asset that simply can't be found ion the balance sheet. 
Westin is a rising giant in India. We recently opened three new Westins in the country, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune and expect another to open later on in the coming months in Gurgaon. Developers in India understand and appreciate Starwood’s penchant for innovation and Westin’s focus on wellness, contemporary design, not to mention the Heavenly Bed our clear differentiators. The growth in the Westin is made possible by the credibility in relationships built by Sheraton and Le Méridien over several decades.
Today, we make most of our money in the upper upscale and luxury segments. But India also promises great select-service potential. Four Points by Sheraton benefits from the Sheraton halo and Aloft is a real game changer. The Aloft brand is sleek, modern and youthful and resonates with India’s tech savvy traveler. No surprise then that we already expect to open six Alofts over the coming years, with three in 2010 alone. 
On a prior call, I mentioned the incremental travel that will result from our outsourcing IT efforts to Accenture. Add to that the new demand that results from having a team of 450 people in Bangalore, now employed by a U.S. company. We spent some time with his team and they’re young, ambitious and eager to get ahead. They’ll travel increasingly for business and for leisure. When we walked through the operation center, we saw American computers, American air conditioners and employees wearing American-branded clothes. Our hotel brands resonate with this emerging middle class. To sum it up, our travels through India left us with a raft of living examples of the kind of growth we can expect from the rapidly growing markets around the world.
So now to my third topic for today. Some thoughts on luxury. As we've said many times, Starwood is the largest global operator of luxury hotels, with no fewer than 118 properties among our St. Regis Luxury Collection and W brands. Last year, this meant many challenges and headwinds as we witnessed unparalleled demand contraction from a plummeting world economy, not to mention government rhetoric about the evils of luxury travel. 
Now I wish I had a new hotel for every time I was asked whether luxury was dead. My answer was always the same. When people and business feel better about the world, they won't resist the allure of luxury. Today, the paranoia has subsided and our luxury properties are enjoying the strongest REVPAR gains of any segment. The business traveler is back and leisure travelers are rewarding themselves with vacations to our one-of-a-kind properties. Low levels of REVPAR today and slow supply growth tomorrow are setting the foundation for a multi-year recovery.
So let me share with you a few statistics to highlight the return of business to our luxury properties. 
At the Phoenician Luxury Collection Resort occupancies were up over 30% in the first quarter. With group demand coming back and the need for additional space at this hotel, we restarted the ballroom project a few months ago. We expect it to be completed and fully occupied during the hotel's peak period in the fall. Our W Hotels were our strongest performing brand in the quarter, marking occupancy gains of 28% in the U.S. Gateway cities, such as New York are seeing occupancies at near pre-crisis levels. For now, rate continues to lag, the question is for how long. 
Our St. Regis hotels are also experiencing a healthy rebound of travel and since the start of the year, we've even seen increased activity at our sales center for our Bal Harbour project. In fact, we sold over $20 million in residences year-to-date, with 35% refundable deposits. The global jet-setting crowd is starting to spend again and there are no other projects in South Florida like the St. Regis Bal Harbour. And to remind you, Starwood has the largest pipeline of upper upscale and luxury hotels in the industry. St. Regis will have 24 hotels in the system by January 2011, which doubles its footprint from 2008. And W will more than double its size between 2007 and 2011, going from 25 to over 50 hotels worldwide. I might add, we’re also pleased to see that some deals put on hold are now showing signs of life.
So with this discussion of luxury, I can't resist digressing briefly and commenting on our continued transformation to an asset-light structure. Our 21,000 owned and leased rooms lie mostly in high-barrier-to-entry urban and resort markets and are rated in the four- to five-star categories. Many of these hotels would be difficult, if not impossible, to replicate. Their asset values are therefore significantly higher than their depressed cash flows today would imply. So despite these high implied multiples, we don't feel that this is the right time to embark on a major asset sale program. 
First of all, many real estate investors today may still be hoping to scoop up assets at bargain prices. But with the amount of money piling up on the sidelines, buyers need to realize that the great distress sale of 2010 is unlikely to materialize. Second, EBITDAs are well below historic highs and poised to bounce back as high-end hotels rebound. And third, hotel assets are trading at valuations well below replacement costs.
As a case in point, lodging REITS implied valuations on a per key basis are somewhat less than $250,000 a key. Whereas the cost to borrow funds, buy land and build today would be significantly higher. So as we look at our own portfolio, we feel the right course with most assets is to wait for the market to recover further. And when it does, we expect per key values to be well ahead even with the highest quality REITS. 
I'd like to move on now to my fourth topic for today: A review of the five essentials of the Starwood journey that guide our actions and create shareholder value. I believe that companies prosper when they have a clear strategy that's well understood and that aligns management around measurable goals. By giving the strategy a name, we develop a shorthand way of describing our direction and explaining our goals to associates, partners and investors. And investor said something interesting to me just the other day. He noted that if you’d just woken up after a two-year slumber, you might not think that anything had changed. And in a sense, you'd be correct because at no point during the great lodging depression of 2009 did we stop executing on our five essentials. Some of our growth plans were slowed and our asset sales were put on hold. Other aspects of our strategy were accelerated, such as the focus on reducing costs, but the strategy remained intact. What has changed is the competitive environment and the global market. Strong companies emerged stronger. 
Starwood as the scale to invest in brand building and demand creation. It has the financial flexibility to take advantage of transaction opportunities, as well as the global presence to grow wherever demand grows. The world is also a different place with emerging economies driving global growth. So with this as a backdrop, let me quickly run you through the five essentials starting with winning with talent. 
Our 145,000 associates around the world did a terrific job managing through the crisis of 2009. Lodging is a great industry to work. In particular, when you work for a company that looks to open hundreds of new hotels for the coming years. After creating 12,000 jobs in 2009 at newly-opened hotels, we expect to create an additional 12,000 jobs in 2010. 
Our second essential is to execute brilliantly. When you have the right person in the right role with the right training, you can deliver great guest experiences and build brand loyalty. As we've mentioned before, our guest satisfaction scores have never been higher, even with our careful focus on costs. And at the same time, we have made substantial changes in how we drive the top line, such as our revenue management systems and the redeployment of our sales force. 
Our third essential is to build great brands. We believe Starwood has the best portfolio of high-end brands in the industry. And we've kept the hammer down on innovation to keep our brands both distinctive and compelling. And while we may be in the early stages of the Sheraton re-launch, we're already beginning to see solid growth in market share for that brand. 
Our fourth essential is to drive global growth. India highlighted the potential for our company in a country that's just beginning to develop infrastructure, including hotels. We believe that we're uniquely able to deliver on our growth promises, relying on local smart teams that have worked in these markets for decades. Our pipeline of 85,000 rooms remains robust, as the slowdown in new additions in developing markets is being offset by a strong pipeline of new leads in our emerging markets. This pipeline represents potential room growth of almost 30%, with over 80% of those rooms to be built in markets outside of the U.S. 
Our fifth essential is to drive outstanding results for our shareholders. Throughout 2009, we were able to beat our financial targets through aggressive cost containment. As we look forward, we will continue to generate cash as we make a transition to an asset-light operating model. For example, our Vacation Ownership business is now a significant cash generator for the company. And the Bal Harbour project will absorb capital in the near term, but sales are returning and we remain on track to complete the residences and the hotel in early 2012. Overall, we can generate a lot of cash as we work towards a business that is at least 80% fee driven.
So let me wrap up my prepared remarks by saying that the recovery is playing out better than most people expected, including ourselves. While the economic recovery will probably not be a straight line, we're bullish about our growth prospects around the world. India is just one example of how Starwood is well positioned to capitalize on the infrastructure build-out as these economies develop. Luxury travel is alive and well, and has a long runway ahead of it after a deep drop-off last year. And finally, Starwood’s leadership continues to execute on the five essentials that will be the key to the company's success. And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Vasant."

Clearly, the recovery we’re seeing has been stronger than we expected when we last talked to you. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the state of business around the globe and provide some more color on",1824,"Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. Clearly, the recovery we’re seeing has been stronger than we expected when we last talked to you. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the state of business around the globe and provide some more color on our Q2 and full year outlook. 
We’ll start with Asia, which as you saw was our strongest region in Q1. All REVPAR numbers I give you are in constant dollars for company-operated hotels. When we talked in February, Asia was already off to a strong start, up 11% in January. This momentum accelerated as REVPAR grew 16% in the quarter and is up 20% in April. We have strong growth across the region, driven by robust economic recoveries. Growth was especially strong in China, up 27% in Q1. The only exceptions were Japan, their economic conditions remain sluggish and more recently, Thailand, which has seen significant political uncertainty.
The return of corporate travel is of course the primary driver. In Asia as elsewhere, there was significant unanticipated late-breaking corporate business, both transient and group.  Occupancies in the quarter were up 10 points, rate was down 3%. The rate trend through the quarter improved, down 10% in January, flattish in March and now up 2% in April. Across Asia today, we operate 159 hotels, 52,000 rooms. We expect to open 30 to 35 hotels this year and have a pipeline of 50,000 rooms, which would double the size of our business over the next three to four years as these hotels open. In 2010, we expect Asia to contribute over 20% of our fees. With the largest share of our pipeline and robust REVPAR growth at existing hotels, Asia will be a major engine of our growth well into the future.
Moving on to North America, our largest region. This is the biggest upside surprise in the quarter. Company-operated REVPAR was down 3% in January, flat in February. We then saw a sharp uptick in March, up 9%, which has continued into April. As you have heard from others, the measure driver is late-breaking corporate business, both transient and group. The recovery is broad-based across sectors and across geographies. Leading indicator markets like New York, Boston and San Francisco were up in the high-single digits. Occupancy at New York hotels reached 75% in Q1, rate was down 7%. Across the U.S., the rate picture improved through the quarter from down 10% in January to down 3% in March. In April, we are seeing the first positive ADR change in North America since this downturn began.
In Q1, transient nights were up 14%, group nights were up 5%. 
Group business booked for the rest of 2010 was up substantially compared to almost no activity last year. LEEDS are up 14%, group pace for the balance of the year is rapidly approaching flat to 2009, and this business should be less susceptible to cancellations than 2009 was. Clearly, easy comparisons are helping and will help through Q2. Then the comparisons get tougher as we lap a recovery in occupancies in the second half of 2009. For this growth to be sustained, great increases are critical. So far, so good. 
In Continental Europe, a recovery is also underway. Although we did not see the sharp uptick we saw in March in the U.S., the first quarter in our European markets is a low season, and it is hard to read much into it. It is fair to say that Europe did not outperform as much as the U.S. did. In March, European REVPAR was up 5%. Business conditions are clearly recovering in major, northern and central European markets: the UK, France, Germany, Austria and the Benelux. As may be expected, things are more challenging in southern Europe. Italy is holding up okay so far. Once again, it is late-breaking corporate business that is the main driver. As travel is normalizing, we do not expect the volcanic ash disruptions to materially impact our European business in the second quarter. 
We have a great footprint in Africa and the Middle East, with 86 hotels and 22,000 rooms currently operating. We expect this region to be a major source of long-term growth like Asia. Our brands, Le Méridien and Sheraton, have been long-established and are very well-regarded. This year, we will derive 13% of our fees from this region. In the first quarter, we did not see growth here primarily due to difficult conditions in the UAE where REVPAR declined 11%. Egypt and North Africa, on the other hand, grew 11% and sub-Saharan Africa was flat. With its many national resource-veiled economies and stabilizing politics, we're very bullish about our future in this region. 
Finally in Latin America, Q1 REVPAR was down 3.6%. South America was very strong, up 10%, with Brazil up 36%, but Mexico where we have a large presence, was down 23%. Business travel to Mexico is slowly recovering in line with improving conditions in the U.S., but leisure travel to resorts on both coasts remains sluggish due to concerns about crime and perhaps cheaper rates available at comparable U.S. resorts. In Q2, Mexico will lap the huge H1N1 decline in 2009 so growth rates will turn positive. So far in April, Mexico is up 7%. Our five hotels in Chile have been impacted by the earthquake. Business is down significantly and the recovery will be slow. 
In our Vacation Ownership business, conditions continue to stabilize. Price reductions helped both close rates and price realization in several markets. We are again on track in this business to generate more cash this year, more than enough to fund Bal Harbour. As Frits indicated, we have seen a meaningful uptick in contract signings, with high deposits and good prices for condos at Bal Harbour. We remain optimistic about this project and are on track to complete construction by late 2011, early 2012. 
In summary, a global recovery is underway. It is most robust in Asia and has been sharper than expected in the U.S. over the past eight weeks. A few parts of the globe are not participating yet, Japan, Thailand, the UAE, Mexico and parts of Southern Europe. Clearly, the pace of recovery is stronger than we expected when we last talked. So what does all this mean for Q2 and the balance of the year? With April ending, it is clear that the trends are just described are continuing into the second quarter. We're also lapping the deepest declines from last year. As such, we're comfortable projecting global REVPAR growth at company-operated hotels in the double digits, up 9% to 11% in constant dollars. Exchange rates in Q2 remained a tailwind, adding 200 basis points to REVPAR as reported in dollars. At our global-owned hotels, we expect a similar REVPAR trend and forex in this case will add another 300 basis points. This gives us an EBITDA range in Q2 of $200 million to $210 million. We expect to have our first quarter of positive margin improvement since this downturn started. With owned-hotel margins, up 150 to 250 basis points in Q2. Even as the recovery takes off as Frits indicated, we remain very focused on cost control and productivity enhancements. Expected margin improvement in Q2 reflects the fact that REVPAR growth is driven primarily by occupancy, which does not flow through at the same level as ADR increases. Also 300 basis points of forex-driven top line growth does not drive margin gains, as you know. 
We should point out some other items that impact year-over-year comparisons in Q2. Net asset sales through 2009, Bliss, the W San Francisco, the Fifth Avenue shops and now the Court Tuscany. These assets contributed approximately $5 million in EBITDA in Q2 last year. Also, in the fees and Other income line last year, we recognized Other income of $7 million from a non-refundable deposit, which is non-recurring.
While we feel good about projecting the current trend into Q2, giving you a definitive view of the back half is quite another matter. The engine of the recovery so far has been late-breaking corporate business, which is hard to see four to six months out. Even for Group business, the booking window is unusually short right now. REVPAR comparisons get tougher in the back half, and exchange rates go from being a tailwind to neutral and potentially even a modest headwind. Frits also enumerated all the other risks out there. As you know, we are heavily correlated to corporate profit growth and business confidence. Anything that dents business confidence, be it a sovereign debt crisis, a double-dip recession, geopolitical issues like Iran, a spike in interest rates or other currently unexpected events, could derail this recovery. The outlook range we are providing assumes none of the above will happen, and the recovery will continue apace through the year. As such, we are raising our full year REVPAR outlook to a range of 5% to 8% from 0% to 5% in constant dollars at company-operated hotels. 
For owned hotels worldwide were going from a range of minus 2% to plus 2%, to 4% to 7%. Exchange rates will add another 100 basis points to REVPAR as reported in dollars. The midpoint of this new range is a full year company EBITDA of $810 million dollars, up from $750 million. The recovery is still nascent and visibility remains challenging. We've just come through the worst financial crisis in recent memory and all the damage from the crisis has not been repaired yet. We continue to look at the future in terms of scenarios. The outlook we have provided is our best guess based on what we know today. We will, of course, know more about the back half when we talk again in July.
Finally, a quick word on our balance sheet. We completed the last component of our liquidity and leverage enhancement program by extending our bank revolver through November 2013. This puts its expiry after our next two bond maturities in 2012 and '13. Our liquidity position has never been stronger. We have a great bank group. Our leverage is well below covenant levels and our bond maturity profile is very manageable. Q1 is our highest cash use quarter, so debt levels are up a bit. We still expect to close the year with debt down $100 million to $200 million from where we ended 2009. We close on the sale of the two Ws in New York. As planned, they will no longer operate it as Ws. At this point, further asset sales will depend on values realizable. While we remain committed to an asset-light strategy, we're only sellers today at values that reflect normalized EBITDAs or replacement costs. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to sell vacation ownership receivables on favorable terms. And we still expect to receive a much delayed $200 million plus tax refund later this year. With that, I'll turn this back to Jay."

I mean clearly, as you heard from our comments, and you heard from others, late-breaking business is the driver of growth so far. And so, our view was you really can't see a whole lot into Q3 and Q4 as a result of that. That's number one. And so our bias was towards not getting ahead of ourselves here. Second, comparisons, while it was still negative last year, comparisons do get tougher. So for example, in local currency terms, worldwide last year, approximately we were down 24% in Q2, down 18% in Q3 and down 9% in Q4. So there was a quarter-over-quarter 600-basis-point improvement between Q2 and Q3, and then 900 basis points between Q3 and Q4. And that was as much as 1,000 or 10 whole points in the owned-hotel set worldwide, each quarter improvement in Q3 and Q4. So as you can see, while we're still lapping some weak numbers from last year. For the year-over-year comparisons, you'd have to see absolute increases to maintain current levels of REVPAR growth. And then finally, I mean if you look at prior recoveries, you often have this big bounce back. If you looked at, for example, March 2004 Smith Travel numbers for luxury and upper upscale, March is up 14%, April was up 11%, May was up 10%. This was in 2004. So you sort of had a double-digit second quarter and then it settled in at about 6% to 8% in the back half. We're not saying that's precisely what's going to happen. But it’ll give you a sent that, that’s sort of how these recoveries play out. So when you put it all together, no, we're not expecting big rate increases in the second half. Although as we said earlier, we did see rates turn positive in April. I think we've sort of given you our, we call it, our most-educated guess at this point."

What I can tell you is that as we looked at the renovations and the improvements by property, when we sat down with the owners and felt like we couldn't get to the brand standard from where we were on a particular property and to make a good return from our owners, that's when we would agree to part ways and take the Sheraton flag off the properties. So the best way to think about this is each of the improvements met a threshold return for our owners. And that was obviously prospective not retrospective. What happened in the middle of this obviously is this tremendous downturn, and it's hard to recalibrate. What we're very encouraged by though and what we were mentioning is great top-line growth, a real strong improvement in GSI scores, and some meaningful share gains, which we think are all very encouraging for getting the return on investment for both ourselves, as well as the owners who invested."

And we’re still extraordinarily bullish on the long-term opportunity throughout those different markets.

This is a 25-year growth cycle and in many respects, we're still in the early phases of that. So, no, we remain extremely positive on the growth opportunity. That said, the other thing that I think is inevitable as economies grow rapidly is there will be fits and starts. There will be moments of oversupply. There will be periods of overheating in some markets. But over time, the trend line is so strong, and because we work with very sophisticated partners in each of those local markets, we're going to continue to make investments in our own organization and in our brands and in our ability to deliver growth for our business."

This is a question in timing and execution of the strategy. So when we announced our asset-light approach as we talked about the journey two, two and a half years ago, we certainly didn't anticipate the extraordinary downturn that we've all lived through in the last year and a half or so. And during that downturn, transaction volume in the hotel sector was up 80% or 90%, which candidly is what you'd expect. I mean I think buyers were saying: I'm only going to pick something up if it’s at a distressed price because this is likely to be an all- equity deal for me. And sellers were saying: If there’s any way I can hang on, there's going to be a better time to sell. So the bid-ask spread, if you will, was really quite wide. As we look at the market today, I think that bid-ask spread is narrowing. There are certainly transactions starting to happen. And opportunistically with things like the W Court in Tuscany, we’ve stepped into that. We expect it may take a while yet for fundamentals of properties to improve and the availability of financing on the buying side to improve further, to get values that look a lot more like they did before the downturn than they did during the downturn."

I'm going to argue paradoxically that the financial trials and tribulations around some of our W Hotels and their owners ultimately reflect the health and strength of the brand. Because if you bought a hotel for twice what it's worth today and borrowed 70% to 80% loan-to-value to do that, I think it's pretty easy to see how you’d be in a difficult situation. What's been interesting, as owners and as the financial community and as the Chapter 11 process has worked through each of these properties, at no point have we felt like there was any danger of losing the flag on a property to do that, which means anybody looking forward to gaining control of the property or anybody looking at ways of keeping control, has felt that W brand has considerable value to the real estate, which is absolutely the business we're in. In the case of the W Court in Tuscany, again, I think this is a picture of health because those were two of the very first W hotels. They're wonderful charming properties, but did not keep up with the growth and the performance of W as it went from a New York phenomenon, to a U.S. one, to a global one. And to come back to the birthplace of W and have properties like the W downtown opening and the W Hoboken there as a replacement, I think is a great example of brand health and the positive effect of what economists call creative destructions. Now would life be easier for us and our owners if the financial markets and everything and the world performance of the lodging industry had been better? Absolutely. But I think all of this reflects on, as I said, the strength of the W brand rather than anything else."

As you may recall, rather than make predictions, we were looking at a range of scenarios for 2010. Of the many scenarios we considered, what we see today is without a doubt the good-case scenario. The pent-up demand that we hoped for is materializing. And as the economy picks up steam, more businesses are shifting their focus from cost cutting to growing the top line, which means resetting travel and expense budgets and shifting gears to get back on the road after 18 months of dormancy. This holds true as we look around the world. Emerging markets, or as we increasingly call them, rapidly growing markets are exhibiting a strong V-shaped recovery. And at the same time, the U.S. and Western Europe are proving robust. But let me repeat, we are not in the business of forecasting the global economy. Visibility in our business remains very limited, making it challenging to forecast one quarter out, let alone the balance of the year. We call it as we see it in real time and we plan for an array of scenarios. This approach served us well in navigating through 2009. 
So despite all the good news and the better-than-expected REVPAR, we still see reasons to consider less sanguine scenarios. To borrow a phrase from Warren Buffett, we should be fearful when others are greedy. We want to avoid the mistake of taking actions born out new-found optimism. After all, the global economy remains volatile. China risks overheating. Greece and the eurozone are grappling with major fiscal and philosophical issues, not to mention the mountain of U.S. government debt. Finally, volcanoes in Iceland, Red Shirts in Thailand and unrest in Mexico remind us that our industry is susceptible to sudden changes from many unforeseen corners.
In an uncertain world, we remain committed to financial discipline of flexibility. This means austerity in procurement, on-property costs and corporate SG&A. We simply refuse to give back the cost savings that we worked so hard to achieve. If good times continue, this will drive better flow-throughs than in prior cycles. In fact, thanks to lower costs at equivalent REVPAR levels, our EBITDA would be at least $100 million higher than before 2009. 
Our financial discipline also applies to our balance sheet. We'll continue to de-risk and delever it, thanks to operating cash flow, securitizations, proceeds from asset sales, such as the W Court in Tuscany and the long-awaited IRS tax refund.
So with that as a backdrop, I'll cover four topics today: First, a quick review of our first quarter results and implications for the balance of the year; second, some thoughts from a recent 10-day trip to India; third, a few perspectives on the bounce back of luxury travel; and fourth, a review of the five essentials of the journey, the touchstone of Starwood’s direction.
So let me start with some highlights from the first quarter and a range of expectations for the balance of the year.
We were able to beat EBITDA expectations by roughly $30 million and EPS by $0.13, owing to strong REVPAR growth. REVPAR was powered by better-than-expected occupancy, thanks to strong transient demand and encouragingly, in-the-quarter, for-the-quarter group bookings. By the way, this was consistent with our good-case scenario, which anticipated that as business environment improved, companies would scramble to set up pending meetings and events. Our good-case scenario also envisioned Luxury leading the charge, and this is exactly what happened. Luxury occupancy was up by almost 20% in the quarter.
Rate for the quarter was still negative in most geographies and brands, as is typical of the early stages of recoveries. Importantly, though, ADRs did improve month-by-month through the quarter and are nearing positive territory in many markets. Coupled with our continued focus on costs, these solid top line results drove good flow-throughs and margins, even despite the challenging mix of rising occupancy and falling rates. The favorable trends that we experienced in Q1 continued into April and bode well for the balance of the year. 
Leisure and transient demand remained firm, more than offsetting group business that was canceled or not booked in 2009. Importantly, the strongest results came from our urban markets such as New York, London and Paris and in the four and five star categories, all of Starwood's sweet spots. Corporate transient revenue in London and Paris was up 43% in the quarter. 
Group production was improving quickly off a low base. Remember that last year, we had little new bookings and a high cancellation activity. Our gross production, i.e. new bookings, is up 30% for 2010, and importantly, cancellations, block adjustments and wash at arrival are down from record levels last year, and in fact, are now trending below normal levels. This translate into net production, which is projected net revenue for the year and in the year, being up triple digits.
LEED volumes were also up double digits, particularly for smaller near-term bookings. And the recovery is broad-based with particular strength in pharma, technology and financial services. In aggregate, 2010 group pace for the total amount of booked business is approaching flat, after bottoming out in the fall of last year at minus 23%. So lodging demand continues to improve from the low level set in 2009. Based on everything we see today and barring disruptions, we could expect positive REVPAR for the full year from each of our regions. Our newly revised mid-range scenario shows worldwide company-operated REVPAR to be between plus 5% and 8% in 2010 and REVPAR at our worldwide owned hotels to be plus 4% to 7%. Vasant will share greater detail on recent trends by region and a revised baseline scenario for 2010. 
So with that as a backdrop, let me move on to my second topic and highlight some themes from our recent trip to India. Our 10-day whistle-stop tour included visits to 18 of our 41 hotels, 21 existing and 15 being built. In Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Jaipur and Delhi, we saw firsthand examples of what we've been saying for a while. Put simply, the transformation taking place there and in other rapidly growing markets around the world implies a huge secular growth in demand for our high-end brands. To look for analogies to these long-term trends, think back to the rebuilding of Europe after the Second World War, only faster and with 10x the population. In this environment, Starwood enjoys a strong position with some of the best-known brands, long-standing relationships with the development community and as we like to call them, local smart teams that are either native or have spent their careers working in these markets. The key takeaway is that this crisis may have slowed, but it certainly did not derail the unstoppable forces of globalization and the emerging middle class. 
So let's talk about the opportunity in India. And while India and China are vastly different in so many ways, lodging supply looks and feels like China five to 10 years ago. In hindsight, many corporations began investing in China in the 1970s and 80s in anticipation of growth, but only those companies who, like Starwood, stayed the course, hired local talent and forged relationships with local partners saw their investments pay dividends in recent years. To say that India today is under-hoteled relative to future demand is a massive understatement. New York City alone has almost as many hotel rooms as the entire country. And today, we enjoy a larger and better footprint than our competitors. So we can grow our existing brands while introducing new brands, such as Four Points by Sheraton, Westin, and Aloft. And the travel market is still in its infancy. With roughly the same population as China, India generates just ¼ the outbound travel. And even with the government’s incredible India campaign to promote tourism, India has only 5 million visitors versus 50 million for China. 
So today, the dearth of infrastructure and choking transportation has created enormous pressure to develop new cities outside of old ones. As countries develop, people leave villages and head for opportunities in the city. A development named new Mindspace in Hyderabad highlights this pattern of urbanization. One developer we worked with worked with the government to acquire land outside the city and built 7.5 million square feet of commercial space including retail, offices and of course, two new hotel sites, one of which already boasts a brand new Westin. This phenomenon is playing out in Navi Mumbai, outside of Mumbai; in Gurgaon, outside of Delhi; and in Whitefield, outside of Bangalore.
It wouldn't surprise anyone that Sheraton was the first Western brand to open in India in 1973, with Le Méridien soon after, decades before many of our competitors entered the market. Both Sheraton and Le Méridien are established brands and the backbone of our brand portfolio. We see a great opportunity to work with our key partners to build new hotels under both brands. Our global development mantra of the right places, the right properties and the right partners holds true in India as anywhere. And our local smart teams understand the market and how to get things done. This is an asset that simply can't be found on the balance sheet. 
Westin is a rising giant in India. We recently opened three new Westins in the country: Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune, and expect another to open later on in the coming months in Gurgaon. Developers in India understand and appreciate Starwood’s penchant for innovation and Westin’s focus on wellness, contemporary design, not to mention the Heavenly Bed, are clear differentiators. The growth in Westin is made possible by the credibility and relationships built by Sheraton and Le Méridien over several decades.
Today, we make most of our money in the upper upscale and luxury segments. But India also promises great select-serve potential. Four Points by Sheraton benefits from the Sheraton halo and Aloft is a real game changer. The Aloft brand is sleek, modern and youthful and resonates with India’s upcoming tech-savvy traveler. No surprise then that we already expect to open six Alofts over the coming years, with three in 2010 alone. 
On a prior call, I mentioned the incremental travel that will result from our outsourcing IT efforts to Accenture. Add to that the new demand that results from having a team of 450 people in Bangalore now employed by a U.S. company. We spent some time with his team and they’re young, ambitious and eager to get ahead. They’ll travel increasingly for business and for leisure. When we walked through the operations center, we saw American computers, American air conditioners and employees wearing American-branded clothes. Our hotel brands resonate with this emerging middle class. To sum it up, our travels through India left us with a raft of living examples of the kind of growth we can expect from the rapidly growing markets around the world.
So now to my third topic for today. Some thoughts on luxury. As we've said many times, Starwood is the largest global operator of luxury hotels, with no fewer than 118 properties among our St. Regis Luxury Collection and W brands. Last year, this meant many challenges and headwinds as we witnessed unparalleled demand contraction from a plummeting world economy, not to mention government rhetoric about the evils of luxury travel. 
Now I wish I had a new hotel for every time I was asked whether luxury was dead. My answer was always the same. When people and business feel better about the world, they won't resist the allure of luxury. Today, the paranoia has subsided and our luxury properties are enjoying the strongest REVPAR gains of any segment. The business traveler is back and leisure travelers are rewarding themselves with vacations to our one-of-a-kind properties. Low levels of REVPAR today and slow supply growth tomorrow are setting the foundation for a multi-year recovery.
So let me share with you a few statistics to highlight the return of business to our luxury properties. 
At the Phoenician Luxury Collection Resort, occupancies were up over 30% in the first quarter. With group demand coming back and the need for additional space at this hotel, we restarted the Ballroom project a few months ago. We expect it to be completed and fully occupied during the hotel's peak period in the fall. Our W Hotels were our strongest performing brand in the quarter, marking occupancy gains of 28% in the U.S. Gateway cities, such as New York are seeing occupancies at near pre-crisis levels. For now, rate continues to lag. The question is for how long. 
Our St. Regis hotels are also experiencing a healthy rebound in travel and since the start of the year, we've even seen increased activity at our sales center for our Bal Harbour project. In fact, we sold over $20 million in residences year-to-date, with 35% refundable deposits. The global jet-setting crowd is starting to spend again and there are no other projects in South Florida like the St. Regis Bal Harbour. And to remind you, Starwood has the largest pipeline of upper upscale and luxury hotels in the industry. St. Regis will have 24 hotels in the system by January 2011, which doubles its footprint from 2008. And W will more than double its size between 2007 and 2011, going from 25 to over 50 hotels worldwide. I might add, we’re also pleased to see that some deals put on hold are now showing signs of life.
So with this discussion of luxury, I can't resist digressing briefly and commenting on our continued transformation to an asset-light structure. Our 21,000 owned and leased rooms lie mostly in high-barrier-to-entry urban and resort markets and are rated in the four to five star categories. Many of these hotels would be difficult, if not impossible, to replicate. Their asset values are therefore significantly higher than their depressed cash flows today would imply. So despite these high implied multiples, we don't feel that this is the right time to embark on a major asset sale program. 
First of all, many real estate investors today may still be hoping to scoop up assets at bargain prices. But with the amount of money piling up on the sidelines, buyers need to realize that the great distress sale of 2010 is unlikely to materialize. Second, EBITDAs are well below historic highs and poised to bounce back as high-end hotels rebound. And third, hotel assets are trading at valuations well below replacement costs.
As a case in point, lodging REITs implied valuations on a per key basis are somewhat less than $250,000 a key, whereas the cost to borrow funds, buy land and build today would be significantly higher. So as we look at our own portfolio, we feel the right course with most assets is to wait for the market to recover further. And when it does, we expect per key values to be well ahead of even the highest-quality REITs. 
I'd like to move on now to my fourth topic for today: A review of the five essentials of the Starwood journey that guide our actions and create shareholder value. I believe that companies prosper when they have a clear strategy that's well understood and that aligns management around measurable goals. By giving the strategy a name, we develop a shorthand way of describing our direction and explaining our goals to associates, partners and investors. An investor said something interesting to me just the other day. He noted that if you’d just woken up after a two-year slumber, you might not think that anything had changed. And in a sense, you'd be correct because at no point during the great lodging depression of 2009 did we stop executing on our five essentials. Some of our growth plans were slowed and our asset sales were put on hold. Other aspects of our strategy were accelerated, such as the focus on reducing costs, but the strategy remained intact. What has changed is the competitive environment and the global market. Strong companies emerged stronger. 
Starwood has the scale to invest in brand building and demand creation. It has the financial flexibility to take advantage of transaction opportunities, as well as the global presence to grow wherever demand grows. The world is also a different place with emerging economies driving global growth. So with this as a backdrop, let me quickly run you through the five essentials, starting with winning with talent. 
Our 145,000 associates around the world did a terrific job managing through the crisis of 2009. Lodging is a great industry to work, in particular, when you work for a company that looks to open hundreds of new hotels for the coming years. After creating 12,000 jobs in 2009 at newly opened hotels, we expect to create an additional 12,000 jobs in 2010. 
Our second essential is to execute brilliantly. When you have the right person in the right role with the right training, you can deliver great guest experiences and build brand loyalty. As we've mentioned before, our guest satisfaction scores have never been higher, even with our careful focus on costs. And at the same time, we have made substantial changes in how we drive the top line, such as our revenue management systems and the redeployment of our sales force. 
Our third essential is to build great brands. We believe Starwood has the best portfolio of high-end brands in the industry. And we've kept the hammer down on innovation to keep our brands both distinctive and compelling. And while we may be in the early stages of the Sheraton re-launch, we're already beginning to see solid growth in market share for that brand. 
Our fourth essential is to drive global growth. India highlighted the potential for our company in a country that's just beginning to develop infrastructure, including hotels. We believe that we're uniquely able to deliver on our growth promises, relying on local smart teams that have worked in these markets for decades. Our pipeline of 85,000 rooms remains robust, as the slowdown in unit additions in developing markets is being offset by a strong pipeline of new leads in our emerging markets. This pipeline represents potential room growth of almost 30%, with over 80% of those rooms to be built in markets outside of the U.S. 
Our fifth essential is to drive outstanding results for our shareholders. Throughout 2009, we were able to beat our financial targets through aggressive cost containment. As we look forward, we will continue to generate cash as we make a transition to an asset-light operating model. For example, our Vacation Ownership business is now a significant cash generator for the company. And the Bal Harbour project will absorb capital in the near term, but sales are returning and we remain on track to complete the residences and the hotel in early 2012. Overall, we can generate a lot of cash as we work towards a business that is at least 80% fee driven.
So let me wrap up my prepared remarks by saying that the recovery is playing out better than most people expected, including ourselves. While the economic recovery will probably not be a straight line, we're bullish about our growth prospects around the world. India is just one example of how Starwood is well positioned to capitalize on the infrastructure build-out as these economies develop. Luxury travel is alive and well, and has a long runway ahead of it after a deep drop-off last year. And finally, Starwood’s leadership continues to execute on the five essentials that will be the key to the company's success. And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Vasant."
341584,100101020,61816,"Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. Clearly, the recovery we’re seeing has been stronger than we expected when we last talked to you. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the state of business around the globe and provide some more color on",1820,"Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. Clearly, the recovery we’re seeing has been stronger than we expected when we last talked to you. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the state of business around the globe and provide some more color on our Q2 and full year outlook. 
We’ll start with Asia, which as you saw was our strongest region in Q1. All REVPAR numbers I give you are in constant dollars for company-operated hotels. When we talked in February, Asia was already off to a strong start, up 11% in January. This momentum accelerated as REVPAR grew 16% in the quarter and is up 20% in April. We have strong growth across the region, driven by robust economic recoveries. Growth was especially strong in China, up 27% in Q1. The only exceptions were Japan; their economic conditions remain sluggish, and more recently, Thailand, which has seen significant political uncertainty.
The return of corporate travel is of course the primary driver. In Asia as elsewhere, there was significant unanticipated late-breaking corporate business, both transient and group.  Occupancies in the quarter were up 10 points, rate was down 3%. The rate trend through the quarter improved, down 10% in January, flattish in March and now up 2% in April. Across Asia today, we operate 159 hotels, 52,000 rooms. We expect to open 30 to 35 hotels this year and have a pipeline of 50,000 rooms, which would double the size of our business over the next three to four years as these hotels open. In 2010, we expect Asia to contribute over 20% of our fees. With the largest share of our pipeline and robust REVPAR growth at existing hotels, Asia will be a major engine of our growth well into the future.
Moving on to North America, our largest region. This is the biggest upside surprise in the quarter. Company-operated REVPAR was down 3% in January, flat in February. We then saw a sharp uptick in March, up 9%, which has continued into April. As you have heard from others, the measure driver is late-breaking corporate business, both transient and group. The recovery is broad-based across sectors and across geographies. Leading indicator markets like New York, Boston and San Francisco were up in the high-single digits. Occupancy at New York hotels reached 75% in Q1, rate was down 7%. Across the U.S., the rate picture improved through the quarter from down 10% in January to down 3% in March. In April, we are seeing the first positive ADR change in North America since this downturn began.
In Q1, transient nights were up 14%. Group nights were up 5%. 
Group business booked for the rest of 2010 was up substantially compared to almost no activity last year. LEEDs are up 14%, group pace for the balance of the year is rapidly approaching flat to 2009, and this business should be less susceptible to cancellations than 2009 was. Clearly, easy comparisons are helping and will help through Q2. Then the comparisons get tougher as we lap our recovery in occupancies in the second half of 2009. For this growth to be sustained, great increases are critical. So far, so good. 
In continental Europe, a recovery is also underway. Although we did not see the sharp uptick we saw in March in the U.S., the first quarter in our European markets is a low season, and it is hard to read much into it. It is fair to say that Europe did not outperform as much as the U.S. did. In March, European REVPAR was up 5%. Business conditions are clearly recovering in major northern and central European markets: the UK, France, Germany, Austria and the Benelux. As may be expected, things are more challenging in southern Europe. Italy is holding up okay so far. Once again, it is late-breaking corporate business that is the main driver. As travel is normalizing, we do not expect the volcanic ash disruptions to materially impact our European business in the second quarter. 
We have a great footprint in Africa and the Middle East, with 86 hotels and 22,000 rooms currently operating. We expect this region to be a major source of long-term growth like Asia. Our brands, Le Méridien and Sheraton, have been long-established and are very well-regarded. This year, we will derive 13% of our fees from this region. In the first quarter, we did not see growth here primarily due to difficult conditions in the UAE where REVPAR declined 11%. Egypt and North Africa, on the other hand, grew 11% and sub-Saharan Africa was flat. With its many national resource-veiled economies and stabilizing politics, we're very bullish about our future in this region. 
Finally in Latin America, Q1 REVPAR was down 3.6%. South America was very strong, up 10%, with Brazil up 36%; but Mexico, where we have a large presence, was down 23%. Business travel to Mexico is slowly recovering in line with improving conditions in the U.S., but leisure travel to resorts on both coasts remains sluggish due to concerns about crime and perhaps cheaper rates available at comparable U.S. resorts. In Q2, Mexico will lap the huge H1N1 decline in 2009 so growth rates will turn positive. So far in April, Mexico is up 7%. Our five hotels in Chile have been impacted by the earthquake. Business is down significantly and the recovery will be slow. 
In our Vacation Ownership business, conditions continue to stabilize. Price reductions helped both close rates and price realization in several markets. We remain on track in this business to generate more cash this year, more than enough to fund Bal Harbour. As Frits indicated, we have seen a meaningful uptick in contract signings, with high deposits and good prices for condos at Bal Harbour. We remain optimistic about this project and are on track to complete construction by late 2011, early 2012. 
In summary, a global recovery is underway. It is most robust in Asia and has been sharper than expected in the U.S. over the past eight weeks. A few parts of the globe are not participating yet: Japan, Thailand, the UAE, Mexico and parts of Southern Europe. Clearly, the pace of recovery is stronger than we expected when we last talked. So what does all this mean for Q2 and the balance of the year? With April ending, it is clear that the trends we just described are continuing into the second quarter. We're also lapping the deepest declines from last year. As such, we're comfortable projecting global REVPAR growth at company-operated hotels in the double digits, up 9% to 11% in constant dollars. Exchange rates in Q2 remain a tailwind, adding 200 basis points to REVPAR as reported in dollars. At our global-owned hotels, we expect a similar REVPAR trend and Forex in this case will add another 300 basis points. This gives us an EBITDA range in Q2 of $200 million to $210 million. We expect to have our first quarter of positive margin improvement since this downturn started with owned margins, up 150 to 250 basis points in Q2. Even as a recovery takes off, as Frits indicated, we remain very focused on cost control and productivity enhancements. Expected margin improvement in Q2 reflects the fact that REVPAR growth is driven primarily by occupancy, which does not flow through at the same level as ADR increases. Also 300 basis points of Forex-driven top line growth does not drive margin gains, as you know. 
We should point out some other items that impact year-over-year comparisons in Q2: Net asset sales through 2009, Bliss, the W San Francisco, the Fifth Avenue shops and now The Court, Tuscany. These assets contributed approximately $5 million in EBITDA in Q2 last year. Also, in the fees and other income line last year, we recognized other income of $7 million from a non-refundable deposit, which is non-recurring.
While we feel good about projecting the current trend into Q2, giving you a definitive view of the back half is quite another matter. The engine of the recovery so far has been late-breaking corporate business, which is hard to see four to six months out. Even for group business, the booking window is unusually short right now. REVPAR comparisons get tougher in the back half, and exchange rates go from being a tailwind to neutral and potentially even a modest headwind. Frits also enumerated all the other risks out there. As you know, we are heavily correlated to corporate profit growth and business confidence. Anything that dents business confidence, be it a sovereign debt crisis, a double-dip recession, geopolitical issues like Iran, a spike in interest rates or other currently unexpected events could derail this recovery. The outlook range we are providing assumes none of the above will happen and the recovery will continue apace through the year. As such, we are raising our full year REVPAR outlook to a range of 5% to 8% from 0% to 5% in constant dollars at company-operated hotels. 
For owned hotels worldwide, we're going from a range of minus 2% to plus 2%, to 4% to 7%. Exchange rates will add another 100 basis points to REVPAR as reported in dollars. The midpoint of this new range is a full year company EBITDA of $810 million, up from $750 million. The recovery's still nascent and visibility remains challenging. We've just come through the worst financial crisis in recent memory and all the damage from the crisis has not been repaired yet. We continue to look at the future in terms of scenarios. The outlook we have provided is our best guess based on what we know today. We will, of course, know more about the back half when we talk again in July.
Finally, a quick word on our balance sheet. We completed the last component of our liquidity and leverage enhancement program by extending our bank revolver through November 2013. This puts its expiry after our next two bond maturities in 2012 and '13. Our liquidity position has never been stronger. We have a great bank group. Our leverage is well below covenant levels and our bond maturity profile is very manageable. Q1 is our highest cash use quarter, so debt levels are up a bit. We still expect to close the year with debt down $100 million to $200 million from where we ended 2009. We close on the sale of the two Ws in New York. As planned, they will no longer operate it as Ws. At this point, further asset sales will depend on values realizable. While we remain committed to an asset-light strategy, we're only sellers today at values that reflect normalized EBITDAs or replacement costs. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to sell vacation ownership receivables on favorable terms. And we still expect to receive a much-delayed $200 million plus tax refund later this year. With that, I'll turn this back to Jay."

I mean clearly, as you heard from our comments and you heard from others, late-breaking business is the driver of growth so far. And so our view was you really can't see a whole lot into Q3 and Q4 as a result of that. That's number one. And so our bias was towards not getting ahead of ourselves here. Second, comparisons, while it was still negative last year, comparisons do get tougher. So for example, in local currency terms, worldwide last year, approximately we were down 24% in Q2, down 18% in Q3 and down 9% in Q4. So there was a quarter-over-quarter 600-basis-point improvement between Q2 and Q3, and then 900 basis points between Q3 and Q4. And that was as much as 1,000 or 10 whole points in the owned-hotel set worldwide, each quarter improvement in Q3 and Q4. So as you can see, while we're still lapping some weak numbers from last year, for the year-over-year comparison, you'd have to see absolute increases to maintain current levels of REVPAR growth. And then finally, I mean if you look at prior recoveries, you often have this big bounce back. If you looked at, for example, March 2004 Smith Travel numbers for luxury and upper upscale, March is up 14%, April was up 11%, May was up 10%. This was in 2004. So you sort of had a double-digit second quarter and then it settled in at about 6% to 8% in the back half. We're not saying that's precisely what's going to happen. But it’ll give you a sense that, that’s sort of how these recoveries play out. So when you put it all together, no, we're not expecting big rate increases in the second half. Although as we said earlier, we did see rates turn positive in April. I think we've sort of given you our, we call it, our most-educated guess at this point."

What I can tell you is that as we looked at the renovations and the improvements by property, when we sat down with the owners and felt like we couldn't get to the brand standard from where we were on a particular property and to make a good return from our owners, that's when we would agree to part ways and take the Sheraton flag off the properties. So the best way to think about this is each of the improvements met a threshold return for our owners. And that was obviously prospective, not retrospective. What happened in the middle of this, obviously, is this tremendous downturn, and it's hard to recalibrate. What we're very encouraged by though and what we were mentioning is great top line growth, a real strong improvement in GSI scores, and some meaningful share gains, which we think are all very encouraging for getting the return on investment for both ourselves, as well as the owners who invested."

And by that we mean markets in South America, Africa, parts of the Middle East subcontinent and East Asia. And we’re still extraordinarily bullish on the long-term opportunity throughout those different markets. Clearly, the charge is being led by China today with over 50 hotels and another 80 being built. But we expect a market like India to look, from a growth perspective and from our own opportunities, like China in the coming years. And so, the point I was trying to emphasize is first of all, unlike the cyclical nature that we've come to see our industry, as we look at Western Europe and North America, what we see now is a real generational secular trend and change over an extended period of time. The comparison I made with Western Europe post-Second World War is just to give that sense that this isn't a five- to seven-year business cycle. This is a 25-year growth cycle and in many respects, we're still in the early phases of that. So no, we remain extremely positive on the growth opportunity. That said, the other thing that I think is inevitable as economies grow rapidly is there will be fits and starts. There will be moments of oversupply. There will be periods of overheating in some markets. But over time, the trend line is so strong, and because we work with very sophisticated partners in each of those local markets, we're going to continue to make investments in our own organization and in our brands in our ability to deliver growth for our business."

This is a question in timing and execution of the strategy. So when we announced our asset-light approach as we talked about the journey two, 2½ years ago, we certainly didn't anticipate the extraordinary downturn that we've all lived through in the last year and a half or so. And during that downturn, transaction volume in the hotel sector was off 80% or 90%, which candidly is what you would expect. I mean, I think buyers were saying, “I'm only going to pick something up if it’s at a distressed price because this is likely to be an all-equity deal for me.” And sellers were saying, “If there’s any way I can hang on, there's going to be a better time to sell.” So the bid-ask spread, if you will, was really quite wide. As we look at the market today, I think that bid-ask spread is narrowing. There are certainly transactions starting to happen. And opportunistically with things like the W Court in Tuscany, we’ve stepped into that. We expect it may take a while yet for fundamentals of properties to improve and the availability of financing on the buying side to improve further, to get values that look a lot more like they did before the downturn than they did during the downturn."

Because if you bought a hotel for twice what it's worth today and borrowed 70% to 80% loan-to-value to do that, I think it's pretty easy to see how you’d be in a difficult situation. What's been interesting, as owners and as the financial community and as the Chapter 11 process has worked through each of these properties, at no point have we felt like there was any danger of losing the flag on a property to do that, which means anybody looking forward to gaining control of the property or anybody looking at ways of keeping control has felt that the W brand adds considerable value to the real estate, which is absolutely the business we're in. In the case of the W Court in Tuscany, again, I think this is a picture of health because those were two of the very first W hotels. They're wonderful charming properties, but did not keep up with the growth and the performance of W as it went from a New York phenomenon to a U.S. one to a global one. And to come back to the birthplace of W and have properties like the W – Downtown opening and the W Hoboken there as a replacement, I think is a great example of brand health and the positive effect of what economists call creative destruction. Now would life be easier for us and our owners if the financial markets and everything and the world performance of the lodging industry had been better? Absolutely. But I think all of this reflects on, as I said, the strength of the W brand rather than anything else."

The financing was linked into condo sales, which as you know, is a very depressed market right now.

As you may recall, rather than make predictions, we were looking at a range of scenarios for 2010. Of the many scenarios we considered, what we see today is without a doubt the good-case scenario. The pent-up demand that we hoped for is materializing. And as the economy picks up steam, more businesses are shifting their focus from cost cutting to growing the top line, which means resetting travel and expense budgets and shifting gears to get back on the road after 18 months of dormancy. This holds true as we look around the world. Emerging markets, or as we increasingly call them, rapidly growing markets are exhibiting a strong V-shaped recovery. And at the same time, the U.S. and Western Europe are proving robust. But let me repeat, we are not in the business of forecasting the global economy. Visibility in our business remains very limited making it challenging to forecast one quarter out, let alone the balance of the year. We call it as we see it in real time and we plan for an array of scenarios. This approach served us well in navigating through 2009. 
So despite all the good news and the better than expected REVPAR, we still see reasons to consider less sanguine scenarios. To borrow a phrase from Warren Buffett, we should be fearful when others are greedy. We want to avoid the mistake of taking actions born out newfound optimism. After all, the global economy remains volatile. China risks overheating. Greece and the eurozone are grappling with major fiscal and philosophical issues, not to mention the mountain of U.S. government debt. Finally, volcanoes in Iceland, red shirts in Thailand and unrest in Mexico remind us that our industry is susceptible to sudden changes from many unforeseen corners.
In an uncertain world, we remain committed to financial discipline of flexibility. This means austerity in procurement, on-property costs and corporate SG&A. We simply refuse to give back the cost savings that we worked so hard to achieve. If good times continue, this will drive better flow-throughs than in prior cycles. In fact, thanks to lower costs at equivalent REVPAR levels, our EBITDA would be at least $100 million higher than before 2009. 
Our financial discipline also applies to our balance sheet. We'll continue to de-risk and delever it, thanks to operating cash flow, securitizations, proceeds from asset sales, such as the W Court in Tuscany and the long-awaited IRS tax refund.
So with that as a backdrop, I'll cover four topics today: First, a quick review of our first quarter results and implications for the balance of the year; second, some thoughts from a recent 10-day trip to India; third, a few perspectives on the bounce back of luxury travel; and fourth, a review of the five essentials of the journey, the touchstone of Starwood’s direction.
So let me start with some highlights from the first quarter and a range of expectations for the balance of the year.
We were able to beat EBITDA expectations by roughly $30 million and EPS by $0.13, owing to strong REVPAR growth. REVPAR was powered by better-than-expected occupancy, thanks to strong transient demand and encouragingly, in the quarter for the quarter group bookings. By the way, this was consistent with our good-case scenario, which anticipated that as business environment improved, companies would scramble to set up pending meetings and events. Our good-case scenario also envisioned Luxury leading the charge, and this is exactly what happened. Luxury occupancy was up by almost 20% in the quarter.
Rate for the quarter was still negative in most geographies and brands, as is typical of the early stages of recoveries. Importantly, though, ADRs did improve month-by-month through the quarter and are nearing positive territory in many markets. Coupled with our continued focus on costs, these solid top-line results drove good flow-throughs and margins, even despite the challenging mix of rising occupancy and falling rates. The favorable trends that we've experienced in Q1 continued into April and bode well for the balance of the year. 
Leisure and transient demand remained firm, more than offsetting group business that was canceled or not booked in 2009. Importantly, the strongest results came from our urban markets such as New York, London and Paris and in the foreign five-star categories, all Starwood sweet spots. Corporate transient revenue in London and Paris was up 43% in the quarter. 
Group production was improving quickly off a low base. Remember that last year, we had a little new bookings and a high cancellation activity. Our gross production, i.e. new bookings, is up 30% for 2010, and importantly, cancellations, block adjustments and washed [ph] arrival are down from record levels last year, and in fact, are now trending below normal levels. This translate into net production, which is projected net revenue for the year and in the year, being up triple digits.
LEED volumes were also up double digits, particularly for smaller near-term bookings. And the recovery is broad-based with particular strength in pharma, technology and financial services. In aggregate, 2010 group pace for the total amount of booked business is approaching flat, after bottoming out in the fall of last year at minus 23%. So lodging demand continues to improve from the low level set in 2009. Based on everything we see today and barring disruptions, we could expect positive REVPAR for the full year from each of our regions. Our newly revised mid-range scenario shows worldwide company-operated REVPAR to be between plus 5% and 8% in 2010 and REVPAR at our worldwide owned hotels to be plus 4% to 7%. Vasant will share greater detail on recent trends by region and a revised baseline scenario for 2010. 
So with that as a backdrop, let me move on to my second topic and highlight some themes from our recent trip to India. Our 10-day whistle-stop tour included visits to 18 of our 41 hotels, 21 existing and 15 being built. In Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Jaipur, and Delhi, we saw firsthand examples of what we've been saying for a while. Put simply, the transformation taking place there and in other rapidly-growing markets around the world, implies a huge secular growth in demand for our high-end brands. To look for analogies to these long-term trends, think back to the rebuilding of Europe after the Second World War, only faster and with 10x the population. In this environment, Starwood enjoys strong position with some of the best-known brands, long-standing relationships with the development community and as we like to call them, local smart teams that are either native or spent their careers working in these markets. The key takeaway is that this crisis may have slowed, but it certainly did not derail the unstoppable forces of globalization and the emerging middle class. 
So let's talk about the opportunity in India. And while India and China are vastly different in so many ways, lodging supply looks and feels like China five to 10 years ago. In hindsight, many corporations began investing in China in the 1970s and 80s in anticipation of growth, but only those companies who, like Starwood, stayed the course, hired local talent and forged relationships with local partners, saw their investments pay dividends in recent years. To say that India today is under-hotel-ed relative to future demand is a massive understatement. New York City alone has almost as many hotel rooms as the entire country. And today, we enjoy a larger and better footprint than our competitors. So we can grow our existing brands while introducing new brands, such as Four Points by Sheraton, Westin, and Aloft. And the travel market is still in its infancy. With roughly the same population as China, India generates just 1/4 the outbound travel. And even with the government’s incredible India campaign to promote tourism, India has only 5 million visitors versus 50 million for China. 
So today, the dearth of infrastructure and choking transportation has created enormous pressure to develop new cities outside of old ones. As countries develop, people leave villages and head for opportunities in the city. A development named new Mindspace in Hyderabad highlights this pattern of organization. One developer we worked with, worked with the government to acquire land outside the city and built 7.5 million square feet of commercial space including retail, offices, and of course, two new hotel sites, one of which already boasts a brand new Westin. This phenomenon is playing out in Navi Mumbai, outside of Mumbai, and in Gurgaon outside of Delhi and in Whitefield, outside of Bangalore.
It wouldn't surprise anyone that Sheraton was the first Western brand to open in India in 1973, with Le Méridien soon after. Decades before many of our competitors had entered the market. Both Sheraton and Le Méridien are established brands and the backbone of our brand of portfolio. We see a great opportunity to work with our key partners to build new hotels under both France. Our global development mantra of the right places, the right properties and the right partners holds true in India as anywhere. And our local smart teams understand the market and how to get things done. This is an asset that simply can't be found ion the balance sheet. 
Westin is a rising giant in India. We recently opened three new Westins in the country, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune and expect another to open later on in the coming months in Gurgaon. Developers in India understand and appreciate Starwood’s penchant for innovation and Westin’s focus on wellness, contemporary design, not to mention the Heavenly Bed our clear differentiators. The growth in the Westin is made possible by the credibility in relationships built by Sheraton and Le Méridien over several decades.
Today, we make most of our money in the upper upscale and luxury segments. But India also promises great select-service potential. Four Points by Sheraton benefits from the Sheraton halo and Aloft is a real game changer. The Aloft brand is sleek, modern and youthful and resonates with India’s tech savvy traveler. No surprise then that we already expect to open six Alofts over the coming years, with three in 2010 alone. 
On a prior call, I mentioned the incremental travel that will result from our outsourcing IT efforts to Accenture. Add to that the new demand that results from having a team of 450 people in Bangalore, now employed by a U.S. company. We spent some time with his team and they’re young, ambitious and eager to get ahead. They’ll travel increasingly for business and for leisure. When we walked through the operation center, we saw American computers, American air conditioners and employees wearing American-branded clothes. Our hotel brands resonate with this emerging middle class. To sum it up, our travels through India left us with a raft of living examples of the kind of growth we can expect from the rapidly growing markets around the world.
So now to my third topic for today. Some thoughts on luxury. As we've said many times, Starwood is the largest global operator of luxury hotels, with no fewer than 118 properties among our St. Regis Luxury Collection and W brands. Last year, this meant many challenges and headwinds as we witnessed unparalleled demand contraction from a plummeting world economy, not to mention government rhetoric about the evils of luxury travel. 
Now I wish I had a new hotel for every time I was asked whether luxury was dead. My answer was always the same. When people and business feel better about the world, they won't resist the allure of luxury. Today, the paranoia has subsided and our luxury properties are enjoying the strongest REVPAR gains of any segment. The business traveler is back and leisure travelers are rewarding themselves with vacations to our one-of-a-kind properties. Low levels of REVPAR today and slow supply growth tomorrow are setting the foundation for a multi-year recovery.
So let me share with you a few statistics to highlight the return of business to our luxury properties. 
At the Phoenician Luxury Collection Resort occupancies were up over 30% in the first quarter. With group demand coming back and the need for additional space at this hotel, we restarted the ballroom project a few months ago. We expect it to be completed and fully occupied during the hotel's peak period in the fall. Our W Hotels were our strongest performing brand in the quarter, marking occupancy gains of 28% in the U.S. Gateway cities, such as New York are seeing occupancies at near pre-crisis levels. For now, rate continues to lag, the question is for how long. 
Our St. Regis hotels are also experiencing a healthy rebound of travel and since the start of the year, we've even seen increased activity at our sales center for our Bal Harbour project. In fact, we sold over $20 million in residences year-to-date, with 35% refundable deposits. The global jet-setting crowd is starting to spend again and there are no other projects in South Florida like the St. Regis Bal Harbour. And to remind you, Starwood has the largest pipeline of upper upscale and luxury hotels in the industry. St. Regis will have 24 hotels in the system by January 2011, which doubles its footprint from 2008. And W will more than double its size between 2007 and 2011, going from 25 to over 50 hotels worldwide. I might add, we’re also pleased to see that some deals put on hold are now showing signs of life.
So with this discussion of luxury, I can't resist digressing briefly and commenting on our continued transformation to an asset-light structure. Our 21,000 owned and leased rooms lie mostly in high-barrier-to-entry urban and resort markets and are rated in the four- to five-star categories. Many of these hotels would be difficult, if not impossible, to replicate. Their asset values are therefore significantly higher than their depressed cash flows today would imply. So despite these high implied multiples, we don't feel that this is the right time to embark on a major asset sale program. 
First of all, many real estate investors today may still be hoping to scoop up assets at bargain prices. But with the amount of money piling up on the sidelines, buyers need to realize that the great distress sale of 2010 is unlikely to materialize. Second, EBITDAs are well below historic highs and poised to bounce back as high-end hotels rebound. And third, hotel assets are trading at valuations well below replacement costs.
As a case in point, lodging REITS implied valuations on a per key basis are somewhat less than $250,000 a key. Whereas the cost to borrow funds, buy land and build today would be significantly higher. So as we look at our own portfolio, we feel the right course with most assets is to wait for the market to recover further. And when it does, we expect per key values to be well ahead even with the highest quality REITS. 
I'd like to move on now to my fourth topic for today: A review of the five essentials of the Starwood journey that guide our actions and create shareholder value. I believe that companies prosper when they have a clear strategy that's well understood and that aligns management around measurable goals. By giving the strategy a name, we develop a shorthand way of describing our direction and explaining our goals to associates, partners and investors. And investor said something interesting to me just the other day. He noted that if you’d just woken up after a two-year slumber, you might not think that anything had changed. And in a sense, you'd be correct because at no point during the great lodging depression of 2009 did we stop executing on our five essentials. Some of our growth plans were slowed and our asset sales were put on hold. Other aspects of our strategy were accelerated, such as the focus on reducing costs, but the strategy remained intact. What has changed is the competitive environment and the global market. Strong companies emerged stronger. 
Starwood as the scale to invest in brand building and demand creation. It has the financial flexibility to take advantage of transaction opportunities, as well as the global presence to grow wherever demand grows. The world is also a different place with emerging economies driving global growth. So with this as a backdrop, let me quickly run you through the five essentials starting with winning with talent. 
Our 145,000 associates around the world did a terrific job managing through the crisis of 2009. Lodging is a great industry to work. In particular, when you work for a company that looks to open hundreds of new hotels for the coming years. After creating 12,000 jobs in 2009 at newly-opened hotels, we expect to create an additional 12,000 jobs in 2010. 
Our second essential is to execute brilliantly. When you have the right person in the right role with the right training, you can deliver great guest experiences and build brand loyalty. As we've mentioned before, our guest satisfaction scores have never been higher, even with our careful focus on costs. And at the same time, we have made substantial changes in how we drive the top line, such as our revenue management systems and the redeployment of our sales force. 
Our third essential is to build great brands. We believe Starwood has the best portfolio of high-end brands in the industry. And we've kept the hammer down on innovation to keep our brands both distinctive and compelling. And while we may be in the early stages of the Sheraton re-launch, we're already beginning to see solid growth in market share for that brand. 
Our fourth essential is to drive global growth. India highlighted the potential for our company in a country that's just beginning to develop infrastructure, including hotels. We believe that we're uniquely able to deliver on our growth promises, relying on local smart teams that have worked in these markets for decades. Our pipeline of 85,000 rooms remains robust, as the slowdown in new additions in developing markets is being offset by a strong pipeline of new leads in our emerging markets. This pipeline represents potential room growth of almost 30%, with over 80% of those rooms to be built in markets outside of the U.S. 
Our fifth essential is to drive outstanding results for our shareholders. Throughout 2009, we were able to beat our financial targets through aggressive cost containment. As we look forward, we will continue to generate cash as we make a transition to an asset-light operating model. For example, our Vacation Ownership business is now a significant cash generator for the company. And the Bal Harbour project will absorb capital in the near term, but sales are returning and we remain on track to complete the residences and the hotel in early 2012. Overall, we can generate a lot of cash as we work towards a business that is at least 80% fee driven.
So let me wrap up my prepared remarks by saying that the recovery is playing out better than most people expected, including ourselves. While the economic recovery will probably not be a straight line, we're bullish about our growth prospects around the world. India is just one example of how Starwood is well positioned to capitalize on the infrastructure build-out as these economies develop. Luxury travel is alive and well, and has a long runway ahead of it after a deep drop-off last year. And finally, Starwood’s leadership continues to execute on the five essentials that will be the key to the company's success. And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Vasant."

Clearly, the recovery we’re seeing has been stronger than we expected when we last talked to you. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the state of business around the globe and provide some more color on",1824,"Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone. Clearly, the recovery we’re seeing has been stronger than we expected when we last talked to you. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the state of business around the globe and provide some more color on our Q2 and full year outlook. 
We’ll start with Asia, which as you saw was our strongest region in Q1. All REVPAR numbers I give you are in constant dollars for company-operated hotels. When we talked in February, Asia was already off to a strong start, up 11% in January. This momentum accelerated as REVPAR grew 16% in the quarter and is up 20% in April. We have strong growth across the region, driven by robust economic recoveries. Growth was especially strong in China, up 27% in Q1. The only exceptions were Japan, their economic conditions remain sluggish and more recently, Thailand, which has seen significant political uncertainty.
The return of corporate travel is of course the primary driver. In Asia as elsewhere, there was significant unanticipated late-breaking corporate business, both transient and group.  Occupancies in the quarter were up 10 points, rate was down 3%. The rate trend through the quarter improved, down 10% in January, flattish in March and now up 2% in April. Across Asia today, we operate 159 hotels, 52,000 rooms. We expect to open 30 to 35 hotels this year and have a pipeline of 50,000 rooms, which would double the size of our business over the next three to four years as these hotels open. In 2010, we expect Asia to contribute over 20% of our fees. With the largest share of our pipeline and robust REVPAR growth at existing hotels, Asia will be a major engine of our growth well into the future.
Moving on to North America, our largest region. This is the biggest upside surprise in the quarter. Company-operated REVPAR was down 3% in January, flat in February. We then saw a sharp uptick in March, up 9%, which has continued into April. As you have heard from others, the measure driver is late-breaking corporate business, both transient and group. The recovery is broad-based across sectors and across geographies. Leading indicator markets like New York, Boston and San Francisco were up in the high-single digits. Occupancy at New York hotels reached 75% in Q1, rate was down 7%. Across the U.S., the rate picture improved through the quarter from down 10% in January to down 3% in March. In April, we are seeing the first positive ADR change in North America since this downturn began.
In Q1, transient nights were up 14%, group nights were up 5%. 
Group business booked for the rest of 2010 was up substantially compared to almost no activity last year. LEEDS are up 14%, group pace for the balance of the year is rapidly approaching flat to 2009, and this business should be less susceptible to cancellations than 2009 was. Clearly, easy comparisons are helping and will help through Q2. Then the comparisons get tougher as we lap a recovery in occupancies in the second half of 2009. For this growth to be sustained, great increases are critical. So far, so good. 
In Continental Europe, a recovery is also underway. Although we did not see the sharp uptick we saw in March in the U.S., the first quarter in our European markets is a low season, and it is hard to read much into it. It is fair to say that Europe did not outperform as much as the U.S. did. In March, European REVPAR was up 5%. Business conditions are clearly recovering in major, northern and central European markets: the UK, France, Germany, Austria and the Benelux. As may be expected, things are more challenging in southern Europe. Italy is holding up okay so far. Once again, it is late-breaking corporate business that is the main driver. As travel is normalizing, we do not expect the volcanic ash disruptions to materially impact our European business in the second quarter. 
We have a great footprint in Africa and the Middle East, with 86 hotels and 22,000 rooms currently operating. We expect this region to be a major source of long-term growth like Asia. Our brands, Le Méridien and Sheraton, have been long-established and are very well-regarded. This year, we will derive 13% of our fees from this region. In the first quarter, we did not see growth here primarily due to difficult conditions in the UAE where REVPAR declined 11%. Egypt and North Africa, on the other hand, grew 11% and sub-Saharan Africa was flat. With its many national resource-veiled economies and stabilizing politics, we're very bullish about our future in this region. 
Finally in Latin America, Q1 REVPAR was down 3.6%. South America was very strong, up 10%, with Brazil up 36%, but Mexico where we have a large presence, was down 23%. Business travel to Mexico is slowly recovering in line with improving conditions in the U.S., but leisure travel to resorts on both coasts remains sluggish due to concerns about crime and perhaps cheaper rates available at comparable U.S. resorts. In Q2, Mexico will lap the huge H1N1 decline in 2009 so growth rates will turn positive. So far in April, Mexico is up 7%. Our five hotels in Chile have been impacted by the earthquake. Business is down significantly and the recovery will be slow. 
In our Vacation Ownership business, conditions continue to stabilize. Price reductions helped both close rates and price realization in several markets. We are again on track in this business to generate more cash this year, more than enough to fund Bal Harbour. As Frits indicated, we have seen a meaningful uptick in contract signings, with high deposits and good prices for condos at Bal Harbour. We remain optimistic about this project and are on track to complete construction by late 2011, early 2012. 
In summary, a global recovery is underway. It is most robust in Asia and has been sharper than expected in the U.S. over the past eight weeks. A few parts of the globe are not participating yet, Japan, Thailand, the UAE, Mexico and parts of Southern Europe. Clearly, the pace of recovery is stronger than we expected when we last talked. So what does all this mean for Q2 and the balance of the year? With April ending, it is clear that the trends are just described are continuing into the second quarter. We're also lapping the deepest declines from last year. As such, we're comfortable projecting global REVPAR growth at company-operated hotels in the double digits, up 9% to 11% in constant dollars. Exchange rates in Q2 remained a tailwind, adding 200 basis points to REVPAR as reported in dollars. At our global-owned hotels, we expect a similar REVPAR trend and forex in this case will add another 300 basis points. This gives us an EBITDA range in Q2 of $200 million to $210 million. We expect to have our first quarter of positive margin improvement since this downturn started. With owned-hotel margins, up 150 to 250 basis points in Q2. Even as the recovery takes off as Frits indicated, we remain very focused on cost control and productivity enhancements. Expected margin improvement in Q2 reflects the fact that REVPAR growth is driven primarily by occupancy, which does not flow through at the same level as ADR increases. Also 300 basis points of forex-driven top line growth does not drive margin gains, as you know. 
We should point out some other items that impact year-over-year comparisons in Q2. Net asset sales through 2009, Bliss, the W San Francisco, the Fifth Avenue shops and now the Court Tuscany. These assets contributed approximately $5 million in EBITDA in Q2 last year. Also, in the fees and Other income line last year, we recognized Other income of $7 million from a non-refundable deposit, which is non-recurring.
While we feel good about projecting the current trend into Q2, giving you a definitive view of the back half is quite another matter. The engine of the recovery so far has been late-breaking corporate business, which is hard to see four to six months out. Even for Group business, the booking window is unusually short right now. REVPAR comparisons get tougher in the back half, and exchange rates go from being a tailwind to neutral and potentially even a modest headwind. Frits also enumerated all the other risks out there. As you know, we are heavily correlated to corporate profit growth and business confidence. Anything that dents business confidence, be it a sovereign debt crisis, a double-dip recession, geopolitical issues like Iran, a spike in interest rates or other currently unexpected events, could derail this recovery. The outlook range we are providing assumes none of the above will happen, and the recovery will continue apace through the year. As such, we are raising our full year REVPAR outlook to a range of 5% to 8% from 0% to 5% in constant dollars at company-operated hotels. 
For owned hotels worldwide were going from a range of minus 2% to plus 2%, to 4% to 7%. Exchange rates will add another 100 basis points to REVPAR as reported in dollars. The midpoint of this new range is a full year company EBITDA of $810 million dollars, up from $750 million. The recovery is still nascent and visibility remains challenging. We've just come through the worst financial crisis in recent memory and all the damage from the crisis has not been repaired yet. We continue to look at the future in terms of scenarios. The outlook we have provided is our best guess based on what we know today. We will, of course, know more about the back half when we talk again in July.
Finally, a quick word on our balance sheet. We completed the last component of our liquidity and leverage enhancement program by extending our bank revolver through November 2013. This puts its expiry after our next two bond maturities in 2012 and '13. Our liquidity position has never been stronger. We have a great bank group. Our leverage is well below covenant levels and our bond maturity profile is very manageable. Q1 is our highest cash use quarter, so debt levels are up a bit. We still expect to close the year with debt down $100 million to $200 million from where we ended 2009. We close on the sale of the two Ws in New York. As planned, they will no longer operate it as Ws. At this point, further asset sales will depend on values realizable. While we remain committed to an asset-light strategy, we're only sellers today at values that reflect normalized EBITDAs or replacement costs. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to sell vacation ownership receivables on favorable terms. And we still expect to receive a much delayed $200 million plus tax refund later this year. With that, I'll turn this back to Jay."

And in fact, over the course of this quarter and the rest of this fiscal year, we'll be and are in the process of launching our largest promotion campaign in the history of Starwood around Rediscover Sheraton.

I mean clearly, as you heard from our comments, and you heard from others, late-breaking business is the driver of growth so far. And so, our view was you really can't see a whole lot into Q3 and Q4 as a result of that. That's number one. And so our bias was towards not getting ahead of ourselves here. Second, comparisons, while it was still negative last year, comparisons do get tougher. So for example, in local currency terms, worldwide last year, approximately we were down 24% in Q2, down 18% in Q3 and down 9% in Q4. So there was a quarter-over-quarter 600-basis-point improvement between Q2 and Q3, and then 900 basis points between Q3 and Q4. And that was as much as 1,000 or 10 whole points in the owned-hotel set worldwide, each quarter improvement in Q3 and Q4. So as you can see, while we're still lapping some weak numbers from last year. For the year-over-year comparisons, you'd have to see absolute increases to maintain current levels of REVPAR growth. And then finally, I mean if you look at prior recoveries, you often have this big bounce back. If you looked at, for example, March 2004 Smith Travel numbers for luxury and upper upscale, March is up 14%, April was up 11%, May was up 10%. This was in 2004. So you sort of had a double-digit second quarter and then it settled in at about 6% to 8% in the back half. We're not saying that's precisely what's going to happen. But it’ll give you a sent that, that’s sort of how these recoveries play out. So when you put it all together, no, we're not expecting big rate increases in the second half. Although as we said earlier, we did see rates turn positive in April. I think we've sort of given you our, we call it, our most-educated guess at this point."

What I can tell you is that as we looked at the renovations and the improvements by property, when we sat down with the owners and felt like we couldn't get to the brand standard from where we were on a particular property and to make a good return from our owners, that's when we would agree to part ways and take the Sheraton flag off the properties. So the best way to think about this is each of the improvements met a threshold return for our owners. And that was obviously prospective not retrospective. What happened in the middle of this obviously is this tremendous downturn, and it's hard to recalibrate. What we're very encouraged by though and what we were mentioning is great top-line growth, a real strong improvement in GSI scores, and some meaningful share gains, which we think are all very encouraging for getting the return on investment for both ourselves, as well as the owners who invested."

And by that we mean markets in South America, Africa, parts of the Middle East, sub-continent and East Asia. And we’re still extraordinarily bullish on the long-term opportunity throughout those different markets. Clearly, the charge is being led by China today with over 50 hotels and another 80 being built. But we expect a market like India to look, from a growth perspective and from our own opportunities, like China in the coming years. And so, the point I was trying to emphasize is first of all, unlike the cyclical nature that we've come to see our industry, as we look at Western Europe and North America, what we see now is a real generational secular trend and change over an extended period of time. The comparison I made with Western Europe post-Second World War is just to give that sense that this isn't a five to seven year business cycle. This is a 25-year growth cycle and in many respects, we're still in the early phases of that. So, no, we remain extremely positive on the growth opportunity. That said, the other thing that I think is inevitable as economies grow rapidly is there will be fits and starts. There will be moments of oversupply. There will be periods of overheating in some markets. But over time, the trend line is so strong, and because we work with very sophisticated partners in each of those local markets, we're going to continue to make investments in our own organization and in our brands and in our ability to deliver growth for our business."

This is a question in timing and execution of the strategy. So when we announced our asset-light approach as we talked about the journey two, two and a half years ago, we certainly didn't anticipate the extraordinary downturn that we've all lived through in the last year and a half or so. And during that downturn, transaction volume in the hotel sector was up 80% or 90%, which candidly is what you'd expect. I mean I think buyers were saying: I'm only going to pick something up if it’s at a distressed price because this is likely to be an all- equity deal for me. And sellers were saying: If there’s any way I can hang on, there's going to be a better time to sell. So the bid-ask spread, if you will, was really quite wide. As we look at the market today, I think that bid-ask spread is narrowing. There are certainly transactions starting to happen. And opportunistically with things like the W Court in Tuscany, we’ve stepped into that. We expect it may take a while yet for fundamentals of properties to improve and the availability of financing on the buying side to improve further, to get values that look a lot more like they did before the downturn than they did during the downturn."

I'm going to argue paradoxically that the financial trials and tribulations around some of our W Hotels and their owners ultimately reflect the health and strength of the brand. Because if you bought a hotel for twice what it's worth today and borrowed 70% to 80% loan-to-value to do that, I think it's pretty easy to see how you’d be in a difficult situation. What's been interesting, as owners and as the financial community and as the Chapter 11 process has worked through each of these properties, at no point have we felt like there was any danger of losing the flag on a property to do that, which means anybody looking forward to gaining control of the property or anybody looking at ways of keeping control, has felt that W brand has considerable value to the real estate, which is absolutely the business we're in. In the case of the W Court in Tuscany, again, I think this is a picture of health because those were two of the very first W hotels. They're wonderful charming properties, but did not keep up with the growth and the performance of W as it went from a New York phenomenon, to a U.S. one, to a global one. And to come back to the birthplace of W and have properties like the W downtown opening and the W Hoboken there as a replacement, I think is a great example of brand health and the positive effect of what economists call creative destructions. Now would life be easier for us and our owners if the financial markets and everything and the world performance of the lodging industry had been better? Absolutely. But I think all of this reflects on, as I said, the strength of the W brand rather than anything else."

As you may recall, rather than make predictions, we were looking at a range of scenarios for 2010. Of the many scenarios we considered, what we see today is without a doubt the good-case scenario. The pent-up demand that we hoped for is materializing. And as the economy picks up steam, more businesses are shifting their focus from cost cutting to growing the top line, which means resetting travel and expense budgets and shifting gears to get back on the road after 18 months of dormancy. This holds true as we look around the world. Emerging markets, or as we increasingly call them, rapidly growing markets are exhibiting a strong V-shaped recovery. And at the same time, the U.S. and Western Europe are proving robust. But let me repeat, we are not in the business of forecasting the global economy. Visibility in our business remains very limited, making it challenging to forecast one quarter out, let alone the balance of the year. We call it as we see it in real time and we plan for an array of scenarios. This approach served us well in navigating through 2009. 
So despite all the good news and the better-than-expected REVPAR, we still see reasons to consider less sanguine scenarios. To borrow a phrase from Warren Buffett, we should be fearful when others are greedy. We want to avoid the mistake of taking actions born out newfound optimism. After all, the global economy remains volatile. China risks overheating. Greece and the eurozone are grappling with major fiscal and philosophical issues, not to mention the mountain of U.S. government debt. Finally, volcanoes in Iceland, Red Shirts in Thailand and unrest in Mexico remind us that our industry is susceptible to sudden changes from many unforeseen corners.
In an uncertain world, we remain committed to financial discipline of flexibility. This means austerity in procurement, on-property costs and corporate SG&A. We simply refuse to give back the cost savings that we worked so hard to achieve. If good times continue, this will drive better flow-throughs than in prior cycles. In fact, thanks to lower costs at equivalent REVPAR levels, our EBITDA would be at least $100 million higher than before 2009. 
Our financial discipline also applies to our balance sheet. We'll continue to de-risk and delever it, thanks to operating cash flow, securitizations, proceeds from asset sales, such as the W Court in Tuscany and the long-awaited IRS tax refund.
So with that as a backdrop, I'll cover four topics today: First, a quick review of our first quarter results and implications for the balance of the year; second, some thoughts from a recent 10-day trip to India; third, a few perspectives on the bounce back of luxury travel; and fourth, a review of the five essentials of the journey, the touchstone of Starwood’s direction.
So let me start with some highlights from the first quarter and a range of expectations for the balance of the year.
We were able to beat EBITDA expectations by roughly $30 million and EPS by $0.13, owing to strong REVPAR growth. REVPAR was powered by better-than-expected occupancy, thanks to strong transient demand and encouragingly, in-the-quarter, for-the-quarter group bookings. By the way, this was consistent with our good-case scenario, which anticipated that as business environment improved, companies would scramble to set up pending meetings and events. Our good-case scenario also envisioned Luxury leading the charge, and this is exactly what happened. Luxury occupancy was up by almost 20% in the quarter.
Rate for the quarter was still negative in most geographies and brands, as is typical of the early stages of recoveries. Importantly, though, ADRs did improve month-by-month through the quarter and are nearing positive territory in many markets. Coupled with our continued focus on costs, these solid top line results drove good flow-throughs and margins, even despite the challenging mix of rising occupancy and falling rates. The favorable trends that we experienced in Q1 continued into April and bode well for the balance of the year. 
Leisure and transient demand remained firm, more than offsetting group business that was canceled or not booked in 2009. Importantly, the strongest results came from our urban markets such as New York, London and Paris and in the four and five star categories, all of Starwood's sweet spots. Corporate transient revenue in London and Paris was up 43% in the quarter. 
Group production was improving quickly off a low base. Remember that last year, we had little new bookings and a high cancellation activity. Our gross production, i.e. new bookings, is up 30% for 2010, and importantly, cancellations, block adjustments and wash at arrival are down from record levels last year, and in fact, are now trending below normal levels. This translate into net production, which is projected net revenue for the year and in the year, being up triple digits.
LEED volumes were also up double digits, particularly for smaller near-term bookings. And the recovery is broad-based with particular strength in pharma, technology and financial services. In aggregate, 2010 group pace or the total amount of booked business is approaching flat, after bottoming out in the fall of last year at minus 23%. So lodging demand continues to improve from the low level set in 2009. Based on everything we see today and barring disruptions, we could expect positive REVPAR for the full year from each of our regions. Our newly revised mid-range scenario shows worldwide company-operated REVPAR to be between plus 5% and 8% in 2010 and REVPAR at our worldwide-owned hotels to be plus 4% to 7%. Vasant will share greater detail on recent trends by region and a revised baseline scenario for 2010. 
So with that as a backdrop, let me move on to my second topic and highlight some themes from our recent trip to India. Our 10-day whistle-stop tour included visits to 18 of our 41 hotels, 21 existing and 15 being built. In Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Jaipur and Delhi, we saw firsthand examples of what we've been saying for a while. Put simply, the transformation taking place there and in other rapidly growing markets around the world implies a huge secular growth in demand for our high-end brands. To look for analogies to these long-term trends, think back to the rebuilding of Europe after the Second World War, only faster and with 10x the population. In this environment, Starwood enjoys a strong position with some of the best-known brands, long-standing relationships with the development community and as we like to call them, local smart teams that are either native or have spent their careers working in these markets. The key takeaway is that this crisis may have slowed, but it certainly did not derail the unstoppable forces of globalization and the emerging middle class. 
So let's talk about the opportunity in India. And while India and China are vastly different in so many ways, lodging supply looks and feels like China five to 10 years ago. In hindsight, many corporations began investing in China in the 1970s and 80s in anticipation of growth, but only those companies who, like Starwood, stayed the course, hired local talent and forged relationships with local partners saw their investments pay dividends in recent years. To say that India today is under-hoteled relative to future demand is a massive understatement. New York City alone has almost as many hotel rooms as the entire country. And today, we enjoy a larger and better footprint than our competitors. So we can grow our existing brands while introducing new brands, such as Four Points by Sheraton, Westin, and Aloft. And the travel market is still in its infancy. With roughly the same population as China, India generates just ¼ the outbound travel. And even with the government’s incredible India campaign to promote tourism, India has only 5 million visitors versus 50 million for China. 
So today, the dearth of infrastructure and choking transportation has created enormous pressure to develop new cities outside of old ones. As countries develop, people leave villages and head for opportunities in the city. A development named new Mindspace in Hyderabad highlights this pattern of urbanization. One developer we worked with worked with the government to acquire land outside the city and built 7.5 million square feet of commercial space including retail, offices and of course, two new hotel sites, one of which already boasts a brand new Westin. This phenomenon is playing out in Navi Mumbai, outside of Mumbai; in Gurgaon, outside of Delhi; and in Whitefield, outside of Bangalore.
It wouldn't surprise anyone that Sheraton was the first Western brand to open in India in 1973, with Le Méridien soon after, decades before many of our competitors entered the market. Both Sheraton and Le Méridien are established brands and the backbone of our brand portfolio. We see a great opportunity to work with our key partners to build new hotels under both brands. Our global development mantra of the right places, the right properties and the right partners holds true in India as anywhere. And our local smart teams understand the market and how to get things done. This is an asset that simply can't be found on the balance sheet. 
Westin is a rising giant in India. We recently opened three new Westins in the country: Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune, and expect another to open later on in the coming months in Gurgaon. Developers in India understand and appreciate Starwood’s penchant for innovation and Westin’s focus on wellness, contemporary design, not to mention the Heavenly Bed, are clear differentiators. The growth in Westin is made possible by the credibility and relationships built by Sheraton and Le Méridien over several decades.
Today, we make most of our money in the upper upscale and luxury segments. But India also promises great select-serve potential. Four Points by Sheraton benefits from the Sheraton halo and Aloft is a real game changer. The Aloft brand is sleek, modern and youthful and resonates with India’s upcoming tech-savvy traveler. No surprise then that we already expect to open six Alofts over the coming years, with three in 2010 alone. 
On a prior call, I mentioned the incremental travel that will result from our outsourcing IT efforts to Accenture. Add to that the new demand that results from having a team of 450 people in Bangalore now employed by a U.S. company. We spent some time with his team and they’re young, ambitious and eager to get ahead. They’ll travel increasingly for business and for leisure. When we walked through the operations center, we saw American computers, American air conditioners and employees wearing American-branded clothes. Our hotel brands resonate with this emerging middle class. To sum it up, our travels through India left us with a raft of living examples of the kind of growth we can expect from the rapidly growing markets around the world.
So now to my third topic for today. Some thoughts on luxury. As we've said many times, Starwood is the largest global operator of luxury hotels, with no fewer than 118 properties among our St. Regis Luxury Collection and W brands. Last year, this meant many challenges and headwinds as we witnessed unparalleled demand contraction from a plummeting world economy, not to mention government rhetoric about the evils of luxury travel. 
Now I wish I had a new hotel for every time I was asked whether luxury was dead. My answer was always the same. When people and business feel better about the world, they won't resist the allure of luxury. Today, the paranoia has subsided and our luxury properties are enjoying the strongest REVPAR gains of any segment. The business traveler is back and leisure travelers are rewarding themselves with vacations to our one-of-a-kind properties. Low levels of REVPAR today and slow supply growth tomorrow are setting the foundation for a multi-year recovery.
So let me share with you a few statistics to highlight the return of business to our luxury properties. 
At the Phoenician Luxury Collection Resort, occupancies were up over 30% in the first quarter. With group demand coming back and the need for additional space at this hotel, we restarted the Ballroom project a few months ago. We expect it to be completed and fully occupied during the hotel's peak period in the fall. Our W Hotels were our strongest performing brand in the quarter, marking occupancy gains of 28% in the U.S. Gateway cities, such as New York are seeing occupancies at near pre-crisis levels. For now, rate continues to lag. The question is for how long. 
Our St. Regis hotels are also experiencing a healthy rebound in travel and since the start of the year, we've even seen increased activity at our sales center for our Bal Harbour project. In fact, we sold over $20 million in residences year-to-date, with 35% refundable deposits. The global jet-setting crowd is starting to spend again and there are no other projects in South Florida like the St. Regis Bal Harbour. And to remind you, Starwood has the largest pipeline of upper upscale and luxury hotels in the industry. St. Regis will have 24 hotels in the system by January 2011, which doubles its footprint from 2008. And W will more than double its size between 2007 and 2011, going from 25 to over 50 hotels worldwide. I might add, we’re also pleased to see that some deals put on hold are now showing signs of life.
So with this discussion of luxury, I can't resist digressing briefly and commenting on our continued transformation to an asset-light structure. Our 21,000 owned and leased rooms lie mostly in high-barrier-to-entry urban and resort markets and are rated in the four to five star categories. Many of these hotels would be difficult, if not impossible, to replicate. Their asset values are therefore significantly higher than their depressed cash flows today would imply. So despite these high implied multiples, we don't feel that this is the right time to embark on a major asset sale program. 
First of all, many real estate investors today may still be hoping to scoop up assets at bargain prices. But with the amount of money piling up on the sidelines, buyers need to realize that the great distress sale of 2010 is unlikely to materialize. Second, EBITDAs are well below historic highs and poised to bounce back as high-end hotels rebound. And third, hotel assets are trading at valuations well below replacement costs.
As a case in point, lodging REITs implied valuations on a per key basis are somewhat less than $250,000 a key, whereas the cost to borrow funds, buy land and build today would be significantly higher. So as we look at our own portfolio, we feel the right course with most assets is to wait for the market to recover further. And when it does, we expect per key values to be well ahead of even the highest-quality REITs. 
I'd like to move on now to my fourth topic for today: A review of the five essentials of the Starwood journey that guide our actions and create shareholder value. I believe that companies prosper when they have a clear strategy that's well understood and that aligns management around measurable goals. By giving the strategy a name, we develop a shorthand way of describing our direction and explaining our goals to associates, partners and investors. An investor said something interesting to me just the other day. He noted that if you’d just woken up after a two-year slumber, you might not think that anything had changed. And in a sense, you'd be correct because at no point during the great lodging depression of 2009 did we stop executing on our five essentials. Some of our growth plans were slowed and our asset sales were put on hold. Other aspects of our strategy were accelerated, such as the focus on reducing costs, but the strategy remained intact. What has changed is the competitive environment and the global market. Strong companies emerged stronger. 
Starwood has the scale to invest in brand building and demand creation. It has the financial flexibility to take advantage of transaction opportunities, as well as the global presence to grow wherever demand grows. The world is also a different place with emerging economies driving global growth. So with this as a backdrop, let me quickly run you through the five essentials, starting with winning with talent. 
Our 145,000 associates around the world did a terrific job managing through the crisis of 2009. Lodging is a great industry to work, in particular, when you work for a company that looks to open hundreds of new hotels for the coming years. After creating 12,000 jobs in 2009 at newly opened hotels, we expect to create an additional 12,000 jobs in 2010. 
Our second essential is to execute brilliantly. When you have the right person in the right role with the right training, you can deliver great guest experiences and build brand loyalty. As we've mentioned before, our guest satisfaction scores have never been higher, even with our careful focus on costs. And at the same time, we have made substantial changes in how we drive the top line, such as our revenue management systems and the redeployment of our sales force. 
Our third essential is to build great brands. We believe Starwood has the best portfolio of high-end brands in the industry. And we've kept the hammer down on innovation to keep our brands both distinctive and compelling. And while we may be in the early stages of the Sheraton re-launch, we're already beginning to see solid growth in market share for that brand. 
Our fourth essential is to drive global growth. India highlighted the potential for our company in a country that's just beginning to develop infrastructure, including hotels. We believe that we're uniquely able to deliver on our growth promises, relying on local smart teams that have worked in these markets for decades. Our pipeline of 85,000 rooms remains robust, as the slowdown in unit additions in developing markets is being offset by a strong pipeline of new leads in our emerging markets. This pipeline represents potential room growth of almost 30%, with over 80% of those rooms to be built in markets outside of the U.S. 
Our fifth essential is to drive outstanding results for our shareholders. Throughout 2009, we were able to beat our financial targets through aggressive cost containment. As we look forward, we will continue to generate cash as we make a transition to an asset-light operating model. For example, our Vacation Ownership business is now a significant cash generator for the company. And the Bal Harbour project will absorb capital in the near term, but sales are returning and we remain on track to complete the residences and the hotel in early 2012. Overall, we can generate a lot of cash as we work towards a business that is at least 80% fee driven.
So let me wrap up my prepared remarks by saying that the recovery is playing out better than most people expected, including ourselves. While the economic recovery will probably not be a straight line, we're bullish about our growth prospects around the world. India is just one example of how Starwood is well positioned to capitalize on the infrastructure build out as these economies develop. Luxury travel is alive and well, and has a long runway ahead of it after a deep drop-off last year. And finally, Starwood’s leadership continues to execute on the five essentials that will be the key to the company's success. And so with that, I'll turn the call over to Vasant."

Clearly, the recovery we’re seeing has been stronger than we expected when we last talked to you. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the state of business around the globe and provide some more color on our Q2 and full year outlook. 
We’ll start with Asia, which as you saw was our strongest region in Q1. All REVPAR numbers I give you are in constant dollars for company-operated hotels. When we talked in February, Asia was already off to a strong start, up 11% in January. This momentum accelerated as REVPAR grew 16% in the quarter and is up 20% in April. We have strong growth across the region, driven by robust economic recoveries. Growth was especially strong in China, up 27% in Q1. The only exceptions were Japan, their economic conditions remain sluggish; and more recently, Thailand, which has seen significant political uncertainty.
The return of corporate travel is of course the primary driver. In Asia as elsewhere, there was significant unanticipated late-breaking corporate business, both transient and group. Occupancies in the quarter were up 10 points, rate was down 3%. The rate trend through the quarter improved, down 10% in January, flattish in March and now up 2% in April. Across Asia today, we operate 159 hotels, 52,000 rooms. We expect to open 30 to 35 hotels this year and have a pipeline of 50,000 rooms, which would double the size of our business over the next three to four years as these hotels open. In 2010, we expect Asia to contribute over 20% of our fees. With the largest share of our pipeline and robust REVPAR growth at existing hotels, Asia will be a major engine of our growth well into the future.
Moving on to North America, our largest region. This is the biggest upside surprise in the quarter. Company-operated REVPAR was down 3% in January, flat in February. We then saw a sharp uptick in March, up 9%, which has continued into April. As you have heard from others, the major driver is late-breaking corporate business, both transient and group. The recovery is broad-based across sectors and across geographies. Leading indicator markets like New York, Boston and San Francisco were up in the high-single digits. Occupancy at New York hotels reached 75% in Q1, rate was down 7%. Across the U.S., the rate picture improved through the quarter from down 10% in January to down 3% in March. In April, we are seeing the first positive ADR change in North America since this downturn began.
In Q1, transient nights were up 14%. Group nights were up 5%. 
Group business booked for the rest of 2010 was up substantially compared to almost no activity last year. LEEDs are up 14%, group pace for the balance of the year is rapidly approaching flat to 2009, and this business should be less susceptible to cancellations than 2009 was. Clearly, easy comparisons are helping and will help through Q2. Then the comparisons get tougher as we lap our recovery in occupancies in the second half of 2009. For this growth to be sustained, great increases are critical. So far, so good. 
In Continental Europe, a recovery is also underway. Although we did not see the sharp uptick we saw in March in the U.S., the first quarter in our European markets is the low season, and it is hard to read much into it. It is fair to say that Europe did not outperform as much as the U.S. did. In March, European REVPAR was up 5%. Business conditions are clearly recovering in major northern and central European markets: the UK, France, Germany, Austria and the Benelux. As may be expected, things are more challenging in Southern Europe. Italy is holding up okay so far. Once again, it is late-breaking corporate business that is the main driver. As travel is normalizing, we do not expect the volcanic ash disruptions to materially impact our European business in the second quarter. 
We have a great footprint in Africa and the Middle East, with 86 hotels and 22,000 rooms currently operating. We expect this region to be a major source of long-term growth like Asia. Our brands, Le Méridien and Sheraton, have been long established and are very well regarded. This year, we will derive 13% of our fees from this region. In the first quarter, we did not see growth here primarily due to difficult conditions in the UAE where REVPAR declined 11%. Egypt and North Africa, on the other hand, grew 11% and Sub-Saharan Africa was flat. With its many national resource-veiled economies and stabilizing politics, we're very bullish about our future in this region. 
Finally in Latin America, Q1 REVPAR was down 3.6%. South America was very strong, up 10%, with Brazil up 36%; but Mexico, where we have a large presence, was down 23%. Business travel to Mexico is slowly recovering in line with improving conditions in the U.S., but leisure travel to resorts on both coasts remains sluggish due to concerns about crime and perhaps cheaper rates available at comparable U.S. resorts. In Q2, Mexico will lap the huge H1N1 decline in 2009 so growth rates will turn positive. So far in April, Mexico is up 7%. Our five hotels in Chile have been impacted by the earthquake. Business is down significantly and the recovery will be slow. 
In our Vacation Ownership business, conditions continue to stabilize. Price reductions helped both close rates and price realization in several markets. We remain on track in this business to generate more cash this year, more than enough to fund Bal Harbour. As Frits indicated, we have seen a meaningful uptick in contract signings, with high deposits and good prices for condos at Bal Harbour. We remain optimistic about this project and are on track to complete construction by late 2011, early 2012. 
In summary, a global recovery is underway. It is most robust in Asia and has been sharper than expected in the U.S. over the past eight weeks. A few parts of the globe are not participating yet: Japan, Thailand, the UAE, Mexico and parts of Southern Europe. Clearly, the pace of recovery is stronger than we expected when we last talked. So what does all this mean for Q2 and the balance of the year? With April ending, it is clear that the trends we just described are continuing into the second quarter. We're also lapping the deepest declines from last year. As such, we're comfortable projecting global REVPAR growth at company-operated hotels in the double digits, up 9% to 11% in constant dollars. Exchange rates in Q2 remain a tailwind, adding 200 basis points to REVPAR as reported in dollars. At our global-owned hotels, we expect a similar REVPAR trend and forex in this case will add another 300 basis points. This gives us an EBITDA range in Q2 of $200 million to $210 million. We expect to have our first quarter of positive margin improvement since this downturn started with owned margins, up 150 to 250 basis points in Q2. Even as a recovery takes off, as Frits indicated, we remain very focused on cost control and productivity enhancements. Expected margin improvement in Q2 reflects the fact that REVPAR growth is driven primarily by occupancy, which does not flow through at the same level as ADR increases. Also 300 basis points of forex-driven top line growth does not drive margin gains, as you know. 
We should point out some other items that impact year-over-year comparisons in Q2: Net asset sales through 2009, Bliss, the W San Francisco, the Fifth Avenue shops and now The Court, Tuscany. These assets contributed approximately $5 million in EBITDA in Q2 last year. Also, in the fees and other income line last year, we recognized other income of $7 million from a non-refundable deposit, which is non-recurring.
While we feel good about projecting the current trend into Q2, giving you a definitive view of the back half is quite another matter. The engine of the recovery so far has been late-breaking corporate business, which is hard to see four to six months out. Even for group business, the booking window is unusually short right now. REVPAR comparisons get tougher in the back half, and exchange rates go from being a tailwind to neutral and potentially even a modest headwind. Frits also enumerated all the other risks out there. As you know, we are heavily correlated to corporate profit growth and business confidence. Anything that dents business confidence, be it a sovereign debt crisis, a double-dip recession, geopolitical issues like Iran, a spike in interest rates or other currently unexpected events could derail this recovery. The outlook range we are providing assumes none of the above will happen and the recovery will continue apace through the year. As such, we are raising our full year REVPAR outlook to a range of 5% to 8% from 0% to 5% in constant dollars at company-operated hotels. 
For owned hotels worldwide, we're going from a range of minus 2% to plus 2%, to 4% to 7%. Exchange rates will add another 100 basis points to REVPAR as reported in dollars. The midpoint of this new range is a full year company EBITDA of $810 million, up from $750 million. The recovery's still nascent and visibility remains challenging. We've just come through the worst financial crisis in recent memory and all the damage from the crisis has not been repaired yet. We continue to look at the future in terms of scenarios. The outlook we have provided is our best guess based on what we know today. We will, of course, know more about the back half when we talk again in July.
Finally, a quick word on our balance sheet. We completed the last component of our liquidity and leverage enhancement program by extending our bank revolver through November 2013. This puts its expiry after our next two bond maturities in 2012 and '13. Our liquidity position has never been stronger. We have a great bank group. Our leverage is well below covenant levels and our bond maturity profile is very manageable. Q1 is our highest cash use quarter, so debt levels are up a bit. We still expect to close the year with debt down $100 million to $200 million from where we ended 2009. We close on the sale of the two Ws in New York. As planned, they will no longer operate it as Ws. At this point, further asset sales will depend on values realizable. While we remain committed to an asset-light strategy, we're only sellers today at values that reflect normalized EBITDAs or replacement costs. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to sell vacation ownership receivables on favorable terms. And we still expect to receive a much-delayed $200 million plus tax refund later this year. With that, I'll turn this back to Jay."

I mean clearly, as you heard from our comments and you heard from others, late-breaking business is the driver of growth so far. And so our view was you really can't see a whole lot into Q3 and Q4 as a result of that. That's number one. And so our bias was towards not getting ahead of ourselves here. Second, comparisons, while it was still negative last year, comparisons do get tougher. So for example, in local currency terms, worldwide last year, approximately we were down 24% in Q2, down 18% in Q3 and down 9% in Q4. So there was a quarter-over-quarter 600-basis-point improvement between Q2 and Q3, and then 900 basis points between Q3 and Q4. And that was as much as 1,000 or 10 whole points in the owned-hotel set worldwide, each quarter improvement in Q3 and Q4. So as you can see, while we're still lapping some weak numbers from last year, for the year-over-year comparison, you'd have to see absolute increases to maintain current levels of REVPAR growth. And then finally, I mean if you look at prior recoveries, you often have this big bounce back. If you looked at, for example, March 2004 Smith Travel numbers for luxury and upper upscale, March is up 14%, April was up 11%, May was up 10%. This was in 2004. So you sort of had a double-digit second quarter and then it settled in at about 6% to 8% in the back half. We're not saying that's precisely what's going to happen. But it’ll give you a sense that, that’s sort of how these recoveries play out. So when you put it all together, no, we're not expecting big rate increases in the second half. Although as we said earlier, we did see rates turn positive in April. I think we've sort of given you our, we call it, our most-educated guess at this point."

What I can tell you is that as we looked at the renovations and the improvements by property, when we sat down with the owners and felt like we couldn't get to the brand standard from where we were on a particular property and to make a good return from our owners, that's when we would agree to part ways and take the Sheraton flag off the properties. So the best way to think about this is each of the improvements met a threshold return for our owners. And that was obviously prospective, not retrospective. What happened in the middle of this, obviously, is this tremendous downturn, and it's hard to recalibrate. What we're very encouraged by though and what we were mentioning is great top line growth, a real strong improvement in GSI scores, and some meaningful share gains, which we think are all very encouraging for getting the return on investment for both ourselves, as well as the owners who invested."

And we’re still extraordinarily bullish on the long-term opportunity throughout those different markets. Clearly, the charge is being led by China today with over 50 hotels and another 80 being built. But we expect a market like India to look, from a growth perspective and from our own opportunities, like China in the coming years. And so, the point I was trying to emphasize is first of all, unlike the cyclical nature that we've come to see our industry, as we look at Western Europe and North America, what we see now is a real generational secular trend and change over an extended period of time. The comparison I made with Western Europe post-Second World War is just to give that sense that this isn't a five- to seven-year business cycle. This is a 25-year growth cycle and in many respects, we're still in the early phases of that. So no, we remain extremely positive on the growth opportunity. That said, the other thing that I think is inevitable as economies grow rapidly is there will be fits and starts. There will be moments of oversupply. There will be periods of overheating in some markets. But over time, the trend line is so strong, and because we work with very sophisticated partners in each of those local markets, we're going to continue to make investments in our own organization and in our brands in our ability to deliver growth for our business."

This is a question in timing and execution of the strategy. So when we announced our asset-light approach as we talked about the journey two, 2½ years ago, we certainly didn't anticipate the extraordinary downturn that we've all lived through in the last year and a half or so. And during that downturn, transaction volume in the hotel sector was off 80% or 90%, which candidly is what you would expect. I mean, I think buyers were saying, “I'm only going to pick something up if it’s at a distressed price because this is likely to be an all-equity deal for me.” And sellers were saying, “If there’s any way I can hang on, there's going to be a better time to sell.” So the bid-ask spread, if you will, was really quite wide. As we look at the market today, I think that bid-ask spread is narrowing. There are certainly transactions starting to happen. And opportunistically with things like the W Court and Tuscany, we’ve stepped into that. We expect it may take a while yet for fundamentals of properties to improve and the availability of financing on the buying side to improve further, to get values that look a lot more like they did before the downturn than they did during the downturn."

Because if you bought a hotel for twice what it's worth today and borrowed 70% to 80% loan-to-value to do that, I think it's pretty easy to see how you’d be in a difficult situation. What's been interesting, as owners and as the financial community and as the Chapter 11 process has worked through each of these properties, at no point have we felt like there was any danger of losing the flag on a property to do that, which means anybody looking forward to gaining control of the property or anybody looking at ways of keeping control has felt that the W brand adds considerable value to the real estate, which is absolutely the business we're in. In the case of the W Court in Tuscany, again, I think this is a picture of health because those were two of the very first W hotels. They're wonderful charming properties, but did not keep up with the growth and the performance of W as it went from a New York phenomenon to a U.S. one to a global one. And to come back to the birthplace of W and have properties like the W – Downtown opening and the W Hoboken there as a replacement, I think is a great example of brand health and the positive effect of what economists call creative destruction. Now would life be easier for us and our owners if the financial markets and everything and the world performance of the lodging industry had been better? Absolutely. But I think all of this reflects on, as I said, the strength of the W brand rather than anything else."

Occupancies",3060,"Thank you, Jay, and thanks, all, for joining us on our call today. We're happy to report that the economic recovery continued with the global GDP growth rising above 4%. This fueled lodging demand and drove our business in the second quarter. Occupancies continued to climb and rate increased for the first time since Q3 of 2008. At today's occupancy levels, we're confident that rates will sustain their rise through the year. And as each month passes, we're increasingly convinced that the great lodging depression of 2008 and 2009 is behind us. 
Nonetheless, we continue our scenario planning in the face of an uncertain economic picture. Our base case remains cautious about the near-term recovery, playing out somewhere between the new normal and the typical past recoveries. Longer-term, we continue to be bullish about getting more than our fair share of the huge secular growth in demand in emerging markets. 
So with that as a backdrop, I'd like to cover four topics today. First, a review of our second quarter results; second, an update on why Starwood is well positioned to own the upswing; and third, some background on our owned assets and our strategy for getting the most value as we move toward asset light; and fourth, a look at how we create value for our owner partners. 
So let me start with the first topic, some second quarter highlights. We were able to beat EBITDA expectations by $50 million and EPS by $0.10. For some time now, we've been talking about our leading global position, our strong brands and our skew towards luxury. And it was precisely these drivers that accounted for our strong top line results. 
Company-operated REVPAR growth was nearly 30% in Asia Pacific and Latin America. North America company-operated REVPAR was up 12%. And Europe, despite its troubling headlines, was up 10% in local currency. Only Africa and the Middle East under-performed, thanks mostly to oversupply in the Emirates. Overall, worldwide-owned REVPAR jumped 16%, and margins expanded by 400 basis points. 
The big story behind our REVPAR growth is the rebound in business travel, which is 75% of our business. Revenues from global accounts and midweek occupancy are nearly back to 2008 levels. The sectors that are leading the charge are financials, consulting and tech. 
Group business played out well in the second quarter also, with surging booking in the quarter for the quarter. For the first time in two years, total group business on the books is in positive territory. I should also add that booking windows remain quite short, often only four to five months out. So we expect additional pickup for 2011 during this year. Overall, new leads were up 20% and rates for 2010 bookings were up 16%. 
The rebound in business travel bodes well for corporate rate negotiations this fall. After two years of declines, industry-wide occupancies have now reached levels where rates tend to rise. North American property saw occupancy above 71% in the quarter, with midweek levels in June for New York, Boston and Chicago over 90%. So it's not a surprise that ADRs are up roughly 5% in North America for June and July. And in London, June midweek occupancies were 98%, with Paris and Rome at 92%. 
Throughout 2009, we talked about our commitment to contain costs as we moved into the up-cycle. Our efforts are paying off as margins increased 400 basis points in the quarter. Around the world, our 145,000 associates did a great job of maintaining a lean structure. And at the same time, we were able to deliver record guest satisfaction scores even as hotels continue to fill. This success speaks well to our efforts at communication, branded service culture training and succession planning. We're proud to say that Starwood is a great place to work and build a career. 
Our corporate SG&A was up in the quarter, but importantly, net of some lumpiness around incentive compensation, our SG&A spending run rate is actually below last year. Remember last year at this time, we were in declining EBITDA so we lowered accruals. While this year's results have exceeded expectations, those accruals have gone up. Over time, the real driver of cost is headcount, which is flat in the quarter and will remain flat through 2011. Rest assured, we'll keep a tight control on our overhead costs. 
So in many ways, our call today continues the themes from last quarter. Top line growth was stronger than expected, cost controls resulted in higher margins and so far, we aren't seeing any change in our outlook for the back half of the year, emphasis on the so far. The global economy remains volatile and unpredictable. If, for example, the European sovereign debt scare that began in May were to derail the recovery, it would not be until later this fall that it would hit our business. Again, so far, we've not seen anything. So our new outlook does not anticipate a major slowdown and is set at 7% to 9% for worldwide system-wide REVPAR growth in 2010. In a few minutes, Vasant will share greater detail on trends by region and our 2010 baseline scenario. 
So with that as a backdrop, let me move to my second topic, why Starwood is well positioned to own the upswing. Specifically, I want to highlight three reasons why we outperformed our competitors and why we believe this will continue. 
First of all, having high-end brands and properties means we under-perform during down periods like 2009. Conversely, we also outperform in up-cycles. This is good news, not only now but also over time as there tend to be more up-years than down-years. 
Second, our footprint takes us to parts of the world that are likely to grow faster for some time to come. With 52% of our hotels located outside of the U.S., Starwood is not a U.S. company with some assets overseas. Today, we are a global company that happens to be based in New York. Our global presence has fueled a pipeline of 85,000 rooms, representing 28% unit growth, and 80% of our new hotels were opened outside of the U.S., with valuable 20-plus year management incentive based contracts. 
Third, our portfolio of hotels is not only the strongest in the company's history, it keeps getting better. From 2007 through the end of this year, we will have added 320 new hotels. In addition, we've also renovated 350 properties with our owners. That means that 2/3 of our hotels are now new or as good as new. 
So now I'd like to turn to my third topic; how we'll maximize the value of our own portfolio as we become asset light. Our experience in 2009 proved once again how the fee-based model can reduce volatility. Our own profits were down over 50% while our fee revenues fell only 12%. Now in the near term, that volatility actually has a positive flipside. To quote Vasant in the last quarter's call, ""our own earnings are like a coiled spring"". You saw some of that earnings growth potential this quarter with owned EBITDA up 40%. So while our goal is to have over 80% of our EBITDA driven by fees, we'll be patient balancing earnings growth, time value of money and the right prices. 
To gain insight into our thought process, I thought it might be useful to take a look at what we did during the last cycle. Let's start with the sale to host our largest transaction. It demonstrated how we can structure a win-win deal for both sides. We sold 33 hotels to host in early 2006 including 16 Sheratons and 12 Westins. The multiple was over 15x mid-cycle 2005 EBITDA. With 40-year contracts, we joined hands with a terrific owner whose long-term plans aligned with ours and who's balance sheet is one of the best in the industry. Host invests in our brands, as we could see from last year's $55 million renovation of the Sheraton Boston and the $100 million planned renovation for the Sheraton New York. They also recently announced acquisitions of a Westin and a W. 
Investors often ask if we would split out a rate, and the answer is yes, but only under the right circumstances. In 2006, the spin-off would have been an untested entity likely to trade at a discount to host. Also host had the corporate overhead in place to absorb these assets. And finally, the host transaction was extremely tax efficient. 
I should also mention that in the prior cycles, Starwood also made some large one-off sales such as the Westin Philadelphia, St. Regis, D.C., Turnberry Resort and Venetian Hotels. These hotels traded at roughly $400,000 a key. 
Today, we see a transaction market that's down almost 90% from its peak. But after nearly two years, we're seeing a real uptick in interested parties with access to capital. For example, there are potential buyers from markets outside of the U.S. such as sovereign wealth funds, high net worth individuals and real estate companies. Inside the U.S., REITs, blind pools and new private equity funds are coming to life. This money is on the sidelines and is increase in the year to get work. 
As you may know, ground is being broken on few new hotels. Financing is difficult to find and it's cheaper to buy a hotel than to build a new one. This means that room rates and the financial results of existing hotels should rise for some time to come. Accordingly, we value our hotels not based on earnings today but on the present value of their earnings two to three years from now. In other words, we remain committed to the asset light model for us but we have adjusted our expectations on timing and not on pricing. In the meantime, we expect to enjoy strong growth in profits from our owned assets. 
In that context, let me share some statistics on our owned portfolio. As of today, we own or lease 62 hotels with over 21,000 rooms. About 90% of those rooms are in urban locations in markets and resort markets where it's difficult to build new hotels. Roughly 55% of our own EBITDA was generated outside of the United States. Of these 21,000 rooms, almost 18,000 are wholly owned. I'll share some more details on these properties in just a moment. Just under 2,500 rooms at leased, including the brand new W Barcelona, W Times Square, Sheraton Park Lane in London and Sheraton Charles de Gaulle in Paris. These remaining leased properties are detailed in our property list. And there's one unbranded hotel in the list where we own a majority stake and that's the 941-room Boston Park Plaza. 
So let's take a look at the 18,000 rooms that are 100% owned. The first classification we use internally is what we would describe as high-value hotels that have no major capital needs. We could sell them on short notice or continue to own them and enjoy the rebound in earnings. Examples include the Phoenician, Sheraton on the Park in Sydney and St. Regis, San Francisco. We estimate that 60% of our owned rooms fit in this category. 
The second category, about 25,000 owned rooms, includes high value hotels also in great hard-to-replicate markets but that need renovation. These are assets that we'd either sell with a committed property improvement plan or that we would hold and renovate ourselves. Examples would include the St. Regis, Aspen and the Grand in Florence. 
The third classification of our owned hotels is what we call the transaction with partner bucket. This includes a few large box hotels with upside potential, but that need strategic repositioning or a large-scale renovation. We'd like to work with a partner to manage the complexity and capital needs of these projects. About 15% of our rooms are in this category, including the recently [ph] defied (21:34) Sheraton Manhattan and the Westin Peachtree. 
In addition to the wholly-owned hotels, we also have 28 unconsolidated joint ventures that represent 3,000 additional rooms with an average share of 33%. These JV hotels are located in gateway cities including Hong Kong, Tokyo, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, San Diego, Montréal, Seattle and New Orleans. With our minority positions, the timing and sale of these assets is a little trickier for us to control. 
So before I move to my fourth topic, and while I'm talking about their balance sheet value, I wanted to touch on two more potential sources of cash: Starwood vacation ownership and Bal Harbour. As you may recall, our SVO team took early action to generate cash from timeshare by working through the existing inventory on our balance sheet. Between 2009 and 2010, we generated $525 million in cash from the business and we expect an even greater amount over the next three to four years. And Bal Harbour is on track to open by 2012, providing another inflow of cash as we close on the residential sales. 
As we move towards a largely fee-driven business, it's important for us to reflect on how we create value for our owners. This is my fourth topic for today and I'll touch on a few ways we do this in the context of the five essentials of the journey, our strategic touchstone. Under our first essential, win with talent, we created an aligned corporate team over the last three years. This team supports our regional divisions as they recruit, retain, develop and challenge local smart teams. Their job is to deliver culturally relevant on-brand experiences for our guests around the world. Together, we've been able to increase associate engagement and effectiveness despite tough times. 
Under our second essential, execute brilliantly, we achieved some dramatic cost-savings over the past 18 months. But our work is not finished as we continue to find ways to improve efficiency at our hotels. Through our lean hotel operations and procurement efforts, we intend to offset 1/2 of the inflationary growth. This includes maintaining flat headcount into the cycle. Thus far, we've sustained our guest satisfaction scores despite a 10 percentage point increase in occupancies. We've also expanded the coverage and sophistication of our revenue management systems, realizing [ph] lists (23:53) of 2% or more were implemented. Our sales reorganization is now complete in four markets, and we'll be rolling out six more by the end of the year. At the same time, we're strengthening our IT capabilities to better serve our customers. With our worldwide market share up over about 100 basis points this year, we couldn't be more pleased with how our team continues to execute on behalf of our owners. 
Under our third essential, build great brands, we've kept the hammer down on innovation. Whether it's the Link@Sheraton, the launch of a loft or the worldwide rollout of W. Our brand teams are also working with our properties to reduce costs by simplifying brand standards. And SPG'S latest Free Weekends promotion is on track to exceed last year's record. Today, SPG members account for 44% of our room nights, the highest in our history, providing a loyal occupancy base for owners. We also generate the majority of online bookings through our branded websites. 
And as I look at our brands, I'm delighted to share progress on the success thus far with the Sheraton re-launch. On top of the $6 billion already invested in the brand, we're looking forward to another $5 billion to be spent opening 60 new Sheratons. Worldwide, we're seeing Sheraton grow 150 basis points faster in top line than its competitive set, and even faster than that in North America. We continue to reach new highs in overall guest satisfaction, likelihood to return and likelihood to recommend. 
Turning to Le Méridien, we've added some terrific hotels in North America, including Philadelphia, Minneapolis and Cambridge. And as we introduce Le Méridien to North America, we're bringing Westin to points around the world. As mentioned on the last call, Westin is entering India with four openings and expanding in China with properties in Shenzhen, Tiangjin and Huangzhou. Even in ramp-up mode, many new Westins are already outperforming their concept. 
Before I move onto the next essential, let me add that our luxury brands are enjoying a great rebound with the REVPAR gains over 15% for the year. We have the largest base of luxury hotels in the world, with 120 properties and almost 27,000 rooms. The fact that this footprint continues to grow shows that developers see the value of these brands, which gets me to our fourth essential, deliver global growth. 
Our development teams are focused on the right partners, the right properties and right places. We're not afraid of walking away from a deal that's not with the right partner, if it's not for right our brands or if the contract terms aren't right. We'll soon have opened 320 hotels in just over four years and have a pipeline of 350 more. And don't forget, each new hotel creates more demand for our brands. 
Take our backyard, for example. New York City is one of the world's great urban hotel markets and a stronghold for Starwood. In the next year or so, roughly one in four new hotel rooms will carry the Starwood flag as our footprint grows by roughly 50%. This includes two new Sheratons in Brooklyn and Tribeca, the W Downtown, to more lofts in Brooklyn and Harlem, an Element in Times Square and the Four Points on Long Island. 
And now for our fifth and final essential, drive outstanding results. Starwood has executed well over the past decade. Looking ahead, we have an organization focused on a multi-year plan. This includes a relentless focus on driving industry-leading top line growth, margin expansion as well as net unit additions. This is geared towards creating great returns for our hotel owners and growing our fee business. Meanwhile, we can generate cash as we transition to an asset-light model. 
So to summarize my comments very briefly, we've had another great quarter, and we're well positioned to continue on that success even if the recovery moderates. Before I turn the call over to Vasant, I wanted also to let you know that we'll be holding an investor day at the St. Regis New York on December 8. So please mark your calendars and stay tuned for details. Vasant?"

As Frits indicated, we had a strong quarter that exceeded expectations on multiple fronts. REVPAR growth and market share gains, cost control and margin improvement, hotel signings and openings and of course earnings. Over the next few minutes, I'll provide some color on the drivers of these results, current business trends and our outlook for the balance of the year. 
Asia continued its sharp recovery track. Local currency REVPAR was up 28%. China once again led the charge with growth of 46%. Rate was up 7% and occupancy was up 10 points. REVPAR growth was around 14% in India, Australia and the rest of Asia, more than offsetting weakness in Thailand, which was down 6% due to the political crisis. Even Japan, which has been sluggish to date, was up in the double digits driven by occupancy gains. This recovery trend continues into July but comparisons get a lot tougher. Between Q2 and Q3 2009, REVPAR at company-operated hotels in Asia improved by 800 basis points and by another 1,200 basis points between Q3 and Q4. So despite the strong demand trends on the year-over-year basis, the rate of growth will slow down. 
We continue to see a healthy level of new development activity. Out of the 39 new deals we have signed in 2010, 18 were in Asia. And Asia continues to account for 60% of our 85,000-room pipeline. Of the 32 hotels we have opened worldwide this year, 10 were in Asia where we expect to open at least another 20 before year-end. As we have seen in Beijing post-Olympics and elsewhere in Asia, it does not take long for demand growth to absorb new supply. With well-established brands, the largest footprint and a strong local smart team, we remain very well positioned to capitalize on the huge opportunity in Asia. 
Our largest region, North America, was up a solid 13% at company-operated hotels, reminiscent of pre-crisis days. REVPAR growth accelerated during the quarter from 12.6% in April to 14.6% in June as rate turned positive in May and was up 5% in June. The shape of the recovery is similar to what we saw post 9/11. This time, the dip was deeper and the bounce back is stronger. Growth was especially strong in New York, Boston, Chicago and Toronto. Western cities, Seattle, San Diego and Phoenix did not recover as fast. Corporate travel is a primary driver of demand. As midweek occupancies rose into the high 70s, we were able to manage a mix of business to drive rate. For the quarter, occupancy at company-operated hotels was 74% with rate up 2%. Group room nights were up 16% with rate down 1.3%. Transient room nights were up 9% with rate up 5%. 
Another American-owned hotel portfolio with its major metro concentration and Ws, St. Regis, Westins and Sheratons was even stronger, up 21% in Q2. In June, our owned hotel REVPAR grew 27% with rate up 9.5%. The tone of business remains strong in North America as we enter Q3. Short-term booking trends, as well as conversations with customers about future plans, remained positive. In the year, net group production is running at 3x last year's depressed levels and leads continue to increase. Last year, we filled our hotels in July and August as best we could with lower-rated leisure business. This year, corporate transient demand is robust, and we will be reducing our least attractive leisure channels to manage average daily rate up. 
While Q3 business demand is strong, it is important to point out again that comparisons get a lot tougher. In 2009, REVPAR at company-operated hotels improved 700 basis points between Q2 and Q3, and by over 1,000 basis points between Q3 and Q4. As such, the year-over-year REVPAR growth will be lower in Q3 and Q4 than it was in Q2, even ph] if a huge (32:07) levels of REVPAR continue to rise. While occupancies approach peak levels, margins remain well below peak levels as do rates. With limited supply in the pipeline, the demand supply equation has tightened faster than we have seen in prior recoveries, and supply is likely to remain muted as long as rates and margins are at these levels. While raising rates is not something that delights customers, this is a business where rates are determined by the demand-supply balance in each market every night. We price our inventory using increasingly sophisticated revenue management systems to deliver a good return to our owners. As retail rates rise, corporate-negotiated rates, which have declined almost 20% since 2008, will need to rise too. 
In Europe, local currency REVPAR at company-operated hotels rose 10% with strong occupancies in London, Paris, Frankfurt and Vienna. ADR was flat. Our owned hotels were up 6.5%. Occupancies rose but rates were down. As in the U.S., major gateway cities expertise had mid-week occupancies in the 90s in June. Despite the problems in Spain, our new [ph] LEEDS (33:22) hotel, the W Barcelona is off to a great start. The trajectory of recovery is slower in Europe than in the U.S., and the weaker euro adds an additional headwind to reported numbers. 
As we enter Q3, we expect some benefit from the weaker euro at our owned hotels in Italy. However, the timing of Ramadan will hurt business originating from the Middle East. The euro was at 142 in Q3 last year versus 125 to 130 today, further impacting numbers as reported in dollars. 
While group business is solid in the back half, the primary driver of demand remains late-breaking transient business. Primarily due to excess supply in the Gulf, our business in Africa and the Middle East was flat in Q2, our weakest region. As we enter Q3, conditions will remain challenged in the Gulf, stronger in Egypt and the rest of Africa, but Ramadan will affect August. 
In Latin America, strong growth in the South and Mexican H1N1 impact last year resulted in REVPAR up 30%. Argentina grew 44% and Brazil 32%. In Mexico, business travel is recovering but results have been hit by drug-related crime concerns. These trends remain intact as we enter Q3. This quarter, we will lap the significant impact from H1N1 we saw in South America last year. 
On the hotel cost front, our multiple initiatives continue to pay off. At owned hotels worldwide, EBITDA margins were up 400 basis points, a healthy flow-through rate of around 50% despite deriving most of our REVPAR increases from occupancy gains. In North America, productivity was up 7%. At all company-operated hotels, worldwide operating profit margins were up 150 basis points. We remain focused on driving productivity and on our ongoing lean hotel operations and procurement initiatives. While it's tempting to add cost as revenues increase, our hotel GMs understand that margins are well below peak levels and a return to peak margins as fast as we can is job number one. This will, of course, require not just good cost control but also further recovery in REVPAR, especially rates. We expect the margin improvement trend to continue into the back half with operating margins increasing 100 to 150 basis points worldwide. 
On the SG&A front, we're holding the line on headcount additions. The only adds will be in areas like Asia, Africa and Brazil where we see significant growth opportunities. Versus Q2 of last year, our SG&A headcount is down 6% and is flat versus the last quarter. Our reported SG&A was up in Q2 due to year-over-year changes in incentive compensation accruals as Frits described. Last year, at this time, business trends were far worse than we expected, and we were reducing incentive compensation accruals. This year, trends are better than we expected, and we are adding to incentive compensation accruals. Adjusted for this, SG&A is flat year-over-year. This issue will persist into Q3. SG&A will be up again in the 10% to 12% range. We made deep and what we believe are sustainable cuts in SG&A last year and we remain determined to maintain them. 
In our Vacation Ownership business, which is our most consumer-dependent enterprise, the tone of business is best described as sluggish. Customer propensity to tour is lower, close rates are stable and pricing is lower due to our reductions as well as mix. In a tough environment, we did well to hold intervals sold roughly flat. With consumer confidence declining, we do not expect these trends to improve in the second half. 
At Starwood, we remain very optimistic about the long-term for all the reasons that Frits described. Our best-in-class brands and global footprint, a great pipeline, sharp recovery in owned hotel profits and significant cash generation from operations, asset sales, SVO and Bal Harbor. Over the next six to nine months, however, we think some caution is called for. A variety of leading indicators about the macro-economy have turned negative. Confidence is eroding, markets are volatile. We are, as you know, sensitive to corporate profit expectations and business confidence. If these trends persist, it is possible we will see some impact later this year. Booking windows are short and visibility is limited. That said, it is important to reiterate that there is no evidence of any slowdown at this point. 
Our outlook reflects the current trend and the fact that we lapped much tougher comparisons in the second half as described earlier. As such, we expect 8% to 10% local currency REVPAR growth in Q3 at company-operated hotels. Exchange rates will be a significant headwind reducing dollar reported REVPAR growth to 5% to 7%. The forex impact will remain a headwind in Q4 too. 
For the full year, we are raising constant dollar REVPAR growth to 7% to 9%, 200 basis points above our prior expectations, and 6% to 8% as reported in dollars. Our full year EBITDA expectations have also increased to a range of $815 million dollars to $845 million. 
Finally, a quick word on our balance sheet. We finished Q2 with net debt under $3 billion. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is now below 4x. We're working on the securitization of Vacation Ownership receivables. Market conditions are favorable and assuming they stay that way, we should get a deal done in Q3. We continue to expect our $200 million-plus tax refund this year. It is making good progress at this point through the internal processes of the IRS. As such, we expect to end the year with net debt of around $2.5 billion. We will have reduced debt by $1.5 billion over 18 months excluding FAS changes. With that, I'll turn this back to Jay."

You mentioned the pipeline and I think that's important. So a very high percentage of the 300 rooms in our pipeline come from Asia Pacific. I believe it's over half now, it's about 60%. The second thing you have to be able to have insight into was what the growth will be in REVPAR. And what we're seeing now is a bounce back in REVPAR to levels that are getting close to pre-crisis. So looking farther ahead, it's unclear exactly what that pace will be but that certainly would be another piece. In either case, we also have growing incentive fees as we continue to build the profitability of those hotels and as that REVPAR rebounds. And then finally, there's the currency effect, and greater minds and powers than ours are talking about China and what will happen with renminbi over time, but given the size of Fee business and the number of hotels we're adding, were there to be appreciation in the yuan, that would add to it as well. So those are the things that I would be putting in if I wasn't model out what that percentage is over time."

And the beginning of your question was slightly cut off. So let me try to fill in the blank a little bit. The first part of your question was around flat headcount, and that does refer to what's happening at the corporate level and offices. And we do believe that first of all, as we said in the script just a moment ago, that spending rate overall is flat-to-down, that the change you're seeing is largely due to we're moving the incentive comp accrual in the opposite direction from a year ago for all the reasons you can appreciate. But then we do intend to keep headcount flat-to-down for our corporate and SG&A functions. At the property level, as we've described now for a while, we continue to work to roll out a lean hotel operations model. And we continue to look at ways to simplify the execution of our brand standards, focusing really on those things that make a difference and differentiate our brands. And we believe that in doing that, overall, we can hold our expenses to about half the inflation rate. We expect that if occupancy gets a lot higher, we clearly will have to add some variable headcount. But at this point, we're very much focused, at least at the management level of the property, to hold that flat. Vasant, perhaps you want to add something?"

Clearly, the revitalization program is paying off. And the way we can see that is looking at the performance of individual hotels before and after, and also the fact that the guest satisfaction scores and some of the subcomponents of those scores, as in people's appreciation for the physical aspect of the property and people's willingness to recommend and return, are all moving up in tandem with REVPAR. So there's clearly both correlation and causation going on there. We continue to see a build in our SPG occupancies around the promotions there, but we believe also because of our work to continue enrollment and retention of SPG members. The sales reorganization in those markets where that's been unfolded have also yielded considerable benefits, some of which went to Sheraton. And then finally, as we look at revenue management, and Vasant talked about the more sophisticated programs, and I mentioned an average 2% or better lift in properties there. It really was boils down to three things. Not just having the sophisticated systems, but also getting the hotels to use those systems more consistently. And in some cases, to use them as their primary way of doing business, which hasn't always been the case in the past. And the third piece is to train our associates to be able to do that. If you add up all those four things along with a number of other efforts, we're looking at a growth rate in REVPAR for Sheraton that's about 300 basis points faster than some competitive brands at a comparable place. And I think it's the confluence of all of those things. But primarily, the first one, the revitalization program because we're seeing that so much in tandem with that being rolled out right now. So thank you."

With occupancies in the 90s, and retail rates climbing like they are, it is hard to justify holding corporate rates where they are. So we certainly would look to get back to where we were over a two- to three-year period, and therefore would look for high-single-digit increases in our negotiations later this year. Of course, it is a case-by-case negotiation. It also depends on what the rest of the industry is doing. But that would be our intent."

And so those would be some of the ways we do that. But we recognize that as we make a transformation from -- and I should add one more, we made an acquisition of Le Méridien. So there's a variety of things that we could do and what we do will depend on when cash comes in and which of those alternatives makes the most sense for our shareholders based on our view of the world at that time. But what is absolutely clear is that between the monetization of a large part of our Vacation Ownership business, between the closure and sale of the residences at the St. Regis Bal Harbour, as well as obviously asset sales over time, we'll come into a lot of cash at the same time that we transform ourselves to a business model, that doesn't require a lot. So we will definitely have that problem. It's not just a conceptual one or I should say probably that's a luxury problem to have. We'll have that opportunity.

But what we continue to see -- first of all I think one of the things that's encouraging is the sectors that are growing, whether it's tech or banking or consulting, financials are the kinds of businesses that are more leading indicators than lagging was. What we also find in talking to our key accounts is one of the things that they're stressing is the continued globalization of their businesses. And one of the things that we're able to do with them is talk to them about the fact that our brands are so well distributed around the world. And so if anything, what we're seeing is a change in travel patterns, meaning more global travel around the world. We're also seeing more travel across markets. One of the things that's been very interesting for us to watch is the incredible amount of investment from China into Africa. And undoubtedly, what happens when you put a few hundred billion dollars into a market buying companies, you start to look at what you bought and how you can manage it, which means more travel. And so travel between emerging markets, which is something that hadn't been a major factor a few years ago. And then finally, you alluded to a bubble in occupancy. I actually think it's just a question of remembering how apoplectic and flat on its back the global economy was a year and a year and half ago. And a lot of what we're seeing now I think is just a restart of business activity. And inevitably, that business activity means more travel. As people start to focus, as many of you are on companies that are generating top line and not just continuing to develop earnings by reducing costs. And generating the top line, almost by definition means going out, making the sale, building relationships, holding meetings and having incentive trips. So we again feel that, that bodes well. So that even if we have a moderate recovery, I think business travel is on a trajectory that will continue to go up. And given the occupancy levels we've been talking about, it's a great story for rate. The other thing just to emphasize is because so few new hotels are being built at least in the U.S., we think it says a lot about what will happen to rate in the next two or three years. And then maybe just one final remark. The other thing that we see, and again I couldn't put a number on this for you, is the increasing outsourcing and relocating of workers both inside the United States and elsewhere. So as communication costs that have effectively gone to zero, people are working out of different places. And you might argue that means people would travel less but in fact, what we're seeing and we're hearing about from our customers is since someone who's a senior executive or a rising star is now based somewhere other than where they might logically be closer to their office, they're having to travel to visit that office in a way that they wouldn't have had before. So travel is definitely changing. I think travel intensity is staying at least as high as it was as a proportion to GDP. And I don't think this is a bubble. I think this is just a resurgence or a return to some level of normalcy."

We're happy to report that the economic recovery continued with the global GDP growth rising above 4%. This fueled lodging demand and drove our business in the second quarter. Occupancies",3060,"Thank you, Jay, and thanks, all, for joining us on our call today. We're happy to report that the economic recovery continued with the global GDP growth rising above 4%. This fueled lodging demand and drove our business in the second quarter. Occupancies continued to climb and rate increased for the first time since Q3 of 2008. At today's occupancy levels, we're confident that rates will sustain their rise through the year. And as each month passes, we're increasingly convinced that the great lodging depression of 2008 and 2009 is behind us. 
Nonetheless, we continue our scenario planning in the face of an uncertain economic picture. Our base case remains cautious about the near-term recovery, playing out somewhere between the new normal and the typical past recoveries. Longer-term, we continue to be bullish about getting more than our fair share of the huge secular growth in demand in emerging markets. 
So with that as a backdrop, I'd like to cover four topics today. First, a review of our second quarter results; second, an update on why Starwood is well positioned to own the upswing; and third, some background on our owned assets and our strategy for getting the most value as we move toward asset light; and fourth, a look at how we create value for our owner partners. 
So let me start with the first topic, some second quarter highlights. We were able to beat EBITDA expectations by $50 million and EPS by $0.10. For some time now, we've been talking about our leading global position, our strong brands and our skew towards luxury. And it was precisely these drivers that accounted for our strong top line results. 
Company-operated REVPAR growth was nearly 30% in Asia Pacific and Latin America. North America company-operated REVPAR was up 12%. And Europe, despite its troubling headlines, was up 10% in local currency. Only Africa and the Middle East under-performed, thanks mostly to oversupply in the Emirates. Overall, worldwide-owned REVPAR jumped 16%, and margins expanded by 400 basis points. 
The big story behind our REVPAR growth is the rebound in business travel, which is 75% of our business. Revenues from global accounts and midweek occupancy are nearly back to 2008 levels. The sectors that are leading the charge are financials, consulting and tech. 
Group business played out well in the second quarter also, with surging booking in the quarter for the quarter. For the first time in two years, total group business on the books is in positive territory. I should also add that booking windows remain quite short, often only four to five months out. So we expect additional pickup for 2011 during this year. Overall, new leads were up 20% and rates for 2010 bookings were up 16%. 
The rebound in business travel bodes well for corporate rate negotiations this fall. After two years of declines, industry-wide occupancies have now reached levels where rates tend to rise. North American property saw occupancy above 71% in the quarter, with midweek levels in June for New York, Boston and Chicago over 90%. So it's not a surprise that ADRs are up roughly 5% in North America for June and July. And in London, June midweek occupancies were 98%, with Paris and Rome at 92%. 
Throughout 2009, we talked about our commitment to contain costs as we moved into the up-cycle. Our efforts are paying off as margins increased 400 basis points in the quarter. Around the world, our 145,000 associates did a great job of maintaining a lean structure. And at the same time, we were able to deliver record guest satisfaction scores even as hotels continue to fill. This success speaks well to our efforts at communication, branded service culture training and succession planning. We're proud to say that Starwood is a great place to work and build a career. 
Our corporate SG&A was up in the quarter, but importantly, net of some lumpiness around incentive compensation, our SG&A spending run rate is actually below last year. Remember last year at this time, we were in declining EBITDA so we lowered accruals. While this year's results have exceeded expectations, those accruals have gone up. Over time, the real driver of cost is headcount, which is flat in the quarter and will remain flat through 2011. Rest assured, we'll keep a tight control on our overhead costs. 
So in many ways, our call today continues the themes from last quarter. Top line growth was stronger than expected, cost controls resulted in higher margins and so far, we aren't seeing any change in our outlook for the back half of the year, emphasis on the so far. The global economy remains volatile and unpredictable. If, for example, the European sovereign debt scare that began in May were to derail the recovery, it would not be until later this fall that it would hit our business. Again, so far, we've not seen anything. So our new outlook does not anticipate a major slowdown and is set at 7% to 9% for worldwide system-wide REVPAR growth in 2010. In a few minutes, Vasant will share greater detail on trends by region and our 2010 baseline scenario. 
So with that as a backdrop, let me move to my second topic, why Starwood is well positioned to own the upswing. Specifically, I want to highlight three reasons why we outperformed our competitors and why we believe this will continue. 
First of all, having high-end brands and properties means we under-perform during down periods like 2009. Conversely, we also outperform in up-cycles. This is good news, not only now but also over time as there tend to be more up-years than down-years. 
Second, our footprint takes us to parts of the world that are likely to grow faster for some time to come. With 52% of our hotels located outside of the U.S., Starwood is not a U.S. company with some assets overseas. Today, we are a global company that happens to be based in New York. Our global presence has fueled a pipeline of 85,000 rooms, representing 28% unit growth, and 80% of our new hotels were opened outside of the U.S., with valuable 20-plus year management incentive based contracts. 
Third, our portfolio of hotels is not only the strongest in the company's history, it keeps getting better. From 2007 through the end of this year, we will have added 320 new hotels. In addition, we've also renovated 350 properties with our owners. That means that 2/3 of our hotels are now new or as good as new. 
So now I'd like to turn to my third topic; how we'll maximize the value of our own portfolio as we become asset light. Our experience in 2009 proved once again how the fee-based model can reduce volatility. Our own profits were down over 50% while our fee revenues fell only 12%. Now in the near term, that volatility actually has a positive flipside. To quote Vasant in the last quarter's call, ""our own earnings are like a coiled spring"". You saw some of that earnings growth potential this quarter with owned EBITDA up 40%. So while our goal is to have over 80% of our EBITDA driven by fees, we'll be patient balancing earnings growth, time value of money and the right prices. 
To gain insight into our thought process, I thought it might be useful to take a look at what we did during the last cycle. Let's start with the sale to host our largest transaction. It demonstrated how we can structure a win-win deal for both sides. We sold 33 hotels to host in early 2006 including 16 Sheratons and 12 Westins. The multiple was over 15x mid-cycle 2005 EBITDA. With 40-year contracts, we joined hands with a terrific owner whose long-term plans aligned with ours and who's balance sheet is one of the best in the industry. Host invests in our brands, as we could see from last year's $55 million renovation of the Sheraton Boston and the $100 million planned renovation for the Sheraton New York. They also recently announced acquisitions of a Westin and a W. 
Investors often ask if we would split out a rate, and the answer is yes, but only under the right circumstances. In 2006, the spin-off would have been an untested entity likely to trade at a discount to host. Also host had the corporate overhead in place to absorb these assets. And finally, the host transaction was extremely tax efficient. 
I should also mention that in the prior cycles, Starwood also made some large one-off sales such as the Westin Philadelphia, St. Regis, D.C., Turnberry Resort and Venetian Hotels. These hotels traded at roughly $400,000 a key. 
Today, we see a transaction market that's down almost 90% from its peak. But after nearly two years, we're seeing a real uptick in interested parties with access to capital. For example, there are potential buyers from markets outside of the U.S. such as sovereign wealth funds, high net worth individuals and real estate companies. Inside the U.S., REITs, blind pools and new private equity funds are coming to life. This money is on the sidelines and is increase in the year to get work. 
As you may know, ground is being broken on few new hotels. Financing is difficult to find and it's cheaper to buy a hotel than to build a new one. This means that room rates and the financial results of existing hotels should rise for some time to come. Accordingly, we value our hotels not based on earnings today but on the present value of their earnings two to three years from now. In other words, we remain committed to the asset light model for us but we have adjusted our expectations on timing and not on pricing. In the meantime, we expect to enjoy strong growth in profits from our owned assets. 
In that context, let me share some statistics on our owned portfolio. As of today, we own or lease 62 hotels with over 21,000 rooms. About 90% of those rooms are in urban locations in markets and resort markets where it's difficult to build new hotels. Roughly 55% of our own EBITDA was generated outside of the United States. Of these 21,000 rooms, almost 18,000 are wholly owned. I'll share some more details on these properties in just a moment. Just under 2,500 rooms at leased, including the brand new W Barcelona, W Times Square, Sheraton Park Lane in London and Sheraton Charles de Gaulle in Paris. These remaining leased properties are detailed in our property list. And there's one unbranded hotel in the list where we own a majority stake and that's the 941-room Boston Park Plaza. 
So let's take a look at the 18,000 rooms that are 100% owned. The first classification we use internally is what we would describe as high-value hotels that have no major capital needs. We could sell them on short notice or continue to own them and enjoy the rebound in earnings. Examples include the Phoenician, Sheraton on the Park in Sydney and St. Regis, San Francisco. We estimate that 60% of our owned rooms fit in this category. 
The second category, about 25,000 owned rooms, includes high value hotels also in great hard-to-replicate markets but that need renovation. These are assets that we'd either sell with a committed property improvement plan or that we would hold and renovate ourselves. Examples would include the St. Regis, Aspen and the Grand in Florence. 
The third classification of our owned hotels is what we call the transaction with partner bucket. This includes a few large box hotels with upside potential, but that need strategic repositioning or a large-scale renovation. We'd like to work with a partner to manage the complexity and capital needs of these projects. About 15% of our rooms are in this category, including the recently [ph] defied (21:34) Sheraton Manhattan and the Westin Peachtree. 
In addition to the wholly-owned hotels, we also have 28 unconsolidated joint ventures that represent 3,000 additional rooms with an average share of 33%. These JV hotels are located in gateway cities including Hong Kong, Tokyo, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, San Diego, Montréal, Seattle and New Orleans. With our minority positions, the timing and sale of these assets is a little trickier for us to control. 
So before I move to my fourth topic, and while I'm talking about their balance sheet value, I wanted to touch on two more potential sources of cash: Starwood vacation ownership and Bal Harbour. As you may recall, our SVO team took early action to generate cash from timeshare by working through the existing inventory on our balance sheet. Between 2009 and 2010, we generated $525 million in cash from the business and we expect an even greater amount over the next three to four years. And Bal Harbour is on track to open by 2012, providing another inflow of cash as we close on the residential sales. 
As we move towards a largely fee-driven business, it's important for us to reflect on how we create value for our owners. This is my fourth topic for today and I'll touch on a few ways we do this in the context of the five essentials of the journey, our strategic touchstone. Under our first essential, win with talent, we created an aligned corporate team over the last three years. This team supports our regional divisions as they recruit, retain, develop and challenge local smart teams. Their job is to deliver culturally relevant on-brand experiences for our guests around the world. Together, we've been able to increase associate engagement and effectiveness despite tough times. 
Under our second essential, execute brilliantly, we achieved some dramatic cost-savings over the past 18 months. But our work is not finished as we continue to find ways to improve efficiency at our hotels. Through our lean hotel operations and procurement efforts, we intend to offset 1/2 of the inflationary growth. This includes maintaining flat headcount into the cycle. Thus far, we've sustained our guest satisfaction scores despite a 10 percentage point increase in occupancies. We've also expanded the coverage and sophistication of our revenue management systems, realizing [ph] lists (23:53) of 2% or more were implemented. Our sales reorganization is now complete in four markets, and we'll be rolling out six more by the end of the year. At the same time, we're strengthening our IT capabilities to better serve our customers. With our worldwide market share up over about 100 basis points this year, we couldn't be more pleased with how our team continues to execute on behalf of our owners. 
Under our third essential, build great brands, we've kept the hammer down on innovation. Whether it's the Link@Sheraton, the launch of a loft or the worldwide rollout of W. Our brand teams are also working with our properties to reduce costs by simplifying brand standards. And SPG'S latest Free Weekends promotion is on track to exceed last year's record. Today, SPG members account for 44% of our room nights, the highest in our history, providing a loyal occupancy base for owners. We also generate the majority of online bookings through our branded websites. 
And as I look at our brands, I'm delighted to share progress on the success thus far with the Sheraton re-launch. On top of the $6 billion already invested in the brand, we're looking forward to another $5 billion to be spent opening 60 new Sheratons. Worldwide, we're seeing Sheraton grow 150 basis points faster in top line than its competitive set, and even faster than that in North America. We continue to reach new highs in overall guest satisfaction, likelihood to return and likelihood to recommend. 
Turning to Le Méridien, we've added some terrific hotels in North America, including Philadelphia, Minneapolis and Cambridge. And as we introduce Le Méridien to North America, we're bringing Westin to points around the world. As mentioned on the last call, Westin is entering India with four openings and expanding in China with properties in Shenzhen, Tiangjin and Huangzhou. Even in ramp-up mode, many new Westins are already outperforming their concept. 
Before I move onto the next essential, let me add that our luxury brands are enjoying a great rebound with the REVPAR gains over 15% for the year. We have the largest base of luxury hotels in the world, with 120 properties and almost 27,000 rooms. The fact that this footprint continues to grow shows that developers see the value of these brands, which gets me to our fourth essential, deliver global growth. 
Our development teams are focused on the right partners, the right properties and right places. We're not afraid of walking away from a deal that's not with the right partner, if it's not for right our brands or if the contract terms aren't right. We'll soon have opened 320 hotels in just over four years and have a pipeline of 350 more. And don't forget, each new hotel creates more demand for our brands. 
Take our backyard, for example. New York City is one of the world's great urban hotel markets and a stronghold for Starwood. In the next year or so, roughly one in four new hotel rooms will carry the Starwood flag as our footprint grows by roughly 50%. This includes two new Sheratons in Brooklyn and Tribeca, the W Downtown, to more lofts in Brooklyn and Harlem, an Element in Times Square and the Four Points on Long Island. 
And now for our fifth and final essential, drive outstanding results. Starwood has executed well over the past decade. Looking ahead, we have an organization focused on a multi-year plan. This includes a relentless focus on driving industry-leading top line growth, margin expansion as well as net unit additions. This is geared towards creating great returns for our hotel owners and growing our fee business. Meanwhile, we can generate cash as we transition to an asset-light model. 
So to summarize my comments very briefly, we've had another great quarter, and we're well positioned to continue on that success even if the recovery moderates. Before I turn the call over to Vasant, I wanted also to let you know that we'll be holding an investor day at the St. Regis New York on December 8. So please mark your calendars and stay tuned for details. Vasant?"
341584,108747233,68523,"Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Frits, and good morning, everyone.

As Frits indicated, we had a strong quarter that exceeded expectations on multiple fronts. REVPAR growth and market share gains, cost control and margin improvement, hotel signings and openings and of course earnings. Over the next few minutes, I'll provide some color on the drivers of these results, current business trends and our outlook for the balance of the year. 
Asia continued its sharp recovery track. Local currency REVPAR was up 28%. China once again led the charge with growth of 46%. Rate was up 7% and occupancy was up 10 points. REVPAR growth was around 14% in India, Australia and the rest of Asia, more than offsetting weakness in Thailand, which was down 6% due to the political crisis. Even Japan, which has been sluggish to date, was up in the double digits driven by occupancy gains. This recovery trend continues into July but comparisons get a lot tougher. Between Q2 and Q3 2009, REVPAR at company-operated hotels in Asia improved by 800 basis points and by another 1,200 basis points between Q3 and Q4. So despite the strong demand trends on the year-over-year basis, the rate of growth will slow down. 
We continue to see a healthy level of new development activity. Out of the 39 new deals we have signed in 2010, 18 were in Asia. And Asia continues to account for 60% of our 85,000-room pipeline. Of the 32 hotels we have opened worldwide this year, 10 were in Asia where we expect to open at least another 20 before year-end. As we have seen in Beijing post-Olympics and elsewhere in Asia, it does not take long for demand growth to absorb new supply. With well-established brands, the largest footprint and a strong local smart team, we remain very well positioned to capitalize on the huge opportunity in Asia. 
Our largest region, North America, was up a solid 13% at company-operated hotels, reminiscent of pre-crisis days. REVPAR growth accelerated during the quarter from 12.6% in April to 14.6% in June as rate turned positive in May and was up 5% in June. The shape of the recovery is similar to what we saw post 9/11. This time, the dip was deeper and the bounce back is stronger. Growth was especially strong in New York, Boston, Chicago and Toronto. Western cities, Seattle, San Diego and Phoenix did not recover as fast. Corporate travel is a primary driver of demand. As midweek occupancies rose into the high 70s, we were able to manage a mix of business to drive rate. For the quarter, occupancy at company-operated hotels was 74% with rate up 2%. Group room nights were up 16% with rate down 1.3%. Transient room nights were up 9% with rate up 5%. 
Another American-owned hotel portfolio with its major metro concentration and Ws, St. Regis, Westins and Sheratons was even stronger, up 21% in Q2. In June, our owned hotel REVPAR grew 27% with rate up 9.5%. The tone of business remains strong in North America as we enter Q3. Short-term booking trends, as well as conversations with customers about future plans, remained positive. In the year, net group production is running at 3x last year's depressed levels and leads continue to increase. Last year, we filled our hotels in July and August as best we could with lower-rated leisure business. This year, corporate transient demand is robust, and we will be reducing our least attractive leisure channels to manage average daily rate up. 
While Q3 business demand is strong, it is important to point out again that comparisons get a lot tougher. In 2009, REVPAR at company-operated hotels improved 700 basis points between Q2 and Q3, and by over 1,000 basis points between Q3 and Q4. As such, the year-over-year REVPAR growth will be lower in Q3 and Q4 than it was in Q2, even ph] if a huge (32:07) levels of REVPAR continue to rise. While occupancies approach peak levels, margins remain well below peak levels as do rates. With limited supply in the pipeline, the demand supply equation has tightened faster than we have seen in prior recoveries, and supply is likely to remain muted as long as rates and margins are at these levels. While raising rates is not something that delights customers, this is a business where rates are determined by the demand-supply balance in each market every night. We price our inventory using increasingly sophisticated revenue management systems to deliver a good return to our owners. As retail rates rise, corporate-negotiated rates, which have declined almost 20% since 2008, will need to rise too. 
In Europe, local currency REVPAR at company-operated hotels rose 10% with strong occupancies in London, Paris, Frankfurt and Vienna. ADR was flat. Our owned hotels were up 6.5%. Occupancies rose but rates were down. As in the U.S., major gateway cities expertise had mid-week occupancies in the 90s in June. Despite the problems in Spain, our new [ph] LEEDS (33:22) hotel, the W Barcelona is off to a great start. The trajectory of recovery is slower in Europe than in the U.S., and the weaker euro adds an additional headwind to reported numbers. 
As we enter Q3, we expect some benefit from the weaker euro at our owned hotels in Italy. However, the timing of Ramadan will hurt business originating from the Middle East. The euro was at 142 in Q3 last year versus 125 to 130 today, further impacting numbers as reported in dollars. 
While group business is solid in the back half, the primary driver of demand remains late-breaking transient business. Primarily due to excess supply in the Gulf, our business in Africa and the Middle East was flat in Q2, our weakest region. As we enter Q3, conditions will remain challenged in the Gulf, stronger in Egypt and the rest of Africa, but Ramadan will affect August. 
In Latin America, strong growth in the South and Mexican H1N1 impact last year resulted in REVPAR up 30%. Argentina grew 44% and Brazil 32%. In Mexico, business travel is recovering but results have been hit by drug-related crime concerns. These trends remain intact as we enter Q3. This quarter, we will lap the significant impact from H1N1 we saw in South America last year. 
On the hotel cost front, our multiple initiatives continue to pay off. At owned hotels worldwide, EBITDA margins were up 400 basis points, a healthy flow-through rate of around 50% despite deriving most of our REVPAR increases from occupancy gains. In North America, productivity was up 7%. At all company-operated hotels, worldwide operating profit margins were up 150 basis points. We remain focused on driving productivity and on our ongoing lean hotel operations and procurement initiatives. While it's tempting to add cost as revenues increase, our hotel GMs understand that margins are well below peak levels and a return to peak margins as fast as we can is job number one. This will, of course, require not just good cost control but also further recovery in REVPAR, especially rates. We expect the margin improvement trend to continue into the back half with operating margins increasing 100 to 150 basis points worldwide. 
On the SG&A front, we're holding the line on headcount additions. The only adds will be in areas like Asia, Africa and Brazil where we see significant growth opportunities. Versus Q2 of last year, our SG&A headcount is down 6% and is flat versus the last quarter. Our reported SG&A was up in Q2 due to year-over-year changes in incentive compensation accruals as Frits described. Last year, at this time, business trends were far worse than we expected, and we were reducing incentive compensation accruals. This year, trends are better than we expected, and we are adding to incentive compensation accruals. Adjusted for this, SG&A is flat year-over-year. This issue will persist into Q3. SG&A will be up again in the 10% to 12% range. We made deep and what we believe are sustainable cuts in SG&A last year and we remain determined to maintain them. 
In our Vacation Ownership business, which is our most consumer-dependent enterprise, the tone of business is best described as sluggish. Customer propensity to tour is lower, close rates are stable and pricing is lower due to our reductions as well as mix. In a tough environment, we did well to hold intervals sold roughly flat. With consumer confidence declining, we do not expect these trends to improve in the second half. 
At Starwood, we remain very optimistic about the long-term for all the reasons that Frits described. Our best-in-class brands and global footprint, a great pipeline, sharp recovery in owned hotel profits and significant cash generation from operations, asset sales, SVO and Bal Harbor. Over the next six to nine months, however, we think some caution is called for. A variety of leading indicators about the macro-economy have turned negative. Confidence is eroding, markets are volatile. We are, as you know, sensitive to corporate profit expectations and business confidence. If these trends persist, it is possible we will see some impact later this year. Booking windows are short and visibility is limited. That said, it is important to reiterate that there is no evidence of any slowdown at this point. 
Our outlook reflects the current trend and the fact that we lapped much tougher comparisons in the second half as described earlier. As such, we expect 8% to 10% local currency REVPAR growth in Q3 at company-operated hotels. Exchange rates will be a significant headwind reducing dollar reported REVPAR growth to 5% to 7%. The forex impact will remain a headwind in Q4 too. 
For the full year, we are raising constant dollar REVPAR growth to 7% to 9%, 200 basis points above our prior expectations, and 6% to 8% as reported in dollars. Our full year EBITDA expectations have also increased to a range of $815 million dollars to $845 million. 
Finally, a quick word on our balance sheet. We finished Q2 with net debt under $3 billion. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is now below 4x. We're working on the securitization of Vacation Ownership receivables. Market conditions are favorable and assuming they stay that way, we should get a deal done in Q3. We continue to expect our $200 million-plus tax refund this year. It is making good progress at this point through the internal processes of the IRS. As such, we expect to end the year with net debt of around $2.5 billion. We will have reduced debt by $1.5 billion over 18 months excluding FAS changes. With that, I'll turn this back to Jay."

The first part of your question was around flat headcount, and that does refer to what's happening at the corporate level and offices. And we do believe that first of all, as we said in the script just a moment ago, that spending rate overall is flat-to-down, that the change you're seeing is largely due to we're moving the incentive comp accrual in the opposite direction from a year ago for all the reasons you can appreciate. But then we do intend to keep headcount flat-to-down for our corporate and SG&A functions. At the property level, as we've described now for a while, we continue to work to roll out a lean hotel operations model. And we continue to look at ways to simplify the execution of our brand standards, focusing really on those things that make a difference and differentiate our brands. And we believe that in doing that, overall, we can hold our expenses to about half the inflation rate. We expect that if occupancy gets a lot higher, we clearly will have to add some variable headcount. But at this point, we're very much focused, at least at the management level of the property, to hold that flat. Vasant, perhaps you want to add something?"

Clearly, the revitalization program is paying off. And the way we can see that is looking at the performance of individual hotels before and after, and also the fact that the guest satisfaction scores and some of the subcomponents of those scores, as in people's appreciation for the physical aspect of the property and people's willingness to recommend and return, are all moving up in tandem with REVPAR. So there's clearly both correlation and causation going on there. We continue to see a build in our SPG occupancies around the promotions there, but we believe also because of our work to continue enrollment and retention of SPG members. The sales reorganization in those markets where that's been unfolded have also yielded considerable benefits, some of which went to Sheraton. And then finally, as we look at revenue management, and Vasant talked about the more sophisticated programs, and I mentioned an average 2% or better lift in properties there. It really was boils down to three things. Not just having the sophisticated systems, but also getting the hotels to use those systems more consistently. And in some cases, to use them as their primary way of doing business, which hasn't always been the case in the past. And the third piece is to train our associates to be able to do that. If you add up all those four things along with a number of other efforts, we're looking at a growth rate in REVPAR for Sheraton that's about 300 basis points faster than some competitive brands at a comparable place. And I think it's the confluence of all of those things. But primarily, the first one, the revitalization program because we're seeing that so much in tandem with that being rolled out right now. So thank you."

But we were lucky, I think, to find an owner that recognized the value and had the liquidity and confidence at a much darker time. Today, a lot of capital is starting to look at buying hotels. A lot of it's still on sideline as I mentioned. And yet, we think that in the next six to nine months that we'll continue to build and probably get a little bit more impatient. If we find the right transaction, the rest of this year, early next year, it's more likely to be a rightful shot deal where we find an owner in a situation that works out well for us. And as we were talking about in the script earlier as well, really balancing what we think that hotel will do over time. What an owner might be willing to put in, in terms of their own capital to renovate the property, and what the value of that money today is versus two or three years from now.

And so travel between emerging markets, which is something that hadn't been a major factor a few years ago. And then finally, you alluded to a bubble in occupancy. I actually think it's just a question of remembering how apoplectic and flat on its back the global economy was a year and a year and half ago. And a lot of what we're seeing now I think is just a restart of business activity. And inevitably, that business activity means more travel. As people start to focus, as many of you are on companies that are generating top line and not just continuing to develop earnings by reducing costs. And generating the top line, almost by definition means going out, making the sale, building relationships, holding meetings and having incentive trips. So we again feel that, that bodes well. So that even if we have a moderate recovery, I think business travel is on a trajectory that will continue to go up. And given the occupancy levels we've been talking about, it's a great story for rate. The other thing just to emphasize is because so few new hotels are being built at least in the U.S., we think it says a lot about what will happen to rate in the next two or three years. And then maybe just one final remark. The other thing that we see, and again I couldn't put a number on this for you, is the increasing outsourcing and relocating of workers both inside the United States and elsewhere. So as communication costs that have effectively gone to zero, people are working out of different places. And you might argue that means people would travel less but in fact, what we're seeing and we're hearing about from our customers is since someone who's a senior executive or a rising star is now based somewhere other than where they might logically be closer to their office, they're having to travel to visit that office in a way that they wouldn't have had before. So travel is definitely changing. I think travel intensity is staying at least as high as it was as a proportion to GDP. And I don't think this is a bubble. I think this is just a resurgence or a return to some level of normalcy."

We're happy to report that the economic recovery continued with the global GDP growth rising above 4%. This fueled lodging demand and drove our business in the second quarter. Occupancies",3059,"Thank you, Jay, and thanks, all, for joining us on our call today. We're happy to report that the economic recovery continued with the global GDP growth rising above 4%. This fueled lodging demand and drove our business in the second quarter. Occupancies continued to climb and rate increased for the first time since Q3 of 2008. At today's occupancy levels, we're confident that rates will sustain their rise through the year. And as each month passes, we're increasingly convinced that the great lodging depression of 2008 and 2009 is behind us. 
Nonetheless, we continue our scenario planning in the face of an uncertain economic picture. Our base case remains cautious about the near-term recovery, playing out somewhere between the new normal and the typical past recoveries. Longer-term, we continue to be bullish about getting more than our fair share of the huge secular growth in demand in emerging markets. 
So with that as a backdrop, I'd like to cover four topics today. First, a review of our second quarter results; second, an update on why Starwood is well positioned to own the upswing; and third, some background on our owned assets and our strategy for getting the most value as we move toward asset light; and fourth, a look at how we create value for our owner partners. 
So let me start with the first topic, some second quarter highlights. We were able to beat EBITDA expectations by $50 million and EPS by $0.10. For some time now, we've been talking about our leading global position, our strong brands and our skew towards luxury. And it was precisely these drivers that accounted for our strong top line results. 
Company-operated REVPAR growth was nearly 30% in Asia Pacific and Latin America. North America company-operated REVPAR was up 12%. And Europe, despite its troubling headlines, was up 10% in local currency. Only Africa and the Middle East under-performed, thanks mostly to oversupply in the Emirates. Overall, worldwide-owned REVPAR jumped 16%, and margins expanded by 400 basis points. 
The big story behind our REVPAR growth is the rebound in business travel, which is 75% of our business. Revenues from global accounts and midweek occupancy are nearly back to 2008 levels. The sectors that are leading the charge are financials, consulting and tech. 
Group business played out well in the second quarter also, with surging booking in the quarter for the quarter. For the first time in two years, total group business on the books is in positive territory. I should also add that booking windows remain quite short, often only four to five months out. So we expect additional pickup for 2011 during this year. Overall, new leads were up 20% and rates for 2010 bookings were up 16%. 
The rebound in business travel bodes well for corporate rate negotiations this fall. After two years of declines, industry-wide occupancies have now reached levels where rates tend to rise. North American property saw occupancy above 71% in the quarter, with midweek levels in June for New York, Boston and Chicago over 90%. So it's not a surprise that ADRs are up roughly 5% in North America for June and July. And in London, June midweek occupancies were 98%, with Paris and Rome at 92%. 
Throughout 2009, we talked about our commitment to contain costs as we moved into the up-cycle. Our efforts are paying off as margins increased 400 basis points in the quarter. Around the world, our 145,000 associates did a great job of maintaining a lean structure. And at the same time, we were able to deliver record guest satisfaction scores even as hotels continue to fill. This success speaks well to our efforts at communication, branded service culture training and succession planning. We're proud to say that Starwood is a great place to work and build a career. 
Our corporate SG&A was up in the quarter, but importantly, net of some lumpiness around incentive compensation, our SG&A spending run rate is actually below last year. Remember last year at this time, we were in declining EBITDA so we lowered accruals. While this year's results have exceeded expectations, those accruals have gone up. Over time, the real driver of cost is headcount, which is flat in the quarter and will remain flat through 2011. Rest assured, we'll keep a tight control on our overhead costs. 
So in many ways, our call today continues the themes from last quarter. Top line growth was stronger than expected, cost controls resulted in higher margins and so far, we aren't seeing any change in our outlook for the back half of the year, emphasis on the so far. The global economy remains volatile and unpredictable. If, for example, the European sovereign debt scare that began in May were to derail the recovery, it would not be until later this fall that it would hit our business. Again, so far, we've not seen anything. So our new outlook does not anticipate a major slowdown and is set at 7% to 9% for worldwide system-wide REVPAR growth in 2010. In a few minutes, Vasant will share greater detail on trends by region and our 2010 baseline scenario. 
So with that as a backdrop, let me move to my second topic, why Starwood is well positioned to own the upswing. Specifically, I want to highlight three reasons why we outperformed our competitors and why we believe this will continue. 
First of all, having high-end brands and properties means we under-perform during down periods like 2009. Conversely, we also outperform in up-cycles. This is good news, not only now but also over time as there tend to be more up-years than down-years. 
Second, our footprint takes us to parts of the world that are likely to grow faster for some time to come. With 52% of our hotels located outside of the U.S., Starwood is not a U.S. company with some assets overseas. Today, we are a global company that happens to be based in New York. Our global presence has fueled a pipeline of 85,000 rooms, representing 28% unit growth, and 80% of our new hotels were opened outside of the U.S., with valuable 20-plus year management incentive based contracts. 
Third, our portfolio of hotels is not only the strongest in the company's history, it keeps getting better. From 2007 through the end of this year, we will have added 320 new hotels. In addition, we've also renovated 350 properties with our owners. That means that 2/3 of our hotels are now new or as good as new. 
So now I'd like to turn to my third topic; how we'll maximize the value of our own portfolio as we become asset light. Our experience in 2009 proved once again how the fee-based model can reduce volatility. Our own profits were down over 50% while our fee revenues fell only 12%. Now in the near term, that volatility actually has a positive flipside. To quote Vasant in the last quarter's call, ""our own earnings are like a coiled spring"". You saw some of that earnings growth potential this quarter with owned EBITDA up 40%. So while our goal is to have over 80% of our EBITDA driven by fees, we'll be patient balancing earnings growth, time value of money and the right prices. 
To gain insight into our thought process, I thought it might be useful to take a look at what we did during the last cycle. Let's start with the sale to host our largest transaction. It demonstrated how we can structure a win-win deal for both sides. We sold 33 hotels to host in early 2006 including 16 Sheratons and 12 Westins. The multiple was over 15x mid-cycle 2005 EBITDA. With 40-year contracts, we joined hands with a terrific owner whose long-term plans aligned with ours and who's balance sheet is one of the best in the industry. Host invests in our brands, as we could see from last year's $55 million renovation of the Sheraton Boston and the $100 million planned renovation for the Sheraton New York. They also recently announced acquisitions of a Westin and a W. 
Investors often ask if we would split out a rate, and the answer is yes, but only under the right circumstances. In 2006, the spin-off would have been an untested entity likely to trade at a discount to host. Also host had the corporate overhead in place to absorb these assets. And finally, the host transaction was extremely tax efficient. 
I should also mention that in the prior cycles, Starwood also made some large one-off sales such as the Westin Philadelphia, St. Regis, D.C., Turnberry Resort and Venetian Hotels. These hotels traded at roughly $400,000 a key. 
Today, we see a transaction market that's down almost 90% from its peak. But after nearly two years, we're seeing a real uptick in interested parties with access to capital. For example, there are potential buyers from markets outside of the U.S. such as sovereign wealth funds, high net worth individuals and real estate companies. Inside the U.S., REITs, blind pools and new private equity funds are coming to life. This money is on the sidelines and is increase in the year to get work. 
As you may know, ground is being broken on few new hotels. Financing is difficult to find and it's cheaper to buy a hotel than to build a new one. This means that room rates and the financial results of existing hotels should rise for some time to come. Accordingly, we value our hotels not based on earnings today but on the present value of their earnings two to three years from now. In other words, we remain committed to the asset light model for us but we have adjusted our expectations on timing and not on pricing. In the meantime, we expect to enjoy strong growth in profits from our owned assets. 
In that context, let me share some statistics on our owned portfolio. As of today, we own or lease 62 hotels with over 21,000 rooms. About 90% of those rooms are in urban locations in markets and resort markets where it's difficult to build new hotels. Roughly 55% of our own EBITDA was generated outside of the United States. Of these 21,000 rooms, almost 18,000 are wholly owned. I'll share some more details on these properties in just a moment. Just under 2,500 rooms are leased, including the brand new W Barcelona, W Times Square, Sheraton Park Lane in London and Sheraton Charles de Gaulle in Paris. These remaining leased properties are detailed in our property list. And there's one unbranded hotel in the list where we own a majority stake and that's the 941-room Boston Park Plaza. 
So let's take a look at the 18,000 rooms that are 100% owned. The first classification we use internally is what we would describe as high-value hotels that have no major capital needs. We could sell them on short notice or continue to own them and enjoy the rebound in earnings. Examples include the Phoenician; Sheraton on the Park in Sydney; and St. Regis, San Francisco. We estimate that 60% of our owned rooms fit in this category. 
The second category, about 25,000 owned rooms, includes high-value hotels also in great hard-to-replicate markets but that need renovation. These are assets that we'd either sell with a committed property improvement plan or that we would hold and renovate ourselves. Examples would include the St. Regis, Aspen and the Grand in Florence. 
The third classification of our owned hotels is what we call the transaction with partner bucket. This includes a few large box hotels with upside potential but that need strategic repositioning or a large-scale renovation. We'd like to work with a partner to manage the complexity and capital needs of these projects. About 15% of our rooms are in this category, including the recently defied [ph] (21:34) Sheraton Manhattan and the Westin Peachtree. 
In addition to the wholly owned hotels, we also have 28 unconsolidated joint ventures that represent 3,000 additional rooms with an average share of 33%. These JV hotels are located in gateway cities including Hong Kong, Tokyo, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Santiago, Montréal, Seattle and New Orleans. With our minority positions, the timing and sale of these assets is a little trickier for us to control. 
So before I move to my fourth topic, and while I'm talking about our balance sheet value, I wanted to touch on two more potential sources of cash: Starwood vacation ownership and Bal Harbour. As you may recall, our SVO team took early action to generate cash from timeshare by working through the existing inventory on our balance sheet. Between 2009 and 2010, we generated $525 million in cash from the business and we expect an even greater amount over the next three to four years. And Bal Harbour is on track to open by 2012, providing another inflow of cash as we close on the residential sales. 
As we move towards a largely fee-driven business, it's important for us to reflect on how we create value for our owners. This is my fourth topic for today and I'll touch on a few ways we do this in the context of the five essentials of the journey, our strategic touchstone. Under our first essential, win with talent, we created an aligned corporate team over the last three years. This team supports our regional divisions as they recruit, retain, develop and challenge local smart teams. Their job is to deliver culturally relevant on-brand experiences for our guests around the world. Together, we've been able to increase associate engagement and effectiveness despite tough times. 
Under our second essential, execute brilliantly, we achieved some dramatic cost-savings over the past 18 months. But our work is not finished as we continue to find ways to improve efficiency at our hotels. Through our lean hotel operations and procurement efforts, we intend to offset one half of the inflationary growth. This includes maintaining flat headcount into the cycle. Thus far, we've sustained our guest satisfaction scores despite a 10 percentage point increase in occupancies. We've also expanded the coverage and sophistication of our revenue management systems, realizing lifts of 2% or more were implemented. Our sales reorganization is now complete in four markets, and we'll be rolling out six more by the end of the year. At the same time, we're strengthening our IT capabilities to better serve our customers. With our worldwide market share up over about 100 basis points this year, we couldn't be more pleased with how our team continues to execute on behalf of our owners. 
Under our third essential, build great brands, we've kept the hammer down on innovation, whether it's the Link@Sheraton, the launch of a loft or the worldwide rollout of W. Our brand teams are also working with our properties to reduce costs by simplifying brand standards. And SPG'S latest Free Weekends promotion is on track to exceed last year's record. Today, SPG members account for 44% of our room nights, the highest in our history, providing a loyal occupancy base for owners. We also generate the majority of our online bookings through our branded websites. 
And as I look at our brands, I'm delighted to share progress on the success thus far with the Sheraton re-launch. On top of the $6 billion already invested in the brand, we're looking forward to another $5 billion to be spent opening 60 new Sheratons. Worldwide, we're seeing Sheraton grow 150 basis points faster in top line than its competitive set, and even faster than that in North America. We continue to reach new highs in overall guest satisfaction, likelihood to return and likelihood to recommend. 
Turning to Le Méridien, we've added some terrific hotels in North America, including Philadelphia, Minneapolis and Cambridge. And as we introduce Le Méridien to North America, we're bringing Westin to points around the world. As mentioned on the last call, Westin is entering India with four openings and expanding in China with properties in Shenzhen, Tiangjin and Huangzhou. Even in ramp-up mode, many new Westins are already outperforming their concept. 
Before I move onto the next essential, let me add that our luxury brands are enjoying a great rebound with the REVPAR gains over 15% for the year. We have the largest base of luxury hotels in the world, with 120 properties and almost 27,000 rooms. The fact that this footprint continues to grow shows that developers see the value of these brands, which gets me to our fourth essential, deliver global growth. 
Our development teams are focused on the right partners, the right properties and right places. We're not afraid of walking away from a deal that's not with the right partner, if it's not for right our brands or if the contract terms aren't right. We'll soon have opened 320 hotels in just over four years and have a pipeline of 350 more. And don't forget, each new hotel creates more demand for our brands. 
Take our backyard, for example. New York City is one of the world's great urban hotel markets and a stronghold for Starwood. In the next year or so, roughly one in four new hotel rooms will carry the Starwood flag as our footprint grows by roughly 50%. This includes two new Sheratons in Brooklyn and Tribeca, the W Downtown, to more lofts in Brooklyn and Harlem, an Element in Times Square and the Four Points on Long Island. 
And now for our fifth and final essential, drive outstanding results. Starwood has executed well over the past decade. Looking ahead, we have an organization focused on a multi-year plan. This includes a relentless focus on driving industry-leading top line growth, margin expansion as well as net unit additions. This is geared towards creating great returns for our hotel owners and growing our fee business. Meanwhile, we can generate cash as we transition to an asset-light model. 
So to summarize my comments very briefly, we've had another great quarter, and we're well positioned to continue on that success even if the recovery moderates. Before I turn the call over to Vasant, I wanted also to let you know that we'll be holding an investor day at the St. Regis New York on December 8. So please mark your calendars and stay tuned for details. Vasant?"

As Frits indicated, we had a strong quarter that exceeded expectations on multiple fronts. REVPAR growth and market share gains, cost control and margin improvement, hotel signings and openings and of course earnings. Over the next few minutes, I'll provide some color on the drivers of these results, current business trends and our outlook for the balance of the year. 
Asia continued its sharp recovery track. Local currency REVPAR was up 28%. China once again led the charge with growth of 46%. Rate was up 7% and occupancy was up 10 points. REVPAR growth was around 14% in India, Australia and the rest of Asia, more than offsetting weakness in Thailand, which was down 6% due to the political crisis. Even Japan, which has been sluggish to date, was up in the double digits driven by occupancy gains. This recovery trend continues into July but comparisons get a lot tougher. Between Q2 and Q3 2009, REVPAR at company-operated hotels in Asia improved by 800 basis points and by another 1,200 basis points between Q3 and Q4. So despite the strong demand trends on the year-over-year basis, the rate of growth will slow down. 
We continue to see a healthy level of new development activity. Out of the 39 new deals we have signed in 2010, 18 were in Asia. And Asia continues to account for 60% of our 85,000-room pipeline. Of the 32 hotels we have opened worldwide this year, 10 were in Asia where we expect to open at least another 20 before year-end. As we have seen in Beijing post-Olympics and elsewhere in Asia, it does not take long for demand growth to absorb new supply. With well-established brands, the largest footprint and a strong local smart team, we remain very well positioned to capitalize on the huge opportunity in Asia. 
Our largest region, North America, was up a solid 13% at company-operated hotels, reminiscent of pre-crisis days. REVPAR growth accelerated during the quarter from 12.6% in April to 14.6% in June as rate turned positive in May and was up 5% in June. The shape of the recovery is similar to what we saw post 9/11. This time, the dip was deeper and the bounce back is stronger. Growth was especially strong in New York, Boston, Chicago and Toronto. Western cities, Seattle, San Diego and Phoenix did not recover as fast. Corporate travel is a primary driver of demand. As midweek occupancies rose into the high 70s, we were able to manage a mix of business to drive rate. For the quarter, occupancy at company-operated hotels was 74% with rate up 2%. Group room nights were up 16% with rate down 1.3%. Transient room nights were up 9% with rate up 5%. 
Another American-owned hotel portfolio with its major metro concentration and Ws, St. Regis, Westins and Sheratons was even stronger, up 21% in Q2. In June, our owned hotel REVPAR grew 27% with rate up 9.5%. The tone of business remains strong in North America as we enter Q3. Short-term booking trends, as well as conversations with customers about future plans, remained positive. In the year, net group production is running at 3x last year's depressed levels and leads continue to increase. Last year, we filled our hotels in July and August as best we could with lower-rated leisure business. This year, corporate transient demand is robust, and we will be reducing our least attractive leisure channels to manage average daily rate up. 
While Q3 business demand is strong, it is important to point out again that comparisons get a lot tougher. In 2009, REVPAR at company-operated hotels improved 700 basis points between Q2 and Q3 and by over 1,000 basis points between Q3 and Q4. As such, the year-over-year REVPAR growth will be lower in Q3 and Q4 than it was in Q2, even if our huge [ph] (32:07) levels of REVPAR continue to rise. While occupancies approach peak levels, margins remain well below peak levels as do rates. With limited supply in the pipeline, the demand supply equation has tightened faster than we have seen in prior recoveries, and supply is likely to remain muted as long as rates and margins are at these levels. While raising rates is not something that delights customers, this is a business where rates are determined by the demand-supply balance in each market every night. We price our inventory using increasingly sophisticated revenue management systems to deliver a good return to our owners. As retail rates rise, corporate-negotiated rates, which have declined almost 20% since 2008, will need to rise too. 
In Europe, local currency REVPAR at company-operated hotels rose 10% with strong occupancies in London, Paris, Frankfurt and Vienna. ADR was flat. Our owned hotels were up 6.5%. Occupancies rose but rates were down. As in the U.S., major gateway cities had mid-week occupancies in the 90s in June. Despite the problems in Spain, our new LEEDS [ph] (33:22) hotel, the W Barcelona is off to a great start. The trajectory of recovery is slower in Europe than in the U.S., and the weaker euro adds an additional headwind to reported numbers. 
As we enter Q3, we expect some benefit from the weaker euro at our owned hotels in Italy. However, the timing of Ramadan will hurt business originating from the Middle East. The euro was at 142 in Q3 last year versus 125 to 130 today, further impacting numbers as reported in dollars. 
While group business is solid in the back half, the primary driver of demand remains late-breaking transient business. Primarily due to excess supply in the Gulf, our business in Africa and the Middle East was flat in Q2, our weakest region. As we enter Q3, conditions will remain challenged in the Gulf, stronger in Egypt and the rest of Africa, but Ramadan will affect August. 
In Latin America, strong growth in the South and Mexican H1N1 impact last year resulted in REVPAR up 30%. Argentina grew 44% and Brazil 32%. In Mexico, business travel is recovering but results have been hit by drug-related crime concerns. These trends remain intact as we enter Q3. This quarter, we will lap the significant impact from H1N1 we saw in South America last year. 
On the hotel cost front, our multiple initiatives continue to pay off. At owned hotels worldwide, EBITDA margins were up 400 basis points, a healthy flow-through rate of around 50% despite deriving most of our REVPAR increases from occupancy gains. In North America, productivity was up 7%. At all company-operated hotels, worldwide operating profit margins were up 150 basis points. We remain focused on driving productivity and on our ongoing lean hotel operations and procurement initiatives. While it's tempting to add cost as revenues increase, our hotel GMs understand that margins are well below peak levels and a return to peak margins as fast as we can is job number one. This will, of course, require not just good cost control but also further recovery in REVPAR, especially rates. We expect the margin improvement trend to continue into the back half with operating margins increasing 100 to 150 basis points worldwide. 
On the SG&A front, we're holding the line on headcount additions. The only adds will be in areas like Asia, Africa and Brazil where we see significant growth opportunities. Versus Q2 of last year, our SG&A headcount is down 6% and is flat versus the last quarter. Our reported SG&A was up in Q2 due to year-over-year changes in incentive compensation accruals as Frits described. Last year, at this time, business trends were far worse than we expected, and we were reducing incentive compensation accruals. This year, trends are better than we expected, and we are adding to incentive compensation accruals. Adjusted for this, SG&A is flat year-over-year. This issue will persist into Q3. SG&A will be up again in the 10% to 12% range. We made deep and what we believe are sustainable cuts in SG&A last year and we remain determined to maintain them. 
In our Vacation Ownership business, which is our most consumer-dependent enterprise, the tone of business is best described as sluggish. Customer propensity to tour is lower, close rates are stable and pricing is lower due to our reductions as well as mix. In a tough environment, we did well to hold intervals sold roughly flat. With consumer confidence declining, we do not expect these trends to improve in the second half. 
At Starwood, we remain very optimistic about the long-term for all the reasons that Frits described. Our best-in-class brands and global footprint, a great pipeline, sharp recovery in owned hotel profits and significant cash generation from operations, asset sales, SVO and Bal Harbor. Over the next six to nine months, however, we think some caution is called for. A variety of leading indicators about the macro-economy have turned negative. Confidence is eroding, markets are volatile. We are, as you know, sensitive to corporate profit expectations and business confidence. If these trends persist, it is possible we will see some impact later this year. Booking windows are short and visibility is limited. That said, it is important to reiterate that there is no evidence of any slowdown at this point. 
Our outlook reflects the current trend and the fact that we lapped much tougher comparisons in the second half as described earlier. As such, we expect 8% to 10% local currency REVPAR growth in Q3 at company-operated hotels. Exchange rates will be a significant headwind reducing dollar reported REVPAR growth to 5% to 7%. The forex impact will remain a headwind in Q4 too. 
For the full year, we are raising constant dollar REVPAR growth to 7% to 9%, 200 basis points above our prior expectations, and 6% to 8% as reported in dollars. Our full year EBITDA expectations have also increased to a range of $815 million dollars to $845 million. 
Finally, a quick word on our balance sheet. We finished Q2 with net debt under $3 billion. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is now below 4x. We're working on the securitization of Vacation Ownership receivables. Market conditions are favorable and assuming they stay that way, we should get a deal done in Q3. We continue to expect our $200 million-plus tax refund this year. It is making good progress at this point through the internal processes of the IRS. As such, we expect to end the year with net debt of around $2.5 billion. We will have reduced debt by $1.5 billion over 18 months excluding FAS changes. With that, I'll turn this back to Jay."

You mentioned the pipeline and I think that's important. So a very high percentage of the 300 rooms in our pipeline come from Asia Pacific. I believe it's over half now, it's about 60%. The second thing you have to be able to have insight into was what the growth will be in REVPAR. And what we're seeing now is a bounce back in REVPAR to levels that are getting close to pre-crisis. So looking farther ahead, it's unclear exactly what that pace will be but that certainly would be another piece. In either case, we also have growing incentive fees as we continue to build the profitability of those hotels and as that REVPAR rebounds. And then finally, there's the currency effect, and greater minds and powers than ours are talking about China and what will happen with renminbi over time, but given the size of Fee business and the number of hotels we're adding, were there to be appreciation in the yuan, that would add to it as well. So those are the things that I would be putting in if I wasn't model out what that percentage is over time."

And the beginning of your question was slightly cut off. So let me try to fill in the blank a little bit. The first part of your question was around flat headcount, and that does refer to what's happening at the corporate level and offices. And we do believe that first of all, as we said in the script just a moment ago, that spending rate overall is flat-to-down, that the change you're seeing is largely due to we're moving the incentive comp accrual in the opposite direction from a year ago for all the reasons you can appreciate. But then we do intend to keep headcount flat-to-down for our corporate and SG&A functions. At the property level, as we've described now for a while, we continue to work to roll out a lean hotel operations model. And we continue to look at ways to simplify the execution of our brand standards, focusing really on those things that make a difference and differentiate our brands. And we believe that in doing that, overall, we can hold our expenses to about half the inflation rate. We expect that if occupancy gets a lot higher, we clearly will have to add some variable headcount. But at this point, we're very much focused, at least at the management level of the property, to hold that flat. Vasant, perhaps you want to add something?"

Clearly, the revitalization program is paying off. And the way we can see that is looking at the performance of individual hotels before and after, and also the fact that the guest satisfaction scores and some of the subcomponents of those scores, as in people's appreciation for the physical aspect of the property and people's willingness to recommend and return, are all moving up in tandem with REVPAR. So there's clearly both correlation and causation going on there. We continue to see a build in our SPG occupancies around the promotions there, but we believe also because of our work to continue enrollment and retention of SPG members. The sales reorganization in those markets where that's been unfolded have also yielded considerable benefits, some of which went to Sheraton. And then finally, as we look at revenue management, and Vasant talked about the more sophisticated programs, and I mentioned an average 2% or better lift in properties there, it really boils down to three things: Not just having the sophisticated systems, but also getting the hotels to use those systems more consistently, and in some cases, to use them as their primary way of doing business, which hasn't always been the case in the past. And the third piece is to train our associates to be able to do that. If you add up all those four things along with a number of other efforts, we're looking at a growth rate in REVPAR for Sheraton that's about 300 basis points faster than some competitive brands at a comparable place. And I think it's the confluence of all of those things. But primarily, the first one, the revitalization program, because we're seeing that so much in tandem with that being rolled out right now. So thank you."

But we were lucky, I think, to find an owner that recognized the value and had the liquidity and confidence at a much darker time. Today, a lot of capital is starting to look at buying hotels. Lot of it's still on sideline as I mentioned. And yet, we think that in the next six to nine months that we'll continue to build and probably get a little bit more impatient. If we find the right transaction, the rest of this year, early next year, it's more likely to be a rightful shot deal where we find an owner in a situation that works out well for us. And as we were talking about in the script earlier as well, really balancing what we think that hotel will do over time; what an owner might be willing to put in, in terms of their own capital to renovate the property; and what the value of that money today is versus two or three years from now.

And so those would be some of the ways we do that. But we recognize that as we make a transformation from -- and I should add one more, we made an acquisition of Le Méridien. So there's a variety of things that we could do and what we do will depend on when cash comes in and which of those alternatives makes the most sense for our shareholders based on our view of the world at that time. But what is absolutely clear is that between the monetization of a large part of our Vacation Ownership business, between the closure and sale of the residences at the St. Regis Bal Harbour, as well as obviously asset sales over time, we'll come into a lot of cash at the same time that we transform ourselves to a business model, that doesn't require a lot. So we will definitely have that problem. It's not just a conceptual one or I should say probably that's a luxury problem to have. We'll have that opportunity. And when the time comes, as I say, we'll look at makes the most sense for our shareholders."

But what we continue to see -- first of all I think one of the things that's encouraging is the sectors that are growing, whether it's tech or banking or consulting, financials are the kinds of businesses that are more leading indicators than lagging was. What we also find in talking to our key accounts is one of the things that they're stressing is the continued globalization of their businesses. And one of the things that we're able to do with them is talk to them about the fact that our brands are so well distributed around the world. And so if anything, what we're seeing is a change in travel patterns, meaning more global travel around the world. We're also seeing more travel across markets. One of the things that's been very interesting for us to watch is the incredible amount of investment from China into Africa. And undoubtedly, what happens when you put a few hundred billion dollars into a market buying companies, you start to look at what you bought and how you can manage it, which means more travel. And so travel between emerging markets, which is something that hadn't been a major factor a few years ago. And then finally, you alluded to a bubble in occupancy. I actually think it's just a question of remembering how apoplectic and flat on its back the global economy was a year and a year and half ago. And a lot of what we're seeing now I think is just a restart of business activity. And inevitably, that business activity means more travel. As people start to focus, as many of you are on companies that are generating top line and not just continuing to develop earnings by reducing costs. And generating the top line, almost by definition means going out, making the sale, building relationships, holding meetings and having incentive trips. So we again feel that, that bodes well. So that even if we have a moderate recovery, I think business travel is on a trajectory that will continue to go up. And given the occupancy levels we've been talking about, it's a great story for rate. The other thing just to emphasize is because so few new hotels are being built at least in the U.S., we think it says a lot about what will happen to rate in the next two or three years. And then maybe just one final remark. The other thing that we see, and again I couldn't put a number on this for you, is the increasing outsourcing and relocating of workers both inside the United States and elsewhere. So as communication costs that have effectively gone to zero, people are working out of different places. And you might argue that means people would travel less but in fact, what we're seeing and we're hearing about from our customers is since someone who's a senior executive or a rising star is now based somewhere other than where they might logically be closer to their office, they're having to travel to visit that office in a way that they wouldn't have had before. So travel is definitely changing. I think travel intensity is staying at least as high as it was as a proportion to GDP. And I don't think this is a bubble. I think this is just a resurgence or a return to some level of normalcy."

Greetings from Beijing. We're here for a leadership meeting with our top 100 executives from around the world. A lot of companies are looking to Asia and other emerging markets for future",1258,"Thanks, Jay, and thank you, all, for joining us on our call today. Greetings from Beijing. We're here for a leadership meeting with our top 100 executives from around the world. A lot of companies are looking to Asia and other emerging markets for future growth. For us, that growth is a reality today. Asia-Pacific generates 21% of our fee revenues, and the region represents 62% of our pipeline for future hotel openings. In fact, markets outside the developed economies of Europe, Japan, the U.S. and Canada account for 34% of our fees and 80% of our pipeline. Today, our U.S. portfolio of 458 hotels is roughly seven times the size of the number of hotels we have in China. But it's not far-fetched to say that China will one day eclipse the U.S. as Starwood's largest country, no more far-fetched than to imagine that both China's car market and China's number of Internet users would exceed the U.S., which they already do. That means we have many more hotels to open here.
Across our companies, we witness on a daily basis how the economic balance of power is shifting from the developed world to rapidly growing economies. While China is the largest of these markets, the growth and prosperity is pervasive around the world as the crisis recedes. Tourism industry market has increased 100% over last year. Morocco has seen a fivefold increase in inbound visitors over the last decade, and Panama has become a financial center for South America. For sometime now, we've acted not as a U.S. company with outposts in a hundred countries but as a global company that happens to be based in the world city of New York. Now more than ever, we're reaping the rewards of our global footprint, our ability to be local around the world and our long-standing relationships with guests and owners. This is something you cannot buy. You can only earn it over decades.
With that in mind, I'm delighted to take advantage of our leaders being assembled here in the Westin Beijing Financial Street. I'll be introducing you to the four division presidents who lead our businesses around the world. Then Matt Avril, President of our Hotel Group, will share his global perspective on our efforts to bring each hotel back to and beyond pre-crisis profitability, something we're calling past the peak. I'll wrap up by sharing my thoughts on 2011 and then hand the call over to Vasant, who will give more color on our financial results and outlook. Vasant will also share some observations on our efforts to accelerate our growth in India. But first, I want to tell you about the third quarter. We said we would only upswing and we have. We gained share, growing faster than our competition and converted higher revenue into higher profits. The headline is that lodging recovery continues, unabated by the euro crisis, U.S. economic jitters on Malaysia and Japan. With occupancy rising at or above 2007 levels, it's no surprise that rates are on positive territory across each of our regions. Both business and leisure travel continued to show strength in the quarter. The great recession was remarkable in both its harrowing drop on the way the down and on its reliance on emerging markets on the way up. Nonetheless, the lodging recovery is following similar patterns to prior cycles. The strength of gateway cities are spreading to secondary markets. Luxury, thought to be dead by some, is alive and growing. These factors enabled us to beat the high end of our EBITDA guidance by $10 million and EPS by $0.06. International company operated REVPAR grew by 13% compared with 10% in North America. Worldwide owned hotels experienced a 12% increase in REVPAR, with hotels outside of North America again outperforming.
As you know, we're in the early stages of corporate renegotiations. But so far, we like what we see. Corporate buyers know that occupancy levels have already risen towards the prior peaks, especially in the gateway cities where their associates need to stay. Indeed, customers are hearing stories about not being able to find a room regardless of price. Great expectations, therefore, adjusting to this new reality. In light of how far rates have fallen since 2008, we have a long way to go up. In fact, we've been working to change the mix of our business all year. So even though a large percentage of our room rates in 2010 were locked in at tight decreases, we were able to drive our company operated rates up by almost 5% in the third quarter through aggressive yield management.
Trends in group business also remained robust, particularly in the quarter for the quarter bookings. In September, for example, bookings for 2010 were up 19%. As we've enter the back half of 2010, 2011 bookings are picking up nicely. Again, looking at September bookings, revenues for 2011 jumped almost 30%, driven by room night volumes up 22% and rates up 7%. 2011 group pace has improved by almost 15 points over the last six months and is now flat. For comparison's sake, 2010 group pace at the same time last year was down 20% and is now up mid single digits. This makes us all confident that group volumes for 2011  could match 2008 with solid rate increases. This, by the way, also lays to rest any fears that technology or the downturn itself would permanently change group demand. As part of our past-the-peak efforts, we'll continue to focus on cost containment to drive margin improvement for the coming years. Our associates around the world are delivering on this promise with company operated margins up 140 basis points in the quarter. At the same time, our business is all about building brands through great experiences. So despite our focus on cost and despite hotels that are once again full, we're proud to reported that guest satisfaction scores remain at record highs. This is translating into sustained increases in REVPAR index. We now expect full year worldwide share gains of roughly 100 basis points with Sheraton leading the charge.
Our Vacation Ownership business also performed well in the quarter. We managed two of our levels to focus on the most profitable channels. Correspondingly, close rates are steadily improving. We also completed a securitization that underscores the dramatic turnaround in capital markets since the dark days of 2009. We garnered advance rates of 93% and interest rates under 4%, our best ever. As a result, we would generate about $225 million in cash from the Vacation Ownership business this year, and we expect the business to generate similar amounts of cash over each of the next three years. We're also keeping a tight lid on corporate cost. Headcount is flat over 2009 and will remain flat through 2011. So despite adding new hotels, we expect SG&A spend in 2011 to be similar to 2010 levels. Let me underscore the importance of this cost discipline. We removed $100 million in costs in a sustainable way. This translates into corporate margins for our fee business that will be higher in 2011 and peak 2007 levels, despite much lower REVPAR.
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Matt Avril and our division presidents who run our four regions around the world. This team has deep market knowledge and experience. At the same time, they all have tremendous appetite to grow and improve our operations. So please let me begin by introducing you to our host here in China, Miguel Ko."

As the Chairman and President of Starwood Asia-Pacific division, I'm seeing enormous changes in China since I first joined Sheraton in 1979 in internal audit. I was born in a small Chinese city called Shantou, near Guangzhou in Southern China. Although many of you may not have heard of Shantou, this secondary city now has a  population of 5 million people. That's more than inner city limits of Los Angeles or roughly equal to Chicago and Houston combined. Today, Shantou does not have one single international class hotel. This would change as we recently find a deal to build a beautiful new Sheraton there. In fact, Sheraton is often the first five-star international hotel brand to enter a secondary or tertiary city in China. With over 30 hotels now already opened and another 34 in the pipeline, the brand's growth is accelerating. Sheraton benefits from decades of great trend recognition amongst Chinese travelers. And Sheraton in Chinese is called [indiscernible], which is literal translation meaning happiness comes in. That resonates very well with the Chinese.
Our existing hotels are at the best level for future growth. They are a great way to inspire our current partners to start new projects and also to attract new partners. Our hotels are also the perfect training ground for a mix 86 hotels we expect to open over the coming years. Looking ahead, development in Asia-Pacific remains robust. This year, we already signed new contracts for more than 9,000 additional hotel rooms. Many investments focus on Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong when they think of China. But Starwood expects this growth will come from cities they have not heard off like Shantou. China has 171 cities with more than 1 million population. And we are working hard to enter these market as demand grows. In a rapidly transforming economy, supply and demand will bounce around. Take Beijing, for example, where we have six hotels today and two more under construction. In the month following the Summer Olympics in 2008, this city is suffering from oversupply, but year-to-date REVPAR in Beijing is now up 27%. So after almost two decades of double-digit economic growth, I'm very bullish about Starwood's future here.
Outside of U.S., China's already Starwood's largest country, with 60 hotels representing eight of our brands in our fastest growing SPG market as well. Looking ahead, we will open more hotels in China than anywhere else in the Starwood's system. In the third quarter, Asia-Pacific REVPAR grew 21% or 16% excluding the possible impact of appreciating Asian currencies. In China, I'm happy to report a healthy balance of rates and occupancy increases. REVPAR growth in China is up 33%, with Shanghai, driven by the World expo, leading the charge. Collectively, our year-to-date REVPAR index in China was 110, which speaks to the string of our hotel brands and experiences of our team operating the hotels. Most of our hotels are staffed with local Chinese managers. Chin Jing [ph] , Head of Operations, and Stephen [indiscernible] our development in China. I have worked with both of them for more than 20 years. With that, let me now turn the call over to Denise Coll, the President of our North American division."

The unit growth that Starwood's Asia-Pacific division is experiencing is truly amazing. But Starwood's other division, including North America, are well-positioned to capitalize in the outbound travel that will result from these rapidly growing economy and burdening middle classes. China is already one of the top 10 sources of inbound business to the U.S, and this is forecasted to double by 2014. Our global brand and heavy presence in key North American cities is driving even stronger growth to Starwood. For example, Chinese business at the Sheraton Toronto is up 50% year-on-year and some of our Hawaiian resorts, such as the Sheraton Waikiki and the Princess Kaiulani Hotel, saw an inbound Chinese travel growth by over 100%. Frits had said this before, but let me say it again. Think of the Japanese travel boom of 1980s and multiply by a factor of 10.
I started my career in operations with the Sheraton Boston in 1976 and has never forgotten the lessons that I've learned on the importance of delivering terrific guest experiences. After all, exceeding the expectations of guests, wherever they're from, is how Starwood delivers the REVPAR premiums that fuel our growth. Today, our guest satisfaction remains at record-high levels, just one of the reasons why our hotels are outperforming the competition. Occupancy levels have recovered nicely over the last year and are allowing us to push rates more aggressively as we actively manage the segmentation mix within our properties. As a result, REVPAR in our North America owned hotels jumped 11% despite tougher comparisons. ADR grew an impressive 8% and margins increased by 250 basis points. Company Operated REVPAR increased 10%, and we continue to gain share particularly with our incredibly successful Rediscover Sheraton campaign, the largest campaign in the brand's history.
Sheraton's momentum continues, enjoying year-to-date REVPAR index gain of almost 200 basis points over the competition. As we look forward, we have a unique opportunity to expand the breadth of our brands in North America. Our greatest opportunity maybe in the specialty select service space. Our Aloft, Element and Four Points of our Sheraton brand are some of the best in the industry. But with only 152 hotels in this segment today, our brands are under-penetrated relative to our competitors. From Upscale to Luxury, our distinctive and compelling brand portfolio, are equipped by a development team with an arsenal that can be used to fit the needs of our owners and partners. For example, my hometown, Boston, recently caught up to the Beijing hotel count, with the openings at the Le Méridien Cambridge and the W Boston. Both of these properties have brought authentic hotel experiences to the city that did not exist previously.
The real interesting story about North America, both now and over the next few years, will be rate growth. The decades  between 2001 and 2010 saw the slowest growth in road inventory since the Second World War. Given the capital constraint of the last few years, new supplies will remain limited in 2011 through 2014. As a result, we expect to see strong pricing power in the industry, particularly in the gateway cities where we have substantial Owned presence with over 13,000 rooms. With our focus on driving top line and strong flow-throughs through cost containment, we expect significant earnings growth in our Owned portfolio over the coming years. I'd now like to introduce Roeland Vos, the President of our Europe, Africa and Middle East division."

Regardless to all of you, thanks for listening. I began my career as a management trainee at the Sheraton Brussels in 1982 and since then have rotated through multiple positions within Europe as well as in Latin America. One place where I have not been stationed is actually in my home country, the Netherlands, although we do have hotels there. Hotels has rose [ph] in 57 other countries throughout our region. Our portfolio and businesses at this point, 164 hotels in Europe and then furthermore, 86 hotels which are spread across Africa and the Middle East. And you should note that at this point, this footprint makes us far and away the largest operator in these resource-rich economies.
So let me start with Europe. While it's true that similar to the U.S., new supply in Western Europe is limited, we did have some notable growth success, such as the launch of the W brand. In its very first year of operations, the W Barcelona is exceeding all of our expectations and decided that we will soon open the W Leicester Square in London as well as the W in Paris in the Opera area. Now talking about Europe, it's important to distinguish between Western and Eastern Europe, where we do continue to see development opportunities in countries like Poland, Russia, Georgia and Turkey. We will have 23 new hotel openings in the Eastern and Central Europe over the next three years alone. The existing European hotels grew their REVPAR by 11% on a constant-currency basis versus last year, and most of this was led by a very strong business demand in major gateway cities such as London, Paris and Frankfurt.
From there, turning to the Middle East. We, in fact, have a number of very, very diverse growing markets, and these are markets such Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, each of them with different dynamics but each with substantial growth potential. Think about it, for example, even with oil price at $80 a barrel, hundreds of billions of dollars are flowing into the Middle East. And we know what that means, that means more hotels. It did in the 1970s, when the first Sheraton expanded across the region and is happening today but on a much greater scale. We plan to open 20 hotels in the Middle East over the next three years. REVPAR in the Middle East declined over 3% as the UAE works through the supply that came on steam over the last few years, but here, the trends are also slowly improving. And we saw a rate turn positive in September. That was the first time since the fall in 2008.
Then similar to the Middle East, Africa has experienced substantial growth, and that's reflective of the massive investments and the economic transformations that are taking place in these countries. You may not know, but the Chinese investments in Africa in 2009 surpassed the African Development Bank and have increased tenfold over the past decade. So no wonder that 52 out of the 53 African countries are now projecting economical growth for the year 2011. We're starting to see some change in travel patterns with the Chinese inbound travel to some of the markets that have been doubling since 2007. And given the massive investment that they are making on the continent, we expect that this number will increase dramatically over time. Our African business is already quite profitable, and we look forward to have more or less 30% unit growth in the years to come. REVPAR in Africa increased 5% during the third quarter, as the rate increase was partially offset by some occupancy declines there. And with that, let me turn the call over to Osvaldo Librizzi, who is our President of Latin American division."

I joined this company 1975 as a controller at the Sheraton in my hometown of Buenos Aires. Over the last few decades, I've been working various locations throughout Latin America and have witnessed enormous changes and some of these emerging economies have matured. With over 500 million people and abundance of natural resources, Latin America represents yet another great source of growth for Starwood, with our strong presence in the Upper Upscale and Luxury segments, with 63 properties in the region. In Mexico, we have 22 properties and several more in the sideline. And in Brazil, we're actively looking to accelerate our growth with six hotels today and several others under discussion. As you can imagine, my region was hit hard by the H1N1 flu in 2009. Unfortunately, the continued fear of crime in Mexico is keeping tourists away, even though the vast majority of the violence is further moved from our resort locations in Punta Mita, Cancun, Cabo and Puerto Vallarta. Despite this situation, our Mexican properties saw REVPAR growth of 4% in the third quarter, with a result at our euro [ph] locations. Mexico City enjoy REVPAR gains of 14% in the quarter, driven by strong business demands. We're also keeping a tight lid on cost and making use of centralized corporate resources whenever possible. This drove a nearly two-point increase in margins in the quarter before including last year's business interaction proceeds. 
In contrast to Mexico, South America results were very strong. With REVPAR gains of 46%, major cities such as Buenos Aires, Santiago, Rio and San Pablo, are enjoying occupancies at 2000 levels. And we are pushing rates by managing our business mix. These results of recent economy and are well-positioned to benefit from the demand for commodity from other rapidly growing regions such as Asia-Pacific. Now let me turn the call to our leader, Matt Avril, President of Hotel Operations. Matt will share some general comments on how our team is bringing the target cost and revenue initiatives together in a globally coordinated way."

By way of introduction, I've been in the hospitality industry with Starwood for over 20 years, with a heavy focus on operations after beginning my career in finance and accounting. But then my current role is President of the Hotel Groups since 2008. My responsibilities are to drive global initiatives across the system, work closely with our hotel owners and through our associates around the world, bring our brands to life for our guests. Over the last two years, we've been focused on a number of global initiatives to drive performance. The key has been to work together across functions and geographies to analyze rollout and measure our business with a relentless eye on making us more efficient operators for our owners and better host for our guests.
During the past few earnings calls, Frits has talked about our initiatives to drive top line growth and contain cost. As mentioned, we're referring to this focus as past-the-peak. Right now, we are proud of our Company Operated margin improvements, up 160 basis points in North America and 130 basis points across the balance for our global operations. But we won't rest until we reach, if not surpass, 2007 level. Past-the-peak is our organizing roadmap to get us there. As you heard from Miguel, Denise, Roeland and Osvaldo, the recovery is playing out in different ways around the globe. Our teams in each region are all laser-focused on achieving key profitability for the hotels in our system. As our hotel margins are driven by top line results as well as cost, we are focused on initiatives to benefit both. Examples of this include improvements in our revenue management systems, its capabilities and training. Also, we have worked with our regions to reallocate sales resources to better align our organization with the way our clients want to do business with us and to free up resources to prospects for new accounts. These top line initiatives, coupled with our brand positioning, are driving our ability to outperform the competition.
Furthermore, it's clear that we're in the early stages of how these initiatives will further enhance our industry-leading results. On the cost side, we continue to focus on lean hotel operations and our procurement practices. We also benefit from great relationships with our owners and franchisees to identify and migrate best practices. Our goal is to hold cost growth to half the rate of inflation. But our efforts don't end with these internal initiatives. Our operations leadership teams work closely with our brand leadership to ensure that we are innovating in ways that establish emotional connections with our guests. By way of example, this includes improving the meetings experienced through redesigning spaces and refining banquet and catering options for groups, providing a range of entertaining experiences that are cost effective for our corporate customers.
Looking back, hotel operating margins generally peaked in 2007, but remember, that cycle was interrupted by the credit crisis. So while the medium-term target is to get back to 2007 margins, over time, we believe we can exceed those levels. A big part of this, of course, will be determined by our ability to realize rate increases over the coming years as we continue to effectively manage our cost per occupied room. Let me now turn the call back over to Frits."

We want the investment community to spend more time hearing directly from our team. They are living evidence of just how difficult it is to replicate Starwood's current platform. We wholeheartedly believe that the growth and demand that comes from 3 billion people around the world reaching middle classes is nothing less than the most extraordinary opportunity in our lifetime. We didn't let the crisis of 2008 and 2009 go to waste, and we'll certainly not miss this incredible opportunity. I'd like to close with some preliminary thoughts on 2011. As I mentioned before, the positive trends in transient and group business continued. Business travel is robust and has filled our hotels in the critical Monday through Thursday periods, driving compression and allowing us to begin to recover rate. Specifically, we expect corporate rates to be up high single digits. Group business in 2011 is also trending well, with strong volumes and steadily improving rate. And the overall trajectory  of business appears to have stabilized to current levels. Of course, visibility remains limited in the macroeconomic picture and the developed world remains uncertain. However, if current trends continue, we would expect to deliver worldwide REVPAR growth of 7% to 9% in 2011.
With our demonstrated ability to control costs, we expect that this REVPAR growth will result in an EBITDA within the range of $950 million to $980 million.
But before I hand over to Vasant, I want to make one final comment on our business in the United States.  Like many of you, our base case expects America's economy to maul through for the next few years. Despite this, we're cautiously confident about our prospects. You've already heard about how supply's constrained and will grow slowly over the coming three to four years. That makes our industry very different from the economy as a whole, but has significant slight [ph] capacity. On the demand side, we're encouraged to see that profits of U.S. companies are at historic high. Balance sheets are also in good shape. So companies have the means to invest and are going after hard-earned growth. We know that means travel. As one industry executive put it, you don't grow revenues by sitting behind your desk. We stand a gain from this, given our high-end brand portfolio, and as we've said, our business is 75% b to b.  As for leisure demand, it's true that consumers' balance sheets are not as robust as those companies. But for households that make more than $100,000 per year, there's a lot less leverage. And these households account for about half of our U.S. consumer spending. So higher-income consumers have the means to travel and are doing so. For the next few years, all of this points to occupancies and rates at high-end hotels well above what you'd expect given the tepid economic growth. In fact, that's what we're already seeing. Now let me turn the call over to Vasant."

I grew up in Bombay, now known as Mumbai, and left India 30 years ago. India today is a different country than the one I grew up in. The widespread optimism, the boundless confidence, the determination of younger Indians to succeed and their willingness to take big risks is extraordinary. I've been back regularly over the years, and since the late 90s, I watched the pace of change accelerate and become irreversible. It's been exciting to be re-engaged with India in the business context of Starwood. For the past few years, I've been going to India once a quarter to help Miguel and our team in India grow our business, building on long-standing relationships and to be an advocate for our Indian effort at the center. Here's where we are in India today. There are 29 hotels opened and 18 under construction. We're already the largest in five-star system in India, larger than the international as well as the domestic hotel chains of the high-end. Sheraton has been established in India since the 70s. We have a great Le Méridien footprint, its iconic luxury collection hotels with our longtime partner IPC. We've just launched Westin with five spectacular hotels in the key cities, along with two Four Points and two Alofts.
We expect to sign our first W and St. Regis hotels soon, and we'll be on our way to achieving our goal of having 100 open or pipeline hotels in India within five years. We're well represented in the major cities and moving now as we have in China to the next few other cities. There is strong local team on the ground and high-quality owner base. Those of you who have been to India knows that infrastructure is a major bottleneck. The Indian government is making a big push to fix this problem over the next decade. This will help ramp up hotel construction activity. Miguel, who was been involved with both India and China for many years, will tell you that India today reminds them a look of China 10 to 15 years ago. We fully expect India to grow to be our third largest market after the U.S. and China.
With that, let me move on to our outlook starting with the balance of the year. As you heard, the global recovery continues. We remain on high alert for any signs that the trend is changing, and at this point, there are no indications that it is. I feel very comfortable that we will end the year with EBITDA of $840 million to $845 million, which is at the high end of our prior guidance range of $815 million to $845 million. We expect 27 global REVPAR growth at company operated hotels of 8% to 9% in constant dollars, also at the high-end of our prior range. All in all, a substantially better outcome in 2010 than we had anticipated at this time last year. This implies a Q4 EBITDA range of $230 million to $235 million. I want to point out that our year-over-year comparisons are [indiscernible] a variety of factors in Q4. In our Vacation Ownership business, we had a large gain from securitization last year, as well as the accounting change. In the Owned Hotel business, we have some asset sales, as you know, and some onetime items that helped our Latin American business last year. In the fees and other income line, we had a termination fee last year. In SG&A, we have higher incentive compensation this year. Also, we had some items moving between Q3 and Q4 this year, helping Q3 to some extent in reducing Q4. [indiscernible]to this noise, the underlying rate of growth remains strong as reflected in our outlook for 2011.
We expect global REVPAR growth at Company Operated Hotels in Q4 of 7% to 9% in constant dollars. This is a small sequential slowdown from Q3, primarily due to the fact that we are now locking a strong Q4 recovery last year. As an example, in North America, REVPAR growth recovered by 10 whole percentage points between Q3 and Q4 2009. As it has been all year, corporate transient business is the primary driver of growth. As you have seen, we had good ADR growth by inflicting lower rate to leisure business with higher rate to corporate business. And we expect that to continue into Q4. Group booking trends continue to improve. In North America, September was the strongest group booking month of the year, indicating that companies continue to be willing to make commitments to future years. And there's healthy growth in lead for group business around the world. The booking window, while longer than it was earlier in the year, is still shorter than normal. And we continue to have significant in the quarter, for the quarter business.
So what does all this suggest for 2011? As you have heard Frits say before, the global economy is dealing with a variety of unusual challenges. In developed markets, unemployment remains stubbornly high, and there are significant concerns with mounting public and private debt. There's a growing belief that the pace for recovery will be slow, the much discussed new normal scenario. On the other hand, product [ph] profits are strong and global companies are capitalizing on the rapid growth in emerging markets. The lodging supply outlook in developed market is the best it has been in decades, especially in the major metros. As a result of the characteristics of this recovery, REVPAR in the top 100 global cities, as defined by GDP and the rival[ph] , has been growing at twice the rate of national or regional cities.
Our brands of hotels cater to the high end, primarily corporate traveler, and are more concentrated in these global cities. As a result, we have recovered faster and today, have been relatively immune to the malaise elsewhere. Hopefully, this will remain the case. Based on what we see today and the forward-looking indicators we currently have, the most probable 2011 scenario in developed markets for our business is a normal cyclical recovery. Emerging markets have been the engines of the global recovery so far, led by China and India. We, as you know, have the best emerging markets platform and pipeline in our industry, and as such, are benefiting from the secular growth opportunity here. In these markets, while supply growth have been strong, demand growth has continued to be very robust, comfortably absorbing the additional room as Miguel described in China. While there's always the risk of overheating and boom and bust cycles as we have seen in Dubai, we do not think this is likely in 2011 in our key markets in Asia, Latin America and Africa. As you've seen in the numbers, Mexico and the Gulf continue to struggle and are not anticipating a big change in this geography next year. Most of our emerging markets will be lacking from hefty growth from 2010 and will not have events like the World Expo in Shanghai that helped China. As such, it would be reasonable to expect that the rate of growth will slow down sequentially year-over-year, and the growth, therefore, between emerging and developed markets will narrow. Again, based on what we know today, this would be our likely scenario for emerging markets.  In aggregate, this gets us to our 2011 outlook of 7% to 9% REVPAR growth in constant dollars for Company Operated Hotels globally, which corresponds to an EBITDA range of $950 million to $980 million,  up 13% to 16% and an EPS range of $1.44 to $1.55, up 32% to 40%. Exchange rates have been very volatile lately and very monetary. If current rates hold, reported dollar REVPAR growth could be about 100 basis points or so higher. We expect all margins to improve 150 to 200 basis points with a focus on revenue management and continued cost control. Our Vacation Ownership business will be flattish, with a continued focus on cash generation. Overhead will only grow 1% to 2% as we hold the line on headcount in developed markets while investing in emerging markets and incentive compensation normalizes.
Last year at this time, we have indicated that the make-or-break variable for 2010 was a strength of late-breaking corporate trends in business. As we all now know, corporate trends in business came back strong, stronger than many had anticipated. As we look forward to 2011, the team make-or-break variable is going to be rates, and so far, rates are on the right track. It's too early to know how our corporate rate negotiations with our major accounts end up. As we've indicated previously, we're targeting high single-digit increases. Our corporate customers are generally accepting that rates will be moving up. As always, there will be a [indiscernible] and we will let you know in February what the outcome is. Meanwhile, we will continue to aggressively management mix to our enhanced revenue management system. Mix management is what is moving rates up right now as we've split lower rate to leisure with higher rate to corporate business. In markets with good compression like New York, London and others, we can and are moving the entire rate structure up. As you heard from Frits, we expect good room growth in 2011. As always, greater locations will lag in the group segments since we have business on the books for 2011 that is booked in 2008 and 2009. While all the indications are that 2011 will be a normal recovery year for the hotel industry globally, there are always risks out there which we will need to closely monitor. Sharp moves in exchange rates will de-stabilize economies. The unknown side effects of qualitative [ph] in the U.S. and austerity in Europe will need to be closely watched. The efforts in emerging markets to keep inflation controlled and prevent acid levels could also have unintended consequences. Prudency requires that we acknowledge that alternate scenarios are possible and remain on high alert for early warning signs. Plus or minus one point of REVPAR globally impacts EBITDA plus or minus $15 million. Plus or minus one point change in REVPAR, solely due to exchange rate moves, impacts EBITDA by around $4 million. So you can run your own scenario. We would, of course, keep you updated on our quarterly calls. Moving on to a few balance sheet items. Excluding debt associated with securitized receivables, net debt at the end of Q3 was under $2.5 billion. Our leverage ratio as measured for our bank line is now under 3.5 [indiscernible], well below current levels. More importantly, we finished the quarter with over $250 million in excess cash, i.e. cash in excess of our normal working capital. We have no borrowings under our revolver, which remains fully available, and no bond maturities until May 2012. So our liquidity of leverage position get stronger every day. We still expect to receive a $200 million-plus tax refund before the end of the year. With the refund, we expect our excess cash balance to climb to $500 million by year-end and our net debt to be under $2.3 billion. With that, I'll turn this back to Jay."

We caught that in the third quarter. That does affect year-over-year comparisons for that business. In Europe, there's been a couple of issues. One, REVPAR growth in general was lower single digits that will make margin growth a little tougher. But also, just like we've had in our SG&A, the incentive comp adjustments at the hotel level, whereas last year, incentive comp was coming down, this year, it's going up. That does make some comparison adjustments. If we just adjust for those sort of on a run rate basis, the margins would actually have been up 100 basis points. The other question was the management franchise fees, that's really driven by the fact that our incentive fees are largely non-U.S. Our GOP levels are quite high outside the U.S., and these are first dollar incentives. So a little [indiscernible] sort of 1:1.5 ratio between revenue growth and incentive fee growth. And REVPAR growth, as you know, is going to be higher than revenue growth next year too. So if you apply that ratio, you get to the kind of fee growth levels we have. And then the other fee is related on the U.S. side. It's a small incentive fee, so it doesn't really move things that much next year."

And what we've said consistently is our businesses is built on the fact that our owners and developers here, as well as other parts of the world, are profitable and they've gotten to know us, and they've worked with us for decades. And so as they look at new opportunities, a lot of the development that we're seeing is uncontested. It's based on developers and partners that we've worked with coming to us with opportunities, and us talking about which brand, which opportunity makes the most sense. And as I've said, these are virtually all managed hotels.

The past-the-peak effort is based on our observation and objective that many hotels within our system, whether we own them or manage them on behalf of our owners, are still at levels that they were in 2007, in some cases, back to pre-9/11. And if we have a sustained recovery around the world, even if it's low in the developed markets, given the constraint on supply, as well as the rapid economic growth in developing markets, we should be able to get to those levels. And what Matt's doing is reading a series of initiatives from revenue management to sales force allocation to lean operations at the hotel level to procurement, looking at, literally, all the levels as you go through a typical hotel P&L to get back to those peak levels. Exactly when we get there and the trajectory for that, as you can imagine, is largely driven by what happens to REVPAR growth because we can control expenses on the cost side. We've done that, we'll continue to do it, and we talked about a goal of being at roughly half of inflation. So the degree to which we can get to and exceed peak EBITDA margins and absolute EBITDA levels will be a function of how steep the REVPAR increase is. And that, obviously, looking past 2011, is anybody's guess. We've given you a range of what we think overall global REVPAR will be for system-wide. But beyond that, obviously, it's very hard to tell. So we'd be speculating at that point."

Greetings from Beijing. We're here for a leadership meeting with our top 100 executives from around the world.

We're here for a leadership meeting with our top 100 executives from around the world. A lot of companies are looking to Asia and other emerging markets for future growth. For us, that growth is a reality today. Asia-Pacific generates 21% of our fee revenues, and the region represents 62% of our pipeline for future hotel openings. In fact, markets outside the developed economies of Europe, Japan, the U.S. and Canada account for 34% of our fees and 80% of our pipeline. Today, our U.S. portfolio of 458 hotels is roughly seven times the size of the number of hotels we have in China. But it's not far-fetched to say that China will one day eclipse the U.S. as Starwood's largest country, no more far-fetched than to imagine that both China's car market and China's number of Internet users would exceed the U.S., which they already do. That means we have many more hotels to open here.
Across our companies, we witness on a daily basis how the economic balance of power is shifting from the developed world to rapidly growing economies. While China is the largest of these markets, the growth and prosperity is pervasive around the world as the crisis recedes. Tourism industry market has increased 100% over last year. Morocco has seen a fivefold increase in inbound visitors over the last decade, and Panama has become a financial center for South America. For some time now, we've acted not as a U.S. company with outposts in a hundred countries but as a global company that happens to be based in the world city of New York. Now more than ever, we're reaping the rewards of our global footprint, our ability to be local around the world and our long-standing relationships with guests and owners. This is something you cannot buy. You can only earn it over decades.
With that in mind, I'm delighted to take advantage of our leaders being assembled here in the Westin Beijing Financial Street. I'll be introducing you to the four division presidents who lead our businesses around the world. Then Matt Avril, President of our Hotel Group, will share his global perspective on our efforts to bring each hotel back to and beyond pre-crisis profitability, something we're calling past the peak. I'll wrap up by sharing my thoughts on 2011 and then hand the call over to Vasant, who will give more color on our financial results and outlook. Vasant will also share some observations on our efforts to accelerate our growth in India. But first, I want to tell you about the third quarter. We said we would only upswing and we have. We gained share, growing faster than our competition and converted higher revenue into higher profits. The headline is that lodging recovery continues, unabated by the euro crisis, U.S. economic jitters on Malaysia and Japan. With occupancy rising at or above 2007 levels, it's no surprise that rates are on positive territory across each of our regions. Both business and leisure travel continued to show strength in the quarter. The great recession was remarkable in both its harrowing drop on the way the down and on its reliance on emerging markets on the way up. Nonetheless, the lodging recovery is following similar patterns to prior cycles. The strength of gateway cities are spreading to secondary markets. Luxury, thought to be dead by some, is alive and growing. These factors enabled us to beat the high end of our EBITDA guidance by $10 million and EPS by $0.06. International company operated REVPAR grew by 13% compared with 10% in North America. Worldwide owned hotels experienced a 12% increase in REVPAR, with hotels outside of North America again outperforming.
As you know, we're in the early stages of corporate renegotiations. But so far, we like what we see. Corporate buyers know that occupancy levels have already risen towards prior peaks, especially in the gateway cities where their associates need to stay. Indeed, customers are hearing stories about not being able to find a room regardless of price. Great expectations, therefore, adjusting to this new reality. In light of how far rates have fallen since 2008, we have a long way to go up. In fact, we've been working to change the mix of our business all year. So even though a large percentage of our room rates in 2010 were locked in at tight decreases, we were able to drive our company operated rates up by almost 5% in the third quarter through aggressive yield management.
Trends in group business also remained robust, particularly in the quarter for the quarter bookings. In September, for example, bookings for 2010 were up 19%. As we've entered the back half of 2010, 2011 bookings are picking up nicely. Again, looking at September bookings, revenues for 2011 jumped almost 30%, driven by room night volumes up 22% and rates up 7%. 2011 group pace has improved by almost 15 points over the last six months and is now flat. For comparison's sake, 2010 group pace at the same time last year was down 20% and is now up mid single digits. This makes us all confident that group volumes for 2011 could match 2008 with solid rate increases. This, by the way, also lays to rest any fears that technology or the downturn itself would permanently change group demand. As part of our past-the-peak efforts, we'll continue to focus on cost containment to drive margin improvement for the coming years. Our associates around the world are delivering on this promise with company operated margins up 140 basis points in the quarter. At the same time, our business is all about building brands through great experiences. So despite our focus on cost and despite hotels that are once again full, we're proud to report that guest satisfaction scores remain at record highs. This is translating into sustained increases in REVPAR index. We now expect full year worldwide share gains of roughly 100 basis points with Sheraton leading the charge.
Our Vacation Ownership business also performed well in the quarter. We managed our Tour Pro levels to focus on the most profitable channels. Correspondingly, close rates are steadily improving. We also completed a securitization that underscores the dramatic turnaround in capital markets since the dark days of 2009. We garnered advance rates of 93% and interest rates under 4%, our best ever. As a result, we will generate about $225 million in cash from the Vacation Ownership business this year, and we expect the business to generate similar amounts of cash over each of the next three years. We're also keeping a tight lid on corporate costs. Headcount is flat over 2009 and will remain flat through 2011. So despite adding new hotels, we expect SG&A spend in 2011 to be similar to 2010 levels. Let me underscore the importance of this cost discipline. We removed $100 million in costs in a sustainable way. This translates into corporate margins for our fee business that will be higher in 2011 and peak 2007 levels, despite much lower REVPAR.
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Matt Avril and our division presidents who run our four regions around the world. This team has deep market knowledge and experience. At the same time, they all have tremendous appetite to grow and improve our operations. So please let me begin by introducing you to our host here in China, Miguel Ko."

As the Chairman and President of Starwood Asia-Pacific division, I am seeing enormous changes in China since I first joined Sheraton in 1979 in internal audit. I was born in a small Chinese city called Shantou, near Gua",540,"Thank you, Frits, and good morning. As the Chairman and President of Starwood Asia-Pacific division, I am seeing enormous changes in China since I first joined Sheraton in 1979 in internal audit. I was born in a small Chinese city called Shantou, near Guangzhou in Southern China. Although many of you may not have heard of Shantou, this secondary city now has a population of 5 million people. That's more than inner city limits of Los Angeles or roughly equal to Chicago and Houston combined. Today, Shantou does not have one single international class hotel. This will change as we recently find a deal to build a beautiful new Sheraton there. In fact, Sheraton is often the first five-star international hotel brand to enter a secondary or tertiary city in China. With over 30 hotels now already opened and another 34 in the pipeline, the brand's growth is accelerating. Sheraton benefits from decades of great trend recognition among Chinese travelers. And Sheraton in Chinese is called [indiscernible], which is literal translation meaning happiness comes in. That resonates very well with the Chinese.
Our existing hotels are at the best level for future growth. They are a great way to inspire our current partners to start new projects and also to attract new partners. Our hotels are also the perfect training ground for mix 86 hotels we expect to open over the coming years. Looking ahead, development in Asia-Pacific remains robust. This year, we already signed new contracts for more than 9,000 additional hotel rooms. Many investors focus on Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong when they think of China. But Starwood expects this growth will come from cities they have not heard of like Shantou. China has 171 cities with more than 1 million population. And we are working hard to enter these markets as demand grows. In a rapidly transforming economy, supply and demand will bounce around. Take Beijing, for example, where we have six hotels today and two more under construction. In the months following the Summer Olympics in 2008, this city is suffering from oversupply, but year-to-date REVPAR in Beijing is now up 27%. So after almost two decades of double-digit economic growth, I'm very bullish about Starwood's future here.
Outside the U.S., China's already Starwood's largest country, with 60 hotels representing eight of our brands in our fastest growing SPG market as well. Looking ahead, we will open more hotels in China than anywhere else in the Starwood's system. In the third quarter, Asia-Pacific REVPAR grew 21% or 16% excluding the possible impact from appreciating Asian currencies. In China, I'm happy to report a healthy balance of rates and occupancy increases. REVPAR growth in China is up 33%, with Shanghai, driven by the World Expo, leading the charge. Collectively, our year-to-date REVPAR index in China was 110, which speaks to the string of our hotel brands and experiences of our team operating the hotels. Most of our hotels are staffed with local Chinese managers. Chin Jing, Head of Operations, and Stephen [indiscernible] our development in China. I have worked with both of them for more than 20 years. With that, let me now turn the call over to Denise Coll, the President of our North American division."

The unit growth that Starwood's Asia-Pacific division is experiencing is truly amazing. But Starwood's other divisions, including North America, are well-positioned to capitalize in the outbound travel that will result from these rapidly growing economies and burdening middle classes. China is already one of the top 10 sources of inbound business to the U.S, and business is forecasted to double by 2014. Our global brand and heavy presence in key North American cities is driving even stronger growth to Starwood. For example, Chinese business at the Sheraton Toronto is up 50% year-on-year and some of our Hawaiian resorts, such as the Sheraton Waikiki and the Princess Kaiulani Hotel, saw inbound Chinese travel grow by over 100%. Frits had said this before, but let me say it again. Think of the Japanese travel boom of 1980s and multiply it by a factor of 10.
I started my career in operations with the Sheraton Boston in 1976 and have never forgotten the lessons that I've learned on the importance of delivering terrific guest experiences. After all, exceeding the expectations of guests, wherever they're from, is how Starwood delivers the REVPAR premiums that fuel our growth. Today, our guest satisfaction remains at record-high levels, just one of the reasons why our hotels are outperforming the competition. Occupancy levels have recovered nicely over the last year and are allowing us to push rates more aggressively as we actively manage the segmentation mix within our properties. As a result, REVPAR in our North America owned hotels jumped 11% despite tougher comparisons. ADR grew an impressive 8% and margins increased by 250 basis points. Company Operated REVPAR increased 10%, and we continue to gain share particularly with our incredibly successful Rediscover Sheraton campaign, the largest campaign in the brand's history.
Sheraton's momentum continues, enjoying year-to-date REVPAR index gain of almost 200 basis points over the competition. As we look forward, we have a unique opportunity to expand the breadth of our brands in North America. Our greatest opportunity may be in the specialty select service space. Our Aloft, Element and Four Points of our Sheraton brand are some of the best in the industry. But with only 152 hotels in this segment today, our brands are under-penetrated relative to our competitors. From Upscale to Luxury, our distinctive and compelling brand portfolio, are equipped by a development team with an arsenal that can be used to fit the needs of our owners and partners. For example, my hometown, Boston, recently caught up to the Beijing hotel account [ph], with the openings at the Le Méridien Cambridge and the W Boston. Both of these properties have brought authentic hotel experiences to the city that did not exist previously.
The real interesting story about North America, both now and over the next few years, will be rate growth. The decade between 2001 and 2010 saw the slowest growth in road [ph] inventory since the Second World War. Given the capital constraint of the last few years, new supplies will remain limited in 2011 through 2014. As a result, we expect to see strong pricing power in the industry, particularly in the gateway cities where we have substantial Owned presence with over 13,000 rooms. With our focus on driving top line and strong flow-throughs through cost containment, we expect significant earnings growth in our Owned portfolio over the coming years. I'd now like to introduce Roeland Vos, the President of our Europe, Africa and Middle East division."

I'm torn as to where I should open, with good evening since it's 9:00 p.m. here Beijing, or good afternoon to our associates in [indiscernible] and our division or good morning to our U.S. investors. Regardless to all of you, thanks for li",668,"Thanks, Denise. I'm torn as to where I should open, with good evening since it's 9:00 p.m. here Beijing, or good afternoon to our associates in [indiscernible] and our division or good morning to our U.S. investors. Regardless to all of you, thanks for listening. I began my career as a management trainee at the Sheraton Brussels in 1982 and since then have rotated through multiple positions within Europe as well as in Latin America. One place where I have not been stationed is actually in my home country, the Netherlands, although we do have hotels there. Hotels as well as in 57 other countries throughout our region. Our portfolio encompasses at this point, 164 hotels in Europe and then furthermore, 86 hotels which are spread across Africa and the Middle East. And you should note that at this point, this footprint makes us far and away the largest operator in these resource-rich economies.
So let me start with Europe. While it's true that similar to the U.S., new supply in Western Europe is limited, we did have some notable growth success, such as the launch of the W brand. In its very first year of operations, the W Barcelona is exceeding all of our expectations and decided that we will soon open the W Leicester Square in London as well as the W in Paris in the Opera area. Now talking about Europe, it's important to distinguish between Western and Eastern Europe, where we do continue to see development opportunities in countries like Poland, Russia, Georgia and Turkey. We will have 23 new hotel openings in East and Central Europe over the next three years alone. The existing European hotels grew their REVPAR by 11% on a constant-currency basis versus last year, and most of this was led by a very strong business demand in the major gateway cities such as London, Paris or Frankfurt.
From there, turning to the Middle East. We, in fact, have a number of very, very diverse growing markets, and these are markets such Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, each of them with different dynamics but each with substantial growth potential. Think about it, for example, even with oil priced at $80 a barrel, hundreds of billions of dollars are flowing into the Middle East. And we know what that means, that means more hotels. It did in the 1970s, when the first Sheraton expanded across the region and it's happening today but on a much greater scale. We plan to open 20 hotels in the Middle East over the next three years. REVPAR in the Middle East declined over 3% as the UAE works through the supply that came on steam over the last few years, but here, the trends are also slowly improving. And we saw a rate turn positive in September and that was the first time since the fall in 2008.
Then similar to the Middle East, Africa has experienced substantial growth, and that's reflective of the massive investments and the economic transformations that are taking place in these countries. You may not know, but the Chinese investments in Africa in 2009 surpassed the African Development Bank and have increased tenfold over the past decade. So no wonder that 52 out of the 53 African countries are now projecting economical growth for the year 2011. We're starting to see some change in travel patterns with the Chinese inbound travel to some of the markets that have been doubling since 2007. And given the massive investment that they are making on the continent, we expect that this number will increase dramatically over time. Our African business is already quite profitable, and we look forward to have more or less 30% unit growth in the years to come. REVPAR in Africa increased 5% during the third quarter, as the rate increase was partially offset by some occupancy declines there. And with that, let me turn the call over to Osvaldo Librizzi, who is our President of Latin American division."

I joined this company 1975 as a controller at the Sheraton in my hometown of Buenos Aires. Over the last few decades, I've been working various locations throughout Latin America and have witnessed enormous changes as some of these emerging economies have matured. With over 500 million people and abundance of natural resources, Latin America represents yet another great source of growth for Starwood, with our strong presence in the Upper Upscale and Luxury segments, with 63 properties in the region. In Mexico, we have 22 properties and several more in the sideline. And in Brazil, we're actively looking to accelerate our growth with six hotels today and several others under discussion. As you can imagine, my region was hit hard by the H1N1 flu in 2009. Unfortunately, the continued fear of crime in Mexico is keeping tourists away, even though the vast majority of the violence is further moved from our resort locations in Punta Mita, Cancun, Cabo and Puerto Vallarta. Despite this situation, our Mexican properties saw REVPAR growth of 4% in the third quarter, with a result at our Europe locations. Mexico City enjoy REVPAR gains of 14% in the quarter, driven by strong business demands. We're also keeping a tight lid on cost and making use of centralized corporate resources whenever possible. This drove a nearly two-point increase in margins in the quarter before including last year's business interaction proceeds. 
In contrast to Mexico, South America results were very strong. With REVPAR gains of 46%, major cities such as Buenos Aires, Santiago, Rio and San Pablo, are enjoying occupancies at 2000 levels. And we are pushing rates by managing our business mix. These results of recent economy are well-positioned to benefit from the demand for commodity from other rapidly growing regions such as Asia-Pacific. Now let me turn the call to our leader, Matt Avril, President of Hotel Operations. Matt will share some general comments on past-the-peak and how our team is bringing the Starwood's cost and revenue initiatives together in a globally coordinated way."

By way of introduction, I've been in the hospitality industry with Starwood for over 20 years, with a heavy focus on operations after beginning my career in finance and accounting. But then my current role as President of the Hotel Groups since 2008. My responsibilities are to drive global initiatives across the system, work closely with our hotel owners and through our associates around the world, bring our brands to life for our guests. Over the last two years, we've been focused on a number of global initiatives to drive performance. The key has been to work together across functions and geographies to analyze rollout and measure our business with a relentless eye on making us more efficient operators for our owners and better hosts for our guests.
During the past few earnings calls, Frits has talked about our initiatives to drive top line growth and contain cost. As mentioned, we're referring to this focus as past-the-peak. Right now, we are proud of our Company Operated margin improvements, up 160 basis points in North America and 130 basis points across the balance for our global operations. But we won't rest until we reach, if not surpass, 2007 levels. Past-the-peak is our organizing roadmap to get us there. As you've heard from Miguel, Denise, Roeland and Osvaldo, the recovery is playing out in different ways around the globe. Our teams in each region are all laser-focused on achieving key profitability for the hotels in our system. As our hotel margins are driven by top line results as well as cost, we are focused on initiatives to benefit both. Examples of this include improvements in our revenue management systems, its capabilities and training. Also, we have worked with our regions to reallocate sales resources to better align our organization with the way our clients want to do business with us and to free up resources to prospect for new accounts. These top line initiatives, coupled with our brand positioning, are driving our ability to outperform the competition.
Furthermore, it's clear that we're in the early stages of how these initiatives will further enhance our industry-leading results. On the cost side, we continue to focus on lean hotel operations and our procurement practices. We also benefit from great relationships with our owners and franchisees to identify and migrate best practices. Our goal is to hold cost growth to half the rate of inflation. But our efforts don't end with these internal initiatives. Our operations leadership teams work closely with our brand leadership to ensure that we are innovating in ways that establish emotional connections with our guests. By way of example, this includes improving the meetings experience through redesigning spaces and refining banquet and catering options for groups, providing a range of entertaining experiences that are cost effective for our corporate customers.
Looking back, hotel operating margins generally peaked in 2007, but remember, that cycle was interrupted by the credit crisis. So while the medium-term target is to get back to 2007 margins, over time, we believe we can exceed those levels. A big part of this, of course, will be determined by our ability to realize rate increases over the coming years as we continue to effectively manage our cost per occupied room. Let me now turn the call back over to Frits."

We want the investment community to spend more time hearing directly from our team. They are living evidence of just how difficult it is to replicate Starwood's current platform. We wholeheartedly believe that the growth and demand that comes from 3 billion people around the world reaching middle class is nothing less than the most extraordinary opportunity in our lifetime. We didn't let the crisis of 2008 and 2009 go to waste, and we'll certainly not miss this incredible opportunity. I'd like to close with some preliminary thoughts on 2011. As I mentioned before, the positive trends in transient and group business continued. Business travel is robust and has filled our hotels in the critical Monday through Thursday periods, driving compression and allowing us to begin to recover rate. Specifically, we expect corporate rates to be up high single digits. Group business in 2011 is also trending well, with strong volumes and steadily improving rate. And the overall trajectory of business appears to have stabilized to current levels. Of course, visibility remains limited and the macroeconomic picture in the developed world remains uncertain. However, if the current trends continue, we would expect to deliver worldwide REVPAR growth of 7% to 9% in 2011. With our demonstrated ability to control costs, we expect that this REVPAR growth will result in an EBITDA within the range of $950 million to $980 million.
But before I hand over to Vasant, I want to make one final comment on business in the United States. Like many of you, our base case expects America's economy to muddle through for the next few years. Despite this, we're cautiously confident about our prospects. You've already heard about how supply's constrained and will grow slowly over the coming three to four years. That makes our industry very different from the economy as a whole, but has significant slight [ph] capacity. On the demand side, we're encouraged to see that profits of U.S. companies are at historic high. Balance sheets are also in good shape. So companies have the means to invest and are going after hard-earned growth. We know that means travel. As one industry executive put it, you don't grow revenues by sitting behind your desk. We stand to gain from this, given our high-end brand portfolio, and as we've said, our business is 75% b to b. As for leisure demand, it's true that consumers' balance sheets are not as robust as those companies. But for households that made more than $100,000 per year, there's a lot less leverage. And these households account for about half of our U.S. consumer spending. So higher-income consumers have the means to travel and are doing so. For the next few years, all of this points to occupancies and rates at high-end hotels well above what you'd expect given tepid economic growth. In fact, that's what we're already seeing. Now let me turn the call over to Vasant."

I grew up in Bombay, now known as Mumbai, and left India 30 years ago. India today is a very different country than the one I grew up in. The widespread optimism, the boundless confidence, the determination of younger Indians to succeed and their willingness to take big risks is extraordinary. I've been back regularly over the years, and since the late 90s, I watched the pace of change accelerate and become irreversible. It's been exciting to be re-engaged with India in the business context of Starwood. For the past few years, I've been going to India once a quarter to help Miguel and our team in India grow our business, building on long-standing relationships and to be an advocate for our Indian effort at the center. Here's where we are in India today. There are 29 hotels opened and 18 under construction. We're already the largest five-star system in India, larger than the international as well as the domestic hotel chains of the high-end. Sheraton has been established in India since the 70s. We have a great Le Méridien footprint, its iconic luxury collection hotels with our longtime partner ITC. We've just launched Westin with five spectacular hotels in the key cities, along with two Four Points and two Alofts.
We expect to sign our first W and St. Regis hotels soon, and we're well on our way to achieving our goal of having 100 open or pipeline hotels in India within five years. We're well represented in the major cities and moving now as we have in China to the next few cities. There is strong local team on the ground and a high-quality owner base. Those of you who have been to India knows that infrastructure is a major bottleneck. The Indian government is making a big push to fix this problem over the next decade. This will help ramp up hotel construction activity. Miguel, who has been involved with both India and China for many years, will tell you that India today reminds them a lot of China 10 to 15 years ago. We fully expect India to grow to be our third largest market after the U.S. and China.
With that, let me move on to our outlook starting with the balance of the year. As you have heard, the global recovery continues. We remain on high alert for any signs that the trend is changing, and at this point, there are no indications that it is. I feel very comfortable that we will end the year with EBITDA of $840 million to $845 million, which is at the high end of our prior guidance range of $815 million to $845 million. We expect 27 global REVPAR growth at company operated hotels of 8% to 9% in constant dollars, also at the high-end of our prior range. All in all, a substantially better outcome in 2010 than we had anticipated at this time last year. This implies a Q4 EBITDA range of $230 million to $235 million. I want to point out that our year-over-year comparisons are muddied by a variety of factors in Q4. In our Vacation Ownership business, we had a large gain from securitization last year, as well as the accounting change. In the Owned Hotel business, we have some asset sales, as you know, and some onetime items that helped our Latin American business last year. In the fees and other income line, we had a termination fee last year. In SG&A, we have higher incentive compensation this year. Also, we had some items moving between Q3 and Q4 this year, helping Q3 to some extent in reducing Q4. Stripped with this noise, the underlying rate of growth remains strong as reflected in our outlook for 2011.
We expect global REVPAR growth at Company Operated Hotels in Q4 of 7% to 9% in constant dollars. This is a small sequential slowdown from Q3, primarily due to the fact that we are now lacking a strong Q4 recovery last year. As an example, in North America, REVPAR growth recovered by 10 whole percentage points between Q3 and Q4 2009. As it has been all year, corporate transient business is the primary driver of growth. As you have seen, we had good ADR growth by inflicting lower rate to leisure business with higher rate to corporate business. And we expect that to continue into Q4. Group booking trends continue to improve. In North America, September was the strongest group booking month of the year, indicating that companies continue to be willing to make commitments to future years. And there's healthy growth in lead for group business around the world. The booking window, while longer than it was earlier in the year, is still shorter than normal. And we continue to have significant in the quarter, for the quarter business.
So what does all this suggest for 2011? As you have heard Frits say before, the global economy is dealing with a variety of unusual challenges. In developed markets, unemployment remains stubbornly high, and there are significant concerns with mounting public and private debt. There's a growing belief that the pace for recovery will be slow, the much discussed new normal scenario. On the other hand, product [ph] profits are strong and global companies are capitalizing on the rapid growth in emerging markets. The lodging supply outlook in developed markets is the best it has been in decades, especially in the major metros. As a result of the characteristics of this recovery, REVPAR in the top 100 global cities, as defined by GDP and the rival, has been growing at twice the rate of national or regional cities.
Our brands of hotels cater to the high end, primarily corporate traveler, and are more concentrated in these global cities. As a result, we have recovered faster and today, have been relatively immune to the malaise elsewhere. Hopefully, this will remain the case. Based on what we see today and the forward-looking indicators we currently have, the most probable 2011 scenario in developed markets for our business is a normal cyclical recovery. Emerging markets have been the engines of the global recovery so far, led by China and India. We, as you know, have the best emerging markets platform and pipeline in our industry, and as such, are benefiting from the secular growth opportunity here. In these markets, while supply growth has been strong, demand growth has continued to be very robust, comfortably absorbing the additional room as Miguel described in China. While there's always the risk of overheating and boom and bust cycles as we have seen in Dubai, we do not think this is likely in 2011 in our key markets in Asia, Latin America and Africa. As you've seen in the numbers, Mexico and the Gulf continue to struggle and we're not anticipating a big change in either geography next year. Most of our emerging markets will be lacking some hefty growth from 2010 and will not have events like the World Expo in Shanghai that helped China. As such, it would be reasonable to expect that the rate of growth will slow down sequentially year-over-year, and the growth delta between emerging and developed markets will narrow. Again, based on what we know today, this would be our likely scenario for emerging markets.  In aggregate, this gets us to our 2011 outlook of 7% to 9% REVPAR growth in constant dollars for Company Operated Hotels globally, which corresponds to an EBITDA range of $950 million to $980 million,  up 13% to 16% and an EPS range of $1.44 to $1.55, up 32% to 40%. Exchange rates have been very volatile lately and very monetary. If current rates hold, reported dollar REVPAR growth could be about 100 basis points or so higher. We expect all margins to improve 150 to 200 basis points with a focus on revenue management and continued cost control. Our Vacation Ownership business will be flattish, with a continued focus on cash generation. Overhead will only grow 1% to 2% as we hold the line on headcount in developed markets while investing in emerging markets and incentive compensation normalizes.
Last year at this time, we had indicated that the make-or-break variable for 2010 was a strength of late-breaking corporate trends in business. As we all now know, corporate trends in business came back strong, stronger than many had anticipated. As we look forward to 2011, the team make-or-break variable is going to be rates, and so far, rates are on the right track. It's too early to know how our corporate rate negotiations with our major accounts end up. As we've indicated previously, we're targeting high single-digit increases. Our corporate customers are generally accepting that rates will be moving up. As always, there will be a bell arc and we will let you know in February what the outcome is. Meanwhile, we will continue to aggressively manage mix to our enhanced revenue management system. Mix management is what is moving rate up right now as we've split lower rated leisure with higher rated corporate business. In markets with good compression like New York, London and others, we can and are moving the entire rate structure up. As you heard from Frits, we expect good group rooms growth in 2011. As always, greater locations will lag in the group segments since we have business on the books for 2011 that is booked in 2008 and 2009. While all the indications are that 2011 will be a normal recovery year for the hotel industry globally, there are always risks out there which we will need to closely monitor. Sharp moves in exchange rates will de-stabilize economies. The unknown side effects of qualitative using in the U.S. and austerity in Europe will need to be closely watched. The efforts in emerging markets to keep inflation controlled and prevent acid levels could also have unintended consequences. Prudence requires that we acknowledge that alternate scenarios are possible and remain on high alert for early warning signs. Plus or minus one point of REVPAR globally impacts EBITDA by plus or minus $15 million. Plus or minus one point change in REVPAR, solely due to exchange rate moves, impacts EBITDA by around $4 million. So you can run your own scenarios. We would, of course, keep you updated on our quarterly calls. Moving on to a few balance sheet items. Excluding debt associated with securitized receivables, net debt at the end of Q3 was under $2.5 billion. Our leverage ratio as measured for our bank line is now under 3.5 *times, well below current levels. More importantly, we finished the quarter with over $250 million in excess cash, i.e. cash in excess of our normal working capital. We have no borrowings under our revolver, which remains fully available, and no bond maturities until May 2012. So our liquidity of leverage position gets stronger esvery day. We still expect to receive a $200 million-plus tax refund before the end of the year. With the refund, we expect our excess cash balance to climb to $500 million by year-end and our net debt to be under $2.3 billion. With that, I'll turn this back to Jay."

It's more driven by occupancy than rates, and so REVPAR increases tend to be significantly higher than revenue increases, and of course, our fees are more linked to revenue, especially in managed hotels, which is the bulk of our business, than they are to purely REVPAR. That's one reason. The second is we've had, as you know, softness in the Middle East. So that held back some of the growth, some Forex impacts in some places. Those would be the major reasons.

You're right that on the international Owned Hotel side last year in Latin America, we received business interruption insurance from the impact of the big H1N1 issue in Mexico. We caught that in the third quarter. That does affect year-over-year comparisons for that business. In Europe, there's been a couple of issues. One, REVPAR growth in general was lower single digits that will make margin growth a little tougher. But also, just like we've had in our SG&A, the incentive comp adjustments at the hotel level, where last year, incentive comp was coming down, this year, it's going up. That does make some comparison adjustments. If we just adjust for those sort of on a run rate basis, the margins would actually have been up 100 basis points. The other question was the management franchise fees, that's really driven by the fact that our incentive fees are largely non-U.S. Our GOP levels are quite high outside the U.S., and these are first dollar incentives. So a rule of thumb we have sort of a 1:1.5 ratio between revenue growth and incentive fee growth. And REVPAR growth, as you know, is going to be higher than revenue growth next year too. So if you apply that ratio, you get to the kind of fee growth levels we have. And then the other fee is related on the U.S. side. It's a small incentive fee, so it doesn't really move things that much next year."

The past-the-peak effort is based on our observation and objective that many hotels within our system, whether we own them or manage them on behalf of our owners, are still at levels that they were in 2007",266,"I'm going to answer it quickly on behalf of Matt. The past-the-peak effort is based on our observation and objective that many hotels within our system, whether we own them or manage them on behalf of our owners, are still at levels that they were in 2007, in some cases, back to pre-9/11. And if we have a sustained recovery around the world, even if it's low in the developed markets, given the constraint on supply, as well as the rapid economic growth in developing markets, we should be able to get to those levels. And what Matt's doing is leading a series of initiatives from revenue management to sales force allocation to lean operations at the hotel level to procurement, as looking at, literally, all the levels as you go through a typical hotel P&L to get back to those peak levels. Exactly when we get there and the trajectory for that, as you can imagine, is largely driven by what happens to REVPAR growth because we can control expenses on the cost side. We've done that, we'll continue to do it, and we talked about a goal of being at roughly half of inflation. So the degree to which we can get to and exceed peak EBITDA margins and absolute EBITDA levels will be a function of how steeply REVPAR increases. And that, obviously, looking past 2011, is anybody's guess. We've given you a range of what we think overall global REVPAR will be for us system-wide. But beyond that, obviously, it's very hard to tell. That would be speculating at that point."

What we're seeing is, in contrast to absolute radio silence in 2009, is an increased level of interest in buying assets. But I wouldn't say even though we're seeing a lot of money building up on the sidelines that we have a complete array of eager buyers. What you see today in terms of transactions in North America have largely been focused by large, well-capitalized REITs looking at hotels that are in great shape in gateway cities, and by the way, paying pretty substantial prices for those hotels. But the full range of buyers entering the market isn't the phenomenon that we've seen yet, nor have we seen the full range of hotels being sold. So while certainly the environment for buying and selling hotels is considerably better than where it was, we think it will continue to get better. And we'll look to determine exactly when that means we'll sell hotels along the way. As you've seen, we have engaged in some transactions where we've been able to find an opportunity that makes a lot of sense for us, but we'll probably -- I'm not going to give a timeframe. We're probably some time away from being really into a mid-cycle correction with a full range of buyer, and therefore, an opportunity to do a bigger transaction. Nonetheless, just to be clear, and as we said on previous calls, that remains our priority and it's something we will get after when we think the timing is just right."

We're here for a leadership meeting with our top 100 executives from around the world. A lot of companies are looking to Asia and other emerging markets for future growth. For us, that growth is a reality today. Asia-Pacific generates 21% of our fee revenues, and the region represents 62% of our pipeline for future hotel openings. In fact, markets outside the developed economies of Europe, Japan, the U.S. and Canada account for 34% of our fees and 80% of our pipeline. Today, our U.S. portfolio of 458 hotels is roughly seven times the size of the number of hotels we have in China. But it's not far-fetched to say that China will one day eclipse the U.S. as Starwood's largest country, no more far-fetched than to imagine that both China's car market and China's number of Internet users would exceed the U.S., which they already do. That means we have many more hotels to open here.
Across our companies, we witness on a daily basis how the economic balance of power is shifting from the developed world to rapidly growing economies. While China is the largest of these markets, the growth and prosperity is pervasive around the world as the crisis recedes. Tourism industry market has increased 100% over last year. Morocco has seen a fivefold increase in inbound visitors over the last decade, and Panama has become a financial center for South America. For some time now, we've acted not as a U.S. company with outposts in a hundred countries but as a global company that happens to be based in the world city of New York. Now more than ever, we're reaping the rewards of our global footprint, our ability to be local around the world and our long-standing relationships with guests and owners. This is something you cannot buy. You can only earn it over decades.
With that in mind, I'm delighted to take advantage of our leaders being assembled here in the Westin Beijing Financial Street. I'll be introducing you to the four division presidents who lead our businesses around the world. Then Matt Avril, President of our Hotel Group, will share his global perspective on our efforts to bring each hotel back to and beyond pre-crisis profitability, something we're calling past the peak. I'll wrap up by sharing my thoughts on 2011 and then hand the call over to Vasant, who will give more color on our financial results and outlook. Vasant will also share some observations on our efforts to accelerate our growth in India. But first, I want to tell you about the third quarter. We said we would only upswing and we have. We gained share, growing faster than our competition and converted higher revenue into higher profits. The headline is that lodging recovery continues, unabated by the euro crisis, U.S. economic jitters on Malaysia and Japan. With occupancy rising at or above 2007 levels, it's no surprise that rates are on positive territory across each of our regions. Both business and leisure travel continued to show strength in the quarter. The great recession was remarkable in both its harrowing drop on the way the down and on its reliance on emerging markets on the way up. Nonetheless, the lodging recovery is following similar patterns to prior cycles. The strength of gateway cities are spreading to secondary markets. Luxury, thought to be dead by some, is alive and growing. These factors enabled us to beat the high end of our EBITDA guidance by $10 million and EPS by $0.06. International company operated REVPAR grew by 13% compared with 10% in North America. Worldwide owned hotels experienced a 12% increase in REVPAR, with hotels outside of North America again outperforming.
As you know, we're in the early stages of corporate renegotiations. But so far, we like what we see. Corporate buyers know that occupancy levels have already risen towards prior peaks, especially in the gateway cities where their associates need to stay. Indeed, customers are hearing stories about not being able to find a room regardless of price. Great expectations, therefore, adjusting to this new reality. In light of how far rates have fallen since 2008, we have a long way to go up. In fact, we've been working to change the mix of our business all year. So even though a large percentage of our room rates in 2010 were locked in at tight decreases, we were able to drive our company operated rates up by almost 5% in the third quarter through aggressive yield management.
Trends in group business also remained robust, particularly in the quarter for the quarter bookings. In September, for example, bookings for 2010 were up 19%. As we've entered the back half of 2010, 2011 bookings are picking up nicely. Again, looking at September bookings, revenues for 2011 jumped almost 30%, driven by room night volumes up 22% and rates up 7%. 2011 group pace has improved by almost 15 points over the last six months and is now flat. For comparison's sake, 2010 group pace at the same time last year was down 20% and is now up mid single digits. This makes us all confident that group volumes for 2011 could match 2008 with solid rate increases. This, by the way, also lays to rest any fears that technology or the downturn itself would permanently change group demand. As part of our past-the-peak efforts, we'll continue to focus on cost containment to drive margin improvement for the coming years. Our associates around the world are delivering on this promise with company operated margins up 140 basis points in the quarter. At the same time, our business is all about building brands through great experiences. So despite our focus on cost and despite hotels that are once again full, we're proud to report that guest satisfaction scores remain at record highs. This is translating into sustained increases in REVPAR index. We now expect full year worldwide share gains of roughly 100 basis points with Sheraton leading the charge.
Our Vacation Ownership business also performed well in the quarter. We managed our Tour Pro levels to focus on the most profitable channels. Correspondingly, close rates are steadily improving. We also completed a securitization that underscores the dramatic turnaround in capital markets since the dark days of 2009. We garnered advance rates of 93% and interest rates under 4%, our best ever. As a result, we will generate about $225 million in cash from the Vacation Ownership business this year, and we expect the business to generate similar amounts of cash over each of the next three years. We're also keeping a tight lid on corporate costs. Headcount is flat over 2009 and will remain flat through 2011. So despite adding new hotels, we expect SG&A spend in 2011 to be similar to 2010 levels. Let me underscore the importance of this cost discipline. We removed $100 million in costs in a sustainable way. This translates into corporate margins for our fee business that will be higher in 2011 and peak 2007 levels, despite much lower REVPAR.
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Matt Avril and our division presidents who run our four regions around the world. This team has deep market knowledge and experience. At the same time, they all have tremendous appetite to grow and improve our operations. So please let me begin by introducing you to our host here in China, Miguel Ko."

As the Chairman and President of Starwood Asia-Pacific division, I am seeing enormous changes in China since I first joined Sheraton in 1979 in internal audit. I was born in a small Chinese city called Shantou, near Guangzhou in Southern China. Although many of you may not have heard of Shantou, this secondary city now has a population of 5 million people. That's more than inner city limits of Los Angeles or roughly equal to Chicago and Houston combined. Today, Shantou does not have one single international class hotel. This will change as we recently find a deal to build a beautiful new Sheraton there. In fact, Sheraton is often the first five-star international hotel brand to enter a secondary or tertiary city in China. With over 30 hotels now already opened and another 34 in the pipeline, the brand's growth is accelerating. Sheraton benefits from decades of great trend recognition among Chinese travelers. And Sheraton in Chinese is called [indiscernible], which is literal translation meaning happiness comes in. That resonates very well with the Chinese.
Our existing hotels are at the best level for future growth. They are a great way to inspire our current partners to start new projects and also to attract new partners. Our hotels are also the perfect training ground for mix 86 hotels we expect to open over the coming years. Looking ahead, development in Asia-Pacific remains robust. This year, we already signed new contracts for more than 9,000 additional hotel rooms. Many investors focus on Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong when they think of China. But Starwood expects this growth will come from cities they have not heard of like Shantou. China has 171 cities with more than 1 million population. And we are working hard to enter these markets as demand grows. In a rapidly transforming economy, supply and demand will bounce around. Take Beijing, for example, where we have six hotels today and two more under construction. In the months following the Summer Olympics in 2008, this city is suffering from oversupply, but year-to-date REVPAR in Beijing is now up 27%. So after almost two decades of double-digit economic growth, I'm very bullish about Starwood's future here.
Outside the U.S., China's already Starwood's largest country, with 60 hotels representing eight of our brands in our fastest growing SPG market as well. Looking ahead, we will open more hotels in China than anywhere else in the Starwood's system. In the third quarter, Asia-Pacific REVPAR grew 21% or 16% excluding the possible impact from appreciating Asian currencies. In China, I'm happy to report a healthy balance of rates and occupancy increases. REVPAR growth in China is up 33%, with Shanghai, driven by the World Expo, leading the charge. Collectively, our year-to-date REVPAR index in China was 110, which speaks to the string of our hotel brands and experiences of our team operating the hotels. Most of our hotels are staffed with local Chinese managers. Chin Jing [ph] , Head of Operations, and Stephen [indiscernible] our development in China. I have worked with both of them for more than 20 years. With that, let me now turn the call over to Denise Coll, the President of our North American division."

The unit growth that Starwood's Asia-Pacific division is experiencing is truly amazing. But Starwood's other divisions, including North America, are well-positioned to capitalize in the outbound travel that will result from these rapidly growing economies and burdening middle classes. China is already one of the top 10 sources of inbound business to the U.S, and business is forecasted to double by 2014. Our global brand and heavy presence in key North American cities is driving even stronger growth to Starwood. For example, Chinese business at the Sheraton Toronto is up 50% year-on-year and some of our Hawaiian resorts, such as the Sheraton Waikiki and the Princess Kaiulani Hotel, saw inbound Chinese travel grow by over 100%. Frits had said this before, but let me say it again. Think of the Japanese travel boom of 1980s and multiply it by a factor of 10.
I started my career in operations with the Sheraton Boston in 1976 and have never forgotten the lessons that I've learned on the importance of delivering terrific guest experiences. After all, exceeding the expectations of guests, wherever they're from, is how Starwood delivers the REVPAR premiums that fuel our growth. Today, our guest satisfaction remains at record-high levels, just one of the reasons why our hotels are outperforming the competition. Occupancy levels have recovered nicely over the last year and are allowing us to push rates more aggressively as we actively manage the segmentation mix within our properties. As a result, REVPAR in our North America owned hotels jumped 11% despite tougher comparisons. ADR grew an impressive 8% and margins increased by 250 basis points. Company Operated REVPAR increased 10%, and we continue to gain share particularly with our incredibly successful Rediscover Sheraton campaign, the largest campaign in the brand's history.
Sheraton's momentum continues, enjoying year-to-date REVPAR index gain of almost 200 basis points over the competition. As we look forward, we have a unique opportunity to expand the breadth of our brands in North America. Our greatest opportunity may be in the specialty select service space. Our Aloft, Element and Four Points of our Sheraton brand are some of the best in the industry. But with only 152 hotels in this segment today, our brands are under-penetrated relative to our competitors. From Upscale to Luxury, our distinctive and compelling brand portfolio, are equipped by a development team with an arsenal that can be used to fit the needs of our owners and partners. For example, my hometown, Boston, recently caught up to the Beijing hotel count, with the openings at the Le Méridien Cambridge and the W Boston. Both of these properties have brought authentic hotel experiences to the city that did not exist previously.
The real interesting story about North America, both now and over the next few years, will be rate growth. The decade between 2001 and 2010 saw the slowest growth in road [ph] inventory since the Second World War. Given the capital constraint of the last few years, new supplies will remain limited in 2011 through 2014. As a result, we expect to see strong pricing power in the industry, particularly in the gateway cities where we have substantial Owned presence with over 13,000 rooms. With our focus on driving top line and strong flow-throughs through cost containment, we expect significant earnings growth in our Owned portfolio over the coming years. I'd now like to introduce Roeland Vos, the President of our Europe, Africa and Middle East division."

I'm torn as to where I should open, with good evening since it's 9:00 p.m. here Beijing, or good afternoon to our associates in [indiscernible] and our division or good morning to our U.S. investors.

I'm torn as to where I should open, with good evening since it's 9:00 p.m. here Beijing, or good afternoon to our associates in [indiscernible] and our division or good morning to our U.S. investors. Regardless to all of you, thanks for listening. I began my career as a management trainee at the Sheraton Brussels in 1982 and since then have rotated through multiple positions within Europe as well as in Latin America. One place where I have not been stationed is actually in my home country, the Netherlands, although we do have hotels there. Hotels as well as in 57 other countries throughout our region. Our portfolio encompasses at this point, 164 hotels in Europe and then furthermore, 86 hotels which are spread across Africa and the Middle East. And you should note that at this point, this footprint makes us far and away the largest operator in these resource-rich economies.
So let me start with Europe. While it's true that similar to the U.S., new supply in Western Europe is limited, we did have some notable growth success, such as the launch of the W brand. In its very first year of operations, the W Barcelona is exceeding all of our expectations and decided that we will soon open the W Leicester Square in London as well as the W in Paris in the Opera area. Now talking about Europe, it's important to distinguish between Western and Eastern Europe, where we do continue to see development opportunities in countries like Poland, Russia, Georgia and Turkey. We will have 23 new hotel openings in East and Central Europe over the next three years alone. The existing European hotels grew their REVPAR by 11% on a constant-currency basis versus last year, and most of this was led by a very strong business demand in the major gateway cities such as London, Paris or Frankfurt.
From there, turning to the Middle East. We, in fact, have a number of very, very diverse growing markets, and these are markets such Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, each of them with different dynamics but each with substantial growth potential. Think about it, for example, even with oil priced at $80 a barrel, hundreds of billions of dollars are flowing into the Middle East. And we know what that means, that means more hotels. It did in the 1970s, when the first Sheraton expanded across the region and it's happening today but on a much greater scale. We plan to open 20 hotels in the Middle East over the next three years. REVPAR in the Middle East declined over 3% as the UAE works through the supply that came on steam over the last few years, but here, the trends are also slowly improving. And we saw a rate turn positive in September and that was the first time since the fall in 2008.
Then similar to the Middle East, Africa has experienced substantial growth, and that's reflective of the massive investments and the economic transformations that are taking place in these countries. You may not know, but the Chinese investments in Africa in 2009 surpassed the African Development Bank and have increased tenfold over the past decade. So no wonder that 52 out of the 53 African countries are now projecting economical growth for the year 2011. We're starting to see some change in travel patterns with the Chinese inbound travel to some of the markets that have been doubling since 2007. And given the massive investment that they are making on the continent, we expect that this number will increase dramatically over time. Our African business is already quite profitable, and we look forward to have more or less 30% unit growth in the years to come. REVPAR in Africa increased 5% during the third quarter, as the rate increase was partially offset by some occupancy declines there. And with that, let me turn the call over to Osvaldo Librizzi, who is our President of Latin American division."

I joined this company 1975 as a controller at the Sheraton in my hometown of Buenos Aires. Over the last few decades, I've been working various locations throughout Latin America and have witnessed enormous changes as some of these emerging economies have matured. With over 500 million people and abundance of natural resources, Latin America represents yet another great source of growth for Starwood, with our strong presence in the Upper Upscale and Luxury segments, with 63 properties in the region. In Mexico, we have 22 properties and several more in the sideline. And in Brazil, we're actively looking to accelerate our growth with six hotels today and several others under discussion. As you can imagine, my region was hit hard by the H1N1 flu in 2009. Unfortunately, the continued fear of crime in Mexico is keeping tourists away, even though the vast majority of the violence is further moved from our resort locations in Punta Mita, Cancun, Cabo and Puerto Vallarta. Despite this situation, our Mexican properties saw REVPAR growth of 4% in the third quarter, with a result at our Europe locations. Mexico City enjoy REVPAR gains of 14% in the quarter, driven by strong business demands. We're also keeping a tight lid on cost and making use of centralized corporate resources whenever possible. This drove a nearly two-point increase in margins in the quarter before including last year's business interaction proceeds. 
In contrast to Mexico, South America results were very strong. With REVPAR gains of 46%, major cities such as Buenos Aires, Santiago, Rio and San Pablo, are enjoying occupancies at 2000 levels. And we are pushing rates by managing our business mix. These results of recent economy are well-positioned to benefit from the demand for commodity from other rapidly growing regions such as Asia-Pacific.

By way of introduction, I've been in the hospitality industry with Starwood for over 20 years, with a heavy focus on operations after beginning my career in finance and accounting. But then my current role as President of the Hotel Groups since 2008. My responsibilities are to drive global initiatives across the system, work closely with our hotel owners and through our associates around the world, bring our brands to life for our guests. Over the last two years, we've been focused on a number of global initiatives to drive performance. The key has been to work together across functions and geographies to analyze rollout and measure our business with a relentless eye on making us more efficient operators for our owners and better hosts for our guests.
During the past few earnings calls, Frits has talked about our initiatives to drive top line growth and contain cost. As mentioned, we're referring to this focus as past-the-peak. Right now, we are proud of our Company Operated margin improvements, up 160 basis points in North America and 130 basis points across the balance for our global operations. But we won't rest until we reach, if not surpass, 2007 levels. Past-the-peak is our organizing roadmap to get us there. As you've heard from Miguel, Denise, Roeland and Osvaldo, the recovery is playing out in different ways around the globe. Our teams in each region are all laser-focused on achieving key profitability for the hotels in our system. As our hotel margins are driven by top line results as well as cost, we are focused on initiatives to benefit both. Examples of this include improvements in our revenue management systems, its capabilities and training. Also, we have worked with our regions to reallocate sales resources to better align our organization with the way our clients want to do business with us and to free up resources to prospect for new accounts. These top line initiatives, coupled with our brand positioning, are driving our ability to outperform the competition.
Furthermore, it's clear that we're in the early stages of how these initiatives will further enhance our industry-leading results. On the cost side, we continue to focus on lean hotel operations and our procurement practices. We also benefit from great relationships with our owners and franchisees to identify and migrate best practices. Our goal is to hold cost growth to half the rate of inflation. But our efforts don't end with these internal initiatives. Our operations leadership teams work closely with our brand leadership to ensure that we are innovating in ways that establish emotional connections with our guests. By way of example, this includes improving the meetings experience through redesigning spaces and refining banquet and catering options for groups, providing a range of entertaining experiences that are cost effective for our corporate customers.
Looking back, hotel operating margins generally peaked in 2007, but remember, that cycle was interrupted by the credit crisis. So while the medium-term target is to get back to 2007 margins, over time, we believe we can exceed those levels. A big part of this, of course, will be determined by our ability to realize rate increases over the coming years as we continue to effectively manage our cost per occupied room. Let me now turn the call back over to Frits."

We want the investment community to spend more time hearing directly from our team. They are living evidence of just how difficult it is to replicate Starwood's current platform. We wholeheartedly believe that the growth and demand that comes from 3 billion people around the world reaching middle class is nothing less than the most extraordinary opportunity in our lifetime. We didn't let the crisis of 2008 and 2009 go to waste, and we'll certainly not miss this incredible opportunity. I'd like to close with some preliminary thoughts on 2011. As I mentioned before, the positive trends in transient and group business continued. Business travel is robust and has filled our hotels in the critical Monday through Thursday periods, driving compression and allowing us to begin to recover rate. Specifically, we expect corporate rates to be up high single digits. Group business in 2011 is also trending well, with strong volumes and steadily improving rate. And the overall trajectory of business appears to have stabilized to current levels. Of course, visibility remains limited and the macroeconomic picture in the developed world remains uncertain. However, if the current trends continue, we would expect to deliver worldwide REVPAR growth of 7% to 9% in 2011. With our demonstrated ability to control costs, we expect that this REVPAR growth will result in an EBITDA within the range of $950 million to $980 million.
But before I hand over to Vasant, I want to make one final comment on business in the United States. Like many of you, our base case expects America's economy to muddle through for the next few years. Despite this, we're cautiously confident about our prospects. You've already heard about how supply's constrained and will grow slowly over the coming three to four years. That makes our industry very different from the economy as a whole, but has significant slight [ph] capacity. On the demand side, we're encouraged to see that profits of U.S. companies are at historic high. Balance sheets are also in good shape. So companies have the means to invest and are going after hard-earned growth. We know that means travel. As one industry executive put it, you don't grow revenues by sitting behind your desk. We stand to gain from this, given our high-end brand portfolio, and as we've said, our business is 75% b to b. As for leisure demand, it's true that consumers' balance sheets are not as robust as those companies. But for households that made more than $100,000 per year, there's a lot less leverage. And these households account for about half of our U.S. consumer spending. So higher-income consumers have the means to travel and are doing so. For the next few years, all of this points to occupancies and rates at high-end hotels well above what you'd expect given tepid economic growth. In fact, that's what we're already seeing. Now let me turn the call over to Vasant."

I grew up in Bombay, now known as Mumbai, and left India 30 years ago. India today is a very different country than the one I grew up in. The widespread optimism, the boundless confidence, the determination of younger Indians to succeed and their willingness to take big risks is extraordinary. I've been back regularly over the years, and since the late 90s, I watched the pace of change accelerate and become irreversible. It's been exciting to be re-engaged with India in the business context of Starwood. For the past few years, I've been going to India once a quarter to help Miguel and our team in India grow our business, building on long-standing relationships and to be an advocate for our Indian effort at the center. Here's where we are in India today. There are 29 hotels opened and 18 under construction. We're already the largest five-star system in India, larger than the international as well as the domestic hotel chains of the high-end. Sheraton has been established in India since the 70s. We have a great Le Méridien footprint, its iconic luxury collection hotels with our longtime partner ITC. We've just launched Westin with five spectacular hotels in the key cities, along with two Four Points and two Alofts.
We expect to sign our first W and St. Regis hotels soon, and we're well on our way to achieving our goal of having 100 open or pipeline hotels in India within five years. We're well represented in the major cities and moving now as we have in China to the next few cities. There is strong local team on the ground and a high-quality owner base. Those of you who have been to India knows that infrastructure is a major bottleneck. The Indian government is making a big push to fix this problem over the next decade. This will help ramp up hotel construction activity. Miguel, who has been involved with both India and China for many years, will tell you that India today reminds them a lot of China 10 to 15 years ago. We fully expect India to grow to be our third largest market after the U.S. and China.
With that, let me move on to our outlook starting with the balance of the year. As you have heard, the global recovery continues. We remain on high alert for any signs that the trend is changing, and at this point, there are no indications that it is. I feel very comfortable that we will end the year with EBITDA of $840 million to $845 million, which is at the high end of our prior guidance range of $815 million to $845 million. We expect 27 global REVPAR growth at company operated hotels of 8% to 9% in constant dollars, also at the high-end of our prior range. All in all, a substantially better outcome in 2010 than we had anticipated at this time last year. This implies a Q4 EBITDA range of $230 million to $235 million. I want to point out that our year-over-year comparisons are muddied by a variety of factors in Q4. In our Vacation Ownership business, we had a large gain from securitization last year, as well as the accounting change. In the Owned Hotel business, we have some asset sales, as you know, and some onetime items that helped our Latin American business last year. In the fees and other income line, we had a termination fee last year. In SG&A, we have higher incentive compensation this year. Also, we had some items moving between Q3 and Q4 this year, helping Q3 to some extent in reducing Q4. Stripped with this noise, the underlying rate of growth remains strong as reflected in our outlook for 2011.
We expect global REVPAR growth at Company Operated Hotels in Q4 of 7% to 9% in constant dollars. This is a small sequential slowdown from Q3, primarily due to the fact that we are now lacking a strong Q4 recovery last year. As an example, in North America, REVPAR growth recovered by 10 whole percentage points between Q3 and Q4 2009. As it has been all year, corporate transient business is the primary driver of growth. As you have seen, we had good ADR growth by inflicting lower rate to leisure business with higher rate to corporate business. And we expect that to continue into Q4. Group booking trends continue to improve. In North America, September was the strongest group booking month of the year, indicating that companies continue to be willing to make commitments to future years. And there's healthy growth in lead for group business around the world. The booking window, while longer than it was earlier in the year, is still shorter than normal. And we continue to have significant in the quarter, for the quarter business.
So what does all this suggest for 2011? As you have heard Frits say before, the global economy is dealing with a variety of unusual challenges. In developed markets, unemployment remains stubbornly high, and there are significant concerns with mounting public and private debt. There's a growing belief that the pace for recovery will be slow, the much discussed new normal scenario. On the other hand, product [ph] profits are strong and global companies are capitalizing on the rapid growth in emerging markets. The lodging supply outlook in developed markets is the best it has been in decades, especially in the major metros. As a result of the characteristics of this recovery, REVPAR in the top 100 global cities, as defined by GDP and the rival, has been growing at twice the rate of national or regional cities.
Our brands of hotels cater to the high end, primarily corporate traveler, and are more concentrated in these global cities. As a result, we have recovered faster and today, have been relatively immune to the malaise elsewhere. Hopefully, this will remain the case. Based on what we see today and the forward-looking indicators we currently have, the most probable 2011 scenario in developed markets for our business is a normal cyclical recovery. Emerging markets have been the engines of the global recovery so far, led by China and India. We, as you know, have the best emerging markets platform and pipeline in our industry, and as such, are benefiting from the secular growth opportunity here. In these markets, while supply growth has been strong, demand growth has continued to be very robust, comfortably absorbing the additional room as Miguel described in China. While there's always the risk of overheating and boom and bust cycles as we have seen in Dubai, we do not think this is likely in 2011 in our key markets in Asia, Latin America and Africa. As you've seen in the numbers, Mexico and the Gulf continue to struggle and we're not anticipating a big change in either geography next year. Most of our emerging markets will be lacking some hefty growth from 2010 and will not have events like the World Expo in Shanghai that helped China. As such, it would be reasonable to expect that the rate of growth will slow down sequentially year-over-year, and the growth delta between emerging and developed markets will narrow. Again, based on what we know today, this would be our likely scenario for emerging markets.  In aggregate, this gets us to our 2011 outlook of 7% to 9% REVPAR growth in constant dollars for Company Operated Hotels globally, which corresponds to an EBITDA range of $950 million to $980 million,  up 13% to 16% and an EPS range of $1.44 to $1.55, up 32% to 40%. Exchange rates have been very volatile lately and very monetary. If current rates hold, reported dollar REVPAR growth could be about 100 basis points or so higher. We expect all margins to improve 150 to 200 basis points with a focus on revenue management and continued cost control. Our Vacation Ownership business will be flattish, with a continued focus on cash generation. Overhead will only grow 1% to 2% as we hold the line on headcount in developed markets while investing in emerging markets and incentive compensation normalizes.
Last year at this time, we had indicated that the make-or-break variable for 2010 was a strength of late-breaking corporate trends in business. As we all now know, corporate trends in business came back strong, stronger than many had anticipated. As we look forward to 2011, the team make-or-break variable is going to be rates, and so far, rates are on the right track. It's too early to know how our corporate rate negotiations with our major accounts end up. As we've indicated previously, we're targeting high single-digit increases. Our corporate customers are generally accepting that rates will be moving up. As always, there will be a bell arc and we will let you know in February what the outcome is. Meanwhile, we will continue to aggressively manage mix to our enhanced revenue management system. Mix management is what is moving rate up right now as we've split lower rated leisure with higher rated corporate business. In markets with good compression like New York, London and others, we can and are moving the entire rate structure up. As you heard from Frits, we expect good group rooms growth in 2011. As always, greater locations will lag in the group segments since we have business on the books for 2011 that is booked in 2008 and 2009. While all the indications are that 2011 will be a normal recovery year for the hotel industry globally, there are always risks out there which we will need to closely monitor. Sharp moves in exchange rates will de-stabilize economies. The unknown side effects of qualitative using in the U.S. and austerity in Europe will need to be closely watched. The efforts in emerging markets to keep inflation controlled and prevent acid levels could also have unintended consequences. Prudence requires that we acknowledge that alternate scenarios are possible and remain on high alert for early warning signs. Plus or minus one point of REVPAR globally impacts EBITDA by plus or minus $15 million. Plus or minus one point change in REVPAR, solely due to exchange rate moves, impacts EBITDA by around $4 million. So you can run your own scenarios. We would, of course, keep you updated on our quarterly calls. Moving on to a few balance sheet items. Excluding debt associated with securitized receivables, net debt at the end of Q3 was under $2.5 billion. Our leverage ratio as measured for our bank line is now under 3.5 *times, well below current levels. More importantly, we finished the quarter with over $250 million in excess cash, i.e. cash in excess of our normal working capital. We have no borrowings under our revolver, which remains fully available, and no bond maturities until May 2012. So our liquidity of leverage position gets stronger every day. We still expect to receive a $200 million-plus tax refund before the end of the year. With the refund, we expect our excess cash balance to climb to $500 million by year-end and our net debt to be under $2.3 billion. With that, I'll turn this back to Jay."

You're right that on the international Owned Hotel side last year in Latin America, we received business interruption insurance from the impact of the big H1N1 issue in Mexico. We caught that in the third quarter. That does affect year-over-year comparisons for that business. In Europe, there's been a couple of issues. One, REVPAR growth in general was lower single digits that will make margin growth a little tougher. But also, just like we've had in our SG&A, the incentive comp adjustments at the hotel level, where last year, incentive comp was coming down, this year, it's going up. That does make some comparison adjustments. If we just adjust for those sort of on a run rate basis, the margins would actually have been up 100 basis points. The other question was the management franchise fees, that's really driven by the fact that our incentive fees are largely non-U.S. Our GOP levels are quite high outside the U.S., and these are first dollar incentives. So a rule of thumb we have sort of a 1:1.5 ratio between revenue growth and incentive fee growth. And REVPAR growth, as you know, is going to be higher than revenue growth next year too. So if you apply that ratio, you get to the kind of fee growth levels we have. And then the other fee is related on the U.S. side. It's a small incentive fee, so it doesn't really move things that much next year."

However, these cities are also growing very fast, so we feel that in looking at the medium-term, we balance that altogether, but in the short-term, there are some short-term challenges in certain parts of a city more than the entire city."

The past-the-peak effort is based on our observation and objective that many hotels within our system, whether we own them or manage them on behalf of our owners, are still at levels that they were in 2007, in some cases, back to pre-9/11. And if we have a sustained recovery around the world, even if it's low in the developed markets, given the constraint on supply, as well as the rapid economic growth in developing markets, we should be able to get to those levels. And what Matt's doing is leading a series of initiatives from revenue management to sales force allocation to lean operations at the hotel level to procurement, as looking at, literally, all the levels as you go through a typical hotel P&L to get back to those peak levels. Exactly when we get there and the trajectory for that, as you can imagine, is largely driven by what happens to REVPAR growth because we can control expenses on the cost side. We've done that, we'll continue to do it, and we talked about a goal of being at roughly half of inflation. So the degree to which we can get to and exceed peak EBITDA margins and absolute EBITDA levels will be a function of how steeply REVPAR increases. And that, obviously, looking past 2011, is anybody's guess. We've given you a range of what we think overall global REVPAR will be for us system-wide. But beyond that, obviously, it's very hard to tell. That would be speculating at that point."

I just want to point out that if you go back to our press release, you'll see on Page 3 that in constant dollars, it was 11.5%. The reason it is as low as it is internationally, is the bulk of our Luxury collection footprint happens to be in Europe. And we do have quite few St. Regises also in Europe. And if you look at the impact of Forex on Europe, which you can see again on Page 3, it is almost 12 whole points in this quarter.

What we're seeing is, in contrast to absolute radio silence in 2009, is an increased level of interest in buying assets. But I wouldn't say even though we're seeing a lot of money building up on the sidelines that we have a complete array of eager buyers. What you see today in terms of transactions in North America have largely been focused by large, well-capitalized REITs looking at hotels that are in great shape in gateway cities, and by the way, paying pretty substantial prices for those hotels. But the full range of buyers entering the market isn't the phenomenon that we've seen yet, nor have we seen the full range of hotels being sold. So while certainly the environment for buying and selling hotels is considerably better than where it was, we think it will continue to get better. And we'll look to determine exactly when that means we'll sell hotels along the way. As you've seen, we have engaged in some transactions where we've been able to find an opportunity that makes a lot of sense for us, but we'll probably -- I'm not going to give a timeframe. We're probably some time away from being really into a mid-cycle correction with a full range of buyer, and therefore, an opportunity to do a bigger transaction. Nonetheless, just to be clear, and as we said on previous calls, that remains our priority and it's something we will get after when we think the timing is just right."
