I’m very pleased to share the news that PACCAR has earned a net profit for the 71 consecutive year. This remarkable achievement has been attained due to the hard work and dedication of our 15,000 outstanding employees who have delivered th",894,"Good morning. I’m very pleased to share the news that PACCAR has earned a net profit for the 71 consecutive year. This remarkable achievement has been attained due to the hard work and dedication of our 15,000 outstanding employees who have delivered the highest quality products and services in our history against a back drop of a very difficult recession.
I’m very proud of their performance as it shines a light on the consistent proactive approach that has enabled PACCAR to achieve the best shareholder performance in our industry worldwide. On that note, I’d like to personally thank our long term shareholders including the Pigott family for their support and encouragement during the challenging times of 2009. As has been done and other lien years, I and some of the senior executive team did not earn an annual bonus last year due to the effects of the recession.
Looking at 2010, the year ahead will continue to be challenging for many businesses. The economy is still in the middle of a recession. As long as unemployment is at levels close to 10%, and housing starts are at 50 year lows, freight growth will be muted and truck sales will only gradually increase.
The good news is that PACCAR’s fourth quarter results were our best profit quarter in 2009. PACCAR earned $46.1 million in the fourth quarter 2009, compared to $113.1 million in the prior years fourth quarter. fourth quarter 2009 results include a onetime expense of $11.4 million resulting from the retroactive effects of a New Mexican Corporate Income Tax Law enacted in December 2009.
Fourth quarter net sales and financial service revenues were $2.2 billion, compared to $2.9 billion reported for the comparable period in 2008. Regular dividends of $0.54 per share were declared during 2009, and as many of you know, PACCAR has paid a dividend every year since 1941. It’s a long time.
During the last decade, PACCAR’s regular dividends have increased by 240% and PACCAR’s average annual shareholder return is 19.1% for the last 10 years compared to the S&P 500’s return of a negative 1% annually. Reviewing our business, there may be a small improvement in truck and aftermarket sales driven primarily by the industries need to begin replacing an aging national truck fleet.
PACCAR is in excellent position to grow due to the strength of our dealers worldwide, a robust finance company the most seasoned and experienced management team in the business and the highest quality products in the industry. As I enter my 32 year at PACCAR, this promises to be one of the most exciting years. As we begin the installation of the PACCAR MX Engine into Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks this summer.
The PACCAR Engine successfully completed a grueling 50 million mile test schedule and is ready for the North American market. Of course, as many of you know, PACCAR through our DAF truck group has been designing and building engines for 50 years, so the entry into North America is a logical step. We’re pleased that our PACCAR Engines continue to earn industry quality awards.
Speaking of quality, PACCAR reinforced its industry leading quality and resale value in 2009. Kenworth trucks were again ranked highest by the J.D. Power Heavy Duty Customer Satisfaction surveys and the over the road, pick up and delivery and dealer service segments.
Peterbilt was also ranked highest in the conventional medium duty truck segment. PACCAR was honored earlier this year by earning the J.D. Power Founders award for our 25 years of quality leadership and DAF earned the U.K.’s Motor Transport Award for Fleet Truck of the Year for the ninth time.
Looking at the markets, the 15-ton plus truck market in Europe is estimated to be between 150,000 and 180,000 units this year compared to 168,000 last year. U.S. and Canadian retail truck sales are estimated to improve to be in the range of 110,000 to 140,000 units this year compared to 108,000 in 2009.
Now, even though first quarter 2010 industry sales will be helped somewhat by the demand for trucks with 2009 engines, it’s estimated that first quarter truck production will be 5% to 10% lower than the fourth quarter as customers adjust to the $8,000 to $10,000 price increase for 2010 EPA emission engines.
Once again, the good news is that PACCAR’s strong performance places the company in a leading position when industry demand improves to a more normal replacement range of 225,000 to 250,000 units in the U.S. and Canada and the same levels in Europe.
Looking elsewhere in our business, PACCAR continues to invest in its factories, and we appreciate that many of the analysts on this call have toured our facilities and have seen firsthand the superb quality that is represented in every facet of the operations and we thank you for taking the time to do that.
PACCAR’s excellent balance sheet and strong operating cash flow of over $1.3 billion have enabled ongoing investments in projects such as new diesel engines, expanded vehicle ranges, and annual factory efficiency improvements of 5% to 7%, and finally, PACCAR’s finance companies have demonstrated remarkable resiliency due to the rigoroused customer credit reviews, proactive management of challenging accounts, and good access to the capital markets. We look forward to 2010 and the opportunities to grow the company.
Thank you and look forward to your questions.

It’s certainly at the high end for the last couple of decades. I think that’s a fair assessment, which means as business improves, the economy generates some strength. You’ll see better parts and service business particularly at the dealerships and eventually you’re going to have many of the fleets wanting to replace those vehicles and get lower operating cost product running.
I think the industry is in good shape. There’s been a little bit of a shake out over the last couple of years, but compared to the number of fleets that went out of business in ‘01 and ‘02 it’s about half that level. So transportation particularly in North America, but also Europe is in good shape.

You’ve got an older fleet, customers that are still running are doing fairly well, they see the advantage of repairing and replacing their vehicles and the dealers, our dealers in particular are on very strong position. Their inventory on new trucks has come down significantly in Europe, in North America; their inventory is at probably five to six year lows.
So they’ve got the operating cash and the where with all to focus on the parts and service, so I think we’re looking at some improvement on parts business.

I think that’s still being discussed at governmental levels, but I think it would be good for those countries in general, for all industries if they were extended. So that’s an important consideration, but in terms of just the overall business, I think DAF is in good shape. It continues to grow. It’s got a great recognition as being the quality leader and here in North America, I think we’re in very good shape attaining record market levels in the medium duty product and close to industry leadership in terms of the market on the heavy duty and I think everybody is poised to really generate some good results if the economy can cooperate with us.

As we look at the number of bankruptcies for fleets, which we typically look at as companies have five and more trucks for this recession which has been a tough one as we all know. We’ve got about 6,000 companies go into bankruptcy or leave the industry.
When you look at the recession in ‘01 and ‘02 there was 12,000 companies that went into bankruptcy. So what that tells you on a macro level is that, a lot of the weak players have obviously exited and here we are in a recessions that probably 10 times as worse of the one in ‘01-’02, but you only have half as many companies going into bankruptcy, which lets you know that to the people who are here are better financed, better capitalized, probably have better customers paying their bills on time.
So that’s the good news for our industry that the people operating are doing better, they’re managing their companies in a very excellent fashion, which is good for us and obviously has an impact on repossessions. Ron has got some additional color on repossessions.

So the old days of owner operators although it’s romantic, I think it’s pretty much gone away over the last decade.

294721,100757787,56673,"PACCAR Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-20-2010",2010-04-20,"Earnings Calls","PACCAR Inc","Executives","Good morning. PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the first quarter of 2010. PACCAR’s first quarter sales and financial services revenue were $2.2 billion compared to $1.99 billion in the first quarter last year.Net income was $",778,"Good morning. PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the first quarter of 2010. PACCAR’s first quarter sales and financial services revenue were $2.2 billion compared to $1.99 billion in the first quarter last year.
Net income was $68 million compared to $26 million a year ago. PACCAR’s financial results reflect the benefits of higher truck deliveries in North America and an improvement in aftermarket part sales and financial services worldwide. PACCAR results for the first quarter benefited from a small pre-buy in the US and Canadian markets as customers took delivery of new vehicles with pre-EPA 2010 engines.
As I have mentioned in previous calls, I am very proud of our 15,000 employees who have delivered outstanding performance to our shareholders and customers in a very challenging recession. PACCAR’s strong balance sheet and positive cash flow have enabled the company to continuously reinvest in the business, enhance operating efficiency, and introduce new products such as the PACCAR MX engine, which will be installed in Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks this summer.
And on a personal note, I appreciate that many analysts on this call were able to view our many new products at the Mid-America Truck Show last month. I am pleased to share with you that we received over 1,500 orders for MX engines to be installed in Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks. We expect PACCAR’s build rate in the second quarter to be comparable to the first quarter. DAF production may increase slightly, while Kenworth and Peterbilt production will be lower as the North American truck industry adjusts to the new more expensive EPA 2010 engines.
PACCAR Financial Services revenue was $246 million in the first quarter compared to $255 million a year ago. PACCAR Financial’s first quarter pretax income was $28 million compared to $15 million earned in Q1 2009, primarily due to better financed margins and a reduction in the provision for credit losses. The credit loss provision for the first quarter of 2010 was $21.7 million compared to $25 million in 2009. Just as a reminder, there was an $11 million reduction in finance margin in the first quarter of 2009, due to the adjustment from mark-to-market effects on derivative contracts.
Other news in the market, used truck values in North America have increased by approximately $2,500 per vehicle for one-to-two year-old trucks, especially Kenworth and Peterbilt. PACCAR’s conservative approach to business complemented by an AA minus credit rating enables PACCAR Financial to offer competitive financing to Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers and customers around the world. As you are aware, some of our competitors have exited the finance business or formed financing partnerships due to their weakening market positions.
PACCAR Financial on the other hand has excellent access to the medium term note markets. In March of this year, PACCAR Financial sold a three-year $300 million floating rate note with an equivalent fixed rate of 2.17%. More good news, PACCAR’s quarterly aftermarket parts revenue of $505 million was the highest since the fourth quarter of 2008, as our dealers have more customers increasing their service business.
Reviewing our dealers and customers, our 1,900 Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF dealer locations are leading the commercial vehicle industry in customer service, and many of our customers are benefiting from reasonable diesel prices, low driver turnover, and year-on-year increases in freight tonnage, even though freight rates continue to be low.
Looking at the truck markets around the world, we expect a 15-ton plus market in Europe to be between 150,000 to 180,000 units this year comparable to the 168,000 in 2009. Some of you may know that DAF is currently the Number 2 truck manufacturer in Europe with over 16% profitable market share. Let’s see how that goes as the year progresses.
US and Canadian industry retail truck sales are estimated to improve to the range of 110,000 to 140,000 units this year compared to 108,000 last year. As you know, the industry US and Canada received about 20,000 orders in the first quarter, so it ought to be a slightly stronger second half. PACCAR’s investment of $3.8 billion in the last decade has enabled the company to enhance its operating efficiency, develop new products, strengthen its dealer network, become an industry leader in information technology, and deliver shareholder equity of over $5 billion.
Even with of that, there continues to be many challenges facing the transportation industry worldwide, impacted by high unemployment and low home construction and car production. The good news is that PACCAR’s balanced approach in all phases of the business cycle positioned us to generate improving results as the global economy recovers.
Thank you and we look forward to your questions.

You know, we look at the typical cycle and we have all been through many, many cycles in our careers. I usually see about a three-step process. One, is to see some improvement in the parts and services, customers go back to the dealerships to, you know, repair their existing vehicles. And as freight increases, you see some increased demand in values on used trucks and we are starting to see that, which is positive. And then finally, as used truck values increased to a point where customers are saying, you know, there may be some advantages to buying a new truck and there is enough freight to justify that, you see the new truck orders start to tick in. So, it’s really, you know, a pretty normal three-step process. We have seen it for decades, and right now, we are seeing our customers having a little better freight, which means, we are now taking the vehicles in to get the maintenance done, which is improving parts sales.
I mentioned in my comments that used truck values have gone up about $2,500 per vehicle over the last year or two, particularly for late model vehicles, we still have ways to go on that. And then, you know, sometime in the medium-term future, we hope to see new truck orders improving. The general economy is still, there are a lot of challenges out there.

There is some improvement, and I think over the course of the year, we hope to see more of that. Obviously the housing industry is a big factor in terms of freight movement and that’s still a 50-year low on home construction. So, that’s going to take a couple of years to come back. So, I am not sure what the normal cycle recovery is out of worst recession 50 years, but there is some positive signs to say, used trucks are looking good.
Our suppliers are really in good shape. We have an excellent collaborative partnership. We train our suppliers in Six Sigma, we are one of the few companies in the industry that actually will purchase major capital pieces of equipment and install them in our suppliers to help them improve quality and improve capacity and reduce their costs. We retain ownership on this piece of equipment, but so suppliers overall are in very good shape and our team has done a fantastic job around the world. So, the good thing is when suppliers have ideas and have many great ideas, PACCAR is the first place they call, because it truly is a partnership. We want our suppliers to make money, and I am not sure others, other manufacturers are of that same mind. So, it will recover and PACCAR is in good shape to take advantage of it when it does.

PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the first quarter of 2010. PACCAR's first-quarter sales and financial services revenue were $2.2 billion compared to $1.99 billion in the first quarter last year. Net income was $",774,"Good morning.  PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the first quarter of 2010. PACCAR's first-quarter sales and financial services revenue were $2.2 billion compared to $1.99 billion in the first quarter last year. 
Net income was $68 million compared to $26 million a year ago. PACCAR's financial results reflect the benefits of higher truck deliveries in North America and an improvement in aftermarket parts sales and financial services worldwide. PACCAR's results for the first quarter benefited from a small pre-buy in the U.S. and Canadian markets as customers took delivery of new vehicles with pre-EPA 2010 engines. 
As I have mentioned in previous calls, I'm very proud of our 15,000 employees who have delivered outstanding performance to our shareholders and customers in a very challenging recession. PACCAR's strong balance sheet and positive cash flow have enabled the company to continuously reinvest in the business, enhance operating efficiency and introduce new products such as the PACCAR MX engine which will be installed in Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks this summer. And on a personal note, I appreciate that many analysts on this call were able to view our many new products at the Mid-America Truck Show last month. 
I am pleased to share with you that we received over 1,500 orders for MX engines to be installed in Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks. We expect PACCAR's build rate in the second quarter to be comparable to the first quarter. DAF production may increase slightly, while Kenworth and Peterbilt productions will be lower as the North America truck industry adjust to the new, more expensive EPA 2010 engines. 
PACCAR Financial Services revenue was $246 million in the first quarter compared to $255 million a year ago. PACCAR Financial's first quarter pretax income was $28 million compared to $15 million earned in Q1 2009, primarily due to better finance margins and a reduction in the provision for credit losses. The credit loss provision for the first quarter 2010 was $21.7 million compared to $25 million in 2009. Just as a reminder, there was an $11 million reduction in finance margin in the first quarter of 2009 due to an adjustment for mark-to-market effects on derivative contracts. 
Other news in the market. Used truck values in North America have increased by approximately $2,500 per vehicle for one- to two-year-old trucks, especially Kenworth and Peterbilts. PACCAR's conservative approach to business complemented by its AA minus credit rating enables PACCAR Financial to offer competitive pricing to Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers and customers around the world. As you're aware, some of our competitors have exited the finance business or formed financial partnerships due to their weakening market positions.  PACCAR Financial on the other hand has excellent access to the medium-term note markets. In March of this year, PACCAR Financial sold a three-year $300 million floating rate note with an equivalent fixed rate of 2.17%. 
More good news. PACCAR's quarterly aftermarket parts revenue of $505 million was the highest since the fourth quarter of 2008, as our dealers have more customers increasing their service business. Reviewing our dealers and customers. Our 1,900 Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealer locations are leading the commercial vehicle industry in customer service and many of our customers are benefiting from reasonable diesel prices, low driver turnover and year-on-year increases in freight tonnage even though freight rates continue to be low. 
Looking at the truck markets around the world, we expect the 15-ton plus market in Europe to be between 150,000 to 180,000 units this year comparable to the 168,000 in 2009. Some of you may know that DAF is currently the number two truck manufacturer in Europe with over 16% profitable market share. We'll see how that goes as the year progresses. 
U.S. and Canadian industry retail truck sales are estimated to improve to the range of 110,000 to 140,000 units this year compared to 108,000 last year. As you know, the industry in U.S. and Canada received about 20,000 orders in the first quarter. So likely to be slightly stronger second half. 
PACCAR's investment of $3.8 billion in the last decade has enabled the company to enhance its operating efficiency, develop new products, strengthen its dealer network, become an industry leader in information technology and deliver shareholder equity of over $5 billion. But even with all that, there continues to be many challenges facing the transportation industry worldwide, impacted by high unemployment and low home construction and car production.  The good news is that PACCAR's balanced approach in all phases of the business cycle position us to generate improved results as the global economy recovers. 
Thank you, and we look forward to your questions."

We look at the typical cycle, and we've all been through many, many cycles in our careers. Usually see about a three-step process. One, you start to see some improvement in the parts and service as customers go back to the dealerships to repair their existing vehicles. As freight increases, you see some increased demand on values on used trucks and we're starting to see that, which is positive. And then finally, as used truck values increase to a point to where customers are saying, ""You know there may be some advantages to buying a new truck and there's enough freight to justify that,"" you see the new truck orders start to tick in. So it's really a pretty normal three-step process. We've seen it for decades and right now, we're seeing our customers having a little better freight which means they're now taking their vehicles in to get the maintenance done, which is improving parts sales. I mentioned in my comments that used truck values have gone up about $2,500 per vehicle over the last year, too, particularly for late model vehicles. There's still a ways to go on that. And then some time in the medium term future, we hope to see new truck orders improve. The general economy is still -- got a lot of challenges out there."

So we have to get the general economy going, and I'm not talking about the financial sector, just the basic blocking and tackling of people making things in this country to get freight really going again. There is some improvement and I think, over the course of the year, we hope to see more of that. Obviously, the housing industry is a big factor in terms of freight movement and that's still at a 50-year low on home construction. So that's going to take a couple of years to come back. So I'm not sure what the normal cycle recovery is out of the worst recession in 50 years. But there are some positive signs. Let's say used trucks are looking good. Our suppliers are really in good shape. We've got an excellent collaborative partnership. We train our suppliers in Six Sigma. We are one of the few companies in the industry that actually will purchase major capital piece of equipment and install them in our suppliers to help them improve quality and improve capacity and reduce their cost. We retain ownership on this piece of equipment. But our suppliers, overall, are in very good shape and our teams have done a fantastic job around the world. And the good thing is when suppliers have ideas and have many great ideas, PACCAR is the first place they call because it truly is a partnership. We want our suppliers to make money and I'm not sure other manufacturers are of that same mind. It'll recover and PACCAR is in good shape to take advantage of it when it does."

And then you have Spain, Portugal and Italy that are probably having a little more serious economic challenges. Central Europe is sort of being impacted in a negative way. So there's lots of things going on there. It's going to take some time to settle out. The good news is that people love the DAF Trucks and they're buying those but certainly not at the levels we saw two, three years ago."

PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the second quarter of 2010. PACCAR's second quarter sales and Financial Services revenue were $2.46 billion compared to $1.85 billion in the second quarter of 2009, a 33% improvement",1005,"Good morning. PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the second quarter of 2010. PACCAR's second quarter sales and Financial Services revenue were $2.46 billion compared to $1.85 billion in the second quarter of 2009, a 33% improvement. Net income improved to $99 million compared to $26 million a year ago. I'm very proud of our 16,000 employees who have delivered outstanding performance to our shareholders and customers in an uneven and unsettled global economy. PACCAR's financial results reflect the benefits of higher truck deliveries worldwide and a continued improvement in aftermarket parts sales and Financial Services results. However, the North American and European truck markets remained at historically low levels. In the U.S. and Canada, our customers are starting to adjust to the higher- priced vehicles that have resulted from the EPA 2010 emission change. The European truck registrations for the second quarter improved 17% compared to the first, but despite that favorable increase, the European truck market year-over-year is still down.
We expect the 15-ton market registrations in Europe to be between 160,000 units and 170,000 units this year, comparable to the 168,000 units last year. U.S. and Canadian retail truck sales are estimated to improve to a range of 110,000 to 130,000 units this year compared to 108,000 last year. While the global economic outlook is still uneven, the truck market is stabilizing. PACCAR truck build in the third quarter is expected to be slightly better than the second quarter. I would note that production at our DAF factories in Europe will have their regularly scheduled two-week summer shutdown.
We discussed during the analyst call in April the three-step process that the truck industry usually progresses as it recovers from a recession. First is improvement in parts and service, second in used truck values and third is more truck orders. In the U.S. and Canada, parts sales were up 10% to 15%, and used truck pricing increased 10%. The good news is that industry new truck orders for the first six months compared to a year ago are up 30%. Many of the orders are for production during the next six to 12 months. In Europe, a similar situation with parts business and used truck pricing improving by 10% to 15%. In Europe, as I previously noted, new truck sales are 15% lower than last year due to a slow first quarter, but the second half of the year should be up 20% compared to 2009.
More good news is that DAF is the leader in the European market for on-highway tractor sales and has now achieved a record overall market share of 16.3%, the second highest market share in Europe. It's been a wonderful success story over the last decade for DAF.
DAF is steadily progressing toward its medium-term goal of 20% market share in Europe. DAF heavy truck production is up 25% from first to second quarter this year and we expect that their production will be up 25% for the remainder of the year. Kenworth and Peterbilt build rates will be up 10% to 15% from the second to the third quarter.
Our customers are benefiting from a 7% year-on-year improvement in freight volumes, higher freight rates and stable diesel prices. They continue to increase the utilization of their fleets, which in turn is driving increased aftermarket parts and service business for our dealers. PACCAR's aftermarket parts sales increased to $538 million for the second quarter, the highest level since the third quarter of 2008.
Turning to margins, margins for trucks was primarily driven by higher pricing due to improved demand. PACCAR's strong balance sheet and positive cash flow have enabled the company to continuously reinvest in the business, enhance operating efficiency and develop innovative new products such as the PACCAR MX diesel engine. I'm pleased to note that we're now installing the MX engine in approximately 15% of Kenworth and Peterbilt vehicles. Assembly of the PACCAR MX engines began last month at our industry-leading manufacturing facility in Columbus, Mississippi. Early feedback from our customers of the PACCAR MX engine has been excellent. On a broader scale in the U.S. and Canada, the substantial majority of Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks are being produced with the EPA 2010 engines. I know a number of you are interested in it, but there appears to be about a 5% shift to 13-liter engines year-on-year.
PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $239 million in the second quarter compared to $247 million a year ago, reflecting a lower level of assets. PACCAR's Financial second quarter pretax income was $34 million, more than double the $16 million earned in Q2 of 2009. This was achieved due to better finance margins and a reduction in the provision for credit losses. The credit loss provision for the second quarter 2010 was $20.2 million compared to $29.1 million in 2009.
PACCAR's conservative approach to business complimented by its excellent credit ratings enables PACCAR Financial to offer competitive financing to Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers and customers. The ongoing turmoil in the commercial real estate market is impacting regional banks in the U.S. which limits their ability to offer financing to truck customers, good news for PACCAR Financial. PACCAR Financial has excellent access to commercial paper and the medium-term note markets. Last month, PACCAR Financial sold a three-year $250 million fixed rate note at a rate of 2.1%. Also during the quarter, PACCAR completed the renewal of a $2 billion credit facility.
PACCAR's investment of $3.8 billion in the last decade has enabled the company to enhance its operating efficiency, develop new products, strengthen its dealer network and become an industry leader in information technology. As we all can see, from our iPads and newspapers and television every day, there continue to be many challenges facing the world economies. The global economic environment is still unsettled. However, PACCAR's balanced approach in all phases of the business cycle positions us to generate improving results for our shareholders as the global economy recovers. Thank you. Look forward to your questions."

I’m glad you brought it up. As you've seen from the reports, DAF has really become one of the major leaders in the European market, Western and Central Europe, now over 16% market share; great product, great dealers and really a terrific company. So as we are more comfortable with the strengths of what's going on in Europe, we're taking a look at South America. And we've sold in South America particularly with our Kenworth brand for many decades, but in America Sur region, which is most of the product being sold in South America, we've only sold in very limited numbers. So recently in the last few years as we evaluate growth opportunities, that seems to be a very strong candidate. Most likely, we'll take a manufacturing facility in order to meet local content regulations and also to qualify for some of the national finance programs that are available to customers in Brazil and Argentina. And as you've heard from many of our competitors, they seem to be gaining most of their profitability from the strong South American market. We compete against these same competitors around the world and do very well. So I think over time, we should have a very strong, profitable and growing presence in South America."

In Europe, I think the share will be sort of comparable to what we have now. There's certainly a range that will fluctuate in between. We continue to add service points and the customers love the DAF product. Our share in Europe is lower than it is in the U.S. and Canada. So there's still some opportunity. But there's also different dynamics. There's a little different economic headwinds you run into in Europe. Every country has a slightly different challenge and different opportunity. Also a number of our competitors in Europe are not present in North America and some of those competitors have their own unique challenges. So it's a different market."

PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the second quarter of 2010. PACCAR's second quarter sales and Financial Services revenue were $2.46 billion compared to $1.85 billion in the second quarter of 2009, a 33% improvement",1005,"Good morning. PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the second quarter of 2010. PACCAR's second quarter sales and Financial Services revenue were $2.46 billion compared to $1.85 billion in the second quarter of 2009, a 33% improvement. Net income improved to $99 million compared to $26 million a year ago. I'm very proud of our 16,000 employees who have delivered outstanding performance to our shareholders and customers in an uneven and unsettled global economy. PACCAR's financial results reflect the benefits of higher truck deliveries worldwide and a continued improvement in aftermarket parts sales and Financial Services results. However, the North American and European truck markets remained at historically low levels. In the U.S. and Canada, our customers are starting to adjust to the higher- priced vehicles that have resulted from the EPA 2010 emission change. The European truck registrations for the second quarter improved 17% compared to the first, but despite that favorable increase, the European truck market year-over-year is still down.
We expect the 15-ton market registrations in Europe to be between 160,000 units and 170,000 units this year, comparable to the 168,000 units last year. U.S. and Canadian retail truck sales are estimated to improve to a range of 110,000 to 130,000 units this year compared to 108,000 last year. While the global economic outlook is still uneven, the truck market is stabilizing. PACCAR truck build in the third quarter is expected to be slightly better than the second quarter. I would note that production at our DAF factories in Europe will have their regularly scheduled two-week summer shutdown.
We discussed during the analyst call in April the three-step process that the truck industry usually progresses as it recovers from a recession. First is improvement in parts and service, second in used truck values and third is more truck orders. In the U.S. and Canada, parts sales were up 10% to 15%, and used truck pricing increased 10%. The good news is that industry new truck orders for the first six months compared to a year ago are up 30%. Many of the orders are for production during the next six to 12 months. In Europe, a similar situation with parts business and used truck pricing improving by 10% to 15%. In Europe, as I previously noted, new truck sales are 15% lower than last year due to a slow first quarter, but the second half of the year should be up 20% compared to 2009.
More good news is that DAF is the leader in the European market for on-highway tractor sales and has now achieved a record overall market share of 16.3%, the second highest market share in Europe. It's been a wonderful success story over the last decade for DAF.
DAF is steadily progressing toward its medium-term goal of 20% market share in Europe. DAF heavy truck production is up 25% from first to second quarter this year and we expect that their production will be up 25% for the remainder of the year. Kenworth and Peterbilt build rates will be up 10% to 15% from the second to the third quarter.
Our customers are benefiting from a 7% year-on-year improvement in freight volumes, higher freight rates and stable diesel prices. They continue to increase the utilization of their fleets, which in turn is driving increased aftermarket parts and service business for our dealers. PACCAR's aftermarket parts sales increased to $538 million for the second quarter, the highest level since the third quarter of 2008.
Turning to margins, margins for trucks was primarily driven by higher pricing due to improved demand. PACCAR's strong balance sheet and positive cash flow have enabled the company to continuously reinvest in the business, enhance operating efficiency and develop innovative new products such as the PACCAR MX diesel engine. I'm pleased to note that we're now installing the MX engine in approximately 15% of Kenworth and Peterbilt vehicles. Assembly of the PACCAR MX engines began last month at our industry-leading manufacturing facility in Columbus, Mississippi. Early feedback from our customers of the PACCAR MX engine has been excellent. On a broader scale in the U.S. and Canada, the substantial majority of Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks are being produced with the EPA 2010 engines. I know a number of you are interested in it, but there appears to be about a 5% shift to 13-liter engines year-on-year.
PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $239 million in the second quarter compared to $247 million a year ago, reflecting a lower level of assets. PACCAR's Financial second quarter pretax income was $34 million, more than double the $16 million earned in Q2 of 2009. This was achieved due to better finance margins and a reduction in the provision for credit losses. The credit loss provision for the second quarter 2010 was $20.2 million compared to $29.1 million in 2009.
PACCAR's conservative approach to business complimented by its excellent credit ratings enables PACCAR Financial to offer competitive financing to Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers and customers. The ongoing turmoil in the commercial real estate market is impacting regional banks in the U.S. which limits their ability to offer financing to truck customers, good news for PACCAR Financial. PACCAR Financial has excellent access to commercial paper and the medium-term note markets. Last month, PACCAR Financial sold a three-year $250 million fixed rate note at a rate of 2.1%. Also during the quarter, PACCAR completed the renewal of a $2 billion credit facility.
PACCAR's investment of $3.8 billion in the last decade has enabled the company to enhance its operating efficiency, develop new products, strengthen its dealer network and become an industry leader in information technology. As we all can see, from our iPads and newspapers and television every day, there continue to be many challenges facing the world economies. The global economic environment is still unsettled. However, PACCAR's balanced approach in all phases of the business cycle positions us to generate improving results for our shareholders as the global economy recovers. Thank you. Look forward to your questions.

And we've sold in South America particularly with our Kenworth brand for many decades, but in America Sur region, which is most of the product being sold in South America, we've only sold in very limited numbers. So recently in the last few years as we evaluate growth opportunities, that seems to be a very strong candidate. Most likely, we'll take a manufacturing facility in order to meet local content regulations and also to qualify for some of the national finance programs that are available to customers in Brazil and Argentina. And as you've heard from many of our competitors, they seem to be gaining most of their profitability from the strong South American market. We compete against these same competitors around the world and do very well. So I think over time, we should have a very strong, profitable and growing presence in South America.

Obviously, the template that we've designed the MX engine on is based on the success of the engine in the DAF product. And as you know, we're standard and essentially exclusive with our own product, as many of the other competitors are. But it’s going to take some time to ramp up. We certainly will be expecting to get well over half our products. We'll have our engine as we continue to grow our business, but that's what going to take some time. The other element that was not really addressed is that we're seeing some real success in selling our powertrain around the world to independent manufacturers. And that still small numbers but starting to gather some traction.

It's improving, so that's the good news. Our share will improve over time, but there's a number of competitors that still are actively selling engines that were built last year. There's certainly a price differential on that. So this year is certainly a year of flux as customers are working their way between what engine do they buy, how is the economy generally recovering. But then you've got the countervailing concerns about housing build, 50-year low, car production, 20-year low.

PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the second quarter of 2010. PACCAR's second quarter sales and Financial Services revenue were $2.46 billion compared to $1.85 billion in the second quarter of 2009, a 33% improvement",1005,"Good morning. PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the second quarter of 2010. PACCAR's second quarter sales and Financial Services revenue were $2.46 billion compared to $1.85 billion in the second quarter of 2009, a 33% improvement. Net income improved to $99 million compared to $26 million a year ago. I'm very proud of our 16,000 employees who have delivered outstanding performance to our shareholders and customers in an uneven and unsettled global economy. PACCAR's financial results reflect the benefits of higher truck deliveries worldwide and a continued improvement in aftermarket parts sales and Financial Services results. However, the North American and European truck markets remained at historically low levels. In the U.S. and Canada, our customers are starting to adjust to the higher- priced vehicles that have resulted from the EPA 2010 emission change. The European truck registrations for the second quarter improved 17% compared to the first, but despite that favorable increase, the European truck market year-over-year is still down.
We expect the 15-ton market registrations in Europe to be between 160,000 units and 170,000 units this year, comparable to the 168,000 units last year. U.S. and Canadian retail truck sales are estimated to improve to a range of 110,000 to 130,000 units this year compared to 108,000 last year. While the global economic outlook is still uneven, the truck market is stabilizing. PACCAR truck build in the third quarter is expected to be slightly better than the second quarter. I would note that production at our DAF factories in Europe will have their regularly scheduled two-week summer shutdown.
We discussed during the analyst call in April the three-step process that the truck industry usually progresses as it recovers from a recession. First is improvement in parts and service, second in used truck values and third is more truck orders. In the U.S. and Canada, parts sales were up 10% to 15%, and used truck pricing increased 10%. The good news is that industry new truck orders for the first six months compared to a year ago are up 30%. Many of the orders are for production during the next six to 12 months. In Europe, a similar situation with parts business and used truck pricing improving by 10% to 15%. In Europe, as I previously noted, new truck sales are 15% lower than last year due to a slow first quarter, but the second half of the year should be up 20% compared to 2009.
More good news is that DAF is the leader in the European market for on-highway tractor sales and has now achieved a record overall market share of 16.3%, the second highest market share in Europe. It's been a wonderful success story over the last decade for DAF.
DAF is steadily progressing toward its medium-term goal of 20% market share in Europe. DAF heavy truck production is up 25% from first to second quarter this year, and we expect that their production will be up 25% for the remainder of the year. Kenworth and Peterbilt build rates will be up 10% to 15% from the second to the third quarter.
Our customers are benefiting from a 7% year-on-year improvement in freight volumes, higher freight rates and stable diesel prices. They continue to increase the utilization of their fleets, which in turn is driving increased aftermarket parts and service business for our dealers. PACCAR's aftermarket parts sales increased to $538 million for the second quarter, the highest level since the third quarter of 2008.
Turning to margins. Margins for trucks was primarily driven by higher pricing due to improved demand. PACCAR's strong balance sheet and positive cash flow have enabled the company to continuously reinvest in the business, enhance operating efficiency and develop innovative new products such as the PACCAR MX diesel engine. I'm pleased to note that we're now installing the MX engine in approximately 15% of Kenworth and Peterbilt vehicles. Assembly of the PACCAR MX engines began last month at our industry-leading manufacturing facility in Columbus, Mississippi. Early feedback from our customers of the PACCAR MX engine has been excellent. On a broader scale, in the U.S. and Canada, the substantial majority of Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks are being produced with the EPA 2010 engines. I know a number of you are interested in it, but there appears to be about a 5% shift to 13-liter engines year-on-year.
PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $239 million in the second quarter compared to $247 million a year ago, reflecting a lower level of assets. PACCAR's Financial second quarter pretax income was $34 million, more than double the $16 million earned in Q2 of 2009. This was achieved due to better finance margins and a reduction in the provision for credit losses. The credit loss provision for the second quarter 2010 was $20.2 million compared to $29.1 million in 2009.
PACCAR's conservative approach to business complemented by its excellent credit ratings enables PACCAR Financial to offer competitive financing to Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers and customers. The ongoing turmoil in the commercial real estate market is impacting regional banks in the U.S., which limits their ability to offer financing to truck customers, good news for PACCAR Financial. PACCAR Financial has excellent access to commercial paper and the medium-term note markets. Last month, PACCAR Financial sold a three-year $250 million fixed rate note at a rate of 2.1%. Also during the quarter, PACCAR completed the renewal of a $2 billion credit facility.
PACCAR's investment of $3.8 billion in the last decade has enabled the company to enhance its operating efficiency, develop new products, strengthen its dealer network and become an industry leader in information technology. As we all can see from our iPads and newspapers and television every day, there continue to be many challenges facing the world economies. The global economic environment is still unsettled. However, PACCAR's balanced approach in all phases of the business cycle positions us to generate improving results for our shareholders as the global economy recovers.

So as we are more comfortable with the strengths of what's going on in Europe, we're taking a look at South America. And we've sold in South America particularly with our Kenworth brand for many decades, but in America Sur region, which is most of the product being sold in South America, we've only sold in very limited numbers. So recently in the last few years as we evaluate growth opportunities, that seems to be a very strong candidate. Most likely, we'll take a manufacturing facility in order to meet local content regulations and also to qualify for some of the national finance programs that are available to customers in Brazil and Argentina. And as you've heard from many of our competitors, they seem to be gaining most of their profitability from the strong South American market. We compete against these same competitors around the world and do very well. So I think over time, we should have a very strong, profitable and growing presence in South America."

Things can happen that will have an effect on that, but looking at the order input for the entire industry, and obviously, what we're getting at DAF and any of changes in market share between the competitors, it seemed to be probably close to 170,000, which is, as I mentioned earlier, comparable to last year, which is 168,000. 2011 could be better market if some of the momentum continues. In North America, we have a range of 110,000 to 130,000 units, which is up from 108,000. In fact, if you went to 130,000, it's up about roughly 20%. So we're seeing that in terms of the incoming order rate. Hopefully that's the first step in the trend to get back to the replacement demand, which we calculate is about 225,000 to 250,000 units for the U.S. and Canadian market."

Of course, Kenworth, the T700 is really doing well. Peterbilt's got some exciting new products themselves. We continue to be recognized by many of the industry groups, such as the American Truck Dealers as the Peterbilt 384. Right now, when you look at the U.S. and Canadian market, whether it's 110,000, 120,000 units, it's still at about a 20-year low. So it's still at the bottom now. It's improving, so that's the good news. Our share will improve over time, but there's a number of competitors that still are actively selling engines that were built last year. There's certainly a price differential on that. So this year is certainly a year of flux as customers are working their way between what engine do they buy, how is the economy generally recovering. But then you've got the countervailing concerns about housing build, 50-year low, car production, 20-year low. I mean, these are major drivers for freight movement in our country and also have a big effect on what our customers see. So 2010 is certainly a better year than 2009, but it's still a very challenging year."

PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the third quarter 2010. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $2.5 billion, which is 26% higher than the $2 billion in the third quarter last year. Net in",1031,"Good morning. PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the third quarter 2010. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $2.5 billion, which is 26% higher than the $2 billion in the third quarter last year. Net income improved to $120 million, compared to $13 million a year ago. I'm very proud of our 16,500 employees who have delivered outstanding performance to our shareholders and customers in an uneven and unsettled global economy. 
In the U.S. and Canada, our customers are starting to adjust to the higher-priced vehicles that have resulted from the EPA 2010 emission change. The U.S. and Canadian retail truck sales are estimated to improve to a range of 120,000 to 130,000 units this, year compared to 108,000 last year.
European truck registrations for the third quarter improved 16% compared to the second quarter. As a result, we expect the 15-ton plus market registrations in Europe to be between 160,000 and 170,000 units this year, comparable to the 168,000 units last year.
The global economic outlook is improving, which is benefiting the truck market. PACCAR delivered 5% more trucks in the third quarter than the second quarter this year. And looking ahead, we think that truck production for PACCAR could be up 20% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.
We discussed in our analyst call in April the three-step process that the truck industry usually progresses as it recovers from a recession. First is improvement in parts and service. Second is used truck values increasing. And third is more new truck orders. For PACCAR in the U.S. and Canada, the good news is that parts sales are up 15% to 20% compared to last year, and used truck pricing has increased 10% to 15%.
More good news is that the U.S. and Canadian industry Class 8 truck orders for the first nine months are up 23% compared to a year ago although they may be slowing now in the industry.
In Europe, PACCAR Parts business and used truck pricing have both improved by 10% to 15%. And DAF's new truck production for the first nine months is 25% higher than last year.
As we look at the European truck market, we're pleased that DAF is now the leader in the On-highway Tractor segment and has achieved a record overall market share of 15.8%. DAF is steadily progressing toward its medium-term goal of 20% share in Europe.
Talking about our customers. They're benefiting from improved freight volumes, higher freight rates and some stable diesel prices. They continue to increase the utilization of their fleets, which in turn is driving increased aftermarket parts and service business for our dealers.
PACCAR's quarterly aftermarket parts sales increased to $554 million, the highest level since the third quarter of 2008.
PACCAR's strong balance sheet and positive cash flow of $1.1 billion this year have enabled the company to continuously reinvest in the business, enhance our operating efficiency and develop innovative new products such as the PACCAR MX diesel engine. Assembly of the PACCAR MX engine began in June at our new manufacturing facility in Columbus, Mississippi. And in September, the engine plant was officially dedicated in a ceremony that was attended by state and local officials, including Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour. We are now installing the MX engine in over 20% of Kenworth and Peterbilt vehicles. This is the highest level of 13-liter engine installations in our Kenworth and Peterbilt and reflects customer recognition of the PACCAR MX engine's excellent power-to-weight ratio, fuel economy and reliability.
Feedback from our customers of the PACCAR MX engine is excellent with over 2,000 MX engines now installed in Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks.
Speaking of engines, the EPA issued its proposed Greenhouse Gas Regulations yesterday. And as you know, PACCAR is an environmental leader worldwide. We are reviewing the proposed regulations, which is 673 pages long, and we're analyzing the details and look forward to working with the EPA in this during the 60-day comment period to fully understand all the aspects of the proposed regulations.
I also like to point out, speaking of environment, that DAF will launch their hybrid LF truck this year, which will join the Kenworth and Peterbilt hybrid medium-duty vehicles.
Switching topics. PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $238 million in the third quarter compared to $253 million a year ago, reflecting lower level of assets. PACCAR financial's third quarter pretax income improved to $42 million, more than double the $18 million earned last year. This was achieved due to better finance margins and a reduction in the provision for credit losses. The credit loss provision for the third quarter 2010 was $13.7 million compared to $26.6 million in 2009.
Looking at the global market. PACCAR's investment of $3.8 billion in the last decade has enabled the company to enhance its operating efficiency, develop innovative new products, launch the PACCAR MX engine in North America and in Europe, strengthen its dealer network and become an industry leader in information technology. 2010, while very tough economically, was an excellent year for new product introductions, as Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF launched more new vehicles and major options than at any time in our history.
The success of the Kenworth T700, the Peterbilt 587 and the complete line of vocational bodies for DAF as shown at the recent truck show in Hannover, Germany, have our customers excited about the future.
We've indicated in the third quarter press release that PACCAR will be doubling its capital expenditures next year. I know a number of you are interested in that. And the funding will be focused on accelerating new vehicle development, customer service initiatives, meeting the Euro 6 engine emission requirements, which come into play in 2013, and of course our global expansion. These investments will complement our industry-leading powertrain and manufacturing investments over the last decade.
In summary, the global economic environment is still very unsettled. However, PACCAR's balanced approach in all phases of the business cycle positions us to generate improved results for our shareholders as the global economy recovers.
We look forward to welcoming many of you to the investor conference tomorrow, and thank you. Appreciate your questions."

We're encouraged to see its strong growth. And over time, if you look at a 5% to 6% GDP growth, the truck population and the truck production should expand and get up to maybe 200,000 units a year. They have the Olympics coming up. They have the World Cup coming up. So there's going to be a lot of infrastructure investment. And they're growing as a nation. In terms of our particularly plans, as I say, we've been in South America for decades, not so much in Brazil. I'm sure our competitors are not overjoyed at the prospect of us being involved there, but we will. And we're evaluating different business scenarios. We're testing our vehicles, and the preliminary response from suppliers and customers and financial institutions are the market's growing. We'd love to have you here. You're a quality company with world-class products, so let's work together."

Now if you're selling into China or Asia, other markets, yes, you're seeing some real strong benefits. But if you are a trucking company operating in the U.S., it's still plenty of challenges.

PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the third quarter 2010. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $2.5 billion, which is 26% higher than the $2 billion in the third quarter last year. Net in",1031,"Good morning. PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the third quarter 2010. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $2.5 billion, which is 26% higher than the $2 billion in the third quarter last year. Net income improved to $120 million, compared to $13 million a year ago. I'm very proud of our 16,500 employees who have delivered outstanding performance to our shareholders and customers in an uneven and unsettled global economy. 
In the U.S. and Canada, our customers are starting to adjust to the higher-priced vehicles that have resulted from the EPA 2010 emission change. The U.S. and Canadian retail truck sales are estimated to improve to a range of 120,000 to 130,000 units this, year compared to 108,000 last year.
European truck registrations for the third quarter improved 16% compared to the second quarter. As a result, we expect the 15-ton plus market registrations in Europe to be between 160,000 and 170,000 units this year, comparable to the 168,000 units last year.
The global economic outlook is improving, which is benefiting the truck market. PACCAR delivered 5% more trucks in the third quarter than the second quarter this year. And looking ahead, we think that truck production for PACCAR could be up 20% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.
We discussed in our analyst call in April the three-step process that the truck industry usually progresses as it recovers from a recession. First is improvement in parts and service. Second is used truck values increasing. And third is more new truck orders. For PACCAR in the U.S. and Canada, the good news is that parts sales are up 15% to 20% compared to last year, and used truck pricing has increased 10% to 15%.
More good news is that the U.S. and Canadian industry Class 8 truck orders for the first nine months are up 23% compared to a year ago although they may be slowing now in the industry.
In Europe, PACCAR Parts business and used truck pricing have both improved by 10% to 15%. And DAF's new truck production for the first nine months is 25% higher than last year.
As we look at the European truck market, we're pleased that DAF is now the leader in the On-highway Tractor segment and has achieved a record overall market share of 15.8%. DAF is steadily progressing toward its medium-term goal of 20% share in Europe.
Talking about our customers. They're benefiting from improved freight volumes, higher freight rates and some stable diesel prices. They continue to increase the utilization of their fleets, which in turn is driving increased aftermarket parts and service business for our dealers.
PACCAR's quarterly aftermarket parts sales increased to $554 million, the highest level since the third quarter of 2008.
PACCAR's strong balance sheet and positive cash flow of $1.1 billion this year have enabled the company to continuously reinvest in the business, enhance our operating efficiency and develop innovative new products such as the PACCAR MX diesel engine. Assembly of the PACCAR MX engine began in June at our new manufacturing facility in Columbus, Mississippi. And in September, the engine plant was officially dedicated in a ceremony that was attended by state and local officials, including Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour. We are now installing the MX engine in over 20% of Kenworth and Peterbilt vehicles. This is the highest level of 13-liter engine installations in our Kenworth and Peterbilt and reflects customer recognition of the PACCAR MX engine's excellent power-to-weight ratio, fuel economy and reliability.
Feedback from our customers of the PACCAR MX engine is excellent with over 2,000 MX engines now installed in Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks.
Speaking of engines, the EPA issued its proposed Greenhouse Gas Regulations yesterday. And as you know, PACCAR is an environmental leader worldwide. We are reviewing the proposed regulations, which is 673 pages long, and we're analyzing the details and look forward to working with the EPA in this during the 60-day comment period to fully understand all the aspects of the proposed regulations.
I also like to point out, speaking of environment, that DAF will launch their hybrid LF truck this year, which will join the Kenworth and Peterbilt hybrid medium-duty vehicles.
Switching topics. PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $238 million in the third quarter compared to $253 million a year ago, reflecting lower level of assets. PACCAR financial's third quarter pretax income improved to $42 million, more than double the $18 million earned last year. This was achieved due to better finance margins and a reduction in the provision for credit losses. The credit loss provision for the third quarter 2010 was $13.7 million compared to $26.6 million in 2009.
Looking at the global market. PACCAR's investment of $3.8 billion in the last decade has enabled the company to enhance its operating efficiency, develop innovative new products, launch the PACCAR MX engine in North America and in Europe, strengthen its dealer network and become an industry leader in information technology. 2010, while very tough economically, was an excellent year for new product introductions, as Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF launched more new vehicles and major options than at any time in our history.
The success of the Kenworth T700, the Peterbilt 587 and the complete line of vocational bodies for DAF as shown at the recent truck show in Hannover, Germany, have our customers excited about the future.
We've indicated in the third quarter press release that PACCAR will be doubling its capital expenditures next year. I know a number of you are interested in that. And the funding will be focused on accelerating new vehicle development, customer service initiatives, meeting the Euro 6 engine emission requirements, which come into play in 2013, and of course our global expansion. These investments will complement our industry-leading powertrain and manufacturing investments over the last decade.
In summary, the global economic environment is still very unsettled. However, PACCAR's balanced approach in all phases of the business cycle positions us to generate improved results for our shareholders as the global economy recovers.
We look forward to welcoming many of you to the investor conference tomorrow, and thank you. Appreciate your questions.

So I don't think it's anything unusual or even a surprise that the U.S., Canadian and let's call it Mexican markets are just becoming a little bit more aligned with the rest of the world in terms of engine preference. And so I would say, if you could cascade that down, all different types of customers are interested in the 13 liter from the small operator to the largest fleets. They're saying we have similar operating characteristics to companies that operate in South America or Australia or Europe or even into Asia as the infrastructure gets built there.

And that is a very broad topic, but as we have burdened our country with increased legislation and taxation, that has made our recovery in the U.S. very weak. And there's not a strong outlook through any sector that I can see about the U.S.-based company really having a lot of growth. Now if you're selling into China or Asia, other markets, yes, you're seeing some real strong benefits. But if you are a trucking company operating in the U.S., it's still plenty of challenges. It's recessionary in many cities and as you travel around the country as we do, there are many states that are in very difficult shape. So being the trucking industry, obviously, but manufacturing and financial services, that's all. It's just an ongoing challenge. It's going to be tough for the next couple of years.

PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the third quarter 2010. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $2.5 billion, which is 26% higher than the $2 billion in the third quarter last year. Net in",1031,"Good morning. PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the third quarter 2010. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $2.5 billion, which is 26% higher than the $2 billion in the third quarter last year. Net income improved to $120 million, compared to $13 million a year ago. I'm very proud of our 16,500 employees who have delivered outstanding performance to our shareholders and customers in an uneven and unsettled global economy. 
In the U.S. and Canada, our customers are starting to adjust to the higher-priced vehicles that have resulted from the EPA 2010 emission change. The U.S. and Canadian retail truck sales are estimated to improve to a range of 120,000 to 130,000 units this, year compared to 108,000 last year.
European truck registrations for the third quarter improved 16% compared to the second quarter. As a result, we expect the 15-ton plus market registrations in Europe to be between 160,000 and 170,000 units this year, comparable to the 168,000 units last year.
The global economic outlook is improving, which is benefiting the truck market. PACCAR delivered 5% more trucks in the third quarter than the second quarter this year. And looking ahead, we think that truck production for PACCAR could be up 20% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.
We discussed in our analyst call in April the three-step process that the truck industry usually progresses as it recovers from a recession. First is improvement in parts and service. Second is used truck values increasing. And third is more new truck orders. For PACCAR in the U.S. and Canada, the good news is that parts sales are up 15% to 20% compared to last year, and used truck pricing has increased 10% to 15%.
More good news is that the U.S. and Canadian industry Class 8 truck orders for the first nine months are up 23% compared to a year ago although they may be slowing now in the industry.
In Europe, PACCAR Parts business and used truck pricing have both improved by 10% to 15%. And DAF's new truck production for the first nine months is 25% higher than last year.
As we look at the European truck market, we're pleased that DAF is now the leader in the On-highway Tractor segment and has achieved a record overall market share of 15.8%. DAF is steadily progressing toward its medium-term goal of 20% share in Europe.
Talking about our customers. They're benefiting from improved freight volumes, higher freight rates and some stable diesel prices. They continue to increase the utilization of their fleets, which in turn is driving increased aftermarket parts and service business for our dealers.
PACCAR's quarterly aftermarket parts sales increased to $554 million, the highest level since the third quarter of 2008.
PACCAR's strong balance sheet and positive cash flow of $1.1 billion this year have enabled the company to continuously reinvest in the business, enhance our operating efficiency and develop innovative new products such as the PACCAR MX diesel engine. Assembly of the PACCAR MX engine began in June at our new manufacturing facility in Columbus, Mississippi. And in September, the engine plant was officially dedicated in a ceremony that was attended by state and local officials, including Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour. We are now installing the MX engine in over 20% of Kenworth and Peterbilt vehicles. This is the highest level of 13-liter engine installations in our Kenworth and Peterbilt and reflects customer recognition of the PACCAR MX engine's excellent power-to-weight ratio, fuel economy and reliability.
Feedback from our customers of the PACCAR MX engine is excellent with over 2,000 MX engines now installed in Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks.
Speaking of engines, the EPA issued its proposed Greenhouse Gas Regulations yesterday. And as you know, PACCAR is an environmental leader worldwide. We are reviewing the proposed regulations, which is 673 pages long, and we're analyzing the details and look forward to working with the EPA in this during the 60-day comment period to fully understand all the aspects of the proposed regulations.
I also like to point out, speaking of environment, that DAF will launch their hybrid LF truck this year, which will join the Kenworth and Peterbilt hybrid medium-duty vehicles.
Switching topics. PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $238 million in the third quarter compared to $253 million a year ago, reflecting lower level of assets. PACCAR financial's third quarter pretax income improved to $42 million, more than double the $18 million earned last year. This was achieved due to better finance margins and a reduction in the provision for credit losses. The credit loss provision for the third quarter 2010 was $13.7 million compared to $26.6 million in 2009.
Looking at the global market. PACCAR's investment of $3.8 billion in the last decade has enabled the company to enhance its operating efficiency, develop innovative new products, launch the PACCAR MX engine in North America and in Europe, strengthen its dealer network and become an industry leader in information technology. 2010, while very tough economically, was an excellent year for new product introductions, as Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF launched more new vehicles and major options than at any time in our history.
The success of the Kenworth T700, the Peterbilt 587 and the complete line of vocational bodies for DAF as shown at the recent truck show in Hannover, Germany, have our customers excited about the future.
We've indicated in the third quarter press release that PACCAR will be doubling its capital expenditures next year. I know a number of you are interested in that. And the funding will be focused on accelerating new vehicle development, customer service initiatives, meeting the Euro 6 engine emission requirements, which come into play in 2013, and of course our global expansion. These investments will complement our industry-leading powertrain and manufacturing investments over the last decade.
In summary, the global economic environment is still very unsettled. However, PACCAR's balanced approach in all phases of the business cycle positions us to generate improved results for our shareholders as the global economy recovers.
We look forward to welcoming many of you to the investor conference tomorrow, and thank you. Appreciate your questions."

PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the third quarter 2010. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $2.5 billion, which is 26% higher than the $2 billion in the third quarter last year. Net income improved to $120 million, compared to $13 million a year ago. I'm very proud of our 16,500 employees who have delivered outstanding performance to our shareholders and customers in an uneven and unsettled global economy. 
In the U.S. and Canada, our customers are starting to adjust to the higher-priced vehicles that have resulted from the EPA 2010 emission change. The U.S. and Canadian retail truck sales are estimated to improve to a range of 120,000 to 130,000 units this year compared to 108,000 last year.
European truck registrations for the third quarter improved 16% compared to the second quarter. As a result, we expect the 15-ton plus market registrations in Europe to be between 160,000 and 170,000 units this year, comparable to the 168,000 units last year.
The global economic outlook is improving, which is benefiting the truck market. PACCAR delivered 5% more trucks in the third quarter than the second quarter this year. And looking ahead, we think that truck production for PACCAR could be up 20% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.
We discussed in our analyst call in April the three-step process that the truck industry usually progresses as it recovers from a recession. First is improvement in parts and service. Second is used truck values increasing. And third is more new truck orders. For PACCAR in the U.S. and Canada, the good news is that parts sales are up 15% to 20% compared to last year, and used truck pricing has increased 10% to 15%.
More good news is that the U.S. and Canadian industry Class 8 truck orders for the first nine months are up 23% compared to a year ago although they may be slowing now in the industry.
In Europe, PACCAR Parts business and used truck pricing have both improved by 10% to 15%. And DAF's new truck production for the first nine months is 25% higher than last year.
As we look at the European truck market, we're pleased that DAF is now the leader in the On-highway Tractor segment and has achieved a record overall market share of 15.8%. DAF is steadily progressing toward its medium-term goal of 20% share in Europe.
Talking about our customers. They're benefiting from improved freight volumes, higher freight rates and some stable diesel prices. They continue to increase the utilization of their fleets, which in turn is driving increased aftermarket parts and service business for our dealers.
PACCAR's quarterly aftermarket parts sales increased to $554 million, the highest level since the third quarter of 2008.
PACCAR's strong balance sheet and positive cash flow of $1.1 billion this year have enabled the company to continuously reinvest in the business, enhance our operating efficiency and develop innovative new products such as the PACCAR MX diesel engine. Assembly of the PACCAR MX engine began in June at our new manufacturing facility in Columbus, Mississippi. And in September, the engine plant was officially dedicated in a ceremony that was attended by state and local officials, including Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour. We are now installing the MX engine in over 20% of Kenworth and Peterbilt vehicles. This is the highest level of 13-liter engine installations in our Kenworth and Peterbilt and reflects customer recognition of the PACCAR MX engine's excellent power-to-weight ratio, fuel economy and reliability.
Feedback from our customers of the PACCAR MX engine is excellent with over 2,000 MX engines now installed in Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks.
Speaking of engines, the EPA issued its proposed Greenhouse Gas Regulations yesterday. And as you know, PACCAR is an environmental leader worldwide. We are reviewing the proposed regulations, which is 673 pages long, and we're analyzing the details and look forward to working with the EPA in this during the 60-day comment period to fully understand all the aspects of the proposed regulations.
I’d also like to point out, speaking of environment, that DAF will launch their hybrid LF truck this year, which will join the Kenworth and Peterbilt hybrid medium-duty vehicles.
Switching topics. PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $238 million in the third quarter compared to $253 million a year ago, reflecting lower level of assets. PACCAR Financial's third quarter pretax income improved to $42 million, more than double the $18 million earned last year. This was achieved due to better finance margins and a reduction in the provision for credit losses. The credit loss provision for the third quarter 2010 was $13.7 million compared to $26.6 million in 2009.
Looking at the global market. PACCAR's investment of $3.8 billion in the last decade has enabled the company to enhance its operating efficiency, develop innovative new products, launch the PACCAR MX engine in North America and in Europe, strengthen its dealer network and become an industry leader in information technology. 2010, while very tough economically, was an excellent year for new product introductions, as Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF launched more new vehicles and major options than at any time in our history.
The success of the Kenworth T700, the Peterbilt 587 and the complete line of vocational bodies for DAF as shown at the recent truck show in Hannover, Germany, have our customers excited about the future.
We've indicated in the third quarter press release that PACCAR will be doubling its capital expenditures next year. I know a number of you are interested in that. And the funding will be focused on accelerating new vehicle development, customer service initiatives, meeting the Euro 6 engine emission requirements, which come into play in 2013, and of course our global expansion. These investments will complement our industry-leading powertrain and manufacturing investments over the last decade.
In summary, the global economic environment is still very unsettled. However, PACCAR's balanced approach in all phases of the business cycle positions us to generate improved results for our shareholders as the global economy recovers.
We look forward to welcoming many of you to the investor conference tomorrow, and thank you. Appreciate your questions."

We have great engineers who are leaders in terms of developing innovative solutions to meet the new regulation, but the long and tall is something that I knew early in my career and there's always a few that are out there. But for well over a decade, we've been the environmental and aerodynamic leader in terms of our vehicles. So it's just, it's playing into our cards perfectly."

PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the third quarter 2010. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $2.5 billion, which is 26% higher than the $2 billion in the third quarter last year. Net in",1031,"Good morning. PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the third quarter 2010. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $2.5 billion, which is 26% higher than the $2 billion in the third quarter last year. Net income improved to $120 million compared to $13 million a year ago. I'm very proud of our 16,500 employees who have delivered outstanding performance to our shareholders and customers in an uneven and unsettled global economy. 
In the U.S. and Canada, our customers are starting to adjust to the higher-priced vehicles that have resulted from the EPA 2010 emission change. The U.S. and Canadian retail truck sales are estimated to improve to a range of 120,000 to 130,000 units this year compared to 108,000 last year.
European truck registrations for the third quarter improved 16% compared to the second quarter. As a result, we expect the 15-ton plus market registrations in Europe to be between 160,000 and 170,000 units this year, comparable to the 168,000 units last year.
The global economic outlook is improving, which is benefiting the truck market. PACCAR delivered 5% more trucks in the third quarter than the second quarter this year. And looking ahead, we think that truck production for PACCAR could be up 20% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.
We discussed in our analyst call in April the three-step process that the truck industry usually progresses as it recovers from a recession. First is improvement in parts and service. Second is used truck values increasing. And third is more new truck orders. For PACCAR in the U.S. and Canada, the good news is that parts sales are up 15% to 20% compared to last year, and used truck pricing has increased 10% to 15%.
More good news is that the U.S. and Canadian industry Class 8 truck orders for the first nine months are up 23% compared to a year ago although they may be slowing now in the industry.
In Europe, PACCAR Parts business and used truck pricing have both improved by 10% to 15%. And DAF's new truck production for the first nine months is 25% higher than last year.
As we look at the European truck market, we're pleased that DAF is now the leader in the On-highway Tractor segment and has achieved a record overall market share of 15.8%. DAF is steadily progressing toward its medium-term goal of 20% share in Europe.
Talking about our customers. They're benefiting from improved freight volumes, higher freight rates and some stable diesel prices. They continue to increase the utilization of their fleets, which in turn is driving increased aftermarket parts and service business for our dealers.
PACCAR's quarterly aftermarket parts sales increased to $554 million, the highest level since the third quarter of 2008.
PACCAR's strong balance sheet and positive cash flow of $1.1 billion this year have enabled the company to continuously reinvest in the business, enhance our operating efficiency and develop innovative new products such as the PACCAR MX diesel engine. Assembly of the PACCAR MX engine began in June at our new manufacturing facility in Columbus, Mississippi. And in September, the engine plant was officially dedicated in a ceremony that was attended by state and local officials, including Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour. We are now installing the MX engine in over 20% of Kenworth and Peterbilt vehicles. This is the highest level of 13-liter engine installations in our Kenworth and Peterbilts and reflects customer recognition of the PACCAR MX engine's excellent power-to-weight ratio, fuel economy and reliability.
Feedback from our customers of the PACCAR MX engine is excellent with over 2,000 MX engines now installed in Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks.
Speaking of engines, the EPA issued its proposed greenhouse gas regulations yesterday. And as you know, PACCAR is an environmental leader worldwide. We are reviewing the proposed regulations, which is 673 pages long, and we're analyzing the details and look forward to working with the EPA in this during the 60-day comment period to fully understand all the aspects of the proposed regulations.
I’d also like to point out, speaking of environment, that DAF will launch their hybrid LF truck this year, which will join the Kenworth and Peterbilt hybrid medium-duty vehicles.
Switching topics. PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $238 million in the third quarter compared to $253 million a year ago, reflecting lower level of assets. PACCAR Financial's third quarter pretax income improved to $42 million, more than double the $18 million earned last year. This was achieved due to better finance margins and a reduction in the provision for credit losses. The credit loss provision for the third quarter 2010 was $13.7 million compared to $26.6 million in 2009.
Looking at the global market. PACCAR's investment of $3.8 billion in the last decade has enabled the company to enhance its operating efficiency, develop innovative new products, launch the PACCAR MX engine in North America and in Europe, strengthen its dealer network and become an industry leader in information technology. 2010, while very tough economically, was an excellent year for new product introductions, as Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF launched more new vehicles and major options than at any time in our history.
The success of the Kenworth T700, the Peterbilt 587 and the complete line of vocational bodies for DAF as shown at the recent truck show in Hannover, Germany, have our customers excited about the future.
We've indicated in the third quarter press release that PACCAR will be doubling its capital expenditures next year. I know a number of you are interested in that. And the funding will be focused on accelerating new vehicle development, customer service initiatives, meeting the Euro 6 engine emission requirements, which come into play in 2013, and of course our global expansion. These investments will complement our industry-leading powertrain and manufacturing investments over the last decade.
In summary, the global economic environment is still very unsettled. However, PACCAR's balanced approach in all phases of the business cycle positions us to generate improved results for our shareholders as the global economy recovers.
We look forward to welcoming many of you to the investor conference tomorrow, and thank you. Appreciate your questions."

So I don't think it's anything unusual or even a surprise that the U.S., Canadian and let's call it Mexican markets are just becoming a little bit more aligned with the rest of the world in terms of engine preference. And so I would say, if you could cascade that down, all different types of customers are interested in the 13 liter from the small operator to the largest fleets. They're saying we have similar operating characteristics to companies that operate in South America or Australia or Europe or even into Asia as the infrastructure gets built there.

PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the third quarter 2010. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $2.5 billion, which is 26% higher than the $2 billion in the third quarter last year. Net in",1031,"Good morning. PACCAR today reported improved revenues and net income for the third quarter 2010. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $2.5 billion, which is 26% higher than the $2 billion in the third quarter last year. Net income improved to $120 million compared to $13 million a year ago. I'm very proud of our 16,500 employees who have delivered outstanding performance to our shareholders and customers in an uneven and unsettled global economy. 
In the U.S. and Canada, our customers are starting to adjust to the higher-priced vehicles that have resulted from the EPA 2010 emission change. The U.S. and Canadian retail truck sales are estimated to improve to a range of 120,000 to 130,000 units this year compared to 108,000 last year.
European truck registrations for the third quarter improved 16% compared to the second quarter. As a result, we expect the 15-ton plus market registrations in Europe to be between 160,000 and 170,000 units this year, comparable to the 168,000 units last year.
The global economic outlook is improving, which is benefiting the truck market. PACCAR delivered 5% more trucks in the third quarter than the second quarter this year. And looking ahead, we think that truck production for PACCAR could be up 20% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.
We discussed in our analyst call in April the three-step process that the truck industry usually progresses as it recovers from a recession. First is improvement in parts and service. Second is used truck values increasing. And third is more new truck orders. For PACCAR in the U.S. and Canada, the good news is that parts sales are up 15% to 20% compared to last year, and used truck pricing has increased 10% to 15%.
More good news is that the U.S. and Canadian industry Class 8 truck orders for the first nine months are up 23% compared to a year ago although they may be slowing now in the industry.
In Europe, PACCAR Parts business and used truck pricing have both improved by 10% to 15%. And DAF's new truck production for the first nine months is 25% higher than last year.
As we look at the European truck market, we're pleased that DAF is now the leader in the On-highway Tractor segment and has achieved a record overall market share of 15.8%. DAF is steadily progressing toward its medium-term goal of 20% share in Europe.
Talking about our customers. They're benefiting from improved freight volumes, higher freight rates and some stable diesel prices. They continue to increase the utilization of their fleets, which in turn is driving increased aftermarket parts and service business for our dealers.
PACCAR's quarterly aftermarket parts sales increased to $554 million, the highest level since the third quarter of 2008.
PACCAR's strong balance sheet and positive cash flow of $1.1 billion this year have enabled the company to continuously reinvest in the business, enhance our operating efficiency and develop innovative new products such as the PACCAR MX diesel engine. Assembly of the PACCAR MX engine began in June at our new manufacturing facility in Columbus, Mississippi. And in September, the engine plant was officially dedicated in a ceremony that was attended by state and local officials, including Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour. We are now installing the MX engine in over 20% of Kenworth and Peterbilt vehicles. This is the highest level of 13-liter engine installations in our Kenworth and Peterbilts and reflects customer recognition of the PACCAR MX engine's excellent power-to-weight ratio, fuel economy and reliability.
Feedback from our customers of the PACCAR MX engine is excellent with over 2,000 MX engines now installed in Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks.
Speaking of engines, the EPA issued its proposed greenhouse gas regulations yesterday. And as you know, PACCAR is an environmental leader worldwide. We are reviewing the proposed regulations, which is 673 pages long, and we're analyzing the details and look forward to working with the EPA in this during the 60-day comment period to fully understand all the aspects of the proposed regulations.
I’d also like to point out, speaking of environment, that DAF will launch their hybrid LF truck this year, which will join the Kenworth and Peterbilt hybrid medium-duty vehicles.
Switching topics. PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $238 million in the third quarter compared to $253 million a year ago, reflecting lower level of assets. PACCAR Financial's third quarter pretax income improved to $42 million, more than double the $18 million earned last year. This was achieved due to better finance margins and a reduction in the provision for credit losses. The credit loss provision for the third quarter 2010 was $13.7 million compared to $26.6 million in 2009.
Looking at the global market. PACCAR's investment of $3.8 billion in the last decade has enabled the company to enhance its operating efficiency, develop innovative new products, launch the PACCAR MX engine in North America and in Europe, strengthen its dealer network and become an industry leader in information technology. 2010, while very tough economically, was an excellent year for new product introductions, as Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF launched more new vehicles and major options than at any time in our history.
The success of the Kenworth T700, the Peterbilt 587 and the complete line of vocational bodies for DAF as shown at the recent truck show in Hannover, Germany, have our customers excited about the future.
We've indicated in the third quarter press release that PACCAR will be doubling its capital expenditures next year. I know a number of you are interested in that. And the funding will be focused on accelerating new vehicle development, customer service initiatives, meeting the Euro 6 engine emission requirements, which come into play in 2013, and of course our global expansion. These investments will complement our industry-leading powertrain and manufacturing investments over the last decade.
In summary, the global economic environment is still very unsettled. However, PACCAR's balanced approach in all phases of the business cycle positions us to generate improved results for our shareholders as the global economy recovers.
We look forward to welcoming many of you to the investor conference tomorrow, and thank you. Appreciate your questions."

And it's certainly been a mainstay for many years and will continue to have a very important presence in the North American market. So I think that's -- let's just kind of put that out there. The 13 liter worldwide is the preferred large engine for a number of reasons: One being a little bit lighter weight, typically better fuel economy but that's kind of the standard. So I don't think it's anything unusual or even a surprise that the U.S., Canadian and let's call it Mexican markets are just becoming a little bit more aligned with the rest of the world in terms of engine preference. And so I would say, if you could cascade that down, all different types of customers are interested in the 13 liter from the small operator to the largest fleets. They're saying we have similar operating characteristics to companies that operate in South America or Australia or Europe or even into Asia as the infrastructure gets built there. So the 15 liter is a very important contributor and engine in North America. I see that it will continue to be.

Second, we invest in our suppliers where we'll actually purchase capital equipment, which allows them to increase their capacity, increase their quality, reduce their cost, improve their profitability. Third, we have an active Six Sigma program where we will go in and train our suppliers. Everybody from the shop floor to management on how to run their business. And fourth, we invite them into our engineering group at an early stage to get their input on new designs and how they can best partner with us. So that's how we approach it, and it works very, very well."

I think you could actually apply that question to the broader consumer that we all run into on a daily basis. There's been many pronouncements and headlines about the recession is over, but I think whoever came out with that has forgotten to tell the basic consumer because, you know what, in many towns across this great country, it certainly doesn't feel like the recession is over. So obviously, that has an impact on our customers and the trucking in general that people are saying, is it over? You say it is, but I see my neighbor's house just went into foreclosure. Nobody's building any new homes. Car production is at a 30-year low. Consumer spending is not really strong, I would say. So people are saying, tell me when I can see three, four strong economic growth quarters in a row then I'll feel better about it. And that applies to you, me and all of our customers."
