I'm Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me are our President, CEO and Chairman, John Lechleiter; our Chief Financial Officer, Derica Rice; our President of Lilly Research Laboratories, Dr. Steve Paul; and Ronika Pletcher and Nick Lemen from Investor Relations.During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decision. You can access the earnings press release, supporting materials, a live webcast and Internet-based replay and a podcast of this conference call at lilly.com. The supporting materials, the replay and the podcast will be available on our website through February 26, 2009.We accomplished a great deal in 2009 by once again delivering strong financial performance in a tough environment. As well as by implementing a series of actions in the speeding innovation to patients and delivering greater value to our customers. Just as we have done in the past three quarters, in the fourth quarter, we generated strong volume-driven revenue growth. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates, we also have generated an increase in gross margin as a percent revenue, leverage between revenue growth and operating income growth, robust EPS growth and strong operating cash flow. Our Q4 results capped a year of strong operating financial performance. This financial performance gives us the resources we need to strengthen and progress our pipeline, to invest in our transformation allowing us to speed development and improve our competitiveness in key therapeutic areas and geographies, to streamline our cost base, to deal with the patent expiration coming later this decade and to respond to a challenging healthcare environment.We will face our major patent expiration as a leaner more agile company. A company focused on innovation with a strong pipeline. Operating more efficiently and effectively and well positioned to resume sustained and sustainable growth. Now I'll turn the call over to John for a view of key events since our last earnings call."

Since our last earnings call, we continued our efforts to strengthen our operations and effectively utilize our resources typified by the following. Lilly signed a co-promotion agreement with Kowa Pharmaceuticals America to commercialize Livalo in the U.S. In addition, we entered into a licensing agreement with Kowa Company, Limited to market Livalo in Latin America. Livalo is a statin approved by the FDA in August 2009 for the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. On January 1, 2010, the company completed the sale of its Tippecanoe manufacturing facility in Lafayette, Indiana to Evonik Industries. Lilly and Bristol-Myers Squibb restructured our existing collaboration agreement to allow for the co-development and co-commercialization of necitumumab or IMC-11F8 in the U.S., Canada and Japan.Lilly also continued its effort to strengthen and advance our pipeline with the announcement of an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Incyte Corporation for the development and commercialization of Incyte's oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.On the regulatory front, Lilly received a number of regulatory approvals, including FDA approval of a Zyprexa Relprevv long-acting injection for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Byetta as monotherapy along with diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. And Zyprexa in tablet form as an option for the treatment of schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adolescents.The European Commission approved Adcirca as a once daily treatment option to improve exercise capacity for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, or IPAH, and PAH associated with connective tissue diseases in WHO functional classes two and three. The product also received regulatory approval in Canada and Japan. And finally, Shinogi received approval from Japanese regulatory authorities of Cymbalta for the treatment of depression.Before passing the call over to Derica, I would like to take a moment to once again recognize the efforts of Steve Paul, who is participating today in his last earnings call for Lilly. Steve will retire at the end of February after 17 years of service to Lilly. Under Steve's leadership, we built the most robust pipeline in Lilly's history with more than 60 molecules in the clinic, including 29 in Phases II and III. Steve also helped recruit many of LRLs [Lilly Research Laboratories] top scientific leaders during his 17 years here at the company. And he's played a key role in transforming Lilly's R&D to position us for the future. Steve's successor will be Dr. Jan Lundberg, former Executive Vice President and Head of Global Discovery Research at AstraZeneca. Over the past decade, Jan had a hand in delivering some 150 drug candidates to AstraZeneca's pipeline. Dr. Lundberg received his training at Sweden's Karolinska Institute, where he spent 18 years involved in academic research before joining the industry. Now Derica will discuss our fourth quarter financial results."

As I've done on previous calls, I'll focus my comments on the pro forma non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. This view assumes we own ImClone as of January 1, 2008, and it excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges. Now let's start on Slide 8 with a quick look at our fourth quarter income statement before reviewing the effect of foreign exchange. On a pro forma non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated strong revenue growth of 13% in the fourth quarter, while operating income fell 10%. This reduction in operating income was driven by a 6.4 percentage point drop in our gross margin percent. The decrease in gross margin percent from 82.3% to 75.9% is due to the unfavorable impact of cost of sales arising from the effect of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar on the international inventories sold in the period. Specifically, changes in the foreign currency value of the U.S. dollar lowered cost of sales in Q4 of 2008 while increasing cost of sales in Q4 of 2009.In December, we shared information with you on the trend in our gross margin as a percent of revenue, both with and without the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international inventories sold. Now many of you commented that this information was helpful. In the supplemental slides, you'll see that we've updated the slide we presented in December and that we have also provided gross margin as a percent of revenue for each quarter of 2008 and 2009, both with and without this FX effect.This quarter's operating expenses defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A grew slightly less than sale. Within operating expenses, marketing, selling and administrative expenses grew 12%, driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside of the U.S. and the impact of foreign exchange rate. While R&D expense grew 10% due to increased incentive compensation and increased late stage clinical trial costs.Moving down the income statement, you will see the improvement in other income due to lower net interest expense. In addition, our tax rate increased by about two percentage points. Net income and earnings per share declined 10% and 11%, respectively. Due to the negative effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our cost of goods sold, as I previously mentioned.Now for the year, you can see that we generated leverage between revenue and operating income as revenue grew 5%, while operating income grew a robust 15%. This leverage between revenue and operating income was driven by a 2.2 percentage point expansion in our gross margin percent. Net income and earnings per share both grew 16%.Now Slide 9 shows our reported income statement while Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and pro forma non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release. Now let's look at how foreign exchange affected our Q4 results starting with revenue. As you can see on Slide 11, for the fourth quarter, total revenue growth of 13% on a pro forma basis includes a favorable 3% impact from foreign exchange. After that impact, total revenue grew 10% driven by a robust 6% volume growth. This robust volume growth was consistent across all major geographies. Japan's substantial volume growth was largely driven by a Alimta's mid-2009 approval for both first line and second line non-small cell lung cancer.For the year, total revenue growth of 5% on a pro forma basis includes a 3% negative impact from foreign exchange. Absent that impact, total revenue grew 8% driven by 5% volume growth.On Slide 12, we provided the price, rate and volume analysis on a reported basis. Now let's look at the rest of the income statement.  Slide 13 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our pro forma non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. Now the numbers in the first column are the same as you saw earlier on our pro forma non-GAAP income statement. I'll focus my comments on the second column of numbers, which strips out the impact of foreign exchange rate on our pro forma non-GAAP results.First, for the quarter, you'll see the 10% revenue growth I mentioned previously. Below that, you'll see a 3% growth in cost of sales, while operating expenses grew slightly less than revenue this quarter. The 9% performance growth in operating expenses was driven by increases of 9% in both marketing, selling and administrative expenses and R&D expenses. Our 10% performance growth in revenue translated into 15% performance growth in operating income and 16% in EPS. Finally, you'll see in the last column that for the year, we grew revenue faster than both cost of sales and operating expenses leading to 14% performance growth in operating income and EPS.Now for your information, on Slide 14, we've provided the year-on-year growth of select line items of our reported income statement with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates. Comparisons of 2009 to 2008 operating income and EPS are not meaningful due to charges taken in 2008. Now let me wrap up my comments with our 2010 financial guidance. We reconfirm the 2010 financial guidance provided at our investor meeting in December. This guidance excludes the potential impact of healthcare reform in the U.S. And also as a reminder, our guidance reflects earnings per share of $4.65 to $4.85 on both a reported and non-GAAP basis. In terms of line item guidance, we expect total revenue to grow in the high single digits, driven primarily by Alimta, Cymbalta, Humalog, Cialis, Animal Health, Effient and the exenatide franchise. We anticipate gross margin as a percentage of revenue to be flat to declining. However, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, we expect gross margin as a percent of revenue to increase. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are projected to grow in the low- to mid-single digits. Research and development expenses are projected to grow in the low double digits. Other income for the year is expected to be a net deduction of between $150 million and $200 million and the effective tax rate for the full year should be approximately 22%.Finally, we expect cash flows to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion, anticipated business development activity and the company's dividend. Slide 16 provides a reconciliation between reported and pro forma non-GAAP EPS for 2009 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our 2010 guidance. Now let me turn the call over to Nick and Ronica for our product review and pipeline update. Nick?"
285467,78846340,47457,"Eli Lilly & Co., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-28-2010",2010-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Derica.

The last two quarterly calls, we discussed underlying prescription and shared market trends for several of our major products. Since we just provided detailed product updates at our meeting in December, this quarter, we'll take a look at three recently completed business development transactions. As mentioned earlier, in late December, Lilly entered into a co-promotion agreement in the U.S. and a licensing agreement in Latin America with Kowa to market Livalo. We are pleased to partner with Kowa and are excited to help bring this new statin to market. Livalo is in HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor approved by the FDA for patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated total cholesterol LDL-C, Apo B and triglycerides while increasing HDL-C. Livalo was approved by the FDA in August of 2009 and the drug has been marketed in Japan since 2003.This deal enables us to more effectively utilize our current sales force as it allows us to expand our product offerings in the cardiovascular therapeutic area, an area of high focus given the launch of Effient. While Livalo effectively lowers bad cholesterol similar to other prominent statins, Livalo will offer physicians an additional option for their patients who may not be responding to or tolerating their current treatment and for their more complex patients treated with multiple medications and at a risk of potential drug interaction that may occur with some of the currently available statins. Lilly and Kowa are working towards a mid-2010 launch of Livalo in the U.S., where Kowa will record sales and pay Lilly an undisclosed co-promotion fee based upon net sales. Under the U.S. agreement, the party shared cost of commercialization and development equally and Kowa is responsible for manufacturing the product while Lilly is responsible for distribution. The undisclosed upfront payment to Kowa will be amortized over the product's remaining patent life and will be booked to collaboration of the revenue. The agreement runs for the life of the patent, which has a current expiration date of January 2016. Kowa has applied for the five-year patent term extension.In Latin America, Lilly plans to submit Livalo to regulatory agencies during the second half of 2010, and hopes to launch Livalo by mid-2011. The agreement in Latin America is for a period of 10 years from product launch. In late December, Lilly also announced that it entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of Incyte's oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, INCB28050, currently in Phase II. The addition of this asset serves to further bolster our inflammatory and autoimmune disease pipeline. The asset is currently in an ongoing placebo controlled Phase II dose ranging study that has enrolled 100 patients with RA [rheumatoid arthritis]. After three months of treatment, patients in the placebo arm will crossover and receive active drug and the study will continue for another three months. We also plan to run a larger Phase IIb trial, which will generate the data necessary to inform dose selection for Phase III. To this point, there have been no scientific data disclosures on INCB28050. The current data disclosure plan includes sharing six-month data on the ongoing Phase II trial in patients with RA at the ACR meeting in October of this year. With Incyte also planning to share top line three-month results some time in the first half of the year.Lilly is very excited about this opportunity given that RA and other autoimmune diseases are chronic, debilitating diseases that still present an unmet medical need. The current therapeutic continuum typically starts with oral agents such as methotrexate but a significant proportion of patients are not well controlled. And therefore, typically move to biologics, most commonly the anti-TNFs. Even in patients receiving anti-TNFs, only about 50% achieve good ACR 50 response. Therefore, the normal treatment for these patients is to cycle one therapy to the next. If INCB28050 is successful with a favorable benefit risk profile, it could be positioned higher up the therapeutic continuum than anti-TNFs and therefore, not in direct competition with our own internal portfolio of biologics.We hope that our internal antibodies will be positioned at least initially as the treatment of choice following the failure of anti-TNF therapy. As safety and efficacy data on these assets increases, these compounds could assume a role as first line biologic after failure of oral therapy. Ronika?"

Necitumumab is a fully humanized version of Erbitux. Lilly and BMS will share the cost of developing and potentially commercializing necitumumab in the U.S., Canada and Japan. Lilly retains full rights to the asset in other markets around the world.Now I'll provide a brief update on our pipeline. Our pipeline slide demonstrates changes since our December 10 Analyst Meeting as of January 21. The recent addition is in progress of our compounds further underline our robust pipeline in both quantity and quality. Our clinical stage portfolio now stands at 64 distinct entities, including 29 compounds in Phase II and Phase III. We continue to develop a robust biotech portfolio. Biotech molecules represent nearly half of our late stage Phase II and III assets and over a third of our overall clinical portfolio. Our focus remains unchanged, advancing our pipeline as our number one priority. As reflected by the arrows on Slide 20 since our last formal portfolio review, we have advanced one oncology asset to Phase I; promoted three assets to Phase II, one for diabetes, a glucose kinase activator, one for psoriasis our anti-IL-23 antibody and one for cancer, an Eg5 inhibitor. Added our previously mentioned, new in-lines [ph] of asset INCB28050 and JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor for RA in Phase II advanced Tasisulam to Phase III as first patient visit occurred in late December. Added Livalo to our co-promotion and licensing agreement with Kowa in the U.S. and Latin America and finally, one Phase I oncology asset was terminated.Now let's turn to Slide 21 to highlight selected milestones between now and mid-2010.

So we're going to stick with the plans that we have in place now. we're pleased with the level of the access that we're gaining unrestricted in Tiers 2 and 3, the placement now of the product in the cath labs of hospitals that account for well over 50% of all the procedures, the stent placement procedures.

So our expectation would be that the FDA will in fact look at the data sets that the different companies have generated for the different molecules to make a determination of what the appropriate labeling is for that molecule. And in terms of expanding resources, my understanding is that at this point in time, we are essentially resourced along with Amylin to support our launch of Exenatide once weekly.

I should say the effectiveness of the molecule relative to other choices, we feel just as good about Effient today as we did when we launched the product. So I think it's too early to say that we should reset expectations. I think physicians are increasingly of a mind to ask how should the product be used, in which patients should I use the product.

So our inventory turns are about 12 months. So when we have those kinds of sharp movements, it takes about 12 months for the full effect to flow through our P&L.

So you would see a similar effect of what you saw in the fourth quarter. However, we anticipate that that would dissipate or moderate as we go through the year and rate normalize out. Secondly, in regards to our cost reduction programs, we continue to make very good progress. If you look at our headcount that we'll be reporting, we'll probably be down year-on-year somewhere around another 500 or 600 employees. And so we're making programs to our ultimate goal of just 5,000 by the end of 2011. You'll also see in regards to our $1 billion cost reduction goal, we continue to make very good progress and what you're going to see is probably not one big announcement that will come out, but you will see a series of actions that we take to steadily pull those costs out. Beginning with actions that we did with TP that we announced with TP last year. So with us completing the Evonik deal and closing that on January 1 of this year, you'll see that that's one step towards reducing our cost basis. In regards to your third question, in regards to the animal health outlook, we actually saw a nice rebound in the animal health market in the fourth quarter. So in regards to our Dairy business, which also affects our rBST compound, we actually saw milk prices or dairy prices increase, which was a very positive for the milk producers and therefore, they were much more able to use the additives or the enhancements. And we saw that reflected in our fourth quarter results for our animal health. The question is, how sustainable would that be. So we are carefully monitoring that as we enter the year of 2010, we have not seen a significant change in the first few weeks of January, but it's still early."

So your year-on-year compares in a number of these quarters, even if rates were to stay where they are today could be significantly swinging."

During this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide three and those outlined in our latest 10-K.
The information we provide about our products and our pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.

Q1 was a strong quarter for Lilly on many fronts. In terms of financial performance we posted robust results with volume-driven revenue growth, substantial leverage on a performance basis between growth in revenue and growth in cost of sales as well as in operating expenses, and significant improvement in other income.
As Derica will describe excluding the effect of US healthcare reform, this strong financial performance has positioned us to raise the top end of our guidance range by $0.05 and the bottom by $0.10. On our last call we discussed three business development deals that we had recently completed, with Kowa, Incyte, and Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Since that time we’ve continued to be active in business development completing three more deals. We’ve entered into a global licensing agreement with Acrux for the commercialization of an experimental underarm testosterone solution, completed a deal with Boehringer Ingelheim in which we re-acquired full rights to Cymbalta in OUS countries other than Japan, and we agreed to acquire European rights for several animal health products from Pfizer.
Like the three deals we discussed in January we think each of these deals helps to solidify our financial and commercial position in the short to medium term. Ronika and Nick will provide more details on these deals later in the call. 
On the regulatory front in Europe we submitted exenatide once weekly for regulatory review. Our regulatory team did a great job expediting this submission allowing us to submit well in advance of the end of the first half. Here in the US the FDA issued a complete response letter for exenatide once weekly or Bydureon. We expect to submit our response this week. 
Finally the PDUFA date for Cymbalta in chronic pain passed without FDA action. We expect that the FDA will schedule and advisory committee meeting in the second half of this year. On the legal front the Judge in the Southern District of Indiana case with [Teva] upheld our Gemzar compound patent and ruled in our favor on nearly all of the grounds Teva had raised for invalidity of our method of use patent. 
You may recall that the Judge in the Michigan case with [Sun] had already issued a partial summary judgment ruling invalidating our method of use patent on the grounds of [inaudible] double patenting. As a result the Judge in Indiana did not rule on this particular issue. In the Sun case the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will hear our appeal on May 7th.
The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences affirmed the US Patent Office’s rejection of the patent claim Pfizer had asserted for Viagra. As a result Pfizer’s litigation alleging that Cialis infringed Pfizer’s patent claim was dropped by agreement of both parties. Also in Cialis litigation the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the Delaware trial court’s decision rendering its opinion that certain scientists at Vanderbilt University should not be included as joint inventors on patents relating to Cialis and its use in treating erectile dysfunction. 
Finally we reached a proposed settlement of the outstanding shareholder derivative litigation. Now perhaps the biggest news for Lilly and for the healthcare industry was the passage of new legislation that brings significant changes to US healthcare. These changes began to effect our financial results in Q1 and will have a greater impact on our results in the future. 
Before discussing our Q1 financial performance and our 2010 guidance, let’s review some of the major provisions of the new legislation. As you’re probably aware many of the provisions that raised money to pay for healthcare reform take effect within the first 12 months. However the provisions expanding insurance coverage are not slated to take effect until 2014. Let’s start with those provisions that will effect our 2010 results. Changes to the Medicaid fee for service program and to the 340B program take effect retroactive to January 1st of this year.
For the Medicaid fee for service program these changes include an increase in the statutory minimum rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% and a limitation on the maximize rebate to 100% of the product’s price. Changes in the 340B program are focused on expansion of the program to include additional institutions such as children’s hospitals, freestanding cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, and rural referral centers and sole community hospitals meeting certain criteria for disproportionate share adjustment under the Social Security Act. 
Changes to managed Medicaid will take effect as of March 23, 2010, the date the healthcare legislation was signed. Specifically the new legislation calls for an expansion of Medicaid fee for service rebates to managed Medicaid. In addition our 2010 results will also be effected by channel accruals that we will have to book to reflect greater discounts and rebates to the various elements of healthcare reform. 
Why is this? Well, government expenditures for purchases in any given period correspond to sales we made to wholesalers in prior periods. Therefore in advance of the government expenditure occurring we need to reflect our best estimate of the eventual discounts and rebates we’ll have to pay. 
From a practical perspective this means we need to accrue for these future government discounts and rebates at the time we make our sale to wholesalers. In total we expect that these various elements of US healthcare reform will negatively effect our 2010 revenue by $350 to $400 million. 
Finally our 2010 results will be effected by changes to the subsidy paid by the government to employer’s who provide their retirees with the drug benefits that’s at least equivalent to the Medicare Part D drug benefit. Beginning in 2013 the Federal government will tax the subsidy it provides to such employers. 
While this tax will not take effect for three more years, accounting rules dictate that we recognize the present value of this future tax liability as a one-time charge upon passage of the tax law change. As this tax law was officially passed in March, our taxes for Q1 reflect a one-time charge of $85.1 million. 
Now let’s discuss those changes slated to take effect on January 1st of next year, on this date two additional provisions of the healthcare reform legislation will kick in. First branded pharmaceutical companies will provide a discount of 50% on drugs dispensed to certain Medicare Part D participants when they are in the donut hole. 
Second branded pharmaceutical companies will collectively pay a multibillion annual fee to the government. Implementation of these two provisions will undoubtedly be complex. Until specific regulations are written its not clear exactly how each of these provisions will be implemented. We’ve made initial estimates of the effect of these two provisions on our 2011 results.
Although these estimates could change substantially as the regulations are finalized. When these provisions are added to those taking effect in 2010 we anticipate that our 2011 US revenue could be negatively effected by $600 to $700 million. Keep in mind that our exposure to various elements of healthcare reform is dependent upon product mix. 
For example our exposure will decline significantly after Zyprexa patent expiration. By January, 2014 the US healthcare legislation calls for a significant expansion of insurance coverage. This includes expansion of the population eligible for Medicaid as well as the establishment of state health insurance exchanges. 
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated this will eventually extend coverage to approximately 32 million Americans who are currently uninsured. Finally the healthcare reform legislation authorizes a regulatory pathway for follow-on biologics. The legislation includes important incentives for biotech research including data package protection of 12 years. 
Now with this background, Derica will discuss our Q1 financial results and our 2010 guidance.

Now this view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairment, and other special charges. 
Since the ImClone acquisition was completed in late 2008, pro forma comparisons are no longer necessary. Now let’s start on slide eight with a quick look at our Q1 income statement before reviewing the effect of foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis you can see that we generated strong revenue growth of 9% in the first quarter, in spite of the negative impact of US healthcare reform.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased from 83.8% to 79.5% due to the effect on the cost of sales of changes in the value of the US dollar on international inventories sold in the period, specifically this effect significantly lowered cost of sales in Q1 of 2009 and modestly increased cost of sales in Q1 of 2010.
Once again in the supplement section of our slide deck we have provided a slide showing the trend in our gross margin as a percent of revenue both with and without this particular foreign exchange effect. Now this quarter’s operating expenses, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A grew by 7%, less than the 9% revenue growth. 
Within operating expenses, marketing, selling, and administrative expenses grew 6% driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside of the US and the impact of foreign exchange rates which were partially offset by lower legal expenses, while R&D expense grew 10% primarily due to increased late stage clinical trial costs. 
Now despite generating leverage between revenue and operating expenses, operating income declined 3% due to the significant increase in cost of sales caused by foreign exchange. Now moving down the income statement you will see an improvement in other income and this improvement is primarily due to damages recovered from generic pharmaceutical companies following our Zyprexa patent litigation in Germany, a gain related to the disposition of investment securities acquired in the ImClone acquisition, and lower net interest expense.
In addition our tax rate increased by over five percentage points driven primarily by the one-time charge of $85.1 million associated with the imposition of tax on the retiree drug subsidy. Let me also remind you that the failure to pass an extension of the R&D tax credit also served to increase our Q1 tax rate. 
Net income and earnings per share declined 1% and 2% respectively due to the negative effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our cost of goods sold and the impact of the US healthcare reform. Q1 earnings were reduced by $0.12 per share due to the impact of US healthcare reform. It was comprised of two items, first approximately $60 million or $0.04 per share in accruals for higher rebates and secondly, a one-time tax charge of $85.1 million or $0.08 per share. 
Slide nine shows our reported income statement while slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today’s earnings press release. Now let’s take a look at how foreign exchange effected our Q1 results and let’s start with revenue. 
As you can see on slide 11 total revenue growth of 9% includes a favorable 3% impact from foreign exchange. Absence that impact of foreign exchange total revenue grew 6% driven by 4% volume growth. Japan’s substantial volume growth continues driven by Alimta’s mid 2009 approval of both first line and second line non-small cell lung cancer, as well as continued strong growth in Humalog and Zyprexa. 
Lilly remains among the fastest growing companies in this very important market. Slide 12 shows the year on year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. The numbers in the first column are the same as those you saw on slide eight. 
I’ll focus my comments on the second column of numbers which strips out the effect of foreign exchange rates. First, you’ll see the 6% revenue growth I mentioned previously. Now below that you’ll see that the cost of sales grew by only 1% reflecting continued expansion of our gross margin percent on a performance basis. 
Operating expenses grew 5% which was also less than our revenue growth, and as mentioned earlier, increased investment in late stage clinical trials drove R&D which was up 9% on a performance basis. SG&A on the other hand, grew much less which was only 3%. As a result of holding growth in both cost of sales and operating expenses below the revenue growth rate, our 6% performance growth in revenue translated into 9% performance growth in operating income as as well as 10% growth in EPS, including the $0.12 per share negative impact of healthcare reform.
Now for your information on slide 13 we provided the year on year growth of select line items of our reported income statement both with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates. Now let me wrap up my comments with our 2010 financial guidance.
As you may recall up until now our 2010 guidance has explicitly excluded the potential effect of US healthcare reform. Now that specific legislation has been signed into law we are incorporating the estimated impact of this new legislation into our guidance. 
We’ll do so in two steps, first we’ll provide our 2010 guidance still excluding US healthcare reform so that you can have a clear idea of how our underlying financial expectations for the year have changed since our last earnings call. Then, we’ll layer in the estimated effect of US healthcare reform. Moving forward this will be the basis for future guidance updates.
So, excluding the estimated impact of US healthcare reform we are modifying our guidance to reflect our strong underlying business performance including improvement in other income as well as for recent movement in foreign exchange rates. 
At the bottom line we are raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year from a range of $465 to $4.85, to a range now of $4.75 to $4.90, an increase of $0.05 on the top end of the guidance and an increase of $0.10 on the bottom end of the guidance. 
In terms of line item guidance, we’ve slightly modified our revenue guidance to mid to high single-digits to reflect the recent weakness in foreign currencies versus prior periods. Other income and deductions is now forecast to be a net deduction of $50 to $100 million. This represents an improvement of $100 million from our previous guidance of a net reduction of $150 to $200 million. 
This improvement is primarily driven by recovery of damages from companies that had large generic [Lanzapine] in Germany, and a gain on the sale of investment securities acquired in the ImClone acquisition. All other line item guidance remains unchanged. On a reported basis, our earnings per share guidance excluding US healthcare reform reflects the $0.03 charge for the Acrux deal and the $0.02 restructuring charge resulting in an EPS range of $4.70 to $4.85 per share.
Now let’s discuss US healthcare reform and how we expect it will effect our financial results, as mentioned earlier we expect US healthcare reform to negatively effect our 2010 revenue by $350 to $400 million. In addition our 2010 results are also negatively effected by the one-time tax charge of $85 million related to the future taxation of the retiree drug subsidy.
Incorporating the estimated effect of US healthcare reform yields the following EPS and line item guidance, on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis, our 2010 EPS will be approximately $0.35 lower resulting in a range of $4.40 to $4.55 on a non-GAAP basis and a range of $4.35 to $4.50 on a reported basis. 
We now expect total revenue to grow in the mid single-digits driven primarily by Alimta, Cybalta, Humalog, Cialis, animal health, Effient, and the exenatide franchise, partially offset by the negative impact of US healthcare reform. We still anticipate gross margin as a percent of revenue to be flat to declining.
However excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, we still expect gross margin as a percent of revenue to increase. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are still projected to grow in the low to mid single-digits. Research and development expenses are also still projected to grow in the low double-digits.
As mentioned earlier other income for the year is now expected to be a net deduction of between $50 and $100 million and as a result of the $85 million charge in Q1 related to future taxation on the retiree drug subsidy, the effective tax rate for the full year is now anticipated to be approximately 23%. 
Note that our full year tax rate guidance assumes eventual extension of the R&D tax credit retroactive to January 1st, 2010. Finally we still expect cash flows to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion and anticipated business development activity and the company’s dividend. 
Slide 15 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2009 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our revised 2010 guidance. Now let me turn the call over to Ronika for an update on the Effient launch.

Sequential quarter to",663,"Thanks Derica, for Effient Q1 sales of $9 million showed modest growth over Q4 2009. However this included continued inventory reductions on the original stocking. We estimate inventory was reduced by $7 million in the first quarter. Sequential quarter total prescription growth was 124%. While uptick has been slower than planned we are encouraged by the recent demand trend.
Currently new to brand share for Effient exceeds 8% of the total OAP market and has continued to show strong growth. New to brand trends reflect placement of approximately 1800 patients on Effient therapy per week. Current estimates of the approximately 16,000 PCI’s are conducted in the US per week. 
Access continues to expand. Of targeted hospitals Effient is now on formulary and stocked in the cath lab in 75% of all accounts, up from 60% earlier this year leading our expectations. In addition payer formulary access continues to progress well. As of April 1st, examples of payers making positive decisions include express script, Medco, [inaudible], Healthnet, United Part D prescription solutions, and [inaudible] Therapeutics, as well as many other PBM’s and health plans. 
Finally in the US we believe our focus on the high risk ACS PCI patients such as those with diabetes has gained traction in the market as market research suggests that this patient type is often cited as improved and which physicians feel Effient is an appropriate choice. Our sales force is well prepared to communicate these messages using promotional materials that incorporate feedback from [DD Mac]. 
In Europe despite the widespread availability of generic clopidogrel, we continue to achieve strong reimbursement and favorable pricing. Reimbursement covers 100% of the label population in most countries. It is important to highlight that following hospital formulary approval protocol inclusion is a critical step in the hospital access process across Europe. 
In Germany Effient experienced a slower than expected start due to the complexity of the protocol inclusion and access process. However a clear account focus and intensified cath lab activities are accelerating access to formulary protocol inclusion and ultimately patient initiation. 
As a result first quarter sales in Germany showed a 147% increase over Q4. Similarly in the UK PCI centers and primary care [inaudible] have made progress establishing formulary access and creating protocols. The 59 PCI centers with current formulary approval represents 75% of all PCI’s performed in the UK. As a result first quarter sales in the UK increased 190% over the previous quarter. 
In the near-term we expect OUS sales growth to be bolstered by uptick in recently launched markets. Newly launched Effient in Australia in December of last year notably Effient was approved on its first submission in Australia and was listed for the full label population and length of therapy. We launched Effient in France in January and we’ve integrated learnings from the UK and Germany to drive quicker formulary access and protocol inclusion. 
Most recently we launched Effient in Spain in late March, in Italy, early April. Remaining planned launches in 2010 include Canada and over 30 additional countries. In March Lilly entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement for the commercialization of Acrux’s experimental underarm testosterone solution Axiron. 
The product is currently under regulatory review by the FDA for the treatment of testosterone deficiency in men. In exchange for these rights, Acrux will receive and upfront payment of $50 million plus $3 million upon transfer of manufacturing assets. Acrux may also receive a milestone payment upon issuance of marketing authorization in the US and commercial milestones in royalties based upon global sales of Axiron. 
We believe that Axiron will be a strong strategic fit for Lilly leveraging our experience in men’s health with Cialis to advance both the science and clinical outcomes for men with low testosterone. Axiron has the potential to be the first testosterone solution to be applied via an underarm applicator for patients who have testosterone deficiency. 
We look forward to working with Acrux and the FDA during the regulatory review process.

This termination means that excluding Japan, all rights to duloxetine for all indications will revert back to Lilly. Lilly paid $400 million upfront to BI. In addition BI will receive a royalty on sales through the end of 2012.
Over the past few years we’ve been steadily building our animal health business, both through organic growth particularly in the large and growing companion animal segment and through acquisitions. 
In 2007 we acquired [Ivy] Animal Health, in 2008 we acquired worldwide rights, to [Monsanto’s] dairy cow supplement [Posilac] and in March of this year we agreed to acquire European rights to certain of Pfizer’s animal health products. These products are used in both production and companion animals. These products also include vaccines, a new area for us and one we are poised to expand in the coming years with our own pipeline.
To support our entry and future growth in vaccines, the [transic] action also included the acquisition of a vaccine manufacturing plant in Ireland. Detailed financial terms of this deal are not being disclosed. This deal is expected to close in Q2 pending regulatory approvals. Now I’ll provide an update on our pipeline.
Our pipeline slide demonstrates changes since our January 21 earnings call as of April 12. The recent additions in progress of our compounds further underline our robust pipeline in both quantity and quality. Our clinical stage portfolio now stands at 68 distinct NME’s, including 30 compounds in Phase 2 and Phase 3.
We continue to develop a robust biotech portfolio. Biotech molecules represent half our late stage Phase 2 and Phase 3 assets and over a third of our overall clinical portfolio. As we’ve said before advancing our pipeline is our number one priority. As reflected by the arrows on slide 20 since our last formal portfolio update, we have advanced four assets into Phase 1, one for anemia, two for cancer and one for pain, promoted one asset to Phase 2, our Basal insulin for diabetes, added Axiron for testosterone deficiency, and finally one Phase 1 schizophrenia asset was terminated. 
So while the patent expirations of the coming years will hit us hard, we have eight molecules in Phase 3 today and we anticipate at least 10 molecules in Phase 3 by 2011, if not sooner, with more coming behind. We expect that this will position us to launch two novel molecules per year beginning in 2013 providing a foundation for future growth. 
We’ve seen encouraging progress in our late stage pipeline. Our Alzheimer’s program continue to enroll ahead of schedule. We completed enrollment of our first Phase 3 trial for Semagacestat, our [inaudible] inhibitor last year and will complete enrollment on the second Phase 3 study this month. 
We’ve also exceeded 50% enrollment on one of the Phase 3 studies for Solanezumab, our [inaudible] antibody and are closing in on 50% enrollment for the second Phase 3 study. We completed enrollment on the Phase 3 prelude trial evaluating Enzastaruin for diffused large B cell lymphoma. We also initiated our Phase 3 award program for our GLP-1Fc assets in the first quarter and we have Phase 2 data on NERI for depression, both as a mono therapy and for augmentation and are moving forward with our plans to initiate Phase 3 in the first half of 2011.
We plan to present this data at a scientific conference in the future. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we will open the call for the Q&A session.

Now my rationale behind that is that there is still for some of the elements of the healthcare legislation still being discussed and still to be further defined, especially around the excise tax as it relates to the composition of sales and whether it will be branded sales, and so forth.

Clearly in China, marked by China, Brazil and Turkey where we have a great presence, but we’re not just looking at exercising those opportunities on a commercial basis, we’re also taking advantage on R&D.
So, for example we are increasing both our R&D and manufacturing presence in China. We’ve actually doubled the size of our sales organization in China over the last 12 months to take advantage of our diabetes and [CNS] and oncology portfolio there. So, while it may not be I guess as transparent to the marketplace we are employing a lot of different efforts and strategies there to take advantage of that marketplace.
However, and if you look at our price rate volume slide, that gives you some idea if you’re looking at the rest of the world at what we are able to achieve in those markets today.

There’s one that we have quantified and put in some potential upside for and that is a few more individuals actually getting through the donut hole as opposed to stopping treatment under the current reimbursement scheme.
Frankly there’s not a huge percentage currently because [inaudible] example and probably the one we have the biggest issue in our portfolio we estimated about 15% to 30% at most of patients stop treatment as they hit the donut hole. Some of that you just might expect from normal compliance. Some of it could be financially related. So there could be a slight benefit there but its not a large impact.
The other one that I’ve heard a number of people on the street discuss is our doctors currently not putting patients on medications because they’re quite sure they won’t be able to afford them, and they don’t want to start them to have them have partial treatment. Early market research would indicate that you need to have a more substantial closing of the donut hole to make a significant impact in that particular area.
The other thing for the 21 months, just to give you the math as well to make it easy on you, September we completed enrollment in the first trial 21 months from that date would be approximately June of 2011. If we complete enrollment as Nick said which we plan to here in April on the second trial, that takes you up to January of 2012. As we’ve discussed in the past its very likely that we will hold off on announcing results from the first trial until we have both trials actually closed.
We can preserve the data integrity of all the data from the second trial as well.

During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest 10-K. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. You can access the earnings press release, supporting materials, a live webcast and Internet-based replay and a podcast of this conference call at lilly.com. The supporting materials, the replay and the podcast will be available on our Web site through May 21, 2010.
Q1 was a strong quarter for Lilly on many fronts. In terms of financial performance, we posted robust results with volume-driven record revenue growth, substantial leverage on a performance basis between growth in revenue and growth in cost of sales as well as in operating expenses and significant improvement in other income. As Derica will describe, excluding the effect of U.S. healthcare reform, this strong financial performance has positioned us to raise the top end of our guidance range by $0.05 and the bottom end by $0.10. 
On our last call we discussed three business development deals that we had recently competed with Kowa, Incyte and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Since that time, we've continued to be active in business development completing three more deals. We've entered into a global licensing agreement with Acrux with the commercialization of an experimental underarm testosterone solution, completed a deal with Boehringer Ingelheim in which we reacquired full rights to Cymbalta in OUS countries other than Japan and we agreed to acquire European rights for several Animal Health products from Pfizer. Like the three deals we discussed in January, we think each of these deals helps to solidify our financial and commercial position in the short to medium term. Ronika and Nick will provide more details on these deals later in the call. 
On the regulatory front, in Europe we submitted exenatide once weekly for regulatory review. Our regulatory team did a great job expediting this submission allowing us to submit well in advance of the end of the first half.  Here in the U.S., the FDA issued a complete response letter for exenatide once weekly or Bydureon. We expect to submit our response this week. Finally, the PDUFA date for Cymbalta and chronic pain passed without FDA action. We expect that the FDA will schedule an advisory committee meeting in the second half of this year. On the legal front, the judge in the Southern District of Indiana case with Teva, upheld our Gemzar compound patent and ruled in our favor on nearly all of the grounds Teva had raised for invalidity of our method-of-use patent. You may recall that the judge in the Michigan case with Sun had already issued a partial summary judgment ruling invalidating our method-of-use patent on the grounds of obviousness type double patenting. As a result, the judge in Indiana did not rule on this particular issue. 
In the Sun case, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will hear our appeal on May 7. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences affirmed the U.S. Patent office's rejection of the patent claim Pfizer had asserted for VIAGRA. As a result, Pfizer's litigation alleging that Cialis infringed Pfizer's patent claim was dropped by agreement of both parties. Also in Cialis litigation, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the Delaware trial court's decision rendering its opinion that certain scientists as Vanderbilt University should not be included as joint inventors on patents relating to Cialis and its use in treating erectile dysfunction. 
Finally, we reached a proposed settlement of the outstanding shareholder derivative litigation. Now perhaps the biggest news for Lilly, and for the healthcare industry, was the passage of new legislation that brings significant changes to U.S. healthcare. These changes began to affect our financial results in Q1 and will have a greater impact on our results in the future. Before discussing our Q1 financial performance and our 2010 guidance, let's review some of the major provisions of the new legislation. 
As you're probably aware, many of the provisions that raised money to pay for healthcare reform take effect within the first 12 months. However, the provisions expanding insurance coverage are not slated to take effect until 2014. 
Let's start with those provisions that will affect our 2010 results. Changes to the Medicaid fee-for-service program and for the 340B. program take effect retroactive to January 1 of this year. For the Medicaid fee-for-service program, these changes include an increase in the statutory minimum rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% and a limitation on the maximum rebate to 100% of the product's price. 
Changes in the 340B program are focused on expansion of the program to include additional institutions such as children's hospitals, freestanding cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals and rural referral centers and sole community hospitals meeting certain criteria for a disproportion of share adjustment under the Social Security Act. Changes to managed Medicaid will take effect as of March 23, 2010, the date the healthcare legislation was signed. Specifically, the new legislation calls for an expansion of Medicaid fee-for-service rebates to managed Medicaid. In addition, our 2010 results will also be affected by channel accruals that we will have to book to reflect greater discounts and rebates for the various elements of healthcare reform. Why is this? Well, government expenditures for purchases in any given period correspond to sales that we made to wholesalers in prior periods. Therefore, in advance of the government expenditure occurring, we need to reflect our best estimate of the eventual discounts and rebates we'll have to pay. From a practical perspective, this means that we need to accrue for these future government discounts and rebates at the time we make our sale to wholesalers. In total, we expect that these various elements of U.S. healthcare reform will negatively affect our 2010 revenue by $350 million to $450 million. 
Finally, our 2010 results will be affected by changes to the subsidy paid by the government to employers who provide their retirees with a drug benefit that's at least equivalent to the Medicare Part D drug benefit. Beginning in 2013, the federal government will tax the subsidy it provides to such employers. While this tax will not take effect for three more years, accounting rules dictate that we recognize the present value of this future tax liability as a one-time charge upon passage of the tax law change. As this tax law was officially passed in March, our taxes for Q1 reflect a one-time charge of $85.1 million. 
Now let's discuss those changes slated to take effect on January 1 of next year. On this date, two additional provisions of the healthcare reform legislation will kick in. First, branded pharmaceutical companies will provide a discount of 50% on drugs dispensed to certain Medicare Part D participants when they are in the doughnut hole. Second, branded pharmaceutical companies will collectively pay a multi-billion dollar annual fee to the government. Implementation of these two provisions will undoubtedly be complex. Until specific regulations are written, it's not clear exactly how each of these provisions will be implemented. We've made initial estimates of the effect of these two provisions on our 2011 results, although these estimates could change substantially as the regulations are finalized. 
When these provisions are added to those taking effect in 2010, we anticipate that our 2011 U.S. revenue could be negatively affected by $600 million to $700 million. Keep in mind that our exposure to various elements of healthcare reform is dependent upon product mix. For example, our exposure will decline significantly after the Zyprexa patent expiration. By January 2014, the U.S. healthcare legislation calls for a significant expansion of insurance coverage. This includes expansion of the population eligible for Medicaid as well as the establishment of state health insurance exchanges. The Congressional budget office has estimated this will eventually extend coverage to approximately 32 million Americans who are currently uninsured. Finally, the healthcare reform legislation authorizes a regulatory pathway for follow-on biologics. The legislation includes important incentives for biotech research including data package protection of 12 years. 
Now with this background, Derica will discuss our Q1 financial results and our 2010 guidance. Derica?"
285467,78846346,56491,"Eli Lilly & Co., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-19-2010",2010-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Phil. As I've been in the past, I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP results, which we believe provides insight into the underlying trends in our business.

As I've been in the past, I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP results, which we believe provides insight into the underlying trends in our business. Now this view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairment and other special charges. Since the ImClone acquisition was completed in late 2008, pro forma comparisons are no longer necessary. 
Now let's start on Slide 8 with a quick look at our Q1 income statement before reviewing the effect of foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated strong revenue growth of 9% in the first quarter, in spite of the negative impact of U.S. healthcare reform. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased from 83.8% to 79.5% due to the effect on the cost of sales of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar on international inventories sold in the period. Specifically, this effect significantly lowered cost of sales in Q1 of 2009 and modestly increased cost of sales in Q1 of 2010. Once again, in the supplemental section of our slide deck, we have provided a slide showing the trend in our gross margin as a percent of revenue both with and without this particular foreign exchange effect. 
Now this quarter's operating expenses, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, grew by 7%, less than the 9% revenue growth. Within operating expenses, marketing, selling and administrative expenses grew 6% driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside of the U.S. and the impact of foreign exchange rates, which were partially offset by lower legal expenses, while R&D expense sales grew 10% primarily due to increased late stage clinical trial costs. 
Now despite generating leverage between revenue and operating expenses, operating income declined 3% due to the significant increase in cost of sales caused by foreign exchange. 
Now moving down the income statement, you'll see an improvement in other income and this improvement is primarily due to damages recovered from generic pharmaceutical companies following our Zyprexa patent litigation in Germany, a gain related to the disposition of investment securities acquired in the ImClone acquisition and lower net interest expense. In addition, our tax rate increased by over five percentage points driven primarily by the one-time charge of $85.1 million associated with the imposition of tax on the retiree drug subsidy. 
Let me also remind you that the failure to pass an extension of the R&D tax credit also served to increase our Q1 tax rate. Net income and earnings per share declined 1% and 2%, respectively, due to the negative effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our cost of goods sold and the impact of the U.S. healthcare reform. Q1 earnings were reduced by $0.12 per share due to the impact of U.S. healthcare reform and it was comprised of two items. First, approximately $60 million or $0.04 per share and accruals for higher rebates. And secondly, a one-time tax charge of $85.1 million or $0.08 per share. 
Slide 9 shows our reported income statement while Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in our today's earnings press release. 
Now let's take a look at how foreign exchange affected our Q1 results, and let's start with revenue. As you can see on Slide 11, total revenue growth of 9% includes a favorable 3% impact from foreign exchange. Absence that impact of foreign exchange total revenue grew 6% driven by 4% volume growth. Japan's substantial volume growth continues driven, by a lengthy mid-2009 approval of both first-line and second-line non-small cell lung cancer as well as continued strong growth in Humalog and Zyprexa. Lilly remains among the fastest growing companies in this very important market. 
Slide 12 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. The numbers in the first column are the same as those you saw on Slide 8. I'll focus my comments on the second column of numbers, which strips out the effect of foreign exchange rates. 
First, you'll see the 6% revenue growth I mentioned previously. Now below that, you'll see that the cost of sales grew by only 1% reflecting continued expansion of our gross margin percent on a performance basis. Operating expenses grew 5%, which was also less than our revenue growth. And as mentioned earlier, increased investment in late-stage clinical trials drove R&D, which was up 9% on a performance basis. SG&A on the other hand, grew much less, which was only 3%. As a result of holding growth in both cost of sales and operating expenses below the revenue growth rate, our 6% performance growth in revenue translated into 9% performance growth in operating income, as well as 10% growth in EPS, including the $0.12 per share negative impact of healthcare reform. 
Now for your information, on Slide 13, we've provided the year-on-year growth of select line items of our reported income statement both with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates. 
Now let me wrap up my comments with our 2010 financial guidance. As you may recall, up until now our 2010 guidance has explicitly excluded the potential effect of U.S. healthcare reform. Now that specific legislation has been signed into law, we are incorporating the estimated impact of this new legislation into our guidance. We'll do so in two steps. First, we'll provide our 2010 guidance still excluding U.S. healthcare reform so that you can have a clear idea of how our underlying financial expectations for the year has changed since our last earnings call. Then, we'll layer in the estimated effect of U.S. healthcare reform. Moving forward, this will be the basis for future guidance updates. So excluding the estimated impact of U.S. healthcare reform, we are modifying our guidance to reflect our strong underlying business performance, including improvement in other income, as well as for recent movements in foreign exchange rates. 
At the bottom line, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year from a range of $4.65 to $4.85, to a range now of $4.75 to $4.90, and an increase of a nickel on the top end on the guidance and an increase of a dime on the bottom end of the guidance. In terms of line item guidance, we've slightly modified our revenue guidance to mid- to high-single digits to reflect the recent weakness in foreign currencies versus prior periods. 
Other income and deductions is now forecast to be a net reduction of $50 million to $100 million. This represents an improvement of $100 million from our previous guidance of a net reduction of $150 million to $200 million. This improvement is primarily driven by recovery of damages from companies that had launched generic Olanzapine in Germany and a gain on the sale of investment securities acquired in the ImClone acquisition. All other line items guidance remains unchanged. On a reported basis, our earnings per share guidance excluding U.S. healthcare reform, reflects the $0.30 charge for the Acrux deal and a $0.02 restructuring charge resulting at an EPS range of $4.70 to $4.85 per share. 
Now let's discuss U.S. healthcare reform and how we expect it will affect our financial results. As mentioned earlier, we expect U.S. healthcare reform to negatively affect our 2010 revenue by $350 million to $400 million. In addition, our 2010 results are also negatively affected by the one-time tax charge of $85 million related to the future taxation of the retiree drug subsidy. Incorporating the estimated effect of U.S. healthcare reform yields the following EPS and line item guidance. On both a reported and a non-GAAP basis, our 2010 EPS will be approximately $0.35 lower resulting in a range of $4.40 to $4.55 on a non-GAAP basis and a range of $4.35 to $4.50 on a reported basis. We now expect total revenue to grow in the mid-single digits driven primarily by Alimta, Cymbalta, Humalog, Cialis, Animal Health, Escient and the exenatide franchise, partially offset by the negative impact of U.S. healthcare reform. 
We still anticipate gross margin as a percent of revenue to be flat to declining. However, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold, we still expect gross margin as a percent of revenue to increase. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are still projected to grow in the low- to mid-single digits. Research and development expenses are also still projected to grow in the low double digits. As mentioned earlier, other income for the year is now expected to be a net deduction of between $50 million to $100 million, and as a result of the $85 million charge in Q1 related to future taxation under our retiree drug subsidy, the effective tax rates for the full year is now anticipated to be approximately 23%. Note that our full-year tax rate guidance assumes eventual extension of the R&D tax credit retroactive to January 1, 2010. Finally, we still expect cash flows to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion in anticipated business development activity and the company's dividend. 
Slide 15 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2009 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our revised 2010 guidance. 
Now let me turn the call over to Ronika for an update on the Escient launch."

Currently, new-to-brand share for Escient exceeds 8% of the total oral anti-platelet market and has continued to show strong growth. New-to-brand trends reflect placement of approximately 1,800 patients on Escient therapy per week. Current estimates of approximately 16,000 PCIs are conducted in the U.S. per week. 
Access continues to expand. Of targeted hospitals Escient is now now on formula and stocked in the cath lab in 75% of all accounts up from 60% earlier this year meeting our expectations. In addition, payer formulary access continues to progress well. As of April 1, examples of pairs making positive decisions include expressed grips, Medco, Worldpoint Anthem, Health Net, United Part D Prescription Solutions and Prime Therapeutics, as well as many other PBMs and health plans. 
Finally in the U.S., we believe our focus on the high-risk ACS PCI patients such as those with diabetes has gained traction in the market as market research suggests that this patient type is often cited as a group in which physicians feel Escient is an appropriate choice. 
Our sales force is well prepared to communicate these messages using promotional materials that incorporate feedback from DDMAC. In Europe, despite the widespread availability of generic caplitogrom [ph], we continue to achieve strong reimbursement and favorable pricing. Reimbursement covers 100% of the label population in most countries. It is important to highlight that following hospital formulary approval, protocol inclusion is a critical step in the hospital access process across Europe. 
In Germany, Escient experienced a slower than expected start due to the complexity of the protocol inclusion and access process. However, a clearer account focus and intensified cath lab activities are accelerating assess to formularies, protocol inclusion and ultimately patient initiation. As a result, first quarter sales in Germany showed a 147% increase over Q4. 
Similarity in the U.K., PCI centers and primary care trusts have made progress establishing formulary access and creating protocol. The 59 PCI centers with current formulary approval represent 75% of all PCIs performed in the U.K.. As a result, first quarter sales in the U.K. increased 190% over the previous quarter. In the near term, we expect OUS sales growth to be bolstered by uptake in recently launched markets. Lilly launched Escient Australia in December of last year. Notably Escient was approved on its first submission in Australia and was listed for the full label population and length of therapy. We launched Escient in France in January and we've integrated learnings from the U.K. and Germany to drive quicker formulary access and protocol inclusion. Most recently, we launched Escient in Spain in late March and Italy early April. Remaining plan launches in 2010 include Canada and over 30 additional countries. 
In March, Lilly entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement for the commercialization of Acrux's experimental underarm testosterone solution, Axiron. The product is currently under regulatory review by the FDA for the treatment of testosterone deficiency in men. In exchange for these rights, Acrux will receive an up front payment of $50 million plus $3 million upon transfer of manufacturing assets. Acrux may also receive a milestone payment upon issuance of marketing authorization in the U.S. and commercial milestones and royalties based upon global sales of Axiron. We believe that Axiron will be a strong strategic fit for Lilly, leveraging our experience in men's health with Cialis to advance both the science and clinical outcomes for men with low testosterone. Axiron has a potential to be the first testosterone solution to be applied via an underarm applicator for patients who have testosterone deficiency. We look forward to working with Acrux and the FDA during the regulatory review process. Nick?"

In addition, BI will receive a royalty on sales through the end of 2012. 
Over the past few years, we've been steadily building our Animal Health business, both through organic growth, particularly in the large and growing companion Animal segment and through acquisitions. In 2007, we acquired Ivy Animal Health. In 2008, we acquired worldwide rights to Monsanto's dairy cow supplement, Posilac, and in March of this year, we agreed to acquire European rights to certain of Pfizer's animal health products. These products are used in both production and companion animals. These products also include vaccines, a new area for us and one we are poised to expand in the coming years with our own pipeline. To support our entry and future growth in vaccines, the transaction also included the acquisition of a vaccine manufacturing plant in Ireland. Detailed financial terms of this deal are not being disclosed. This deal is expected to close in Q2 pending regulatory approval. 
Now I will provide an update on our pipeline. Our pipeline slide demonstrates changes since our January 21 earnings call as of April 12. The recent additions and progress of our compounds further underlined our robust pipeline in both quantity and quality. Our clinical stage portfolio now stands at 68 distinct NMEs including 30 compounds in Phase II and Phase III. We continue to develop a robust biotech portfolio. Biotech molecules represent half of our late-stage Phase II and Phase III assets and over a third of our overall clinical portfolio. As we've said before, advancing our pipeline is our number one priority. 
As reflected by the arrows on Slide 20, since our last formal portfolio update, we have advanced four assets into Phase I, one for anemia, two for cancer, and one for pain, promoted one asset to Phase II, our basal insulin for diabetes, added Axiron for testosterone deficiency and finally, one Phase I schizophrenia asset was terminated. So while the patent expirations of the coming years will hit us hard, we have eight molecules in Phase III today, and we anticipate at least 10 molecules in Phase III by 2011, if not sooner, with more coming behind. We expect that this will position us to launch two novel molecules per year beginning in 2013, providing a foundation for future growth. 
We've seen encouraging progress in our late-stage pipeline. Our Alzheimer's program continues to enroll ahead of schedule. We completed enrollment of our first Phase III trial for semagacestat, our gamma-secretase inhibitor, last year and will complete enrollment on the second Phase III study this month. We've also exceeded 50% enrollments on one of the Phase III studies for solanezumab, our A-beta antibody, and are closing in on 50% enrollment for the second Phase III study. We completed enrollment on the Phase III prelude trial evaluating Enzastaurin for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We also initiated our Phase III award program for our GLP-1 Fc asset in the first quarter, and we have Phase II data on NERI for depression, both as a monotherapy and for augmentation and are moving forward with our plans to initiate Phase III in the first half of 2011. We plan to present this data at a scientific conference in the future. 
This concludes our prepared remarks and now we will open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, first caller please."

In regards to the healthcare reform impact, the aggregate numbers that we provided of $350 million to $400 million impact in ’10 and the $600 million to $700 million in ‘11, that's the level that we’re comfortable disclosing at this time. We do not have plans to disclose the pieces of that in terms of breaking it down into the elements of the excise tax versus the Medicaid rebate. Now my rationale behind that is that they’re still, for some of those elements of the healthcare legislation, still being discussed and still to be further defined, especially around the excise tax as it relates to the composition of sales and will it be branded sales, so forth. So it would be premature to try to get to that level of detail at this stage but we did try to provide to you all at an aggregate level what we think in totality the range of the impact could be. In regards to our emerging market strategy, in fact, we are quite active in that space in terms of trying to take advantage of the opportunities in those geographies. Clearly in China, much like China, Brazil and Turkey where we have a great presence but we’re not just looking at exercising those opportunities on the commercial basis. We're also taking advantage on the R&D. So for example, we are increasing both our R&D and manufacturing presence in China. We've actually doubled the size of our sales organization in China over the last 12 months to take advantage of our diabetes and CNS [ph] and oncology portfolio there. So while it may not be, I guess, as transparent to the marketplace, we are employing a lot of different efforts and strategies there to take advantage of that marketplace. And if you look at our price rate volume slide, that gives you some idea if you're looking at the rest of the world what we are able to achieve in those markets today."

In terms of the potential benefit coming from additional patient utilization as Pharma companies help fill the doughnut hole, there are two components that we’ve looked at. There's one that we have quantified and put in some potential upside for and that is a few more individuals actually getting through the doughnut hole as opposed to stopping treatment under the current reimbursement scheme. Frankly, there's not a huge percentage currently. If we take FORTEO as an example, and probably the one where we had the biggest issue in our portfolio, we estimated about 15% to 30%, at most, of patients stop treatment as they hit the doughnut hole. Some of that you just might expect from normal compliance; some of it could be financially related. And so there could be a slight benefit there but it is not a large impact. The other one that I've a heard number of people on the street discuss is are doctors currently not putting patients on medications because they’re quite sure that they won't be able to afford them and they don't want to start them to have them have partial treatment. Early market research would indicate that you need to have a more substantial closing of the doughnut hole to make a significant impact in that particular area. And the other thing, for the 21 months, just so that you can do the math as, but to make it easy on you, September we completed enrollment in the first trial. 21 months from that date would be approximately June of '11. If we complete enrollment of next [indiscernible], which we plan to here in April on the second trial, that takes you up in January of '12. As we’ve discussed in the past, it's very likely that we will hold off on announcing results from the first trial until we have both trials actually closed so we can preserve the data integrity of all the data from the second trial as well."

Today, we've taken out about 1,500 of the 5,500 and we’ve made considerable progress in terms of our $1 billion savings goal, so we’re still very good there. The impact that you're seeing us talk about here on the call primarily only relates to the top line impact both in '10 and '11."

We’ve had substantial leverage on a performance basis, which drove operating income to grow faster than our revenue, and we've also seen significant improvement in other income, as we highlighted.

This strong financial performance also provides the resources we need to strengthen and progress our pipeline and engage in business development and pay our dividend.

Q1 was a strong quarter for Lilly on many fronts. In terms of financial performance, we posted robust results with volume-driven record revenue growth, substantial leverage on a performance basis between growth in revenue and growth in cost of sales as well as in operating expenses and significant improvement in other income. As Derica will describe, excluding the effect of U.S. healthcare reform, this strong financial performance has positioned us to raise the top end of our guidance range by $0.05 and the bottom end by $0.10. 
On our last call we discussed three business development deals that we had recently competed with Kowa, Incyte and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Since that time, we've continued to be active in business development completing three more deals. We've entered into a global licensing agreement with Acrux with the commercialization of an experimental underarm testosterone solution, completed a deal with Boehringer Ingelheim in which we reacquired full rights to Cymbalta in OUS countries other than Japan and we agreed to acquire European rights for several Animal Health products from Pfizer. Like the three deals we discussed in January, we think each of these deals helps to solidify our financial and commercial position in the short to medium term. Ronika and Nick will provide more details on these deals later in the call. 
On the regulatory front, in Europe we submitted exenatide once weekly for regulatory review. Our regulatory team did a great job expediting this submission allowing us to submit well in advance of the end of the first half.  Here in the U.S., the FDA issued a complete response letter for exenatide once weekly or Bydureon. We expect to submit our response this week. Finally, the PDUFA date for Cymbalta and chronic pain passed without FDA action. We expect that the FDA will schedule an advisory committee meeting in the second half of this year. On the legal front, the judge in the Southern District of Indiana case with Teva, upheld our Gemzar compound patent and ruled in our favor on nearly all of the grounds Teva had raised for invalidity of our method-of-use patent. You may recall that the judge in the Michigan case with Sun had already issued a partial summary judgment ruling invalidating our method-of-use patent on the grounds of obviousness type double patenting. As a result, the judge in Indiana did not rule on this particular issue. 
In the Sun case, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will hear our appeal on May 7. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences affirmed the U.S. Patent Office's rejection of the patent claim Pfizer had asserted for VIAGRA. As a result, Pfizer's litigation alleging that Cialis infringed Pfizer's patent claim was dropped by agreement of both parties. Also in Cialis litigation, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the Delaware trial court's decision rendering its opinion that certain scientists at Vanderbilt University should not be included as joint inventors on patents relating to Cialis and its use in treating erectile dysfunction. 
Finally, we reached a proposed settlement of the outstanding shareholder derivative litigation. Now perhaps the biggest news for Lilly, and for the healthcare industry, was the passage of new legislation that brings significant changes to U.S. healthcare. These changes began to affect our financial results in Q1 and will have a greater impact on our results in the future. Before discussing our Q1 financial performance and our 2010 guidance, let's review some of the major provisions of the new legislation. 
As you're probably aware, many of the provisions that raised money to pay for healthcare reform take effect within the first 12 months. However, the provisions expanding insurance coverage are not slated to take effect until 2014. 
Let's start with those provisions that will affect our 2010 results. Changes to the Medicaid fee-for-service program and to the 340B program take effect retroactive to January 1 of this year. For the Medicaid fee-for-service program, these changes include an increase in the statutory minimum rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% and a limitation on the maximum rebate to 100% of the product's price. 
Changes in the 340B program are focused on expansion of the program to include additional institutions such as children's hospitals, freestanding cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals and rural referral centers and sole community hospitals meeting certain criteria for disproportionate share adjustment under the Social Security Act. Changes to managed Medicaid will take effect as of March 23, 2010, the date the healthcare legislation was signed. Specifically, the new legislation calls for an expansion of Medicaid fee-for-service rebates to managed Medicaid. In addition, our 2010 results will also be affected by channeled accruals that we will have to book to reflect greater discounts and rebates for the various elements of healthcare reform. Why is this? Well, government expenditures for purchases in any given period correspond to sales we made to wholesalers in prior periods. Therefore, in advance of the government expenditure occurring, we need to reflect our best estimate of the eventual discounts and rebates we'll have to pay. From a practical perspective, this means that we need to accrue for these future government discounts and rebates at the time we make our sale to wholesalers. In total, we expect that these various elements of U.S. healthcare reform will negatively affect our 2010 revenue by $350 million to $400 million. 
Finally, our 2010 results will be affected by changes to the subsidy paid by the government to employers who provide their retirees with a drug benefit that's at least equivalent to the Medicare Part D drug benefit. Beginning in 2013, the federal government will tax the subsidy it provides to such employers. While this tax will not take effect for three more years, accounting rules dictate that we recognize the present value of this future tax liability as a one-time charge upon passage of the tax law change. As this tax law was officially passed in March, our taxes for Q1 reflect a one-time charge of $85.1 million. 
Now let's discuss those changes slated to take effect on January 1 of next year. On this date, two additional provisions of the healthcare reform legislation will kick in. First, branded pharmaceutical companies will provide a discount of 50% on drugs dispensed to certain Medicare Part D participants when they are in the doughnut hole. Second, branded pharmaceutical companies will collectively pay a multi-billion dollar annual fee to the government. Implementation of these two provisions will undoubtedly be complex. Until specific regulations are written, it's not clear exactly how each of these provisions will be implemented. We've made initial estimates of the effect of these two provisions on our 2011 results, although these estimates could change substantially as the regulations are finalized. 
When these provisions are added to those taking effect in 2010, we anticipate that our 2011 U.S. revenue could be negatively affected by $600 million to $700 million. Keep in mind that our exposure to various elements of healthcare reform is dependent upon product mix. For example, our exposure will decline significantly after the Zyprexa patent expiration. By January 2014, the U.S. healthcare legislation calls for a significant expansion of insurance coverage. This includes expansion of the population eligible for Medicaid as well as the establishment of state health insurance exchanges. The Congressional budget office has estimated this will eventually extend coverage to approximately 32 million Americans who are currently uninsured. Finally, the healthcare reform legislation authorizes a regulatory pathway for follow-on biologics. The legislation includes important incentives for biotech research including data package protection of 12 years. 
Now with this background, Derica will discuss our Q1 financial results and our 2010 guidance. Derica?"

As I've been in the past, I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP results, which we believe provides insight into the underlying trends in our business. Now this view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairment and other special charges. Since the ImClone acquisition was completed in late 2008, pro forma comparisons are no longer necessary. 
Now let's start on Slide 8 with a quick look at our Q1 income statement before reviewing the effect of foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated strong revenue growth of 9% in the first quarter, in spite of the negative impact of U.S. healthcare reform. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased from 83.8% to 79.5% due to the effect on the cost of sales of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar on international inventories sold in the period. Specifically, this effect significantly lowered cost of sales in Q1 of 2009 and modestly increased cost of sales in Q1 of 2010. Once again, in the supplemental section of our slide deck, we have provided a slide showing the trend in our gross margin as a percent of revenue both with and without this particular foreign exchange effect. 
Now this quarter's operating expenses, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, grew by 7%, less than the 9% revenue growth. Within operating expenses, marketing, selling and administrative expenses grew 6% driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside of the U.S. and the impact of foreign exchange rates, which were partially offset by lower legal expenses, while R&D expense sales grew 10% primarily due to increased late stage clinical trial costs. 
Now despite generating leverage between revenue and operating expenses, operating income declined 3% due to the significant increase in cost of sales caused by foreign exchange. 
Now moving down the income statement, you'll see an improvement in other income. And this improvement is primarily due to damages recovered from generic pharmaceutical companies following our Zyprexa patent litigation in Germany, a gain related to the disposition of investment securities acquired in the ImClone acquisition and lower net interest expense. In addition, our tax rate increased by over five percentage points driven primarily by the one-time charge of $85.1 million associated with the imposition of tax on the retiree drug subsidy. 
Let me also remind you that the failure to pass an extension of the R&D tax credit also served to increase our Q1 tax rate. Net income and earnings per share declined 1% and 2%, respectively, due to the negative effect of changes in foreign exchange rate on our cost of goods sold and the impact of the U.S. healthcare reform. Q1 earnings were reduced by $0.12 per share due to the impact of U.S. healthcare reform and it was comprised of two items: First, approximately $60 million or $0.04 per share in accruals for higher rebates; and secondly, a one-time tax charge of $85.1 million or $0.08 per share. 
Now, Slide 9 shows our reported income statement while Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in our today's earnings press release. 
Now let's take a look at how foreign exchange affected our Q1 results, and let's start with revenue. As you can see on Slide 11, total revenue growth of 9% includes a favorable 3% impact from foreign exchange. Absent that impact of foreign exchange, total revenue grew 6%, driven by 4% volume growth. Japan's substantial volume growth continues, driven by Alimta's mid-2009 approval of both first-line and second-line non-small cell lung cancer as well as continued strong growth in Humalog and Zyprexa. Lilly remains among the fastest growing companies in this very important market. 
Slide 12 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. The numbers in the first column are the same as those you saw on Slide 8. I'll focus my comments on the second column of numbers, which strips out the effect of foreign exchange rates. 
First, you'll see the 6% revenue growth I mentioned previously. Now below that, you'll see that the cost of sales grew by only 1% reflecting continued expansion of our gross margin percent on a performance basis. Operating expenses grew 5%, which was also less than our revenue growth. And as mentioned earlier, increased investment in late-stage clinical trials drove R&D, which was up 9% on a performance basis. SG&A on the other hand, grew much less, which was only 3%. As a result of holding growth in both cost of sales and operating expenses below the revenue growth rate, our 6% performance growth in revenue translated into 9% performance growth in operating income, as well as 10% growth in EPS, including the $0.12 per share negative impact of healthcare reform. 
Now for your information, on Slide 13, we've provided the year-on-year growth of select line items of our reported income statement both with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates. 
Now let me wrap up my comments with our 2010 financial guidance. As you may recall, up until now our 2010 guidance has explicitly excluded the potential effect of U.S. healthcare reform. Now that specific legislation has been signed into law, we are incorporating the estimated impact of this new legislation into our guidance. We'll do so in two steps. First, we'll provide our 2010 guidance still excluding U.S. healthcare reform so that you can have a clear idea of how our underlying financial expectations for the year has changed since our last earnings call. Then, we'll layer in the estimated effect of U.S. healthcare reform. Moving forward, this will be the basis for future guidance updates. So excluding the estimated impact of U.S. healthcare reform, we are modifying our guidance to reflect our strong underlying business performance, including improvement in other income, as well as for recent movements in foreign exchange rates. 
At the bottom line, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year from a range of $4.65 to $4.85, to a range now of $4.75 to $4.90, and an increase of a nickel on the top end on the guidance and an increase of a dime on the bottom end of the guidance. In terms of line item guidance, we've slightly modified our revenue guidance to mid- to high-single digits to reflect the recent weakness in foreign currencies versus prior periods. 
Other income and deductions is now forecast to be a net deduction of $50 million to $100 million. This represents an improvement of $100 million from our previous guidance of a net reduction of $150 million to $200 million. This improvement is primarily driven by recovery of damages from companies that had launched generic Olanzapine in Germany and a gain on the sale of investment securities acquired in the ImClone acquisition. All other line items guidance remains unchanged. On a reported basis, our earnings per share guidance excluding U.S. healthcare reform, reflects the $0.30 charge for the Acrux deal and a $0.02 restructuring charge resulting at an EPS range of $4.70 to $4.85 per share. 
Now let's discuss U.S. healthcare reform and how we expect it will affect our financial results. As mentioned earlier, we expect U.S. healthcare reform to negatively affect our 2010 revenue by $350 million to $400 million. In addition, our 2010 results are also negatively affected by the one-time tax charge of $85 million related to the future taxation of the retiree drug subsidy. Incorporating the estimated effect of U.S. healthcare reform yields the following EPS and line item guidance. On both a reported and a non-GAAP basis, our 2010 EPS will be approximately $0.35 lower resulting in a range of $4.40 to $4.55 on a non-GAAP basis and a range of $4.35 to $4.50 on a reported basis. We now expect total revenue to grow in the mid-single digits driven primarily by Alimta, Cymbalta, Humalog, Cialis, Animal Health, Escient and the exenatide franchise, partially offset by the negative impact of U.S. healthcare reform. 
We still anticipate gross margin as a percent of revenue to be flat to declining. However, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold, we still expect gross margin as a percent of revenue to increase. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are still projected to grow in the low- to mid-single digits. Research and development expenses are also still projected to grow in the low double digits. As mentioned earlier, other income for the year is now expected to be a net deduction of between $50 million to $100 million, and as a result of the $85 million charge in Q1 related to future taxation under our retiree drug subsidy, the effective tax rates for the full year is now anticipated to be approximately 23%. Note that our full-year tax rate guidance assumes eventual extension of the R&D tax credit retroactive to January 1, 2010. Finally, we still expect cash flows to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion in anticipated business development activity and the company's dividend. 
Slide 15 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2009 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our revised 2010 guidance. 
Now let me turn the call over to Ronika for an update on the Escient launch."
285467,78846346,56541,"Eli Lilly & Co., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-19-2010",2010-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks Derica. For Escient Q1 sales of $9 million showed modest growth over Q4 2009. However, this included continued inventory reduction from the original stocking. We estimate inventory was reduced by $7 million in the first quarter. Sequential quarter",663,"Thanks Derica. For Escient Q1 sales of $9 million showed modest growth over Q4 2009. However, this included continued inventory reduction from the original stocking. We estimate inventory was reduced by $7 million in the first quarter. Sequential quarter total prescription growth was 124%. While uptake has been slower than planned, we are encouraged by the recent demand trends. Currently, new-to-brand share for Escient exceeds 8% of the total oral anti-platelet market and has continued to show strong growth. New-to-brand trends reflect placement of approximately 1,800 patients on Escient therapy per week. Current estimates of approximately 16,000 PCIs are conducted in the U.S. per week. 
Access continues to expand. Of targeted hospitals Escient is now on formula and stocked in the cath lab in 75% of all accounts up from 60% earlier this year meeting our expectations. In addition, payer formulary access continues to progress well. As of April 1, examples of pairs making positive decisions include expressed grips, Medco, Worldpoint Anthem, Health Net, United Part D Prescription Solutions and Prime Therapeutics, as well as many other PBMs and health plans. 
Finally in the U.S., we believe our focus on the high-risk ACS PCI patients such as those with diabetes has gained traction in the market as market research suggests that this patient type is often cited as a group in which physicians feel Escient is an appropriate choice. 
Our sales force is well prepared to communicate these messages using promotional materials that incorporate feedback from DDMAC. In Europe, despite the widespread availability of generic caplitogrom [ph], we continue to achieve strong reimbursement and favorable pricing. Reimbursement covers 100% of the label population in most countries. It is important to highlight that following hospital formulary approval, protocol inclusion is a critical step in the hospital access process across Europe. 
In Germany, Escient experienced a slower than expected start due to the complexity of the protocol inclusion and access process. However, a clearer account focus and intensified cath lab activities are accelerating assess to formularies, protocol inclusion and ultimately patient initiation. As a result, first quarter sales in Germany showed a 147% increase over Q4. 
Similarity in the U.K., PCI centers and primary care trusts have made progress establishing formulary access and creating protocol. The 59 PCI centers with current formulary approval represent 75% of all PCIs performed in the U.K.. As a result, first quarter sales in the U.K. increased 190% over the previous quarter. In the near term, we expect OUS sales growth to be bolstered by uptake in recently launched markets. Lilly launched Escient Australia in December of last year. Notably Escient was approved on its first submission in Australia and was listed for the full label population and length of therapy. We launched Escient in France in January and we've integrated learnings from the U.K. and Germany to drive quicker formulary access and protocol inclusion. Most recently, we launched Escient in Spain in late March and Italy early April. Remaining plan launches in 2010 include Canada and over 30 additional countries. 
In March, Lilly entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement for the commercialization of Acrux's experimental underarm testosterone solution, Axiron. The product is currently under regulatory review by the FDA for the treatment of testosterone deficiency in men. In exchange for these rights, Acrux will receive an up front payment of $50 million plus $3 million upon transfer of manufacturing assets. Acrux may also receive a milestone payment upon issuance of marketing authorization in the U.S. and commercial milestones and royalties based upon global sales of Axiron. We believe that Axiron will be a strong strategic fit for Lilly, leveraging our experience in men's health with Cialis to advance both the science and clinical outcomes for men with low testosterone. Axiron has a potential to be the first testosterone solution to be applied via an underarm applicator for patients who have testosterone deficiency. We look forward to working with Acrux and the FDA during the regulatory review process. Nick?"

This termination means that, excluding Japan, all rights to duloxetine for all indications will revert back to Lilly. Lilly paid $400 million up front to BI. In addition, BI will receive a royalty on sales through the end of 2012. 
Over the past few years, we've been steadily building our Animal Health business, both through organic growth, particularly in the large and growing companion Animal segment and through acquisitions. In 2007, we acquired Ivy Animal Health. In 2008, we acquired worldwide rights to Monsanto's dairy cow supplement, Posilac, and in March of this year, we agreed to acquire European rights to certain of Pfizer's animal health products. These products are used in both production and companion animals. These products also include vaccines, a new area for us and one we are poised to expand in the coming years with our own pipeline. To support our entry and future growth in vaccines, the transaction also included the acquisition of a vaccine manufacturing plant in Ireland. Detailed financial terms of this deal are not being disclosed. This deal is expected to close in Q2 pending regulatory approval. 
Now I will provide an update on our pipeline. Our pipeline slide demonstrates changes since our January 21 earnings call as of April 12. The recent additions and progress of our compounds further underlined our robust pipeline in both quantity and quality. Our clinical stage portfolio now stands at 68 distinct NMEs including 30 compounds in Phase II and Phase III. We continue to develop a robust biotech portfolio. Biotech molecules represent half of our late-stage Phase II and Phase III assets and over a third of our overall clinical portfolio. As we've said before, advancing our pipeline is our number one priority. 
As reflected by the arrows on Slide 20, since our last formal portfolio update, we have advanced four assets into Phase I, one for anemia, two for cancer, and one for pain, promoted one asset to Phase II, our basal insulin for diabetes, added Axiron for testosterone deficiency and finally, one Phase I schizophrenia asset was terminated. So while the patent expirations of the coming years will hit us hard, we have eight molecules in Phase III today, and we anticipate at least 10 molecules in Phase III by 2011, if not sooner, with more coming behind. We expect that this will position us to launch two novel molecules per year beginning in 2013, providing a foundation for future growth. 
We've seen encouraging progress in our late-stage pipeline. Our Alzheimer's program continues to enroll ahead of schedule. We completed enrollment of our first Phase III trial for semagacestat, our gamma-secretase inhibitor, last year and will complete enrollment on the second Phase III study this month. We've also exceeded 50% enrollments on one of the Phase III studies for solanezumab, our A-beta antibody, and are closing in on 50% enrollment for the second Phase III study. We completed enrollment on the Phase III prelude trial evaluating Enzastaurin for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We also initiated our Phase III award program for our GLP-1 Fc asset in the first quarter, and we have Phase II data on NERI for depression, both as a monotherapy and for augmentation and are moving forward with our plans to initiate Phase III in the first half of 2011. We plan to present this data at a scientific conference in the future.

In regards to the healthcare reform impact, the aggregate numbers that we provided of $350 million to $400 million impact in ’10 and the $600 million to $700 million in ‘11, that's the level that we’re comfortable disclosing at this time. We do not have plans to disclose the pieces of that in terms of breaking it down into the elements of the excise tax versus the Medicaid rebate. Now my rationale behind that is that they’re still, for some of those elements of the healthcare legislation, still being discussed and still to be further defined, especially around the excise tax as it relates to the composition of sales and will it be branded sales, so forth. So it would be premature to try to get to that level of detail at this stage but we did try to provide to you all at an aggregate level what we think in totality the range of the impact could be. In regards to our emerging market strategy, in fact, we are quite active in that space in terms of trying to take advantage of the opportunities in those geographies. Clearly in China, much like China, Brazil and Turkey where we have a great presence but we’re not just looking at exercising those opportunities on the commercial basis. We're also taking advantage on the R&D. So for example, we are increasing both our R&D and manufacturing presence in China. We've actually doubled the size of our sales organization in China over the last 12 months to take advantage of our diabetes and CNS and oncology portfolio there. So while it may not be, I guess, as transparent to the marketplace, we are employing a lot of different efforts and strategies there to take advantage of that marketplace. And if you look at our price rate volume slide, that gives you some idea if you're looking at the rest of the world, of what we’re able to achieve in those markets today."

There's one",342,"I guess a couple of other things just provide some additional color. In terms of the potential benefit coming from additional patient utilization as Pharma companies help fill the doughnut hole, there are two components that we’ve looked at. There's one that we have quantified and put in some potential upside for and that is a few more individuals actually getting through the doughnut hole as opposed to stopping treatment under the current reimbursement scheme. Frankly, there's not a huge percentage currently. If we take FORTEO as an example, and probably the one where we had the biggest issue in our portfolio, we estimated about 15% to 30%, at most, of patients stop treatment as they hit the doughnut hole. Some of that you just might expect from normal compliance; some of it could be financially related. And so there could be a slight benefit there but it is not a large impact. The other one that I've a heard number of people on the street discuss is are doctors currently not putting patients on medications because they’re quite sure that they won't be able to afford them and they don't want to start them to have them have partial treatment. Early market research would indicate that you need to have a more substantial closing of the doughnut hole to make a significant impact in that particular area. And the other thing, for the 21 months, just so that you can do the math as, but to make it easy on you, September we completed enrollment in the first trial. 21 months from that date would be approximately June of '11. If we complete enrollment of next [indiscernible], which we plan to here in April on the second trial, that takes you up in January of '12. As we’ve discussed in the past, it's very likely that we will hold off on announcing results from the first trial until we have both trials actually closed so we can preserve the data integrity of all the data from the second trial as well."

We’ve had substantial leverage on a performance basis, which drove operating income to grow faster than our revenue, and we've also seen significant improvement in other income, as we highlighted. Now excluding the effect of the U.S. healthcare reform, the strong financial performance has positioned us to raise the top end of our 2000 (sic) [2010] EPS guidance by $0.05 and the bottom end by $0.10. This strong financial performance also provides the resources we need to strengthen and progress our pipeline and engage in business development and pay our dividend.

During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest 10-K. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.

The supporting materials, the replay and the podcast will be available on our website through May 21, 2010.
Q1 was a strong quarter for Lilly on many fronts. In terms of financial performance, we posted robust results with volume-driven revenue growth, substantial leverage on a performance basis between growth in revenue and growth in cost of sales as well as in operating expenses, and significant improvement in other income. As Derica will describe, excluding the effect of U.S. healthcare reform, this strong financial performance has positioned us to raise the top end of our guidance range by $0.05 and the bottom end by $0.10. 
On our last call we discussed three business development deals that we had recently competed with Kowa, Incyte and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Since that time, we've continued to be active in business development, completing three more deals. We've entered into a global licensing agreement with Acrux for the commercialization of an experimental underarm testosterone solution, completed a deal with Boehringer Ingelheim in which we reacquired full rights to Cymbalta in OUS countries other than Japan and we agreed to acquire European rights for several Animal Health products from Pfizer. Like the three deals we discussed in January, we think each of these deals helps to solidify our financial and commercial position in the short to medium term. Ronika and Nick will provide more details on these deals later in the call. 
On the regulatory front, in Europe we submitted exenatide once weekly for regulatory review. Our regulatory team did a great job expediting this submission, allowing us to submit well in advance of the end of the first half.  Here in the U.S., the FDA issued a complete response letter for exenatide once weekly or Bydureon. We expect to submit our response this week. Finally, the PDUFA date for Cymbalta and chronic pain passed without FDA action. We expect that the FDA will schedule an advisory committee meeting in the second half of this year. 
On the legal front, the judge in the Southern District of Indiana case with Teva upheld our Gemzar compound patent and ruled in our favor on nearly all of the grounds Teva had raised for invalidity of our method-of-use patent. You may recall that the judge in the Michigan case with Sun had already issued a partial summary judgment ruling invalidating our method-of-use patent on the grounds of obviousness type double patenting. As a result, the judge in Indiana did not rule on this particular issue. 
In the Sun case, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will hear our appeal on May 7. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences affirmed the U.S. Patent Office's rejection of the patent claim Pfizer had asserted for VIAGRA. As a result, Pfizer's litigation alleging that Cialis infringed Pfizer's patent claim was dropped by agreement of both parties. Also in Cialis litigation, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the Delaware trial court's decision rendering its opinion that certain scientists at Vanderbilt University should not be included as joint inventors on patents relating to Cialis and its use in treating erectile dysfunction. 
Finally, we reached a proposed settlement of the outstanding shareholder derivative litigation. Now perhaps the biggest news for Lilly, and for the healthcare industry, was the passage of new legislation that brings significant changes to U.S. healthcare. These changes began to affect our financial results in Q1 and will have a greater impact on our results in the future. Before discussing our Q1 financial performance and our 2010 guidance, let's review some of the major provisions of the new legislation. 
As you're probably aware, many of the provisions that raised money to pay for healthcare reform take effect within the first 12 months. However, the provisions expanding insurance coverage are not slated to take effect until 2014. 
Let's start with those provisions that will affect our 2010 results. Changes to the Medicaid fee-for-service program and to the 340B program take effect retroactive to January 1 of this year. For the Medicaid fee-for-service program, these changes include an increase in the statutory minimum rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% and a limitation on the maximum rebate to 100% of the product's price. 
Changes in the 340B program are focused on expansion of the program to include additional institutions such as children's hospitals, freestanding cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals and rural referral centers and sole community hospitals meeting certain criteria for disproportionate share adjustment under the Social Security Act. Changes to managed Medicaid will take effect as of March 23, 2010, the date the healthcare legislation was signed. Specifically, the new legislation calls for an expansion of Medicaid fee-for-service rebates to managed Medicaid. In addition, our 2010 results will also be affected by channel accruals that we will have to book to reflect greater discounts and rebates for the various elements of healthcare reform. Why is this? Well, government expenditures for purchases in any given period correspond to sales we made to wholesalers in prior periods. Therefore, in advance of the government expenditure occurring, we need to reflect our best estimate of the eventual discounts and rebates we'll have to pay. From a practical perspective, this means that we need to accrue for these future government discounts and rebates at the time we make our sale to wholesalers. In total, we expect that these various elements of U.S. healthcare reform will negatively affect our 2010 revenue by $350 million to $400 million. 
Finally, our 2010 results will be affected by changes to the subsidy paid by the government to employers who provide their retirees with a drug benefit that's at least equivalent to the Medicare Part D drug benefit. Beginning in 2013, the federal government will tax the subsidy it provides to such employers. While this tax will not take effect for three more years, accounting rules dictate that we recognize the present value of this future tax liability as a one-time charge upon passage of the tax law change. As this tax law was officially passed in March, our taxes for Q1 reflect a one-time charge of $85.1 million. 
Now let's discuss those changes slated to take effect on January 1 of next year. On this date, two additional provisions of the healthcare reform legislation will kick in. First, branded pharmaceutical companies will provide a discount of 50% on drugs dispensed to certain Medicare Part D participants when they are in the doughnut hole. Second, branded pharmaceutical companies will collectively pay a multi-billion dollar annual fee to the government. Implementation of these two provisions will undoubtedly be complex. Until specific regulations are written, it's not clear exactly how each of these provisions will be implemented. We've made initial estimates of the effect of these two provisions on our 2011 results, although these estimates could change substantially as the regulations are finalized. 
When these provisions are added to those taking effect in 2010, we anticipate that our 2011 U.S. revenue could be negatively affected by $600 million to $700 million. Keep in mind that our exposure to various elements of healthcare reform is dependent upon product mix. For example, our exposure will decline significantly after the Zyprexa patent expiration. By January 2014, the U.S. healthcare legislation calls for a significant expansion of insurance coverage. This includes expansion of the population eligible for Medicaid as well as the establishment of state health insurance exchanges. The Congressional budget office has estimated this will eventually extend coverage to approximately 32 million Americans who are currently uninsured. Finally, the healthcare reform legislation authorizes a regulatory pathway for follow-on biologics. The legislation includes important incentives for biotech research, including data package protection of 12 years. 
Now with this background, Derica will discuss our Q1 financial results and our 2010 guidance. Derica?"

As I've done in the past, I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP results, which we believe provides insight into the underlying trends in our business. Now this view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairment and other
 special charges. Since the ImClone acquisition was completed in late 2008, pro forma comparisons are no longer necessary. 
Now let's start on Slide 8 with a quick look at our Q1 income statement before reviewing the effect of foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated strong revenue growth of 9% in the first quarter, in spite of the negative impact of U.S. healthcare reform. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased from 83.8% to 79.5% due to the effect on the cost of sales of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar on international inventories sold in the period. Specifically, this effect significantly lowered cost of sales in Q1 of 2009 and modestly increased cost of sales in Q1 of 2010. Once again, in the supplemental section of our slide deck, we have provided a slide showing the trend in our gross margin as a percent of revenue both with and without this particular foreign exchange effect. 
Now this quarter's operating expenses, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, grew by 7%, less than the 9% revenue growth. Within operating expenses, marketing, selling and administrative expenses grew 6%, driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside of the U.S. and the impact of foreign exchange rates, which were partially offset by lower legal expenses, while R&D expense sales grew 10% primarily due to increased late-stage clinical trial costs. 
Now despite generating leverage between revenue and operating expenses, operating income declined 3% due to the significant increase in cost of sales caused by foreign exchange. 
Now moving down the income statement, you'll see an improvement in other income. And this improvement is primarily due to damages recovered from generic pharmaceutical companies following our Zyprexa patent litigation in Germany, a gain related to the disposition of investment securities acquired in the ImClone acquisition and lower net interest expense. In addition, our tax rate increased by over five percentage points driven primarily by the one-time charge of $85.1 million associated with the imposition of tax on the retiree drug subsidy. 
Let me also remind you that the failure to pass an extension of the R&D tax credit also served to increase our Q1 tax rate. Net income and earnings per share declined 1% and 2%, respectively, due to the negative effect of changes in foreign exchange rate on our cost of goods sold and the impact of the U.S. healthcare reform. Q1 earnings were reduced by $0.12 per share due to the impact of U.S. healthcare reform and it was comprised of two items: First, approximately $60 million or $0.04 per share in accruals for higher rebates; and secondly, a one-time tax charge of $85.1 million or $0.08 per share. 
Now, Slide 9 shows our reported income statement while Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in our today's earnings press release. 
Now let's take a look at how foreign exchange affected our Q1 results, and let's start with revenue. As you can see on Slide 11, total revenue growth of 9% includes a favorable 3% impact from foreign exchange. Absent that impact of foreign exchange, total revenue grew 6%, driven by 4% volume growth. Japan's substantial volume growth continues, driven by Alimta's mid-2009 approval of both first-line and second-line non-small cell lung cancer as well as continued strong growth in Humalog and Zyprexa. Lilly remains among the fastest growing companies in this very important market. 
Slide 12 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. The numbers in the first column are the same as those you saw on Slide 8. I'll focus my comments on the second column of numbers, which strips out the effect of foreign exchange rates. 
First, you'll see the 6% revenue growth I mentioned previously. Now below that, you'll see that the cost of sales grew by only 1%, reflecting continued expansion of our gross margin percent on a performance basis. Operating expenses grew 5%, which was also less than our revenue growth. And as mentioned earlier, increased investment in late-stage clinical trials drove R&D, which was up 9% on a performance basis. SG&A on the other hand grew much less, which was only 3%. As a result of holding growth in both cost of sales and operating expenses below the revenue growth rate, our 6% performance growth in revenue translated into 9% performance growth in operating income, as well as 10% growth in EPS, including the $0.12 per share negative impact of healthcare reform. 
Now for your information, on Slide 13, we've provided the year-on-year growth of select line items of our reported income statement both with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates. 
Now let me wrap up my comments with our 2010 financial guidance. As you may recall, up until now our 2010 guidance has explicitly excluded the potential effect of U.S. healthcare reform. Now that specific legislation has been signed into law, we are incorporating the estimated impact of this new legislation into our guidance. We'll do so in two steps. First, we'll provide our 2010 guidance still excluding U.S. healthcare reform so that you can have a clear idea of how our underlying financial expectations for the year have changed since our last earnings call. Then, we'll layer in the estimated effect of U.S. healthcare reform. Moving forward, this will be the basis for future guidance updates. So excluding the estimated impact of U.S. healthcare reform, we are modifying our guidance to reflect our strong underlying business performance, including improvement in other income, as well as for recent movements in foreign exchange rates. 
At the bottom line, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year from a range of $4.65 to $4.85, to a range now of $4.75 to $4.90, and an increase of $0.05 on the top end on the guidance and an increase of $0.10 on the bottom end of the guidance. In terms of line item guidance, we've slightly modified our revenue guidance to mid- to high-single digits to reflect the recent weakness in foreign currencies versus prior periods. 
Other income and deductions is now forecast to be a net deduction of $50 million to $100 million. This represents an improvement of $100 million from our previous guidance of a net reduction of $150 million to $200 million. This improvement is primarily driven by recovery of damages from companies that had launched generic Olanzapine in Germany and a gain on the sale of investment securities acquired in the ImClone acquisition. All other line items guidance remains unchanged. On a reported basis, our earnings per share guidance excluding U.S. healthcare reform, reflects the $0.30 charge for the Acrux deal and a $0.02 restructuring charge resulting at an EPS range of $4.70 to $4.85 per share. 
Now let's discuss U.S. healthcare reform and how we expect it will affect our financial results. As mentioned earlier, we expect U.S. healthcare reform to negatively affect our 2010 revenue by $350 million to $400 million. In addition, our 2010 results are also negatively affected by the one-time tax charge of $85 million related to the future taxation of the retiree drug subsidy. Incorporating the estimated effect of U.S. healthcare reform yields the following EPS and line item guidance. On both a reported and a non-GAAP basis, our 2010 EPS will be approximately $0.35 lower resulting in a range of $4.40 to $4.55 on a non-GAAP basis and a range of $4.35 to $4.50 on a reported basis. We now expect total revenue to grow in the mid-single digits, driven primarily by Alimta, Cymbalta, Humalog, Cialis, Animal Health, Effient and the exenatide franchise, partially offset by the negative impact of U.S. healthcare reform. 
We still anticipate gross margin as a percent of revenue to be flat to declining. However, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, we still expect gross margin as a percent of revenue to increase. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are still projected to grow in the low- to mid-single digits. Research and development expenses are also still projected to grow in the low double digits. As mentioned earlier, other income for the year is now expected to be a net deduction of between $50 million and $100 million, and as a result of the $85 million charge in Q1 related to future taxation under our retiree drug subsidy, the effective tax rates for the full year is now anticipated to be approximately 23%. Note that our full year tax rate guidance assumes eventual extension of the R&D tax credit retroactive to January 1, 2010. Finally, we still expect cash flows to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion in anticipated business development activity and the company's dividend. 
Slide 15 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2009 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our revised 2010 guidance. 
Now let me turn the call over to Ronika for an update on the Effient launch."
285467,78846346,57042,"Eli Lilly & Co., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-19-2010",2010-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Derica. For Effient, Q1 sales of $9 million showed modest growth over Q4 2009. However, this included continued inventory reduction from the original stocking. We estimate inventory was reduced by $7 million in the first quarter. Sequential quarte",662,"Thanks, Derica. For Effient, Q1 sales of $9 million showed modest growth over Q4 2009. However, this included continued inventory reduction from the original stocking. We estimate inventory was reduced by $7 million in the first quarter. Sequential quarter total prescription growth was 124%. While uptake has been slower than planned, we are encouraged by the recent demand trend. Currently, new-to-brand share for Effient exceeds 8% of the total oral antiplatelet market and has continued to show strong growth. New-to-brand trends reflect placement of approximately 1,800 patients on Effient therapy per week. Current estimates are that
 approximately 16,000 PCIs are conducted in the U.S. per week. 
Access continues to expand. Of targeted hospitals, Effient is now on formula and stocked in the cath lab in 75% of all accounts, up from 60% earlier this year, meeting our expectations. In addition, payer formulary access continues to progress well. As of April 1, examples of pairs making positive decisions include Express Scripts, Medco, WellPoint Anthem, Health Net, United Part D Prescription Solutions and Prime Therapeutics, as well as many other PBMs and health plans. 
Finally, in the U.S., we believe our focus on the high-risk ACS/PCI patients such as those with diabetes has gained traction in the market, as market research suggests that this patient type is often cited as a group in which physicians feel Effient is an appropriate choice. 
Our sales force is well prepared to communicate these messages using promotional materials that incorporate feedback from DDMAC. In Europe, despite the widespread availability of generic clopidogrel, we continue to achieve strong reimbursement and favorable pricing. Reimbursement covers 100% of the label population in most countries. It is important to highlight that following hospital formulary approval, protocol inclusion is a critical step in the hospital access process across Europe. 
In Germany, Effient experienced a slower than expected start due to the complexity of the protocol inclusion and access process. However, a clearer account focus and intensified cath lab activities are accelerating access to formularies, protocol inclusion and ultimately patient initiation. As a result, first quarter sales in Germany showed a 147% increase over Q4. 
Similarly, in the U.K. PCI centers and primary care trusts have made progress establishing formulary access and creating protocols. The 59 PCI centers with current formulary approval represent 75% of all PCIs performed in the U.K. As a result, first quarter sales in the U.K. increased 190% over the previous quarter. 
In the near term, we expect OUS sales growth to be bolstered by uptake in recently launched markets. Lilly launched Effient in Australia in December of last year. Notably Effient was approved on its first submission in Australia and was listed for the full label population and length of therapy. We launched Effient in France in January and we've integrated learnings from the U.K. and Germany to drive quicker formulary access and protocol inclusion. Most recently, we launched Effient in Spain in late March and Italy, early April. Remaining plan launches in 2010 include Canada and over 30 additional countries. 
In March, Lilly entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement for the commercialization of Acrux's experimental underarm testosterone solution, Axiron. The product is currently under regulatory review by the FDA for the treatment of testosterone deficiency in men. In exchange for these rights, Acrux will receive an upfront payment of $50 million plus $3 million upon transfer of manufacturing assets. Acrux may also receive a milestone payment upon issuance of marketing authorization in the U.S. and commercial milestones and royalties based upon global sales of Axiron. We believe that Axiron will be a strong strategic fit for Lilly, leveraging our experience in men's health with Cialis to advance both the science and clinical outcomes for men with low testosterone. Axiron has the potential to be the first testosterone solution to be applied via an underarm applicator for patients who have testosterone deficiency. We look forward to working with Acrux and the FDA during the regulatory review process. Nick?"

In addition, BI will receive a royalty on sales through the end of 2012. 
Over the past few years, we've been steadily building our Animal Health business, both through organic growth, particularly in the large and growing companion animal segment, and through acquisitions. In 2007, we acquired Ivy Animal Health; in 2008, we acquired worldwide rights to Monsanto's dairy cow supplement, Posilac; and in March of this year, we agreed to acquire European rights to certain of Pfizer's Animal Health products. These products are used in both production and companion animals. These products also include vaccines, a new area for us and one we are poised to expand in the coming years with our own pipeline. To support our entry and future growth in vaccines, the transaction also included the acquisition of a vaccine manufacturing plant in Ireland. Detailed financial terms of this deal are not being disclosed. This deal is expected to close in Q2 pending regulatory approvals. 
Now I will provide an update on our pipeline. Our pipeline slide demonstrates changes since our January 21 earnings call as of April 12. The recent additions and progress of our compounds further underline our robust pipeline in both quantity and quality. Our clinical stage portfolio now stands at 68 distinct NMEs, including 30 compounds in Phase II and Phase III. We continue to develop a robust biotech portfolio. Biotech molecules represent half of our late-stage Phase II and Phase III assets and over a third of our overall clinical portfolio. As we have said before, advancing our pipeline is our number one priority. 
As reflected by the arrows on Slide 20, since our last formal portfolio update, we have advanced four assets into Phase I; one for anemia, two for cancer, and one for pain; promoted one asset to Phase II, our basal insulin for diabetes; added Axiron for testosterone deficiency; and finally, one Phase I schizophrenia asset was terminated. So while the patent expirations of the coming years will hit us hard, we have eight molecules in Phase III today, and we anticipate at least 10 molecules in Phase III by 2011, if not sooner, with more coming behind. We expect that this will position us to launch two novel molecules per year beginning in 2013, providing a foundation for future growth. 
We've seen encouraging progress in our late-stage pipeline. Our Alzheimer's program continues to enroll ahead of schedule. We completed enrollment of our first Phase III trial for semagacestat, our gamma-secretase inhibitor, last year and will complete enrollment on the second Phase III study this month. We've also exceeded 50% enrollments on one of the Phase III studies for solanezumab, our A-beta antibody, and are closing in on 50% enrollment for the second Phase III study. We completed enrollment on the Phase III PRELUDE trial evaluating Enzastaurin for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We also initiated our Phase III award program for our GLP-1 Fc asset in the first quarter, and we have Phase II data on NERI for depression, both as a monotherapy and for augmentation and are moving forward with our plans to initiate Phase III in the first half of 2011. We plan to present this data at a scientific conference in the future.

Tim, let me try to address both. In regards to the healthcare reform impact, the aggregate numbers that we provided of $350 million to $400 million impact in ’10 and the $600 million to $700 million in ‘11, that's the level that we’re comfortable disclosing at this time. We do not have plans to disclose the pieces of that in terms of breaking it down into the elements of the excise tax versus the Medicaid rebate. Now my rationale behind that is that they’re still, for some of those elements of the healthcare legislation, still being discussed and still to be further defined, especially around the excise tax as it relates to the composition of sales and will it be branded sales, so forth. So it would be premature to try to get to that level of detail at this stage. But we did try to provide to you all at an aggregate level what we think in totality the range of the impact could be. In regards to our emerging market strategy, in fact we are quite active in that space in terms of trying to take advantage of the opportunities in those geographies; clearly, in China -- markets like China, Brazil and Turkey where we have a great presence. But we’re not just looking at exercising those opportunities on a commercial basis, we're also taking advantage on the R&D. So for example, we’re increasing both our R&D and manufacturing presence in China. We've actually double the size of our sales organization in China over the last 12 months to take advantage of our diabetes and CNS and oncology portfolio there.
 So while it may not be, I guess, as transparent to the marketplace, we are employing a lot of different efforts and strategies there to take advantage of that marketplace. And if you look at our price rate volume slide, that gives you some idea, if you're looking at the rest of the world, of what we’re able to achieve in those markets today."

In terms of the potential benefit coming from additional patient utilization as pharma companies help fill the doughnut hole, there are two components that we’ve looked at. There's one that we have quantified and put in some potential upside for, and that is a few more individuals actually getting through the doughnut hole as opposed to stopping treatment under the current reimbursement scheme. Frankly, there's not a huge percentage currently. If we take FORTEO as an example, and probably the one where we had the biggest issue in our portfolio, we estimate that about 15% to 30%, at most, of patients stop treatment as they hit the doughnut hole. Some of that you just might expect from normal compliance; some of it could be financially related. So there could be a slight benefit there but it’s not a large impact. The other one that I've a heard number of people on the Street discuss is are doctors currently not putting patients on medications because they’re quite sure that they won't be able to afford them and they don't want to start them to have them have partial treatment. Early market research would indicate that you need to have a more substantial closing of the doughnut hole to make a significant impact in that particular area. The other thing, for the 21 months, just to -- you can do the math as well, but to make it easy on you, September we completed enrollment of the first trial. 21 months from that date would be approximately June of '11. If we complete enrollment, as Nick said, which we plan to here in April on the second trial, that takes you up in January of '12. As we’ve discussed in the past, it's very likely that we will hold off on announcing results from the first trial until we have both trials actually closed so we can preserve the data integrity of all the data from the second trial as well."

The profile, for example, that we’ve shown with exenatide once weekly compared to essentially all of the major current therapies is extremely promising, very strong HbA1C control, very good weight profile, initial things that we've seen in terms of CV [cardiovascular] risk and definitely compared to some of the other drugs

So I assume the readouts for these first two programs will guide us, actually, how early do we need to treat an Alzheimer patient and also for how long.

And all the while, we’ve initiated Phase I trials for four new molecules. 
Now while the U.S. healthcare reform clearly provides a near-term challenge, we are confident our innovation-based strategy will create value for patients, payers and shareholders. We're focused on advancing our pipeline to deliver on our strategy, and we believe that our pipeline will enable us to launch two new novel molecules per year beginning in 2013 and return us to growth after the Years YZ. I want to thank you for taking your time this morning to allowing us to update you on Eli Lilly and Company. And we greatly appreciate your interest in our company. And as always, we'll keep you informed on our progress, and have a great day."

During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest 10-K. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. You can access the earnings press release, supporting materials, a live webcast, an Internet-based replay and a podcast of this conference call at lilly.com. The supporting materials, the replay and the podcast will be available on our website through May 21, 2010.
Q1 was a strong quarter for Lilly on many fronts. In terms of financial performance, we posted robust results with volume-driven revenue growth, substantial leverage on a performance basis between growth in revenue and growth in cost of sales as well as in operating expenses, and significant improvement in other income. As Derica will describe, excluding the effect of U.S. healthcare reform, this strong financial performance has positioned us to raise the top end of our guidance range by $0.05 and the bottom end by $0.10. 
On our last call we discussed three business development deals that we had recently competed with Kowa, Incyte and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Since that time, we've continued to be active in business development, completing three more deals. We've entered into a global licensing agreement with Acrux for the commercialization of an experimental underarm testosterone solution, completed a deal with Boehringer Ingelheim in which we reacquired full rights to Cymbalta in OUS countries other than Japan and we agreed to acquire European rights for several Animal Health products from Pfizer. Like the three deals we discussed in January, we think each of these deals helps to solidify our financial and commercial position in the short to medium term. Ronika and Nick will provide more details on these deals later in the call. 
On the regulatory front, in Europe we submitted exenatide once weekly for regulatory review. Our regulatory team did a great job expediting this submission, allowing us to submit well in advance of the end of the first half.  Here in the U.S., the FDA issued a complete response letter for exenatide once weekly or Bydureon. We expect to submit our response this week. Finally, the PDUFA date for Cymbalta and chronic pain passed without FDA action. We expect that the FDA will schedule an advisory committee meeting in the second half of this year. 
On the legal front, the judge in the Southern District of Indiana case with Teva upheld our Gemzar compound patent and ruled in our favor on nearly all of the grounds Teva had raised for invalidity of our method-of-use patent. You may recall that the judge in the Michigan case with Sun had already issued a partial summary judgment ruling invalidating our method-of-use patent on the grounds of obviousness type double patenting. As a result, the judge in Indiana did not rule on this particular issue. 
In the Sun case, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will hear our appeal on May 7. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences affirmed the U.S. Patent Office's rejection of the patent claim Pfizer had asserted for VIAGRA. As a result, Pfizer's litigation alleging that Cialis infringed Pfizer's patent claim was dropped by agreement of both parties. Also in Cialis litigation, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the Delaware trial court's decision rendering its opinion that certain scientists at Vanderbilt University should not be included as joint inventors on patents relating to Cialis and its use in treating erectile dysfunction. 
Finally, we reached a proposed settlement of the outstanding shareholder derivative litigation. Now perhaps the biggest news for Lilly, and for the healthcare industry, was the passage of new legislation that brings significant changes to U.S. healthcare. These changes began to affect our financial results in Q1 and will have a greater impact on our results in the future. Before discussing our Q1 financial performance and our 2010 guidance, let's review some of the major provisions of the new legislation. 
As you're probably aware, many of the provisions that raised money to pay for healthcare reform take effect within the first 12 months. However, the provisions expanding insurance coverage are not slated to take effect until 2014. 
Let's start with those provisions that will affect our 2010 results. Changes to the Medicaid fee-for-service program and to the 340B program take effect retroactive to January 1 of this year. For the Medicaid fee-for-service program, these changes include an increase in the statutory minimum rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% and a limitation on the maximum rebate to 100% of the product's price. 
Changes in the 340B program are focused on expansion of the program to include additional institutions such as children's hospitals, freestanding cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals and rural referral centers and sole community hospitals meeting certain criteria for disproportionate share adjustment under the Social Security Act. Changes to managed Medicaid will take effect as of March 23, 2010, the date the healthcare legislation was signed. Specifically, the new legislation calls for an expansion of Medicaid fee-for-service rebates to managed Medicaid. In addition, our 2010 results will also be affected by channel accruals that we will have to book to reflect greater discounts and rebates for the various elements of healthcare reform. Why is this? Well, government expenditures for purchases in any given period correspond to sales we made to wholesalers in prior periods. Therefore, in advance of the government expenditure occurring, we need to reflect our best estimate of the eventual discounts and rebates we'll have to pay. From a practical perspective, this means that we need to accrue for these future government discounts and rebates at the time we make our sale to wholesalers. In total, we expect that these various elements of U.S. healthcare reform will negatively affect our 2010 revenue by $350 million to $400 million. 
Finally, our 2010 results will be affected by changes to the subsidy paid by the government to employers who provide their retirees with a drug benefit that's at least equivalent to the Medicare Part D drug benefit. Beginning in 2013, the federal government will tax the subsidy it provides to such employers. While this tax will not take effect for three more years, accounting rules dictate that we recognize the present value of this future tax liability as a one-time charge upon passage of the tax law change. As this tax law was officially passed in March, our taxes for Q1 reflect a one-time charge of $85.1 million. 
Now let's discuss those changes slated to take effect on January 1 of next year. On this date, two additional provisions of the healthcare reform legislation will kick in. First, branded pharmaceutical companies will provide a discount of 50% on drugs dispensed to certain Medicare Part D participants when they are in the doughnut hole. Second, branded pharmaceutical companies will collectively pay a multi-billion dollar annual fee to the government. Implementation of these two provisions will undoubtedly be complex. Until specific regulations are written, it's not clear exactly how each of these provisions will be implemented. We've made initial estimates of the effect of these two provisions on our 2011 results, although these estimates could change substantially as the regulations are finalized. 
When these provisions are added to those taking effect in 2010, we anticipate that our 2011 U.S. revenue could be negatively affected by $600 million to $700 million. Keep in mind that our exposure to various elements of healthcare reform is dependent upon product mix. For example, our exposure will decline significantly after the Zyprexa patent expiration. By January 2014, the U.S. healthcare legislation calls for a significant expansion of insurance coverage. This includes expansion of the population eligible for Medicaid as well as the establishment of state health insurance exchanges. The Congressional budget office has estimated this will eventually extend coverage to approximately 32 million Americans who are currently uninsured. Finally, the healthcare reform legislation authorizes a regulatory pathway for follow-on biologics. The legislation includes important incentives for biotech research, including data package protection of 12 years. 
Now with this background, Derica will discuss our Q1 financial results and our 2010 guidance. Derica?"
285467,78846346,57044,"Eli Lilly & Co., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-19-2010",2010-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Phil.

As I've done in the past, I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP results, which we believe provides insight into the underlying trends in our business. Now this view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairment and other
 special charges. Since the ImClone acquisition was completed in late 2008, pro forma comparisons are no longer necessary. 
Now let's start on Slide 8 with a quick look at our Q1 income statement before reviewing the effect of foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, you can see that we generated strong revenue growth of 9% in the first quarter, in spite of the negative impact of U.S. healthcare reform. Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased from 83.8% to 79.5% due to the effect on the cost of sales of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar on international inventories sold in the period. Specifically, this effect significantly lowered cost of sales in Q1 of 2009 and modestly increased cost of sales in Q1 of 2010. Once again, in the supplemental section of our slide deck, we have provided a slide showing the trend in our gross margin as a percent of revenue both with and without this particular foreign exchange effect. 
Now this quarter's operating expenses, defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, grew by 7%, less than the 9% revenue growth. Within operating expenses, marketing, selling and administrative expenses grew 6%, driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside of the U.S. and the impact of foreign exchange rates, which were partially offset by lower legal expenses, while R&D expense sales grew 10% primarily due to increased late-stage clinical trial costs. 
Now despite generating leverage between revenue and operating expenses, operating income declined 3% due to the significant increase in cost of sales caused by foreign exchange. 
Now moving down the income statement, you'll see an improvement in other income. And this improvement is primarily due to damages recovered from generic pharmaceutical companies following our Zyprexa patent litigation in Germany, a gain related to the disposition of investment securities acquired in the ImClone acquisition and lower net interest expense. In addition, our tax rate increased by over five percentage points driven primarily by the one-time charge of $85.1 million associated with the imposition of tax on the retiree drug subsidy. 
Let me also remind you that the failure to pass an extension of the R&D tax credit also served to increase our Q1 tax rate. Net income and earnings per share declined 1% and 2%, respectively, due to the negative effect of changes in foreign exchange rate on our cost of goods sold and the impact of the U.S. healthcare reform. Q1 earnings were reduced by $0.12 per share due to the impact of U.S. healthcare reform and it was comprised of two items: First, approximately $60 million or $0.04 per share in accruals for higher rebates; and secondly, a one-time tax charge of $85.1 million or $0.08 per share. 
Now, Slide 9 shows our reported income statement while Slide 10 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in our today's earnings press release. 
Now let's take a look at how foreign exchange affected our Q1 results, and let's start with revenue. As you can see on Slide 11, total revenue growth of 9% includes a favorable 3% impact from foreign exchange. Absent that impact of foreign exchange, total revenue grew 6%, driven by 4% volume growth. Japan's substantial volume growth continues, driven by Alimta's mid-2009 approval of both first-line and second-line non-small cell lung cancer as well as continued strong growth in Humalog and Zyprexa. Lilly remains among the fastest growing companies in this very important market. 
Slide 12 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates. The numbers in the first column are the same as those you saw on Slide 8. I'll focus my comments on the second column of numbers, which strips out the effect of foreign exchange rates. 
First, you'll see the 6% revenue growth I mentioned previously. Now below that, you'll see that the cost of sales grew by only 1%, reflecting continued expansion of our gross margin percent on a performance basis. Operating expenses grew 5%, which was also less than our revenue growth. And as mentioned earlier, increased investment in late-stage clinical trials drove R&D, which was up 9% on a performance basis. SG&A on the other hand grew much less, which was only 3%. As a result of holding growth in both cost of sales and operating expenses below the revenue growth rate, our 6% performance growth in revenue translated into 9% performance growth in operating income, as well as 10% growth in EPS, including the $0.12 per share negative impact of healthcare reform. 
Now for your information, on Slide 13, we've provided the year-on-year growth of select line items of our reported income statement both with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates. 
Now let me wrap up my comments with our 2010 financial guidance. As you may recall, up until now our 2010 guidance has explicitly excluded the potential effect of U.S. healthcare reform. Now that specific legislation has been signed into law, we are incorporating the estimated impact of this new legislation into our guidance. We'll do so in two steps. First, we'll provide our 2010 guidance still excluding U.S. healthcare reform so that you can have a clear idea of how our underlying financial expectations for the year have changed since our last earnings call. Then, we'll layer in the estimated effect of U.S. healthcare reform. Moving forward, this will be the basis for future guidance updates. So excluding the estimated impact of U.S. healthcare reform, we are modifying our guidance to reflect our strong underlying business performance, including improvement in other income, as well as for recent movements in foreign exchange rates. 
At the bottom line, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year from a range of $4.65 to $4.85, to a range now of $4.75 to $4.90, and an increase of $0.05 on the top end on the guidance and an increase of $0.10 on the bottom end of the guidance. In terms of line item guidance, we've slightly modified our revenue guidance to mid- to high-single digits to reflect the recent weakness in foreign currencies versus prior periods. 
Other income and deductions is now forecast to be a net deduction of $50 million to $100 million. This represents an improvement of $100 million from our previous guidance of a net reduction of $150 million to $200 million. This improvement is primarily driven by recovery of damages from companies that had launched generic Olanzapine in Germany and a gain on the sale of investment securities acquired in the ImClone acquisition. All other line items guidance remains unchanged. On a reported basis, our earnings per share guidance excluding U.S. healthcare reform, reflects the $0.30 charge for the Acrux deal and a $0.02 restructuring charge resulting at an EPS range of $4.70 to $4.85 per share. 
Now let's discuss U.S. healthcare reform and how we expect it will affect our financial results. As mentioned earlier, we expect U.S. healthcare reform to negatively affect our 2010 revenue by $350 million to $400 million. In addition, our 2010 results are also negatively affected by the one-time tax charge of $85 million related to the future taxation of the retiree drug subsidy. Incorporating the estimated effect of U.S. healthcare reform yields the following EPS and line item guidance. On both a reported and a non-GAAP basis, our 2010 EPS will be approximately $0.35 lower resulting in a range of $4.40 to $4.55 on a non-GAAP basis and a range of $4.35 to $4.50 on a reported basis. We now expect total revenue to grow in the mid-single digits, driven primarily by Alimta, Cymbalta, Humalog, Cialis, Animal Health, Effient and the exenatide franchise, partially offset by the negative impact of U.S. healthcare reform. 
We still anticipate gross margin as a percent of revenue to be flat to declining. However, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold, we still expect gross margin as a percent of revenue to increase. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are still projected to grow in the low- to mid-single digits. Research and development expenses are also still projected to grow in the low double digits. As mentioned earlier, other income for the year is now expected to be a net deduction of between $50 million and $100 million, and as a result of the $85 million charge in Q1 related to future taxation under our retiree drug subsidy, the effective tax rates for the full year is now anticipated to be approximately 23%. Note that our full year tax rate guidance assumes eventual extension of the R&D tax credit retroactive to January 1, 2010. Finally, we still expect cash flows to be sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion in anticipated business development activity and the company's dividend. 
Slide 15 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2009 and the associated growth rates from these numbers to our revised 2010 guidance. 
Now let me turn the call over to Ronika for an update on the Effient launch."
285467,78846346,57044,"Eli Lilly & Co., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-19-2010",2010-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Derica. For Effient, Q1 sales of $9 million showed modest growth over Q4 2009. However, this included continued inventory reduction from the original stocking.

However, this included continued inventory reduction from the original stocking. We estimate inventory was reduced by $7 million in the first quarter. Sequential quarter total prescription growth was 124%. While uptake has been slower than planned, we are encouraged by the recent demand trend. Currently, new-to-brand share for Effient exceeds 8% of the total oral antiplatelet market and has continued to show strong growth. New-to-brand trends reflect placement of approximately 1,800 patients on Effient therapy per week. Current estimates are that
 approximately 16,000 PCIs are conducted in the U.S. per week. 
Access continues to expand. Of targeted hospitals, Effient is now on formula and stocked in the cath lab in 75% of all accounts, up from 60% earlier this year, meeting our expectations. In addition, payer formulary access continues to progress well. As of April 1, examples of pairs making positive decisions include Express Scripts, Medco, WellPoint Anthem, Health Net, United Part D Prescription Solutions and Prime Therapeutics, as well as many other PBMs and health plans. 
Finally, in the U.S., we believe our focus on the high-risk ACS/PCI patients such as those with diabetes has gained traction in the market, as market research suggests that this patient type is often cited as a group in which physicians feel Effient is an appropriate choice. 
Our sales force is well prepared to communicate these messages using promotional materials that incorporate feedback from DDMAC. In Europe, despite the widespread availability of generic clopidogrel, we continue to achieve strong reimbursement and favorable pricing. Reimbursement covers 100% of the label population in most countries. It is important to highlight that following hospital formulary approval, protocol inclusion is a critical step in the hospital access process across Europe. 
In Germany, Effient experienced a slower than expected start due to the complexity of the protocol inclusion and access process. However, a clearer account focus and intensified cath lab activities are accelerating access to formularies, protocol inclusion and ultimately patient initiation. As a result, first quarter sales in Germany showed a 147% increase over Q4. 
Similarly, in the U.K. PCI centers and primary care trusts have made progress establishing formulary access and creating protocols. The 59 PCI centers with current formulary approval represent 75% of all PCIs performed in the U.K. As a result, first quarter sales in the U.K. increased 190% over the previous quarter. 
In the near term, we expect OUS sales growth to be bolstered by uptake in recently launched markets. Lilly launched Effient in Australia in December of last year. Notably Effient was approved on its first submission in Australia and was listed for the full label population and length of therapy. We launched Effient in France in January and we've integrated learnings from the U.K. and Germany to drive quicker formulary access and protocol inclusion. Most recently, we launched Effient in Spain in late March and Italy, early April. Remaining plan launches in 2010 include Canada and over 30 additional countries. 
In March, Lilly entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement for the commercialization of Acrux's experimental underarm testosterone solution, Axiron. The product is currently under regulatory review by the FDA for the treatment of testosterone deficiency in men. In exchange for these rights, Acrux will receive an upfront payment of $50 million plus $3 million upon transfer of manufacturing assets. Acrux may also receive a milestone payment upon issuance of marketing authorization in the U.S. and commercial milestones and royalties based upon global sales of Axiron. We believe that Axiron will be a strong strategic fit for Lilly, leveraging our experience in men's health with Cialis to advance both the science and clinical outcomes for men with low testosterone. Axiron has the potential to be the first testosterone solution to be applied via an underarm applicator for patients who have testosterone deficiency. We look forward to working with Acrux and the FDA during the regulatory review process. Nick?"

In addition, BI will receive a royalty on sales through the end of 2012. 
Over the past few years, we've been steadily building our Animal Health business, both through organic growth, particularly in the large and growing companion animal segment, and through acquisitions. In 2007, we acquired Ivy Animal Health; in 2008, we acquired worldwide rights to Monsanto's dairy cow supplement, Posilac; and in March of this year, we agreed to acquire European rights to certain of Pfizer's Animal Health products. These products are used in both production and companion animals. These products also include vaccines, a new area for us and one we are poised to expand in the coming years with our own pipeline. To support our entry and future growth in vaccines, the transaction also included the acquisition of a vaccine manufacturing plant in Ireland. Detailed financial terms of this deal are not being disclosed. This deal is expected to close in Q2 pending regulatory approvals. 
Now I will provide an update on our pipeline. Our pipeline slide demonstrates changes since our January 21 earnings call as of April 12. The recent additions and progress of our compounds further underline our robust pipeline in both quantity and quality. Our clinical stage portfolio now stands at 68 distinct NMEs, including 30 compounds in Phase II and Phase III. We continue to develop a robust biotech portfolio. Biotech molecules represent half of our late-stage Phase II and Phase III assets and over a third of our overall clinical portfolio. As we have said before, advancing our pipeline is our number one priority. 
As reflected by the arrows on Slide 20, since our last formal portfolio update, we have advanced four assets into Phase I; one for anemia, two for cancer, and one for pain; promoted one asset to Phase II, our basal insulin for diabetes; added Axiron for testosterone deficiency; and finally, one Phase I schizophrenia asset was terminated. So while the patent expirations of the coming years will hit us hard, we have eight molecules in Phase III today, and we anticipate at least 10 molecules in Phase III by 2011, if not sooner, with more coming behind. We expect that this will position us to launch two novel molecules per year beginning in 2013, providing a foundation for future growth. 
We've seen encouraging progress in our late-stage pipeline. Our Alzheimer's program continues to enroll ahead of schedule. We completed enrollment of our first Phase III trial for semagacestat, our gamma-secretase inhibitor, last year and will complete enrollment on the second Phase III study this month. We've also exceeded 50% enrollments on one of the Phase III studies for solanezumab, our A-beta antibody, and are closing in on 50% enrollment for the second Phase III study. We completed enrollment on the Phase III PRELUDE trial evaluating Enzastaurin for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We also initiated our Phase III award program for our GLP-1 Fc asset in the first quarter, and we have Phase II data on NERI for depression, both as a monotherapy and for augmentation and are moving forward with our plans to initiate Phase III in the first half of 2011. We plan to present this data at a scientific conference in the future. 
This concludes our prepared remarks and now we will open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, first caller please."

So it would be premature to try to get to that level of detail at this stage. But we did try to provide to you all at an aggregate level what we think in totality the range of the impact could be. In regards to our emerging market strategy, in fact we are quite active in that space in terms of trying to take advantage of the opportunities in those geographies; clearly, in China -- markets like China, Brazil and Turkey where we have a great presence. But we’re not just looking at exercising those opportunities on a commercial basis, we're also taking advantage on the R&D. So for example, we’re increasing both our R&D and manufacturing presence in China. We've actually double the size of our sales organization in China over the last 12 months to take advantage of our diabetes and CNS and oncology portfolio there.
 So while it may not be, I guess, as transparent to the marketplace, we are employing a lot of different efforts and strategies there to take advantage of that marketplace. And if you look at our price rate volume slide, that gives you some idea, if you're looking at the rest of the world, of what we’re able to achieve in those markets today."

In terms of the potential benefit coming from additional patient utilization as pharma companies help fill the doughnut hole, there are two components that we’ve looked at. There's one that we have quantified and put in some potential upside for, and that is a few more individuals actually getting through the doughnut hole as opposed to stopping treatment under the current reimbursement scheme. Frankly, there's not a huge percentage currently. If we take FORTEO as an example, and probably the one where we had the biggest issue in our portfolio, we estimate that about 15% to 30%, at most, of patients stop treatment as they hit the doughnut hole. Some of that you just might expect from normal compliance; some of it could be financially related. So there could be a slight benefit there but it’s not a large impact. The other one that I've a heard number of people on the Street discuss is are doctors currently not putting patients on medications because they’re quite sure that they won't be able to afford them and they don't want to start them to have them have partial treatment. Early market research would indicate that you need to have a more substantial closing of the doughnut hole to make a significant impact in that particular area. The other thing, for the 21 months, just to -- you can do the math as well, but to make it easy on you, September we completed enrollment of the first trial. 21 months from that date would be approximately June of '11. If we complete enrollment, as Nick said, which we plan to here in April on the second trial, that takes you up in January of '12. As we’ve discussed in the past, it's very likely that we will hold off on announcing results from the first trial until we have both trials actually closed so we can preserve the data integrity of all the data from the second trial as well."

The profile, for example, that we’ve shown with exenatide once weekly compared to essentially all of the major current therapies is extremely promising, very strong HbA1C control, very good weight profile, initial things that we've seen in terms of CV [cardiovascular] risk and definitely compared to some of the other drugs
 like insulins, low risk of hypoglycemia make it something that we think would be a very significant drug in the treatment of type 2 diabetes going forward. Jan, for Alzheimer’s disease and diagnostics."

But certainly some dementias are likely to be caused by other factors, such as more vascular problems in the brain. So from the standpoint of the current therapies, I think we need the amyloid diagnostics to be combined with Alzheimer’s treatments and preferably, to do that as early as possible in the lifespan of the Alzheimer's disease. So I assume the readouts for these first two programs will guide us, actually, how early do we need to treat an Alzheimer patient and also for how long. I also see a great interest in the evolution of diagnostics for the Alzheimer area, specifically then to have some additional markers than just cognition to, in time, realize when there is a need to treat further amyloid accumulation."

Let me just try to close today's session with some overarching remarks. First of all, we've had a very good start to 2010, and it was highlighted by volume-driven revenue growth; we’ve had substantial leverage on a performance basis, which drove operating income to grow faster than our revenue; and we've also seen significant improvement in other income, as we highlighted. Now excluding the effect of the U.S. healthcare reform, this strong financial performance has positioned us to raise the top end of our 2000 (sic) [2010] EPS guidance by $0.05 and the bottom end by $0.10. This strong financial performance also provides the resources we need to strengthen and progress our pipeline and engage in business development and pay our dividend. In fact, in the past three months, we've completed three more business development deals; we've made significant progress on products such as Bydureon and our Alzheimer’s drugs, Enzastaurin, NERI IV, GLP-1 Fc and our basal insulin. And all the while, we’ve initiated Phase I trials for four new molecules. 
Now while the U.S. healthcare reform clearly provides a near-term challenge, we are confident our innovation-based strategy will create value for patients, payers and shareholders. We're focused on advancing our pipeline to deliver on our strategy, and we believe that our pipeline will enable us to launch two new novel molecules per year beginning in 2013 and return us to growth after the Years YZ.

I'm Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are John Lechleiter, our Chairman and CEO; Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ronika Pletcher; and Nick Lemen, for Investor Relations.. 
During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest 10-K and 10-Q. The information we provide about our product and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.  
In the second quarter, we again generated strong financial results, including robust volume-driven revenue growth. We were able to leverage our high single-digit revenue growth into double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share. In addition, we again generated strong operating cash flow. This strong financial performance has allowed us to raise our full-year 2010 EPS guidance in spite of the negative effect of recent pricing actions in Europe. Now since our last earnings call, we've continued to be active in business development, completing two more deals. We acquired Alnara Pharmaceuticals and their lead asset, liprotamase, which is under FDA review for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and we entered into a development and exclusive license agreement from Marcadia Biotech's preclinical short-acting glucagon program.
We've also made progress on the regulatory front. The FDA confirmed that an advisory committee will be held on August 19 to discuss the chronic pain indication for Cymbalta. With our partner Amylin, we submitted our response to the FDA's complete response letter for Bydureon, and the agency assigned a new PDUFA date of October 2.  And we received a positive final appraisal from NICE in the U.K. for the use of Alimta as a maintenance therapy for patients with non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer.
In commercial news, we launched Livalo in the U.S. Livalo is the statin we licensed from Kowa last year. We also announced an agreement with Wal-Mart to make Humulin available in Wal-Mart pharmacies across the U.S. under the dual-branded name Humulin ReliOn, and as I alluded to earlier, a number of European governments announced measures to reduce their pharmaceutical expenditures. Let's briefly review the situation in Europe before discussing our Q2 results in detail. 
While pricing and reimbursement systems vary by country in Europe, year-on-year average price decreases of 1% to 2% across the region have been commonplace for many years. We attempt to offset this by driving volume growth and achieving incremental productivity gains. Occasionally, acute budget issues in one particular country have prompted more substantial measures, like across-the-board price cuts. As you are aware, the economic downturn has caused budget pressures, which have forced a number of European countries to simultaneously introduce austerity measures to reduce public spending, including measures to reduce their pharmaceutical expenditures. Let's briefly look at some of the measures that have been passed.
The German government announced two temporary measures that will take effect on August 1 of this year. First, for products not subject to reference pricing, the rebate paid to the sick funds will be increased from 6% to 16%; second, prices will be reset back to their August 1, 2009, levels and held flat going forward. Both of these temporary measures will expire at the end of 2013. Not all of our German business is exposed to these actions. For example, some of our products are subject to reference pricing and Humalog rebates already exceed the new 16% mandatory rebate and will not be affected. In addition, a portion of our German demand for many of our products is satisfied through imports by wholesalers from other markets. We are not liable for German rebates on these sales.
In Spain, the government introduced a 7.5% rebate on public sector purchases of most branded products. Generics took an even bigger hit, 25%, while orphan drug prices were reduced by only 4%. These reductions will remain in place through the end of the year, with the government deciding later this year about 2011. In addition, measures leading to a more rapid decline in prices post-patent expiration were passed.
On May 1, the Greek government implemented a temporary price reduction of up to 27%. Lilly's average reduction was roughly 23%. The Greek legislation stipulates that this temporary price reduction will be in effect through August 31 of this year. By that time, we expect a temporary price reduction to be replaced by our referenced price system that pegs the Greek price to average of the three lowest prices in the EU. While still substantial, we would expect the impact to Lilly of the new reference pricing scheme to be roughly half that of the May 1 price cuts. In addition, this change should lead to a reduced financial exposure in countries that may reference their prices to the prices in Greece. We've also seen some pricing actions taken in smaller EU countries like Romania. In total, at current exchange rates, we estimate that the price cuts announced by these governments will reduce our European revenue by approximately $90 million in 2010 and approximately $150 million in 2011.
In the three major European countries I have not mentioned, U.K., France and Italy, we do not anticipate any additional significant price reductions. Not long ago, the U.K. implemented a revised PPRS agreement to deliver savings on the country's pharmaceutical spend. Under this industry-wide agreement, average prices were reduced by 3.9% in early 2009, and by an additional 1.9% in early 2010. The remaining three years of the agreement call for price stability. 
In France, similar to last year, the government has announced its intention to take actions to reduce pharmaceutical spend by 100 million euros. Last year's actions were directed at the statins and proton pump inhibitors. It's not clear how the French government will target this year's savings.
Finally, in Italy, the price cuts announced by the government didn't affect patented products. However, generic prices were reduced by 12.5% and the government announced its intention to move to a tender system in 2011 for purchasing generic drugs. We'll continue to monitor the economic situation in Europe and the actions taken by governments to address their budget and debt issues. While we will see higher than average price erosion in the near-term, the underlying fundamentals of the European market remain strong. There will continue to be strong demand for our products and the benefits they offer patients.
As we have seen in Spain and Italy, as well as in Japan earlier this year, we're optimistic that governments that haven't yet done so will increasingly look to reduce the prices they pay for generic drugs to create room to pay for patented drugs. This is crucial in order to maintain adequate incentives for companies to develop the next generation of innovative branded drugs that will subsequently become the next generation of improved low-cost generics, helping future generations live longer, healthier and more productive lives.
Now with his background, Derica will discuss our Q2 financial results and our 2010 guidance. Derica?"

As I've done in the past, I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges. Now let's start on Slide 7, with a quick look at our Q2 income statement before reviewing the effect of foreign exchange.
On a non-GAAP basis, we generated strong revenue growth of 9% in the second quarter, continuing our strong top line performance. On a product basis, our Q2 revenue growth was fueled by Alimta, Cymbalta, Cialis, Zyprexa and animal health. We are especially pleased with the continued strong performance of Alimta, which this quarter surpassed Taxol for shared leadership in the first-line non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer setting in the U.S., which is a significant accomplishment given Taxol's  long-time leadership in this setting.
On a geographic basis, just to sight a few highlights, Japan grew 32% on a performance basis, and China grew 25%, and we saw solid growth in the U.S., Spain and a number of other Asian and Latin American countries. Our gross margin as a percent of revenue was essentially unchanged at just over 82%. This quarter's operating expenses, which we've defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A grew by 7%, less than the 9% revenue growth. Within our operating expenses, marketing, selling and administrative expenses grew only 3%, with the growth driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside the U.S., partially offset by lower administrative expenses and our ongoing cost containment efforts. R&D expense grew 14%, primarily due to increased late stage clinical trial costs, while also paying key milestone payments, which added over three percentage points of growth. In total, we were able to generate leverage between revenue and operating expenses, leading to operating income growing 12% in the quarter.
Moving down the income statement, you'll see that other income improved slightly due to lower net interest expense. In addition, our tax rate increased by half of a percentage point due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit, partially offset by slight changes in the expected mix of income amongst tax jurisdiction. Net income and earnings per share each grew 11% in the quarter, again, generating strong leverage from the top line.
Slide 8, shows our reported income statement, while Slide 9, provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.
Now let's look at how foreign exchange affected our Q2 results, and we'll start with revenue. As you can see at the bottom of Slide 10, total revenue growth of 9% includes a favorable 1% impact from foreign exchange. This includes a 2% drag in Europe due to a weaker euro. However, this was more than offset by the strengthening in many other currencies, including the Japanese yen, the Australian and Canadian dollars, the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, total revenue grew 7%, driven by 5% volume growth. Japan's substantial volume growth continues, driven by Alimta's Q2 2009 approval for non-small cell lung cancer, the recent launch of Cymbalta and strong volume growth in Zyprexa and Humalog. Our Animal Health business registered very strong 18% volume growth in both the Food and Companion Animals segments and both in the U.S. and internationally. In general, the animal health market has rebounded as economic conditions have stabilized.
Slide 11, shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effective changes in foreign exchange rates. Now the numbers in the first column are the same as those that you saw on Slide 10. I'll focus my comments on the second column of numbers, which strips out the effect of foreign exchange rates.
First, you'll see the 7% revenue growth I mentioned previously. Below that, you'll see that cost of sales grew 8%. In total, operating expenses grew slower than revenue at 6%. As I mentioned earlier, increased investment in late stage-clinical trials and milestone payments drove R&D expense, which was up 14% on a performance basis. SG&A spending, on the other hand, grew much less, only 2%.
As a result of holding growth and operating expenses below the growth in the revenue rate, our 7% performance growth in revenue translated into 9% performance growth in operating income and 8% growth in EPS. You can also see that year-to-date, we leveraged 7% revenue growth on a performance basis and to 9% EPS growth.
Now for your information, on Slide 12, we've provided the year-on-year growth of select line items of our reported income statement, both with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates.
Now let me wrap up my comments with our 2010 financial guidance. Given our strong performance in the first six months of the year, we are raising our previously issued 2010 earnings per share guidance range of $4.40 to $4.55 to a new range of $4.50 to $4.65 on a pro forma non-GAAP basis. This corresponds to a range of $4.44 to $4.59 on a reported basis. In terms of line item guidance, we continue to expect total revenue to grow in the mid-single digits, even with the initial impact of the extraordinary European pricing cuts and the recent unfavorable movement in the euro. Gross margin as a percent of revenue for the year is now expected to be flat to increasing, and we continue to expect improvement excluding the effect of FX on international inventories sold.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are now projected to grow in the low-single digits. We continue to expect research and development expenses to grow in the low-double digits. Our forecast for other income is unchanged at a net deduction of between $50 million and $100 million, and the effective tax rate for the full year is still expected to be approximately 23%, assuming the extension of the R&D tax credit. Finally, we now expect capital expenditures to be less than $900 million.
Slide 14, provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2009 and for our revised 2010 guidance. 
Now let me turn the call over to Ronika for an update on our pipeline. Ronika?"
285467,78846348,68504,"Eli Lilly & Co., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Eli Lilly and Company","Executives","Thanks, Derica. Before reviewing our pipeline slide, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the investigational product exenatide once weekly, also known by the proposed trade name of Bydureon. It is one of our most important pipeline molecules and is clear",942,"Thanks, Derica. Before reviewing our pipeline slide, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the investigational product exenatide once weekly, also known by the proposed trade name of Bydureon. It is one of our most important pipeline molecules and is clearly the most proximate to potentially reaching the market as it is currently under active regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe. Based on the clinical data Lilly and Amylin have generated with Bydureon, the evolving therapeutic landscape, and the considerable real world experience we have with the exenatide molecules, we are very excited about the potential of Bydureon to help people with type two diabetes. Over time, we believe the GLP class will play a significant role in the treatment of these diseases and the clinical data we've generated Bydureon has set a high hurdles for drugs in this class. 
As shown on Slide 15 across the duration Phase III program, Bydureon has consistently shown clinically meaningful reduction in A1C. While Bydureon is not being studied as a weight-loss product, we've also seen reductions in the secondary end point of weight, as well as lower incidence of mild to moderate hypoglycemic events relative to comparative drugs.
Common treatment emergent adverse events with Bydureon have included injection site pyrites, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea and constipation. At ADA last month, there were a significant number of presentations on the exenatide molecule covering both Byetta and Bydureon. Just to highlight a couple of the Bydureon presentations,  Slide 16, shows data from a pulled analysis of the duration one, two and three trials in which we analyze the percentage of patients experiencing a reduction in both HbA1C and body weight. As you can see, 73% of the people treated with Bydureon experienced reductions in both HbA1C and weight. In comparison, reductions in these two measures were treated by 46% of the patients taking sitagliptin, 32% of those taking enfenwargenes [ph] [11:34 am] and only 14% of those taking pioglitazone. Elevated HbA1C and weight are known risk factors for cardiovascular events.
We're also pleased to report that we've recently begun enrollment in our Xcel trial, a cardiovascular study for Bydureon, which will help show whether treatment with Bydureon does in fact reduce cardiovascular events. The trial is slated to include 9,500 patients and provide results in 2016. 
Finally, data presented was at ADA on the extension phase of the DURATION-2 trial. In the 26-week extension phase, patients that received sitagliptin or pioglitazone during the initial 26-week phase were switched Bydureon, while Bydureon-treated patients continued on therapy. As shown in Slide 17, when treated Bydureon in the extension phase, patients who switched from pioglitazone to Bydureon maintain HbA1C improvements and nearly all of the weight gain seen in the initial 26 weeks was reversed by 52 weeks. Patients who started initially on sitagliptin experienced a further reduction in weight and an additional reduction in HbA1C. These and other data make us very excited about the potential role that Bydureon can play in helping people with type two diabetes manage their disease.
Switching to our pipeline, Slide 18, demonstrates changes since our April 19 earnings call as of July 20. Our clinical phase portfolio stands at 69 distinct NMEs, including 29 compounds and Phase II and Phase III. Our focus remains on developing a robust biotech portfolio, as biotechnology molecules now represent nearly half of our late-stage Phase II and Phase III assets, as well as over a third of our overall clinical portfolio. This includes the recent entry of four new oncology biologics into the clinic, as highlighted with the green arrows on the left. 
As we have said before and continue to emphasize, advancing our pipeline remains our number one priority. Since our last formal portfolio update, we have advanced six assets in Phase I, five targeting oncology and one for Alzheimer's, promoted two assets to Phase II, one for VPH and a second for atherosclerosis and liprotamase, which is currently under regulatory review in the U.S..
Launched Livalo and the U.S. and still plan to submit Livalo in our first Latin American country during the second half of this year. As shown at the bottom of the slide, we also terminated the development of two Phase I assets, as well as three Phase II assets. We're also seeing encouraging progress in our late-stage pipeline. Our partner Incyte. disclosed top line three months Phase IIa data on the JAK1/JAK2 in early May. Incyte also reiterated its plan to present more detailed three-month data as well as six-month data at the ACR conference in November. Ongoing development efforts remain focused on initiating a Phase IIb study later this year. We recently completed two Phase II trials for our BAFF antibody for rheumatoid arthritis. Data from both trials will also be presented at ACR in November. We expect to start Phase III trials in late '10 or early '11.
We recently completed Phase II trials for NERI for depression, OpRA for alcohol dependence and Hypnion for insomnia. We're currently reviewing these data and plan to disclose these data at an upcoming medical meeting. Currently we have eight molecules in Phase III, and we are on track to have at least 10 molecules in Phase III by the time the Zyprexa patent expires in late '11, if not sooner, with more coming behind. We continue to expect that executing on our innovation-based strategy will position us to launch two novel molecules per year beginning in 2013, providing the emphasis for future growth as we emerge from the YZ period.
This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, first caller please."

I had a question about emerging markets, and you had provided some information on your emerging markets business unit's strategy and sales performance last year. I was wondering when we might see an update on that? And specifically, more transparency with regards to the emerging markets sales performance. And a second question on guidance. You've raised your 2010 guidance, but I was wondering about longer-term guidance that you've previously given out until 2014. And with what's happening with price reductions in Europe and the U.S. health care reform, do we assume that the 2014 guidance is still intact? And then a last question, if I could, on your pipeline. You've got eight drugs in Phase III. Could you highlight one or two of the compounds in Phase III, which you think are the most exciting, especially one or two where you think investors might be missing something or underestimating them?"

If you look at Lilly today, our emerging markets represents about 10% of our total revenue, and if you look at our Q2 results, we had about 14% growth in the emerging markets. Now obviously that's a mix of countries and it also has patent expirations in there in some of the smaller ones. But if you look at markets like we talked about earlier in China, in our opening comments, where he had 25% growth, you can say Japan's not an emerging market, but clearly it's a key strategic market for us where we had 32% growth. So we see huge opportunity, and we see also the additional benefit of launching some of our current products in those markets. So here recently we launched Cymbalta in Japan, and we're looking forward to launching FORTEO. In regards to the 2010 and 2014 longer-term guidance, we still feel very good about our comments that we made in December at our analyst meeting about our ability to be at least a $20 billion revenue company, even as we go through the series of patent expirations, and the fact that we think that we can also have good prospects of generating at least $3 billion in net income. And that allows us to have the cash flow to, as you've seen here in the first part of this year, to fund our pipeline of over almost 70 molecules, and also to pursue the business development opportunities that we think will enhance our longer-term prospects."

So there's a lot happening at that end of the pipeline. I think as you look at the eight that we currently have in Phase III right now, I think the ones I would call attention to would be good the two Alzheimer's assets, semagacestat, the oral solanezumab, the antibody, both are progressing well in Phase III. And then we've got the two other molecules from ImClone, 1121 B and 11F8, both of those are in Phase III right now looking at different kinds of tumors.

I'm not going to put a sort of a price range on what we would, what we might consider the largest type of deal that we would do. I think the way I would frame that is to say that obviously as we go forward into these years where we're going to have patent  expirations, we're going to be first and foremost paying attention to at least maintaining our dividend, making sure that we've got the cash as we're confidence that we do, to run our business, to make capital investments and then to also pursue licensing opportunities, including in our Elanco business.

In terms of the clinical data, I'm a bit more familiar with some of the data that we have for liprotamase. In large part, because that's where we've gotten a few more questions since we've done the deal. So a couple of comments there. First, the regulatory end points that we're shooting for is called co-efficient of fat absorption. It's our understanding that for the FDA that this is a very valid surrogate measure of lipase activity. This is accepted as a primary endpoint for approval of treatments for EPI. There were two studies that will contribute to that primary endpoint, both of which met their endpoint with statistical significance, 726 study and also it's called PC-2a study. We view both of those as the registration pivotal studies. I think some of the concern has come about, the 726 study where there was a subpopulation of patients in Eastern Europe and South America that did not seem to experience the same level of benefit. But, again, that overall trial did meet its endpoint, and we view that as being appropriate basis to go ahead and make the submission. There are also two other studies that were done, longer-term studies that go out about 12 months, that looked at endpoints that while they're not strictly the ones we'd look to for the regulatory approval, they're very important, we believe, as supportive data. And those were the 767 and the 810 study that had very good data and BMI, height and weight that we think supports the profile of the product. In terms of the Erbitux line extensions, new indications on all three of those we've made very good progress with the FDA, and would expect in 2011 to be in a position to respond to the complete response letter on the first line head, neck indication to resubmit the first line non-small cell lung indication and to submit the first line colorectal."

We appreciate your continued interest in Eli Lilly. Let me close with a few key points. First, underscoring our financial performance and then highlighting progress made on our innovation-based strategy. We're very pleased with our performance so far in 2010. In the second quarter, we again generated strong financial results with robust, volume-driven revenue growth, continued leverage between growth and revenue and operating expenses, largely driven by our ongoing cost-containment efforts and strong operating cash flow. This strong financial performance has allowed us to raise our full-year 2010 EPS guidance, and we're doing this despite the negative effect of the recent pricing actions in Europe.
During the remainder of the year, we expect continued strength in worldwide uptake of Alimta, growth in product demand, most notably outside the U.S., further indicators of stronger uptake of Effient, given Lilly and Daiichi Sankyo's continued commitment to Effient and its potential, and along with our partner, Kowa, we look forward to growth contributions from our newest cardiovascular product, Livalo. As we increased our guidance, we're also keenly aware of the challenges ahead. However, we remain confident that we are positioning ourselves to meet those challenges as we remain focused on implementing our innovation-based strategy. Again, just over the past quarter, we brought six more NMEs into Phase I human testing, we've moved two more assets into Phase II testing and we completed two additional business development deals for truly promising and novel assets with the acquisition of Alnara Pharmaceuticals and the exclusive licensing agreement with Marcadia Biotech. 
As highlighted earlier we remain excited about the strength of the Bydureon data and the product's potential as a truly best-in-class therapy for people with type two diabetes. We're looking forward to the October 22 PDUFA date, and hope to make this product available to patients before the end of the year.
In closing, we remain focused on speeding innovation to patients. We currently have eight molecules in Phase III, we're on track to have at least 10 molecules in Phase III by the time the Zyprexa patent expires in late 2011, if not sooner, with more coming behind. We continue to bolster our near-to-medium term top line and earnings with targeted end licensing and acquisitions, and we are prudently reducing our headcount and managing our expenses to enable us to invest in the pipeline and provide a robust return of cash to shareholders with our dividend. We continue to expect that executing on our innovation-based strategy will position us to launch two novel molecules per year beginning in 2013, providing the impetus for future growth as we emerge from the YZ period. As always, we will keep you informed of our progress. Have a great day."

Joining me this morning are John Lechleiter, our Chairman and CEO; Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ronika Pletcher; and Nick Lemen, for Investor Relations.. 
During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest 10-K and 10-Q. The information we provide about our product and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.  
In the second quarter, we again generated strong financial results, including robust volume-driven revenue growth. We were able to leverage our high single-digit revenue growth into double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share. In addition, we again generated strong operating cash flow. This strong financial performance has allowed us to raise our full-year 2010 EPS guidance in spite of the negative effect of recent pricing actions in Europe. Now since our last earnings call, we've continued to be active in business development, completing two more deals. We acquired Alnara Pharmaceuticals and their lead asset, liprotamase, which is under FDA review for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and we entered into a development and exclusive license agreement from Marcadia Biotech's preclinical short-acting glucagon program.
We've also made progress on the regulatory front. The FDA confirmed that an advisory committee will be held on August 19 to discuss the chronic pain indication for Cymbalta. With our partner Amylin, we submitted our response to the FDA's complete response letter for Bydureon, and the agency assigned a new PDUFA date of October 2.  And we received a positive final appraisal from NICE in the U.K. for the use of Alimta as a maintenance therapy for patients with non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer.
In commercial news, we launched Livalo in the U.S. Livalo is the statin we licensed from Kowa last year. We also announced an agreement with Wal-Mart to make Humulin available in Wal-Mart pharmacies across the U.S. under the dual-branded name Humulin ReliOn, and as I alluded to earlier, a number of European governments announced measures to reduce their pharmaceutical expenditures. Let's briefly review the situation in Europe before discussing our Q2 results in detail. 
While pricing and reimbursement systems vary by country in Europe, year-on-year average price decreases of 1% to 2% across the region have been commonplace for many years. We attempt to offset this by driving volume growth and achieving incremental productivity gains. Occasionally, acute budget issues in one particular country have prompted more substantial measures, like across-the-board price cuts. As you are aware, the economic downturn has caused budget pressures, which have forced a number of European countries to simultaneously introduce austerity measures to reduce public spending, including measures to reduce their pharmaceutical expenditures. Let's briefly look at some of the measures that have been passed.
The German government announced two temporary measures that will take effect on August 1 of this year. First, for products not subject to reference pricing, the rebate paid to the sick funds will be increased from 6% to 16%; second, prices will be reset back to their August 1, 2009, levels and held flat going forward. Both of these temporary measures will expire at the end of 2013. Not all of our German business is exposed to these actions. For example, some of our products are subject to reference pricing and Humalog rebates already exceed the new 16% mandatory rebate and will not be affected. In addition, a portion of our German demand for many of our products is satisfied through imports by wholesalers from other markets. We are not liable for German rebates on these sales.
In Spain, the government introduced a 7½% rebate on public sector purchases of most branded products. Generics took an even bigger hit, 25%, while orphan drug prices were reduced by only 4%. These reductions will remain in place through the end of the year, with the government deciding later this year about 2011. In addition, measures leading to a more rapid decline in prices post-patent expiration were passed.
On May 1, the Greek government implemented a temporary price reduction of up to 27%. Lilly's average reduction was roughly 23%. The Greek legislation stipulates that this temporary price reduction will be in effect through August 31 of this year. By that time, we expect a temporary price reduction to be replaced by a reference price system that pegs the Greek price to average of the three lowest prices in the EU. While still substantial, we would expect the impact to Lilly of the new reference pricing scheme to be roughly half that of the May 1 price cuts. In addition, this change should lead to a reduced financial exposure in countries that may reference their prices to the prices in Greece. We've also seen some pricing actions taken in smaller EU countries like Romania. In total, at current exchange rates, we estimate that the price cuts announced by these governments will reduce our European revenue by approximately $90 million in 2010 and approximately $150 million in 2011.
In the three major European countries I've not mentioned, U.K., France and Italy, we do not anticipate any additional significant price reductions. Not long ago, the U.K. implemented a revised PPRS agreement to deliver savings on the country's pharmaceutical spend. Under this industry-wide agreement, average prices were reduced by 3.9% in early 2009, and by an additional 1.9% in early 2010. The remaining three years of the agreement call for price stability. 
In France, similar to last year, the government has announced its intention to take actions to reduce pharmaceutical spend by 100 million euros. Last year's actions were directed at the statins and proton pump inhibitors. It's not clear how the French government will target this year's savings.
Finally, in Italy, the price cuts announced by the government didn't affect patented products. However, generic prices were reduced by 12½% and the government announced its intention to move to a tender system in 2011 for purchasing generic drugs. We'll continue to monitor the economic situation in Europe and the actions taken by governments to address their budget and debt issues. While we will see higher than average price erosion in the near-term, the underlying fundamentals of the European market remain strong. There will continue to be strong demand for our products and the benefits they offer patients.
As we have seen in Spain and Italy as well as in Japan earlier this year, we're optimistic that governments that haven't yet done so will increasingly look to reduce the prices they pay for generic drugs to create room to pay for patented drugs. This is crucial in order to maintain adequate incentives for companies to develop the next generation of innovative branded drugs that will subsequently become the next generation of improved low-cost generics, helping future generations live longer, healthier and more productive lives.
Now with his background, Derica will discuss our Q2 financial results and our 2010 guidance. Derica?"

As I've done in the past, I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges. Now let's start on Slide 7, with a quick look at our Q2 income statement before reviewing the effect of foreign exchange.
On a non-GAAP basis, we generated strong revenue growth of 9% in the second quarter, continuing our strong top line performance. On a product basis, our Q2 revenue growth was fueled by Alimta, Cymbalta, Cialis, Zyprexa and animal health. We are especially pleased with the continued strong performance of Alimta, which this quarter surpassed Taxol for shared leadership in the first-line non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer setting in the U.S., which is a significant accomplishment given Taxol's  long-time leadership in this setting.
On a geographic basis, just to sight a few highlights, Japan grew 32% on a performance basis, and China grew 25%, and we saw solid growth in the U.S., Spain and a number of other Asian and Latin American countries. Our gross margin as a percent of revenue was essentially unchanged at just over 82%. This quarter's operating expenses, which we've defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A grew by 7%, less than the 9% revenue growth. Within our operating expenses, marketing, selling and administrative expenses grew only 3%, with the growth driven by higher marketing and selling expenses outside the U.S., partially offset by lower administrative expenses and our ongoing cost containment efforts. R&D expense grew 14%, primarily due to increased late stage clinical trial costs, while also paying key milestone payments, which added over three percentage points of growth. In total, we were able to generate leverage between revenue and operating expenses, leading to operating income growing 12% in the quarter.
Moving down the income statement, you'll see that other income improved slightly due to lower net interest expense. In addition, our tax rate increased by half of a percentage point due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit, partially offset by slight changes in the expected mix of income amongst tax jurisdiction. Net income and earnings per share each grew 11% in the quarter, again, generating strong leverage from the top line.
Slide 8, shows our reported income statement, while Slide 9, provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.
Now let's look at how foreign exchange affected our Q2 results, and we'll start with revenue. As you can see at the bottom of Slide 10, total revenue growth of 9% includes a favorable 1% impact from foreign exchange. This includes a 2% drag in Europe due to a weaker euro. However, this was more than offset by the strengthening in many other currencies, including the Japanese yen, the Australian and Canadian dollars, the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, total revenue grew 7%, driven by 5% volume growth. Japan's substantial volume growth continues, driven by Alimta's Q2 2009 approval for non-small cell lung cancer, the recent launch of Cymbalta and strong volume growth in Zyprexa and Humalog. Our Animal Health business registered very strong 18% volume growth in both the Food and Companion Animals segments and both in the U.S. and internationally. In general, the animal health market has rebounded as economic conditions have stabilized.
Slide 11, shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effective changes in foreign exchange rates. Now the numbers in the first column are the same as those that you saw on Slide 10. I'll focus my comments on the second column of numbers, which strips out the effect of foreign exchange rates.
First, you'll see the 7% revenue growth I mentioned previously. Below that, you'll see that cost of sales grew 8%. In total, operating expenses grew slower than revenue at 6%. As I mentioned earlier, increased investment in late stage-clinical trials and milestone payments drove R&D expense, which was up 14% on a performance basis. SG&A spending, on the other hand, grew much less, only 2%.
As a result of holding growth and operating expenses below the growth in the revenue rate, our 7% performance growth in revenue translated into 9% performance growth in operating income and 8% growth in EPS. You can also see that year-to-date, we leveraged 7% revenue growth on a performance basis and to 9% EPS growth.
Now for your information, on Slide 12, we've provided the year-on-year growth of select line items of our reported income statement, both with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates.
Now let me wrap up my comments with our 2010 financial guidance. Given our strong performance in the first six months of the year, we are raising our previously issued 2010 earnings per share guidance range of $4.40 to $4.55 to a new range of $4.50 to $4.65 on a pro forma non-GAAP basis. This corresponds to a range of $4.44 to $4.59 on a reported basis. In terms of line item guidance, we continue to expect total revenue to grow in the mid-single digits, even with the initial impact of the extraordinary European pricing cuts and the recent unfavorable movement in the euro. Gross margin as a percent of revenue for the year is now expected to be flat to increasing, and we continue to expect improvement excluding the effect of FX on international inventories sold.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are now projected to grow in the low-single digits. We continue to expect research and development expenses to grow in the low-double digits. Our forecast for other income is unchanged at a net deduction of between $50 million and $100 million, and the effective tax rate for the full year is still expected to be approximately 23%, assuming the extension of the R&D tax credit. Finally, we now expect capital expenditures to be less than $900 million.
Slide 14, provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2009 and for our revised 2010 guidance. 
Now let me turn the call over to Ronika for an update on our pipeline. Ronika?"

Before reviewing our pipeline slide, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the investigational product exenatide once weekly, also known by the proposed trade name of Bydureon. It is one of our most important pipeline molecules and is clearly the most proximate to potentially reaching the market as it is currently under active regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe. Based on the clinical data Lilly and Amylin have generated with Bydureon, the evolving therapeutic landscape, and the considerable real world experience we have with the exenatide molecules, we are very excited about the potential of Bydureon to help people with type two diabetes. Over time, we believe the GLP class will play a significant role in the treatment of these diseases and the clinical data we've generated Bydureon has set a high hurdles for drugs in this class. 
As shown on Slide 15 across the duration Phase III program, Bydureon has consistently shown clinically meaningful reduction in A1C. While Bydureon is not being studied as a weight-loss product, we've also seen reductions in the secondary end point of weight, as well as lower incidence of mild to moderate hypoglycemic events relative to comparative drugs.
Common treatment emergent adverse events with Bydureon have included injection site pyrites, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea and constipation. At ADA last month, there were a significant number of presentations on the exenatide molecule covering both Byetta and Bydureon. Just to highlight a couple of the Bydureon presentations,  Slide 16 shows data from a pulled analysis of the duration one, two and three trials in which we analyze the percentage of patients experiencing a reduction in both HbA1C and body weight. As you can see, 73% of the people treated with Bydureon experienced reductions in both HbA1C and weight. In comparison, reductions in these two measures were treated by 46% of the patients taking sitagliptin, 32% of those taking inflanglargine [ph] and only 14% of those taking pioglitazone. Elevated HbA1C and weight are known risk factors for cardiovascular events.
We're also pleased to report that we've recently begun enrollment in our Xcel trial, a cardiovascular outcome study for Bydureon, which will help show whether treatment with Bydureon does in fact reduce cardiovascular events. The trial is slated to include 9,500 patients and provide results in 2016. 
Finally, data were presented at ADA on the extension phase of the DURATION-2 trial. In the 26-week extension phase, patients that received sitagliptin or pioglitazone during the initial 26-week phase were switched to Bydureon, while Bydureon-treated patients continued on therapy. As shown in Slide 17, when treated with Bydureon in the extension phase, patients who switched from pioglitazone to Bydureon maintain HbA1C improvements and nearly all of the weight gain seen in the initial 26 weeks was reversed by 52 weeks. Patients who started initially on sitagliptin experienced a further reduction in weight and an additional reduction in HbA1C. These and other data make us very excited about the potential role that Bydureon can play in helping people with type 2 diabetes manage their disease.
Switching to our pipeline, Slide 18, demonstrates changes since our April 19 earnings call as of July 20. Our clinical stage portfolio stands at 69 distinct NMEs, including 29 compounds in Phase II and Phase III. Our focus remains on developing a robust biotech portfolio, as biotechnology molecules now represent nearly half of our late-stage Phase II and Phase III assets, as well as over a third of our overall clinical portfolio. This includes the recent entry of four new oncology biologics into the clinic, as highlighted with the green arrows on the left. 
As we have said before and continue to emphasize, advancing our pipeline remains our number one priority. Since our last formal portfolio update, we have advanced six assets in Phase I, five targeting oncology and one for Alzheimer's; promoted two assets to Phase II, one for VPH and a second for atherosclerosis; and liprotamase, which is currently under regulatory review in the U.S..
Launched Livalo and the U.S. and still plan to submit Livalo in our first Latin American country during the second half of this year. As shown at the bottom of the slide, we also terminated the development of two Phase I assets, as well as three Phase II assets. We're also seeing encouraging progress in our late-stage pipeline. Our partner, Incyte, disclosed top line three-month Phase IIa data on the JAK1/JAK2 in early May. Incyte also reiterated its plan to present more detailed three-month data as well as six-month data at the ACR conference in November. Ongoing development efforts remain focused on initiating a Phase IIb study later this year. We recently completed two Phase II trials for our BAFF antibody for rheumatoid arthritis. Data from both trials will also be presented at ACR in November. We expect to start Phase III trials in late '10 or early '11.
We recently completed Phase II trials for NERI for depression, OpRA for alcohol dependence and Hypnion for insomnia. We're currently reviewing these data and plan to disclose these data at an upcoming medical meeting. Currently we have eight molecules in Phase III, and we are on track to have at least 10 molecules in Phase III by the time the Zyprexa patent expires in late '11, if not sooner, with more coming behind. We continue to expect that executing on our innovation-based strategy will position us to launch two novel molecules per year beginning in 2013, providing the emphasis for future growth as we emerge from the YZ period.
This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, first caller please."

I had a question about emerging markets, and you had provided some information on your emerging markets business unit's strategy and sales performance last year. I was wondering when we might see an update on that? And specifically, more transparency with regards to the emerging markets sales performance. And a second question on guidance. You've raised your 2010 guidance, but I was wondering about longer-term guidance that you've previously given out until 2014. And with what's happening with price reductions in Europe and the U.S. health care reform, do we assume that the 2014 guidance is still intact? And then a last question, if I could, on your pipeline. You've got eight drugs in Phase III. Could you highlight one or two of the compounds in Phase III, which you think are the most exciting, especially one or two where you think investors might be missing something or underestimating them?"

If you look at Lilly today, our emerging markets represents about 10% of our total revenue, and if you look at our Q2 results, we had about 14% growth in the emerging markets. Now obviously that's a mix of countries and it also has patent expirations in there in some of the smaller ones. But if you look at markets like we talked about earlier in China, in our opening comments, where he had 25% growth, you can say Japan's not an emerging market, but clearly it's a key strategic market for us where we had 32% growth. So we see huge opportunity, and we see also the additional benefit of launching some of our current products in those markets. So here recently we launched Cymbalta in Japan, and we're looking forward to launching FORTEO. In regards to the 2010 and 2014 longer-term guidance, we still feel very good about our comments that we made in December at our analyst meeting about our ability to be at least a $20 billion revenue company, even as we go through the series of patent expirations, and the fact that we think that we can also have good prospects of generating at least $3 billion in net income. And that allows us to have the cash flow to, as you've seen here in the first part of this year, to fund our pipeline of over almost 70 molecules, and also to pursue the business development opportunities that we think will enhance our longer-term prospects."

I think as you look at the eight that we currently have in Phase III right now, I think the ones I would call attention to would be good the two Alzheimer's assets, semagacestat, the oral solanezumab, the antibody, both are progressing well in Phase III. And then we've got the two other molecules from ImClone, 1121 B and 11F8, both of those are in Phase III right now looking at different kinds of tumors.

In terms of the clinical data, I'm a bit more familiar with some of the data that we have for liprotamase. In large part, because that's where we've gotten a few more questions since we've done the deal. So a couple of comments there. First, the regulatory end points that we're shooting for is called co-efficient of fat absorption. It's our understanding that for the FDA that this is a very valid surrogate measure of lipase activity. This is accepted as a primary endpoint for approval of treatments for EPI. There were two studies that will contribute to that primary endpoint, both of which met their endpoint with statistical significance, 726 study and also it's called PC-2a study. We view both of those as the registration pivotal studies. I think some of the concern has come about, the 726 study where there was a subpopulation of patients in Eastern Europe and South America that did not seem to experience the same level of benefit. But, again, that overall trial did meet its endpoint, and we view that as being appropriate basis to go ahead and make the submission. There are also two other studies that were done, longer-term studies that go out about 12 months, that looked at endpoints that while they're not strictly the ones we'd look to for the regulatory approval, they're very important, we believe, as supportive data. And those were the 767 and the 810 study that had very good data and BMI, height and weight that we think supports the profile of the product. In terms of the Erbitux line extensions, new indications on all three of those we've made very good progress with the FDA, and would expect in 2011 to be in a position to respond to the complete response letter on the first line head, neck indication to resubmit the first line non-small cell lung indication and to submit the first line colorectal."

So I'd say stay tuned on that front."

So good acceleration there of TRx up to a 91,000 range in Q2 versus 51,000 in Q1.

We appreciate your continued interest in Eli Lilly. Let me close with a few key points, first underscoring our financial performance and then highlighting progress made on our innovation-based strategy. We're very pleased with our performance so far in 2010. In the second quarter, we again generated strong financial results with robust, volume-driven revenue growth; continued leverage between growth and revenue and operating expenses, largely driven by our ongoing cost-containment efforts; and strong operating cash flow. This strong financial performance has allowed us to raise our full year 2010 EPS guidance, and we're doing this despite the negative effect of the recent pricing actions in Europe.
During the remainder of the year, we expect continued strength in worldwide uptake of Alimta; growth in product demand, most notably outside the U.S; further indicators of stronger uptake of Effient, given Lilly and Daiichi Sankyo's continued commitment to Effient and its potential, and along with our partner, Kowa, we look forward to growth contributions from our newest cardiovascular product, Livalo. As we increased our guidance, we're also keenly aware of the challenges ahead. However, we remain confident that we are positioning ourselves to meet those challenges as we remain focused on implementing our innovation-based strategy. Again, just over the past quarter, we brought six more NMEs into Phase I human testing, we've moved two more assets into Phase II testing and we completed two additional business development deals for truly promising and novel assets with the acquisition of Alnara Pharmaceuticals and the exclusive licensing agreement with Marcadia Biotech. 
As highlighted earlier we remain excited about the strength of the Bydureon data and the product's potential as a truly best-in-class therapy for people with type 2 diabetes. We're looking forward to the October 22 PDUFA date, and hope to make this product available to patients before the end of the year.
In closing, we remain focused on speeding innovation to patients. We currently have eight molecules in Phase III, we're on track to have at least 10 molecules in Phase III by the time the Zyprexa patent expires in late 2011, if not sooner, with more coming behind. We continue to bolster our near- to medium-term top line and earnings with targeted end licensing and acquisitions, and we are prudently reducing our headcount and managing our expenses to enable us to invest in the pipeline and provide a robust return of cash to shareholders with our dividend. We continue to expect that executing on our innovation-based strategy will position us to launch two novel molecules per year beginning in 2013, providing the impetus for future growth as we emerge from the YZ period. As always, we will keep you informed of our progress. Have a great day."

Joining me this morning are John Lechleiter, our Chairman and CEO; Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Enrique Conterno, President of our Diabetes business; and Ronika Pletcher and Nick Lemen for Investor Relations.
During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest 10-K and 10-Q. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. 
Let's start with a few headlines for the quarter. On the operating front, we again delivered robust financial results, delivering EPS of $1.18 on a reported basis and of a $1.21 on a non-GAAP basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, we continued to see positive leverage between revenue and total costs. Our ongoing cost containment and productivity efforts allowed us to leverage 3% performance growth in revenue and a 7% performance growth in operating income.
On the revenue line, we saw strong performance growth in international markets for our Human Pharmaceuticals business and globally for our Animal Health business. As Derica will discuss later, revenue growth in our U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals business was negatively affected by wholesaler buying patterns, while the impact of foreign exchange on revenue turned negative for the first time this year.
Based on continued solid financial performance and a lower estimate for the cost of U.S. healthcare reform in 2010, we're raising our EPS guidance for the full year.
On the legal front, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or CAFC upheld the Michigan District Court ruling that our method-of-use patent for Gemzar is invalid. The U.S. District Court in New Jersey ruled that the method-of-use patent for Strattera is invalid. The CAFC will hear our appeal of this ruling in early December. The CAFC upheld the Indiana District Court ruling that Evista's method-of-use patents are valid, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that a class should not have been certified in a pending third-party payer suit on Zyprexa. The court further ruled that the plaintiff's overpricing claim should not go forward.
Later in the call, Nick will provide a more detailed update on these and other patent challenges.
In clinical and regulatory news, the FDA issued a complete response letter for Bydureon, requesting a thorough QT study and submission of the DURATION-5 study results. Pending discussions with the FDA, our goal is to reply to the complete response letter by the end of 2011.
An independent data monitoring committee for the Protege trial with teplizumab recently met and concluded at a primary efficacy endpoint a compositive patient's total daily insulin usage and HbA1C level at 12 months was not met. Administration of the study drug has been completed, and patients will be followed for safety information. Lilly and MacroGenics have decided to suspend enrollment in dosing in two other ongoing clinical trials. The companies are currently evaluating next steps. And we hope the development of semagacestat, our gamma-secretase inhibitor that was being studied in Phase III trials to treat patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
Finally, the FDA Anesthetic and Life Support Drugs Advisory Committee voted 8 to 6 in favor of expanding the pain indications for Cymbalta to a broader population to be further defined by the FDA. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Derica to discuss our Q3 financial results and our 2010 guidance in more detail. Derica?"

Consistent with prior calls, I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP results, which we believe provides insights into the underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges.
Now let's start on Slide 7 with a quick look at our Q3 non-GAAP income statement. At the top line, we generated revenue growth of 2% in the third quarter. This includes a negative impact of more than 1% from U.S. healthcare reform and European pricing actions that, in total, reduced Q3 revenue by roughly $65 million. This 2% growth is lower than what we've seen in the first half of the year, primarily due to wholesaler buying patterns in the U.S. and movements in foreign exchange. I'll provide more details in a moment when we review the price rate volume analysis.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue again came in at over 82%, an increase of 1.4 percentage points from Q3 2009. This increase was driven by manufacturing productivity improvement and by the favorable impact of price increases. This quarter's operating expenses, which we defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, grew by 3%, slightly more than the 2% revenue growth. Operating expense growth was driven by a charge of approximately $80 million that was booked to R&D expense as a result of the termination of development of semagacestat. R&D expense grew 9% in the quarter due in large part to this charge.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses, on the other hand, were flat compared to last year, driven by lower administrative expenses and our ongoing cost containment efforts. Now as a result of the improvement in the gross margin percent, we were able to leverage 2% revenue growth into 4% operating income growth.
Now moving down the income statement, you will see that other income improved by $45 million due largely to an insurance recovery and lower net interest expense. In addition, our tax rate increased by 3.5 percentage points due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit this year, as well as the benefit realized in last year's quarter related to a cumulative adjustment in the forecasted effective tax rate for the full year of 2009 and to the resolution of the company's 2001 to 2004 tax audit.
Now as a consequence of this higher tax rate, growth in net income and EPS lagged as seen in revenue and operating income. Specifically, net income and earnings per share grew 2% and 1%, respectively.
Now Slide 8 shows our reported income statement, while Slide 9 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.
Now let's look at how foreign exchange affected our Q3 results, and we'll start with revenue. At the bottom of Slide 10, you'll see the 2% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. Now this growth is driven by a favorable price impact of 3%, which was partially offset by a negative effect from foreign exchange of 1%, while volume growth was essentially flat. So in performance terms, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, revenue grew 3% in the quarter.
Clearly, the overall growth rate of revenue is below what we've seen in both Q1 and Q2 earlier this year. The biggest changes are in exchange rate and volume. In terms of rate, Q3 is the first quarter this year that FX has had a negative effect on revenue. The primary drivers of this reversal are the weakening of the euro versus last year and a number of other international currencies, only partially offset by a stronger yen.
In terms of volume, the biggest changes in the U.S. where we went from having low single digit volume increases in Q1 and in Q2 to a 6% volume decrease this quarter. Now of that 6% decrease, four percentage points of this decrease were driven by changes in wholesaler inventory levels, which increased in Q3 last year while they were decreasing in Q3 of this year. Now these fluctuations were within normal contractual limits.
We continue to see robust volume growth in our Animal Health business, which was up 13%; and in Japan, where volume was up 18%. We also registered volume growth of between 15% and 21% in a number of other international markets including China, Mexico, Australia, Korea and Turkey. In total, our emerging markets business posted 14% volume growth in the third quarter.
Now Slide 11 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effect of changes in foreign currency rate. The numbers in the first column are the same as you saw in the last column on Slide 7. I'll focus my comments on the second column of numbers, which strips out the effect of foreign exchange rate.
First, you'll see a 3% growth in revenue. Below that, you'll see that the cost of sales actually declined 7%, driven by our continued efforts to improve productivity and reduce cost. In total, operating expenses grew slightly faster than revenue, showing growth of 4%. Operating expense growth rising above that revenue is due to the R&D charge incurred for the termination of the development of semagacestat.
In total, we held the growth in our total expenses being manufacturing, SG&A and R&D below the revenue growth rate, which allowed us to leverage 3% performance growth in revenue and to 7% performance growth in operating income. Again, EPS growth of 5% in performance terms was negatively affected by the increase in the effective tax rate. And finally, as shown in the last column, you'll see similar leverage in our year-to-date results, excluding the effect of FX.
Now for your information, on Slide 12, we provided the year-on-year growth of select line items of our reported income statement, once again, both with and without the effect of foreign exchange rate.
Now let me wrap up my comments with our 2010 financial guidance. As Phil mentioned earlier, our continued strong financial performance, including prudent management of expenses and a lower estimate of the 2010 revenue impact of U.S. healthcare reform, has positioned us to raise our previously issued 2010 earnings per share guidance. We're moving up from a range of $4.50 to $4.65 to a new range of $4.65 to $4.75 on a non-GAAP basis. Now this corresponds to a range of $4.55 to $4.65 on a reported basis.
In terms of line item guidance, we now expect total revenue to grow in the mid-single digit. This guidance contemplates the potential introduction of generic gemcitabine in mid-November, and it assumes no generic atomoxetine and incorporates the revised 2010 cost estimates for U.S. healthcare reform.
As we outlined in our press release, we now anticipate that U.S. healthcare reform will reduce our 2010 revenue by between $225 million to $275 million.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue for the year is still expected to be flat to increasing, and we continue to expect improvement excluding the effect of FX on international inventories sold.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are still projected to grow in the low-single digits, and growth in research and development expenses is still expected to be in the low-double digits.
Our forecast for other income has changed slightly to a net deduction of between zero and $50 million. The effective tax rate for the full year is still expected to be approximately 23%. This includes the $85 million tax charge booked earlier this year related to U.S. healthcare reform and the future taxation of the retiree drug subsidy, and it assumes that the extension of the R&D tax credit is retroactive to January 1, 2010. If this credit is not extended, our tax rate for the full year would be roughly 1 percentage point higher.
Finally, through the continued efforts of our engineering group to deliver needed capital projects more efficiently, we now expect capital expenditures for the year to total approximately $700 million.
Also, please note that we are in the process of evaluating whether or not the news on Bydureon and teplizumab will result in any charge to the fourth quarter earnings. Our guidance does not explicitly include any such charges.
On Slide 14, we provide a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2009 and for our revised 2010 guidance.
On an additional note, we will issue our 2011 guidance, including updated estimates of the impact of U.S. healthcare reform and European pricing measures, on our Q4 earnings call in late January of 2011. Also, we intend to update you on our medium-term 2014 outlook at our next investment community meeting, which we anticipate holding at the end of June of next year.
Now let me turn the call over to Nick, who will share our quarterly pipeline update, as well as additional details on U.S. patent challenges and an overview of our Japanese business. Nick?"

Slide 15 demonstrates changes in our pipeline since our July 20 earnings call as of October 18. Our clinical stage portfolio stands at 68 distinct NMEs, including 28 compounds in Phase II and Phase III. We remain focused on developing a robust biotech portfolio, and biotech molecule now represent over half of our Phase II and Phase III assets and over 40% of our overall clinical portfolio. Advancing our pipeline remains our number one priority. 
Since our last formal portfolio update, we have advanced three assets into Phase I, two oncology compounds and one for nephropathy, promoted two assets into Phase II, IMC-18F1 for cancer and a second asset for osteoporosis. And we began Phase III trials of NERI IV as an adjunctive therapy to SSRIs and patients with major depressive disorder based on the result of two positive Phase II studies. Data from our Phase II augmentation trial will be presented in November at the international forum on mood and anxiety disorders in Vienna. In addition, data from our Phase II monotherapy trial will be presented in December at the ACNP meeting in Miami.
As shown at the bottom of the slide, we also terminated the development of one Phase I asset and two Phase II assets. And as mentioned earlier, dosing will be suspended in Phase III trials of teplizumab for Type 1 diabetes, and we terminated semagacestat from our Phase III pipeline.
While the loss of semagacestat was a disappointment in our Alzheimer's program, we're encouraged by the progress of our a beta antibody, solanezumab. This month, the first Phase III clinical trial for solanezumab completed enrollment, while the second study is over 80% enrolled. Assuming this trend continues, we would anticipate completing the two 18-month studies in 2012.
Also, while not currently shown in the Phase III, by early 2011, we will begin Phase III trials of our BAFF antibody for rheumatoid arthritis and for lupus.
As mentioned earlier, the last three months have been busy from a legal perspective. I'll take the next few moments to provide some more details on the recent patent decisions and to highlight two upcoming cases.
As you know, protection of intellectual property is critical to our business, and it is the nature of our business that our patents will be challenged by generic manufacturers. Over the past three months, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the prior ruling by the U.S. District Court from the Eastern District of Michigan that Gemzar's method-of-use patent is invalid. We have requested a rehearing at the CAFC and are waiting to hear if that request will be granted. If the rehearing is denied or isn't successful, we will lose market exclusivity for Gemzar in the U.S. as early as November 15, 2010, when the compound patented and its extensions expire.
The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey ruled that the method-of-use patent for Strattera is invalid. The patent had been set to expire in May of 2017. We appealed this decision, and the CAFC has scheduled a hearing on December 9, 2010. In addition, we're pleased that the CAFC granted an injunction that prevents the launch of generic versions of atomoxetine until the ruling is rendered.
The CAFC also affirmed a prior ruling by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana that the company's method-of-use patents for Evista are valid. These patents provide protection for Evista in the U.S. through March of 2014. The period for requesting an appeal has passed. However, Teva can file a petition to the Supreme Court for review.
In the months to come, we have two other patent challenges that will go to trial. Unlike the three cases I just discussed, which involve method-of-use patents, these cases involve compound patents. First, three generic manufacturers have challenged the compound patent for Alimta. These cases have been consolidated and will be heard at the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware starting on November 8, 2010. We expect to prevail in this litigation and maintain U.S. exclusivity, at least through July 2016.
Second, nine generic manufacturers have challenged a compound patent for Cymbalta. Lawsuits against all but one of these challengers have been stayed pending the outcome against the lone remaining challenger. The trial is currently scheduled to be heard at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana starting on June 6, 2011. We also expect to prevail in this litigation and maintain U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta until June 2013 or December 2013, if we were successful in securing the six-month pediatric extension.
Again, we are confident in the validity of our patents, and we'll continue to take every reasonable step to protect our intellectual property rights. Successfully defending valid patents is critical to Lilly and to all innovation-based pharmaceutical companies as it provides the underpinning for investment and research and development to discover and bring to market new therapies that improve patient outcomes.
In past quarters, we provided informational updates on specific marketed products, compounds in development or business development deals to help you better understand the story behind our quarterly numbers. This time around, we'd like to highlight our Japanese Human Pharmaceutical business.
Along with emerging markets in Animal Health, Japan will provide substantial counter-cyclical growth as we experienced patent expirations in the U.S. and Europe on products like Zyprexa, Gemzar, Cymbalta and Evista. You may wonder what's going to drive significant growth of Lilly products during this period in Japan, an established and mature market. Historically, we've launched our projects in Japan well after we've launched them in the U.S. and Europe. While we've made great progress in accelerating development of our pipeline molecules to allow for more proximate launches in the U.S., Europe and Japan in the future, we are still working through this historical launch gap. As a result, we have a significant opportunity for growth over the next several years.
In 2009, we generated pharmaceutical sales of nearly $1.2 billion in Japan, representing growth of 28% over 2008 and making it the second-largest market for Lilly behind the United States. Growth continues to be very strong in 2010, with September year-to-date performance growth of 26%. As measured by IMS, we are far and away the fastest-growing major pharmaceutical company in this important market, growing at 29% versus market growth of only 1% for August year-to-date. This has allowed Lilly Japan to move up in ranking from number 23 to number 19 in the last two months.
Zyprexa is our biggest seller in the Japanese market, with over $300 million in sales and 8% performance growth year-to-date. This is an important opportunity for Lilly and one that should be bolstered by additional indications as we hope to receive approval for an indication in bipolar mania soon, and we expect to submit an application for bipolar depression by year end. It is important to note that while we lose the patent on Zyprexa in the U.S. and Europe next year, we maintain exclusivity in Japan until December 2015. This should help drive what we hope to be a significant tale of Zyprexa sales post-2011.
Alimta has demonstrated very impressive growth since its approval for non-small cell lung cancer in Q2 of last year with the best share of market uptick in first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer of any market in the world. This growth has made it our second best-selling product in Japan. With Alimta and Gemzar, which had breast cancer added to its label earlier this year, our oncology presence continues to grow impressively in the Japanese market.
With our partner, Shionogi, we are very pleased with the uptick for Cymbalta for major depressive disorder since our launch in Q2 of this year. In addition, our application for diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain indication is currently under regulatory review.
Our insulin products continue to grow at double the market growth, with Humalog mix showing strong share of market gains, picking up nine share points over the last two years. The momentum in Japan has continued recently, including approvals for Strattera for ADHD in children last year; and for FORTEO for osteoporosis in Q3, allowing the affiliate to launch the products in October 1 after having obtained a first-time exception from the 14-day prescription rule in Japan.
In addition, we hope to receive approval soon for Byetta BID for Type 2 diabetes. Hopefully, this provides you with some valuable insights to our Japanese business. We are confident in our ability to continue on a strong growth trajectory in Japan, and we expect Japan to contribute meaningfully to our corporate results in the coming years.

Lilly has been describing Bydureon as its most important late-stage pipeline product. We had the delay recently, that comes on top of some other pipeline setbacks and some other negative news like some of the patent losses. I think the prevailing consensus among investors is that given some of the big expirations that lay, ahead at some point, Lilly will likely have to do a larger acquisition to fill in the gaps. For John, I'm wondering what you can share on this. Are all options on the table at this point? And can you reconfirm what you said before, which is at any business development that you do, won't jeopardize the dividend. And in as much as Lilly benchmarks against its peers in terms of strategy, is Lilly leaning more towards a Bristol-Myers-type of approach, meaning a pure plate branded pharma company or might that company head down the path of diversification more like a GlaxoSmithKline or some of the other players?"

The recent events that you cite do not change our fundamental strategy, the core of which is progression of molecules through our pipeline. We have still our eyes set on having at least 10 molecules in Phase III development at or around the time that we lose our Zyprexa patent here in the U.S. in late 2011. I think our fundamental strategy remains intact. We're not interested in large-scale combinations. I think there are many other opportunities that I think we could consider along the lines of several that we've done already this year. Most recently the Alnara acquisition, the acquisition of the Pfizer-Wyeth divested Animal Health assets in Europe. As far as diversification goes, we like our Animal Health business. You saw us report 12% revenue growth for the quarter for Elanco. It's an area where we've shown a willingness to invest externally, as well as to develop our companion animal business organically, and we're going to continue to focus on that. As far as diversification goes, I think we're considering as a form of diversification our enhanced and increased focus on biotechnology. You heard today I think 40% of our pipeline assets are biotech molecules, and I think there's an element of geographic diversification here as well. When you can grow like we're growing in Japan, the second largest pharma market in the world, I think that presents a nice offset. We have only about 10% of our sales today in what we classify as the emerging markets. We see a tremendous opportunity to grow and expand there, largely with our existing product portfolio in the years ahead. So I think that remains our focus, and notwithstanding the setbacks, we're confident that we can execute on that strategy."

If you go back and do apples and apples and you say, ""How far along are we toward the 5,500?"" We're at about 2,700 day. So one can say we're sort of halfway through the process of eliminating the 5,500 positions that we described in September of 2009. With respect to any further plans on headcount reduction, we have no such plans at the moment. Obviously, we work in a business and in an industry that's undergoing a tremendous amount of change. We will continue to navigate through these waters and do, at any point in time, what we think is the appropriate thing for the business. But right now, our focus is resolutely on advancing our pipeline, taking advantage of growth opportunities we have that we described earlier in the phone call today."

Clearly, Pfizer would add significant commercialization power to them as they commercialize in a number of different countries. We do believe, though, as we look at insulin that delivery devices are a critical capability that only a few players actually possess. And it's not just the current delivery devices, but improved delivery devices and the innovation that we continue to work on. So clearly, something that we will watch. But we feel very confident in our ability to be certainly effective with our insulin portfolio. As I shared before, I am not going to comment on GLP FC. When we look at Bydureon, what we have shared is that we expect to have a submission at the end of 2011, and this projection is based on a range of possibility, when we look at the range of product cost that we plan to discuss with the agency. Clearly, this is a conservative estimate and one that we want to make sure that we are meeting.

Maybe you could share with us your views on what you see as a change in the fundamental communications between the industry and the FDA. Because clearly, Lilly has been subjected now to what seems to be several communications breakdowns, both with Effient and the multiple complete response letters, the pain indication for Cymbalta, and now Bydureon as my understanding is the first complete response letter did not include any request for QTC issue. So just your view on that, what's changed and your outlook for communications going forward the agency. And secondly, I appreciate the company's continued commitment to the $2 billion annual dividend. But based on our numbers, just with the patent expirations and the setbacks in the pipeline, which would've helped to fill that somewhat, we're reflecting about a $4 billion to $5 billion hit on the revenue line between 2010 to 2015, and that's before Alimta goes away in 2016. It seems the only way to really offset that and maintain your annual $2 billion dividend is by announcing a much more significant headcount reduction or cost reduction program. And/or what are we missing in terms of the top line? What are the products that give you confidence to drive the company sort of the next period 2015 and beyond?"

I think there is a -- this has been a tougher journey for many companies in the industry as FDA, I think, tries to strike what it believes to be the right balance between making new medicines available and ensuring safety. I think the three examples you cite, I think you talked about Effient and then Cymbalta and Bydureon, they're all reviewed and looked at by different divisions within the FDA. There is a sort of a different storyline there for each one of these. I think as Enrique said earlier, we're committed to meeting the request that FDA has made around Bydureon and hopefully getting this work done in a time that enables us to resubmit at the end of 2011. We were pleased with the outcome of the Advisory Committee for Cymbalta in August, and we continue to work with the agency toward what we hope will be an approval for a new indication for Cymbalta in the area of chronic pain.

When we presented the 2014 construct in December of last year, we said at that time that we anticipate 2014 being a trough period for Eli Lilly in terms of this given patent expirations. And even at that time, we still anticipated being able to both fund or finance the operations of our business, including progressing the pipeline, as well as maintaining our dividend. And that was in what we consider to be the trough period. To your point about what I think many in the market may be missing about Lilly, everyone obviously is focused on the certainty of the patent we will lose. I think some of the growth opportunities that's not registering maybe in the investor's mind these days are one, I'll come back to the Zyprexa comment earlier. Recall that we do not lose the patent for Zyprexa in Japan until the end of 2015, so we still anticipate growth there. In most of the markets outside of the U.S. for Zyprexa, we've already lost in the major markets much of the patent protection there. So I think there's more of a tail to Zyprexa than people are giving it credit for. Secondly, if you look at markets like Japan, we expect to double the size of that business over the next three to five years. If you look at the market business Elanco, which John touched on earlier, we also expect to double in the next three to five years. And then thirdly, if you look at our emerging markets, which grew 14% this quarter, we expect to double the size of that business as well. So yes, while we may be losing revenue associated with Zyprexa in the U.S, as well as Cymbalta in the U.S., there is some markets outside the U.S. and some other business segments that we anticipate growing very robustly during that same period."

But in the context of an environment that seems to be fraught with increased risk, they're doing a lot of other things to sort of move that risk for their shareholders, and I think that given the recent performance from the pipeline of Lilly, sort of one of the frustrations. So what are you learning through this process? And the guidance for 2014 going out to June sort of implies that you're going to be going back to the drawing board. So I think that with the benefit of hindsight, certainly, we could look at Bydureon and say maybe you took some shortcuts in the line extension strategy versus a new drug application strategy. And certainly with, prasugrel, you got the product approved onto the market. But certainly it isn't commercially probably doing what you had hoped. So can you just sort of talk to us about what we should be expecting you're going to be looking at over the next six months and specifically, what kinds of changes, if any, you might be making in R&D."

But I guess I'm not as negative as maybe some of your commentary may indicate in terms of the outlook of our business. I want to remind the investment community once again, we still anticipate 2014 being a trough. And as I indicated earlier, what gives us between today and 2014, the driver to that is primarily our ongoing trends of our currently marketed products, as well as our cost containment efforts. The pipeline will be more indicative of what our growth prospects look like coming out of 2014. And I think that hinges back to what John stated earlier that today we're sitting on approximately 68 molecules in clinical stage development. We still anticipate having at least 10 molecules in Phase III development by the end of 2011 which we believe puts us in proximity to be able to begin to launch products as we're coming out of the Y-Z period and then returning to growth. When you think about our strategy, there are some, I guess, to your point about how do you mitigate risk or how do you dampen the nature of the business that we're in? I think there's a couple of factors, one is the Elanco Animal Health business, it softens that. Secondly, we have some parts of our geographical business that's counter-cyclical to what you're seeing in the Y-Z. And then thirdly, if you come back to just biotech presence, the fact that roughly half of our portfolio is in biotech or a little bit more than 40%, half of our Phase II, Phase III portfolio is biotech. So when I think about our fundamental business strategy, I think it's still intact. And yes, we will continue to use our balance sheet and business development opportunities to bridge gaps that maybe there or to take advantage of emerging opportunities.

Clearly, this is a challenging time for the company and the industry, but it's also, we believe, a time, as I said earlier on the call, of great opportunity. We continue to believe that our innovation-based strategy, while not without risk, will provide the greatest value to our shareholders and to society.
Clearly, we're not sitting here passively reacting to events as they occur, but we're acting with focus and purpose to achieve our goals, to overcome upcoming patent losses and to return to growth. The consistent operational performance we've shared with you throughout this year are signs of progress and provide the wherewithal for us to meet our challenges. To date, we generated strong financial results with robust, volume-driven sales growth, continued leverage driven by cost containment and productivity efforts, and strong operating cash flow.
Thanks to the strong operating performance we've raised, our full year 2010 EPS guidance for the third time this year, we're seeing small growth in our Animal Health business and emerging markets and in Japan, as Nick commented where we're the fastest-growing pharma company. Obviously, the strong financial performance is the fuel for our innovation strategy.
And because we know that setbacks are part of our business, we've been working hard to increase our shops on goal. We now have 68 assets in human testing, 28 in Phases II and III, including many with tremendous potential. Among them, we have Phase III trials ongoing for 1121B. This is the ImClone molecule in breast and gastric cancer. We recently started another Phase III study, in hepatocellular cancer, we'll be starting more in the near future. And we completed enrollment in our first Phase III trial for solanezumab, and the second is more than 80% enrolled.
Furthermore, a major part of our recent restructuring was aimed at accelerating our pipeline flow, and I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing. We've moved nearly four into Phase III, and we expect to begin Phase III trials of our BAFF antibody for RA and for lupus in early 2011. This molecule is the first of an emerging autoimmune portfolio that includes our IL-17 antibody and the JAK1/JAK2 with our partners from Incyte. We also advanced three more assets into Phase I and two into Phase II this quarter. We're going to continue to focus on speeding innovation to patients, and we remain on track to have at least 10 molecules in Phase III by the end of 2011 with more coming behind.
We continue to bolster our near to medium-term top line and earnings with targeted in licensing and acquisitions, and we are prudently reducing our headcount and managing our expenses to enable us to invest in the pipeline and provide a robust return of cash to shareholders with the dividend. As always, we'll keep you informed of our progress. Thank you again for your interest in Lilly."

Welcome to Eli Lilly & Company's third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. I am Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations.

Welcome to Eli Lilly & Company's third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. I am Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are John Lechleiter, our Chairman and CEO; Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Enrique Conterno, President of our Diabetes business; and Ronika Pletcher and Nick Lemen from Investor Relations.
During the conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide 3 and those outlined in our latest 10-K and 10-Q. The information we provide about our product and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.
Let's start with the key headlines for the quarter. On the operating front we again delivered robust financial results, delivering EPS of $1.18 on a reported basis and $1.21 on a non-GAAP basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange we continue to see positive leverage within revenue and total costs.
Our ongoing cost containment and productivity efforts allowed us to leverage 3% performance growth in revenue and a 7% performance growth in operating income. On the revenue line we saw strong performance growth in international markets for our Human Pharmaceuticals business and globally for Animal Health business.
As Derica will discuss later, revenue growth in our US Human Pharmaceutical business was negatively affected by wholesaler buying patents, while the impact of foreign exchange on revenue turned negative for the first time this year. 
Based on continued solid natural performance and a lower estimate for the cost of US health care reform in 2010 we're raising out EPS guidance for the full year.
On the legal front, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or CAFC upheld the Michigan District court ruling that our method-of-use patents for Gemzar is invalid. The US District Court in New Jersey ruled that the method of use pattern for Strattera is invalid. The CAFC will hear our appeal of this ruling in early December. 
The CAFC upheld the Indiana District Court ruling that have listed a method-of-use patents are valid and the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that a class should not have been certified in a pending third-party payor suit on Zyprexa. The courts further ruled that the plaintiffs overpricing claim should not go forward.
Later in the call Nick will provide a more detailed update on these and other patent challenges. In clinical and regulatory news, the FDA issued a complete response letter for BYDUREON requesting a thorough QT study and submission of the DURATION-5 study results. Pending discussions with the FDA, our goal is to reply to the complete response letter by the end of 2011. 
An independent data monitoring committee for the Protege trial with teplizumab recently met and concluded the primary efficacy endpoint, a composite patients total daily insulin usage and HbA1c level at 12 months was not met. Administration of study drug has been completed and patients will followed for safety information. 
Lilly and MacroGenics have decided to suspend enrolment in dozing in two other ongoing clinical trials. The company's are currently evaluating next step. And we hope that development of Semagacestat, our gamma secretase inhibitor that was being studied in Phase 3 trials to treat patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. 
Finally the FDA Anesthetic and Life Support Drugs Advisory Committee voted eight to six in favor of expanding the pain indications for Cymbalta to a broader population to be further defined by the FDA.
Now I will turn the call over to Derica to discuss our Q3 financial results and our 2010 guidance in more detail. Derica?

Consistent with prior calls, I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP results, which we believe provides insights into the underlying trends in our business. This here excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and",1499,"Thanks Phil. Consistent with prior calls, I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP results, which we believe provides insights into the underlying trends in our business. This here excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges. Now let's start on slide seven with a quick look at our Q3 non-GAAP income statement. 
At the top-line, we generated revenue growth of 2% in the third quarter. This includes a negative impact of more than 1% from US health care reform and European pricing actions at in total reduce Q3 revenue by roughly $65 million. This 2% growth is slower than what we've seen in the first half of the year, primarily due to wholesale of buying patents in the US and movements in foreign exchange.
I will provide more details in a moment where we review the price/rate/volume analysis. 
Gross margin as a percent of revenue again came in at over 82%, an increase of 1.4 percentage points from Q3 2009. This increase was driven by manufacturing productivity improvement and by the favorable impact of price increases. This quarter's operating expenses which we defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A grew by 3%, slightly more than the 2% revenue growth.
Operating expense growth was driven by a charge of approximately $80 million that was booked to R&D expense, as a result of the termination of development of Semagacestat. R&D expense grew 9% in the quarter due to a large part to this charge.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses on the other hand were flat compared to last year, driven by lower administrative expenses and our ongoing cost containment efforts. Now as a result of the improvement in the gross margin percent, we were able to leverage 2% revenue growth into 4% operating income growth.
Now moving down the income statement, you will see that other income improved by $45 million due largely to an insurance recovery and lower net interest expense. In addition, our tax rate increased by 3.5 percentage points due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit this year, as well as the benefit realized in last year's quarter related to a cumulative adjustment in the forecasted effective tax rate for the full year of 2009 and to the resolution of the company's 2001 to 2004 tax audit. Now as a consequence of this higher tax rate, growth in net income and EPS lagged that scene in revenue and in operating income specifically net income and earnings per share grew 2% and 1% respectively.
Now slide 8 shows our reported income statement, while slide 9 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.
Now, let's look at how foreign exchange affected our Q3 results, and we'll start with revenue.
At the bottom of slide 10, you'll see the 2% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. Now this growth is driven by a favorable price impact of 3%, which was partially offset by negative effect from foreign exchange of 1%, while volume growth was essentially flat. So in performance terms, excluding the effect of foreign exchange revenue grew 3% in the quarter. Clearly the overall growth rate of revenue is below what we've seen in both Q1 and Q2 earlier this year. The biggest changes are in exchange rate and volume.
In terms of rate, Q3 is the first quarter this year that FX has had a negative effect on revenue. The primary drivers of this reversal are the weakening of the Euro versus last year, and a number of other international currencies only partially offset by a stronger Yen.
In terms of volume, the biggest changes in the US where we went from having low single-digit volume increases in Q1 and in Q2, to a 6% volume decrease this quarter. Now of that 6% decrease, 4 percentage points of this decrease were driven by changes in wholesaler inventory levels, which increased in Q3 last year, while they were decreasing in Q3 of this year. Now these fluctuations were within normal contractual limit.
We continue to see robust volume growth in our animal health business which was up 13%, and in Japan where volume was up 18%. We also registered volume growth of between 15% and 21% in a number of other international markets, including China, Mexico, Australia, Korea and Turkey. In total, our emerging markets business posted 14% volume growth in the third quarter.
Now slide 11 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effect of changes in foreign currency rate. The numbers in the first column are the same as you saw in the last column of slide 7. I will focus my comments on the second column of numbers which strips out the effect of foreign exchange rate.
First, you will see a 3% growth in revenue. Below that you will see that the cost of sales actually declined 7% driven by our continued efforts to improve productivity and reduce costs. In total operating expenses grew slightly faster than revenue showing growth of 4%. Operating expense growth rising above that of revenue is due to the R&D charge incurred for the termination of the development of Semagacestat.
In total, we held the growth in our total expenses being manufacturing, SG&A and R&D below the revenue growth rate which allowed us to leverage 3% performance growth in revenue and to 7% performance growth in operating income. Again EPS growth of 5% in performance terms was negatively affected by the increase in the effective tax rate. And finally as shown in the last column you will see similar leverage in our year-to-date results excluding the effect of FX.
Now for your information on slide 12, we provided the year-on-year growth of direct line items of our reported income statement. Once again both with and without the effect of foreign exchange rates.
Now let me wrap up my comments with our 2010 financial guidance. As Phil mentioned earlier our continued strong financial performance including prudent management of expenses and a lower estimate of the 2010 revenue impact of US healthcare reform has positioned us to raise our previously issued 2010 earnings per share guidance. We are moving up from a range of $4.50 to $4.65 to a new range of $4.65 to $4.75 on a non-GAAP basis. Now this corresponds to a range of $4.55 to $4.65 on a reported basis. 
In terms of line item guidance, we now expect total revenue to grow in the mid-single digits, this guidance contemplates the potential introduction of generic gemcitabine in mid November and it assumes no generic atomoxetine and incorporates the revised 2010 cost estimate for US healthcare reform. 
As we outlined in our press release we now anticipate that US healthcare reform will reduce our 2010 revenue by between $225 million to $275 million. Gross margin as a percent of revenue for the year is still expected to be flat to increasing and we continue to expect improvement excluding the effect of FX on international inventory sold. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are still projected to grow in the low single-digit. And growth in research and development expenses is still expected to be in the low double-digit. Our forecast for other income has changed slightly to a net reduction of between 0 and $50 million. The effective tax rate for the full year is still expected to be approximately 23%. This includes the $85 million tax charge booked earlier this year related to US health care reforms. And the future taxation of the retiree drug subsidy. 
And it assumes that the extension of the R&D tax credit is retroactive to January 1 of 2010. If this credit is not extended our tax rate for the full year would be roughly 1 percentage point higher. 
Finally through the continued efforts of our engineering group to deliver needed capital projects more efficiently. We now expect capital expenditures for the year to total approximately $700 million. 
Also please note that we are in the process of evaluating whether or not the news on BYDUREON and teplizumab will result in any charge to the fourth quarter earnings. Our guidance does not explicatively include any such charges. 
On slide 14 we provide a reconciliation between the reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2009 and for our revised 2010 guidance. On an additional note, we will issue our 2011 guidance including updated estimates of the impact of US healthcare reforms and European pricing measures on our Q4 earnings call in late January of 2011.
Also we intend to update you on our medium term 2014 outlook and our net investment community meetings which we anticipate holding at the end of June of next year. 
Now let me turn the call over to Nick, who will share our quarterly pipeline update as well as additional details on US pattern challenges and an overview of our Japanese business. Nick?

Slide 15 demonstrates changes in our pipeline since our July 20 earnings call as of October 18. Our clinical stage portfolio stands at 68 distinct enemies including 28 compounds in Phase 2 and Phase 3. We remain focused on developing a robust biotic portfolio and biotic molecule now represent over half of our Phase 2 and Phase 3 assets and over 40% of our overall clinical portfolio. Advancing our pipeline remains our number one priority, since our last formal portfolio update we have advanced three assets into Phase 1, two oncology compound and one for nephropathy, promoted two assets into Phase 2 IMC-18F1 for cancer and a second asset for osteoporosis. 
And we begin Phase 3 trials of NERI IV as a adjunctive therapy to either accessorize and patients with major depressive disorder based on the results of two positive Phase 2 studies. Data from our Phase 2 augmentation trials will be presented in November at the international forum on mood and anxiety disorders in Vienna. In addition data from our Phase 2 monotherapy trial will be presented in December at the ACNP meeting in Miami.
As shown at the bottom of the slide we also terminated the development of one Phase 1 asset and two Phase 2 assets. And as mentioned earlier dosing will be suspended in Phase 3 trials for Teplizumab for Type 1 diabetes and we terminated Semagacestat from our Phase 3 pipeline. 
While the loss of Semagacestat was a disappoint in our Alzheimer's program, we are encouraged by the progress of our antibody solanezumab. This month the first Phase 3 clinical trial for solanezumab compeleted enrollments while the second study is over 80% enrolled. Assuming this trend continues we would anticipate completing the two 18-month studies in 2012. Also, while not currently shown in the Phase III, by early 2011 we will begin Phase III trials of our BAFF antibody for rheumatoid arthritis and for lupus. 
As mentioned earlier, the last three months have been busy from a legal perspective. I'll take the next few moments to provide some more details on the recent patent decisions and to highlight two upcoming cases. As you know, protection of intellectual property is critical to our business and it is the nature of our business that our patents will be challenged by generic manufacturers. 
Over the past three months, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the prior ruling by the US district court for the Eastern district of Michigan that Gemzar's method-of-use patent is invalid. We have requested a rehearing at the CAFC and are waiting to hear if that request will be granted. If the rehearing is denied or is unsuccessful, we will lose market exclusivity for Gemzar in the US as early as November 15, 2010 when the compound patent and its extensions expire. 
The US district court for the district of New Jersey ruled that the method-of-use patents for Strattera is invalid. The patents have been set to expire in May of 2017. We appealed this decision and the CAFC has scheduled a hearing on December 9, 2010. In addition, we're pleased that the CAFC granted an injunction that prevents the launch of generic versions of atomoxetine until a ruling is rendered. 
The CAFC also affirmed a prior ruling by the US district court for the Southern of Indiana that the company's method-of-use patents for Evista are valid. These patents provide protection for Evista in the US through March of 2014. The period for requesting an appeal has passed, however Teva can file a petition to the Supreme Court for review. 
In the months to come, we have two other patent challenges that will go to trial. Unlike the three cases I just discussed which involves method-of-use patents, these cases involve compound patents. First, three generic manufacturers have challenged the compound patent for Alimta. These cases have been consolidated and will be heard at the US District Court for the District of Delaware starting on November 8, 2010. We expect to prevail in this litigation and maintain US exclusivity at least through July 2016. 
Second, nine generic manufacturers have challenged the compound patent for Cymbalta. Lawsuits against all but one of these challengers have been stayed pending the outcome against the lone remaining challenger. The trial was currently scheduled to be heard at the US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana starting on June 6, 2011.
We also expect to prevail in this litigation and maintain US exclusivity for Cymbalta until June 2013 or December 2013 if we are successful in securing the six months pediatric extension. Again, we are confident of the validity of our patents that will continue to take every reasonable step to protect our intellectual property rights. Successfully defending valid patents is critical to Lilly and to all innovation based pharmaceutical companies as it provides the underpinning for investment and research and development to discover and bring the market new therapies that improved patient outcomes. 
In past quarters we've provided informational updates on specific marketed products, compounds and developments or business development deals to help you better understand the story behind our quarterly numbers. This time around, we'd like to highlight our Japanese human pharmaceutical business.
Along with emerging markets and animal health, Japan will provide substantial counter-cyclical growth as we experience patent explorations in the US and Europe on products like Zyprexa, Gemzar, Cymbalta and Evista. You may wonder what's going to drive significant growth of moving products during this period in Japan and establish in mature market. 
Historically, we've launched our products in Japan well after we've launched them in US and Europe where we have made great progress in accelerating development of our pipeline molecules to allow for more approximate launches in the US, Europe and Japan in the future. We are still working through this historical launch gap. As a result, we have a significant opportunity for growth over the next several years.
In 2009, we generated pharmaceutical sales of nearly $1.2 billion in Japan, representing growth of 28% over 2008 and making it the second largest market for Lilly behind United States. 
Growth continues to be very strong in 2010 with September year-to-date performance growth of 26%. As measured by IMS, we are far and away the fastest growing major pharmaceutical company in this important market growing at 29% versus market growth of only 1% for August year-to-date. This has allowed Lilly Japan to move up in ranking from number 23 to number 19 in the last two months.
Zyprexa is our biggest seller in the Japanese market, with over $300 million in sales and 8% performance growth year-to-date. This is an important opportunity for Lilly and one that should be bolstered by additional indications as we hope to receive approval for an indication in bipolar mania soon and we expect to submit an application for bipolar depression by year-end. 
It is important to note that while we loose the patent in Zyprexa in the US and Europe next year, we maintain exclusivity in Japan until December 2015. This should help drive what we hope to be a significant tail of Zyprexa sales post first 2011.
Alimta has demonstrated very impressive growth since its approval for non-small cell lung cancer in Q2 of last year. With the best share of market uptick in first by a nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer of any market in the world. This growth has made it our second best selling product in Japan with Alimta and Gemzar, which had breast cancer added to its label earlier this year, our oncology presence continues to grow impressively in the Japanese market. With our partners Shionogi, we are very pleased with the uptick for Cymbalta for major depressive disorder since our launch in Q2 of this year. 
In addition, our application for diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain indication is currently under regulatory review. Our insulin products continue to grow at double the market growth with Humalog mix showing strong share of market gains, picking up nine share points over the last two years. The momentum in Japan is continued recently including approvals for Strattera for ADHD in children last year and for FORTEO for osteoporosis in Q3 allowing the affiliate to launch the product in October 1 after having attainted a first time exemption from the 14-day prescription rule in Japan. 
In addition, we hope to receive approvals soon for BYETTA BID for Type 2 diabetes. Hopefully this provides you with some valuable insights for our Japanese business. We are confident our ability to continue on a strong growth trajectory in Japan and we expect Japan to contribute meaningfully to our corporate results in the coming years. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will open the call for the Q&A session. Operator, first caller please.

Lilly has been describing BYDUREON as its most important late-stage pipeline product. We had a delay recently; that comes on top of some other pipeline setbacks and some other negative news like some of the patent losses. I think that prevailing consensus among investors as they had given some of the big expirations that lay ahead of some point where we will likely have to do a larger acquisition that's on the gap. 
So John I'm wondering what you can share on this? Are all options on the table at this point and can you reconfirm what you said before which is that any business development that you do do won't jeopardize the dividend? And in as much as Lilly benchmarks against its peers in terms of strategy, is Lilly leaning more towards a Bristol-Myers type of approach, meaning a pure-play branded pharma company or like that company head down the path of diversification more like a GlaxoSmithKline or some of the other players?

First of all let me just comment, we are maintaining our commitment to our dividend, to paying our dividend at at least its current level. The recent events that you sight do not change our fundamental strategy, at the core of which is progression of molecules through our pipeline. We have still our eyes set on having at least 10 molecules in Phase 3 development at/or around the time that we lose our Zyprexa patent here in the US in late 2011. 
I think our fundamental strategy remains intact. We're not interested in large scale combinations. I think there are many other opportunities that I think we could consider along the lines of several that we've done already this year most recently, the Alnara acquisition, the acquisition of the Pfizer Wyeth divested animal health assets in Europe. 
As far as diversification goes, we like our animal health business. You saw us report 12% revenue growth for the quarter for Elanco. It's an area where we've shown a willingness to invest externally as well as to develop our companion animal business organically, and we're going to continue to focus on that.
As far as diversification goes, I think we are considering as of one of diversification are enhanced and increased focus on biotechnology, you heard today. I think 40% of our pipeline assets are biotech molecules and I think there is an element of geographic diversification here as well. When you can grow like we are growing in Japan, the second largest Pharma market in the world, I think that presents a nice offset. We have only about 10% of our sales today and what we classify as the emerging markets we see a tremendous opportunity to grow and expand largely with our existing product portfolio in the years ahead. So I think that remains our focus and not withstanding the setbacks, we are confident that we can execute on that strategy.

And so if you are looking at healthcare reform, the true effect and the underline effect in the third quarter was about $65 million. We did have a reversal of an accrual of about $40 million associated with the timing of the 340b expansion and when that would take effect. We had been assuming that it will be effective retroactive back to January 1st of this year, and in fact it is only going to taking effect as the hospitals themselves take on that declaration. So, that was the cause of $40 million reversal.

So just your view on that, what's changed, and your outlook for communications going for the agency? 
And secondly, I appreciate that companies continue commitment to the $2 billion annual dividend but based on our numbers just with the patent expirations and the setbacks in the pipeline which would have helped to still that somewhat, we are reflecting about a $4-5 billion hit on the revenue line between 2010 to 2015 and that's before Alimta goes the way in 2016. It seems that the only way to really offset that and maintain your annual $2 billion dividend is by announcing a much more significant headcount reduction or cost reduction program and/or what are we missing in terms of the top line? What are the products that give you confidence to drive the company sort of the next period 2015 and beyond?

I think the three examples you cite; I think you talked about Effient and Cymbalta and BYDUREON. They were all reviewed and looked at by different divisions within the FDA. There is a sort of a different storyline there for each one of these, I think as Enrique said earlier, we are committed to meeting the request that FDA is made around BYDUREON and hopefully getting this work done in a time that enables us to resubmit at the end of 2011.

And even at that time we still anticipated being able to both fund or finance the operations of our business including progress in the pipeline, as well as maintaining our dividend. And that was in what we consider to be the trough period.
To your point about what I think, meaning in the market maybe missing about Lilly, everyone obviously is focused on the certainty of the patents that we will lose, I think some of the growth opportunities that's not registering maybe in the investors line these days, are one, I will come back to those, I've touched a comment earlier. We've called that we do not lose the patent for as I touched in Japan until the end of 2015. So we still anticipate growth there. In most of the market outside of the US for Zyprexa, we have already lost in the major markets much of the plan for protection there. So, I think there is more of a tail to Zyprexa and people are giving it credit for.
Secondly, if you look at markets like Japan, we expected to double the size of that business over the next three to five years. If you look at the business Elanco which John touched on earlier, we also expect to double in the next three to five years. And then thirdly, if you look at our emerging market which grew 14% this quarter, we expect to double the size of that business as well. So yes, why we maybe losing revenue associated Zyprexa in the US as well as Cymbalta and Evista in the US, as well as the markets outside the US and some other business segments that we anticipate growing very robustly during that same period.

So what are you learning through this process and needing the guidance for 2014 going out to June sort of implies that you are going to be going fast to drawing board. I think that with the benefit of time site certainly we could look at BYDUREON and say maybe you took some shortcuts in the line extension strategy versus a new drug application strategy, and certainly with prasugrel, you got the product approved onto the market, but certainly it isn't commercially probably doing what you had hoped. So, can you just sort of talk to us about what we should be expecting. You are going to be looking at over the next six months and specifically what kind of changes if any you maybe making in R&D.

The portfolio the pipeline will be more indicative of what our growth prospectus looks like coming out of 2014 and I think that hands us to back to what John stated earlier that today we are sitting on approximately 68 molecules in clinical phase development. We anticipate having at least 10 molecules in Phase 3 development by the end of 2011 which we believe puts us in proximity to be able to again to launch products as we are coming out of the wising period. And then we turn into growth, when we think about our strategy there are some I guess to your point about how do you mitigate risk or how do you dampen the saw tooth nature of the business that we are in. I think there is a couple of factors one is the Elanco animal health business. It softens that. Secondly, we have some parts of our geographical business that's kind of cyclical to what you are seeing in the vize. And then thirdly, if you come back to just our biotech presence, the fact that roughly half of our portfolio is in biotech, little bit more than 40% half of our Phase 2 Phase 3 portfolio is biotech. 
So when I think about our fundamental business strategy I think its still intact, and yes we will continue to use our balance sheet and this is development opportunity to bridge gaps that maybe there, or to take advantage of emerging opportunities. But I feel very confident about what we are pursuing in terms of our strategy.

I want to thank everybody again for taking time this morning for this update on Eli Lilly & Co. We appreciate your continued interest in Lilly. 
Clearly, this is a challenging time for the company and the industry, but it's also we believe a time as I said earlier on the call a great opportunity. We continue to believe that our innovation-based strategy while not without risk will provide the greatest value to our shareholders and to society.
Clearly, we're not sitting here passively reacting to events as they occur, but we're acting with focus and purpose to achieve our goals to overcome upcoming patent losses and to return to growth. The consistent operational performance we've shared with you throughout this year are signs of progress and provide the wherewithal for us to meet our challenges. 
To date we've generated strong financial results with robust volume driven sales growth, continued leverage driven by cost containment and productivity efforts and strong operating cash flow. 
Thanks to the strong financial performance we've raised; our full year 2010 EPS guidance for the third time this year. We're seeing strong growth in our animal health business in emerging markets and in Japan as Nick commented. We were the fastest growing pharma company. 
Obviously the strong financial performance is the fuel for our innovation strategy and because we know the setbacks are part of our business, we've been working hard to increase our shops on goal. We now have 68 assets in human testing, 28 in Phases II and III including many with tremendous potential. Among them we have Phase III trials ongoing for 1121B, this is the ImClone molecule in breast and gastric cancer. We recently started another Phase III study in hepatocellular cancer would be starting more in the near future and we completed enrollment in our first Phase III trial for Solanezumab and the second is more than 80% enrolled.
Furthermore a major part of our recent restructuring was aimed at accelerating our pipeline flow and I am encouraged by what I am seeing. We've moved nearly 4 in to Phase III and we expect to begin Phase III trials by about any body for RA and lupus in early 2011. This molecule is the first of an emerging autoimmune portfolio that includes our IL-17 antibody and the [Jack-1/2] with our partners from inside. We also advanced three more assets into Phase I and two into Phase II this quarter. We are going to continue to focus on speeding innovation to patients and we remain on track to have at least 10 molecules in Phase III by the end of 2011 with more coming behind. We continue to bolster our near to medium term top line and earnings with targeted in licensing and acquisition. And we are prudently reducing our headcount and managing our expenses to enable us to invest in the pipeline and provide a robust return of cash to shareholders with the dividend. As always, we'll keep you informed of our progress. Thank you again for you interest in Lilly.

Welcome to Eli Lilly & Co.'s Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Phil Johnson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me this morning are John Lechleiter, our Chairman and CEO; Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Enrique Conterno, President of our Diabetes business; and Ronika Pletcher and Nick Lemen for Investor Relations.
During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors including those listed on Slide 3 and those outlined in our latest 10-K and 10-Q. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. 
Let's start with a few headlines for the quarter. On the operating front, we again delivered robust financial results, delivering EPS of $1.18 on a reported basis and of a $1.21 on a non-GAAP basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, we continued to see positive leverage between revenue and total costs. Our ongoing cost containment and productivity efforts allowed us to leverage 3% performance growth in revenue and a 7% performance growth in operating income.
On the revenue line, we saw strong performance growth in international markets for our Human Pharmaceuticals business and globally for our Animal Health business. As Derica will discuss later, revenue growth in our U.S. Human Pharmaceuticals business was negatively affected by wholesaler buying patterns, while the impact of foreign exchange on revenue turned negative for the first time this year.
Based on continued solid financial performance and a lower estimate for the cost of U.S. healthcare reform in 2010, we're raising our EPS guidance for the full year.
On the legal front, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or CAFC upheld the Michigan District Court ruling that our method-of-use patent for Gemzar is invalid. The U.S. District Court in New Jersey ruled that the method-of-use patent for Strattera is invalid. The CAFC will hear our appeal of this ruling in early December. The CAFC upheld the Indiana District Court ruling that Evista's method-of-use patents are valid, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that a class should not have been certified in a pending third-party payer suit on Zyprexa. The court further ruled that the plaintiff's overpricing claim should not go forward.
Later in the call, Nick will provide a more detailed update on these and other patent challenges.
In clinical and regulatory news, the FDA issued a complete response letter for Bydureon, requesting a thorough QT study and submission of the DURATION-5 study results. Pending discussions with the FDA, our goal is to reply to the complete response letter by the end of 2011.
An independent data monitoring committee for the Protege trial with teplizumab recently met and concluded at a primary efficacy endpoint a compositive patient's total daily insulin usage and HbA1C level at 12 months was not met. Administration of the study drug has been completed, and patients will be followed for safety information. Lilly and MacroGenics have decided to suspend enrollment in dosing in two other ongoing clinical trials. The companies are currently evaluating next steps. And we hope the development of semagacestat, our gamma-secretase inhibitor that was being studied in Phase III trials to treat patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
Finally, the FDA Anesthetic and Life Support Drugs Advisory Committee voted 8 to 6 in favor of expanding the pain indications for Cymbalta to a broader population to be further defined by the FDA. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Derica to discuss our Q3 financial results and our 2010 guidance in more detail. Derica?"

Consistent with prior calls, I'll focus my comments on our non-GAAP results, which we believe provide insights into the underlying trends in our business. This view excludes certain items such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and other special charges.
Now let's start on Slide 7 with a quick look at our Q3 non-GAAP income statement. At the top line, we generated revenue growth of 2% in the third quarter. This includes a negative impact of more than 1% from U.S. healthcare reform and European pricing actions that, in total, reduced Q3 revenue by roughly $65 million. This 2% growth is slower than what we've seen in the first half of the year, primarily due to wholesaler buying patterns in the U.S. and movements in foreign exchange. I'll provide more details in a moment when we review the price rate volume analysis.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue again came in at over 82%, an increase of 1.4 percentage points from Q3 2009. This increase was driven by manufacturing productivity improvement and by the favorable impact of price increases. This quarter's operating expenses, which we defined as the sum of R&D and SG&A, grew by 3%, slightly more than the 2% revenue growth. Operating expense growth was driven by a charge of approximately $80 million that was booked to R&D expense as a result of the termination of development of semagacestat. R&D expense grew 9% in the quarter due in large part to this charge.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses, on the other hand, were flat compared to last year, driven by lower administrative expenses and our ongoing cost containment efforts. Now as a result of the improvement in the gross margin percent, we were able to leverage 2% revenue growth into 4% operating income growth.
Now moving down the income statement, you will see that other income improved by $45 million due largely to an insurance recovery and lower net interest expense. In addition, our tax rate increased by 3.5 percentage points due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit this year, as well as the benefit realized in last year's quarter related to a cumulative adjustment in the forecasted effective tax rate for the full year of 2009 and to the resolution of the company's 2001 to 2004 tax audit.
Now as a consequence of this higher tax rate, growth in net income and EPS lagged as seen in revenue and operating income. Specifically, net income and earnings per share grew 2% and 1%, respectively.
Now Slide 8 shows our reported income statement, while Slide 9 provides a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS. Additional details about our reported earnings are available in today's earnings press release.
Now let's look at how foreign exchange affected our Q3 results, and we'll start with revenue. At the bottom of Slide 10, you'll see the 2% revenue growth I mentioned earlier. Now, this growth is driven by a favorable price impact of 3%, which was partially offset by a negative effect from foreign exchange of 1%, while volume growth was essentially flat. So in performance terms, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, revenue grew 3% in the quarter.
Clearly, the overall growth rate of revenue is below what we've seen in both Q1 and Q2 earlier this year. The biggest changes are in exchange rate and volume. In terms of rate, Q3 is the first quarter this year that FX has had a negative effect on revenue. The primary drivers of this reversal are the weakening of the euro versus last year and a number of other international currencies, only partially offset by a stronger yen.
In terms of volume, the biggest changes in the U.S. where we went from having low single-digit volume increases in Q1 and in Q2 to a 6% volume decrease this quarter. Now of that 6% decrease, four percentage points of this decrease were driven by changes in wholesaler inventory levels, which increased in Q3 last year while they were decreasing in Q3 of this year. Now, these fluctuations were within normal contractual limits.
We continue to see robust volume growth in our Animal Health business, which was up 13%; and in Japan, where volume was up 18%. We also registered volume growth of between 15% and 21% in a number of other international markets including China, Mexico, Australia, Korea and Turkey. In total, our Emerging Markets business posted 14% volume growth in the third quarter.
Now, Slide 11 shows the year-on-year growth of select line items of our non-GAAP income statement, both with and without the effect of changes in foreign currency rate. The numbers in the first column are the same as you saw in the last column on Slide 7. I'll focus my comments on the second column of numbers, which strips out the effect of foreign exchange rate.
First, you'll see a 3% growth in revenue. Below that, you'll see that the cost of sales actually declined 7%, driven by our continued efforts to improve productivity and reduce cost. In total, operating expenses grew slightly faster than revenue, showing growth of 4%. Operating expense growth rising above that revenue is due to the R&D charge incurred for the termination of the development of semagacestat.
In total, we held the growth in our total expenses being manufacturing, SG&A and R&D below the revenue growth rate, which allowed us to leverage 3% performance growth in revenue and to 7% performance growth in operating income. Again, EPS growth of 5% in performance terms was negatively affected by the increase in the effective tax rate. And finally, as shown in the last column, you'll see similar leverage in our year-to-date results, excluding the effect of FX.
Now for your information, on Slide 12, we provided the year-on-year growth of select line items of our reported income statement, once again, both with and without the effect of foreign exchange rate.
Now, let me wrap up my comments with our 2010 financial guidance. As Phil mentioned earlier, our continued strong financial performance, including prudent management of expenses and a lower estimate of the 2010 revenue impact of U.S. healthcare reform, has positioned us to raise our previously issued 2010 earnings per share guidance. We're moving up from a range of $4.50 to $4.65 to a new range of $4.65 to $4.75 on a non-GAAP basis. Now, this corresponds to a range of $4.55 to $4.65 on a reported basis.
In terms of line item guidance, we now expect total revenue to grow in the mid-single digit. This guidance contemplates the potential introduction of generic gemcitabine in mid-November, and it assumes no generic atomoxetine and incorporates the revised 2010 cost estimates for U.S. healthcare reform.
As we outlined in our press release, we now anticipate that U.S. healthcare reform will reduce our 2010 revenue by between $225 million to $275 million.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue for the year is still expected to be flat to increasing, and we continue to expect improvement excluding the effect of FX on international inventories sold.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are still projected to grow in the low-single digits, and growth in research and development expenses is still expected to be in the low-double digits.
Our forecast for other income has changed slightly to a net deduction of between zero and $50 million. The effective tax rate for the full year is still expected to be approximately 23%. This includes the $85 million tax charge booked earlier this year related to U.S. healthcare reform and the future taxation of the retiree drug subsidy, and it assumes that the extension of the R&D tax credit is retroactive to January 1, 2010. If this credit is not extended, our tax rate for the full year would be roughly one percentage point higher.
Finally, through the continued efforts of our engineering group to deliver needed capital projects more efficiently, we now expect capital expenditures for the year to total approximately $700 million.
Also, please note that we are in the process of evaluating whether or not the news on Bydureon and teplizumab will result in any charge to the fourth quarter earnings. Our guidance does not explicitly include any such charges.
On Slide 14, we provide a reconciliation between reported and non-GAAP EPS for 2009 and for our revised 2010 guidance.
On an additional note, we will issue our 2011 guidance, including updated estimates of the impact of U.S. healthcare reform and European pricing measures, on our Q4 earnings call in late January of 2011. Also, we intend to update you on our medium-term 2014 outlook at our next investment community meeting, which we anticipate holding at the end of June of next year.
Now let me turn the call over to Nick, who will share our quarterly pipeline update, as well as additional details on U.S. patent challenges and an overview of our Japanese business. Nick?"

Slide 15 demonstrates changes in our pipeline since our July 20 earnings call as of October 18. Our clinical stage portfolio stands at 68 distinct NMEs, including 28 compounds in Phase II and Phase III. We remain focused on developing a robust biotech portfolio, and biotech molecule now represent over half of our Phase II and Phase III assets and over 40% of our overall clinical portfolio. Advancing our pipeline remains our number one priority. 
Since our last formal portfolio update, we have advanced three assets into Phase I, two oncology compounds and one for nephropathy, promoted two assets into Phase II, IMC-18F1 for cancer and a second asset for osteoporosis. And we began Phase III trials of NERI IV as an adjunctive therapy to SSRIs and patients with major depressive disorder based on the results of two positive Phase II studies. Data from our Phase II augmentation trial will be presented in November at the international forum on mood and anxiety disorders in Vienna. In addition, data from our Phase II monotherapy trial will be presented in December at the ACNP meeting in Miami.
As shown at the bottom of the slide, we also terminated the development of one Phase I asset and two Phase II assets. And as mentioned earlier, dosing will be suspended in Phase III trials of teplizumab for Type 1 diabetes, and we terminated semagacestat from our Phase III pipeline.
While the loss of semagacestat was a disappointment in our Alzheimer's program, we're encouraged by the progress of our A-beta antibody, solanezumab. This month, the first Phase III clinical trial for solanezumab completed enrollment, while the second study is over 80% enrolled. Assuming this trend continues, we would anticipate completing the two 18-month studies in 2012.
Also, while not currently shown in the Phase III, by early 2011, we will begin Phase III trials of our BAFF antibody for rheumatoid arthritis and for lupus.
As mentioned earlier, the last three months have been busy from a legal perspective. I'll take the next few moments to provide some more details on the recent patent decisions and to highlight two upcoming cases.
As you know, protection of intellectual property is critical to our business, and it is the nature of our business that our patents will be challenged by generic manufacturers. Over the past three months, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the prior ruling by the U.S. District Court from the Eastern District of Michigan that Gemzar's method-of-use patent is invalid. We have requested a rehearing at the CAFC and are waiting to hear if that request will be granted. If the rehearing is denied or isn't successful, we will lose market exclusivity for Gemzar in the U.S. as early as November 15, 2010, when the compound patented and its extensions expire.
The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey ruled that the method-of-use patent for Strattera is invalid. The patent had been set to expire in May of 2017. We appealed this decision, and the CAFC has scheduled a hearing on December 9, 2010. In addition, we're pleased that the CAFC granted an injunction that prevents the launch of generic versions of atomoxetine until the ruling is rendered.
The CAFC also affirmed a prior ruling by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana that the company's method-of-use patents for Evista are valid. These patents provide protection for Evista in the U.S. through March of 2014. The period for requesting an appeal has passed. However, Teva can file a petition to the Supreme Court for review.
In the months to come, we have two other patent challenges that will go to trial. Unlike the three cases I just discussed, which involve method-of-use patents, these cases involve compound patents. First, three generic manufacturers have challenged the compound patent for Alimta. These cases have been consolidated and will be heard at the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware starting on November 8, 2010. We expect to prevail in this litigation and maintain U.S. exclusivity, at least through July 2016.
Second, nine generic manufacturers have challenged a compound patent for Cymbalta. Lawsuits against all but one of these challengers have been stayed pending the outcome against the lone remaining challenger. The trial is currently scheduled to be heard at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana starting on June 6, 2011. We also expect to prevail in this litigation and maintain U.S. exclusivity for Cymbalta until June 2013 or December 2013, if we are successful in securing the six-month pediatric extension.
Again, we are confident in the validity of our patents, and we'll continue to take every reasonable step to protect our intellectual property rights. Successfully defending valid patents is critical to Lilly and to all innovation-based pharmaceutical companies as it provides the underpinning for investment and research and development to discover and bring to market new therapies that improve patient outcomes.
In past quarters, we provided informational updates on specific marketed products, compounds in development or business development deals to help you better understand the story behind our quarterly numbers. This time around, we'd like to highlight our Japanese Human Pharmaceutical business.
Along with emerging markets in Animal Health, Japan will provide substantial counter-cyclical growth as we experience patent expirations in the U.S. and Europe on products like Zyprexa, Gemzar, Cymbalta and Evista. You may wonder what's going to drive significant growth of Lilly products during this period in Japan, an established and mature market. Historically, we've launched our products in Japan well after we've launched them in the U.S. and Europe. While we've made great progress in accelerating development of our pipeline molecules to allow for more proximate launches in the U.S., Europe and Japan in the future, we are still working through this historical launch gap. As a result, we have a significant opportunity for growth over the next several years.
In 2009, we generated pharmaceutical sales of nearly $1.2 billion in Japan, representing growth of 28% over 2008 and making it the second-largest market for Lilly behind the United States. Growth continues to be very strong in 2010, with September year-to-date performance growth of 26%. As measured by IMS, we are far and away the fastest-growing major pharmaceutical company in this important market, growing at 29% versus market growth of only 1% for August year-to-date. This has allowed Lilly Japan to move up in ranking from number 23 to number 19 in the last two months.
Zyprexa is our biggest seller in the Japanese market, with over $300 million in sales and 8% performance growth year-to-date. This is an important opportunity for Lilly and one that should be bolstered by additional indications as we hope to receive approval for an indication in bipolar mania soon, and we expect to submit an application for bipolar depression by year end. It is important to note that while we lose the patent on Zyprexa in the U.S. and Europe next year, we maintain exclusivity in Japan until December 2015. This should help drive what we hope to be a significant tale of Zyprexa sales post-2011.
Alimta has demonstrated very impressive growth since its approval for non-small cell lung cancer in Q2 of last year with the best share of market uptake in first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer of any market in the world. This growth has made it our second best-selling product in Japan. With Alimta and Gemzar, which had breast cancer added to its label earlier this year, our oncology presence continues to grow impressively in the Japanese market.
With our partner, Shionogi, we are very pleased with the uptake for Cymbalta for major depressive disorder since our launch in Q2 of this year. In addition, our application for diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain indication is currently under regulatory review.
Our insulin products continue to grow at double the market growth, with Humalog mix showing strong share of market gains, picking up nine share points over the last two years. The momentum in Japan has continued recently, including approvals for Strattera for ADHD in children last year; and for FORTEO for osteoporosis in Q3, allowing the affiliate to launch the products in October 1 after having obtained a first-time exception from the 14-day prescription rule in Japan.
In addition, we hope to receive approval soon for Byetta BID for Type 2 diabetes. Hopefully, this provides you with some valuable insights to our Japanese business. We are confident in our ability to continue on a strong growth trajectory in Japan, and we expect Japan to contribute meaningfully to our corporate results in the coming years.

We had the delay recently, that comes on top of some other pipeline setbacks and some other negative news like some of the patent losses. I think the prevailing consensus among investors is that given some of the big expirations that lay ahead, at some point, Lilly will likely have to do a larger acquisition to fill in the gaps. For John, I'm wondering what you can share on this. Are all options on the table at this point? And can you reconfirm what you said before, which is that any business development that you do, won't jeopardize the dividend? And in as much as Lilly benchmarks against its peers in terms of strategy, is Lilly leaning more towards a Bristol-Myers-type of approach, meaning a pure plate branded pharma company, or might that company head down the path of diversification more like a GlaxoSmithKline or some of the other players?"

The recent events that you cite do not change our fundamental strategy, the core of which is progression of molecules through our pipeline. We have still our eyes set on having at least 10 molecules in Phase III development at or around the time that we lose our Zyprexa patent here in the U.S. in late 2011. I think our fundamental strategy remains intact. We're not interested in large-scale combinations. I think there are many other opportunities that I think we could consider along the lines of several that we've done already this year. Most recently the Alnara acquisition, the acquisition of the Pfizer-Wyeth divested Animal Health assets in Europe. As far as diversification goes, we like our Animal Health business. You saw us report 12% revenue growth for the quarter for Elanco. It's an area where we've shown a willingness to invest externally, as well as to develop our Companion Animal business organically, and we're going to continue to focus on that. As far as diversification goes, I think we're considering as a form of diversification our enhanced and increased focus on biotechnology. You heard today, I think, 40% of our pipeline assets are biotech molecules, and I think there's an element of geographic diversification here as well. When you can grow like we're growing in Japan, the second largest pharma market in the world, I think that presents a nice offset. We have only about 10% of our sales today in what we classify as the emerging markets. We see a tremendous opportunity to grow and expand there, largely with our existing product portfolio in the years ahead. So yeah, I think that remains our focus, and notwithstanding the setbacks, we're confident that we can execute on that strategy."

Maybe you could share with us your views on what you see as a change in the fundamental communications between the industry and the FDA. Because clearly, Lilly has been subjected now to what seems to be several communications breakdowns, both with Effient and the multiple complete response letters, the pain indication for Cymbalta, and now Bydureon as my understanding is the first complete response letter did not include any request for QTC issue. So just your view on that, what's changed and your outlook for communications going forward at the agency. And secondly, I appreciate the company's continued commitment to the $2 billion annual dividend. But based on our numbers, just with the patent expirations and the setbacks in the pipeline, which would've helped to fill that somewhat, we're reflecting about a $4 billion to $5 billion hit on the revenue line between 2010 to 2015, and that's before Alimta goes away in 2016. It seems the only way to really offset that and maintain your annual $2 billion dividend is by announcing a much more significant headcount reduction or cost reduction program. And/or what are we missing in terms of the top line? What are the products that give you confidence to drive the company sort of the next period 2015 and beyond?"

Well, I think there's no doubt that FDA is scrutinizing drug applications like never before. I think there is a -- this has been a tougher journey for many companies in the industry as FDA, I think, tries to strike what it believes to be the right balance between making new medicines available and ensuring safety. I think the three examples you cite, I think you talked about Effient and then Cymbalta and Bydureon, they're all reviewed and looked at by different divisions within the FDA. There is a sort of a different storyline there for each one of these. I think as Enrique said earlier, we're committed to meeting the request that FDA has made around Bydureon and hopefully getting this work done in a time that enables us to resubmit at the end of 2011. We were pleased with the outcome of the Advisory Committee for Cymbalta in August, and we continue to work with the agency toward what we hope will be an approval for a new indication for Cymbalta in the area of chronic pain.

When we presented the 2014 construct in December of last year, we said at that time that we anticipate 2014 being a trough period for Eli Lilly in terms of this given patent expirations. And even at that time, we still anticipated being able to both fund or finance the operations of our business, including progressing the pipeline, as well as maintaining our dividend. And that was in what we consider to be the trough period. To your point about what I think many in the market may be missing about Lilly, everyone obviously is focused on the certainty of the patents that we will lose. I think some of the growth opportunities that's not registering maybe in the investor's mind these days are one, I'll come back to the Zyprexa comment earlier. Recall that we do not lose the patent for Zyprexa in Japan until the end of 2015, so we still anticipate growth there. In most of the markets outside of the U.S. for Zyprexa, we've already lost in the major markets much of the patent protection there. So I think there's more of a tail to Zyprexa than people are giving it credit for. Secondly, if you look at markets like Japan, we expect to double the size of that business over the next three to five years. If you look at the market business Elanco, which John touched on earlier, we also expect to double in the next three to five years. And then thirdly, if you look at our emerging markets, which grew 14% this quarter, we expect to double the size of that business as well. So yes, while we may be losing revenue associated with Zyprexa in the U.S, as well as Cymbalta and Evista in the U.S., there are some markets outside the U.S. and some other business segments that we anticipate growing very robustly during that same period."

I think that probably a lot of your competitors would say that they're doing the same thing. But in the context of an environment that seems to be fraught with increased risk, they're doing a lot of other things to sort of move that risk for their shareholders, and I think that given the recent performance from the pipeline of Lilly, sort of one of the frustrations. So what are you learning through this process? And the guidance for 2014 going out to June sort of implies that you're going to be going back to the drawing board. So I think that with the benefit of hindsight, certainly, we could look at Bydureon and say maybe you took some shortcuts in the line extension strategy versus a new drug application strategy. And certainly with, prasugrel, you got the product approved onto the market. But certainly, it isn't commercially probably doing what you had hoped. So can you just sort of talk to us about what we should be expecting you're going to be looking at over the next six months, and specifically, what kinds of changes, if any, you might be making in R&D?"

I'll take the first stab at it, and if anyone else has anything you want to add to it, feel free to chime in. But I guess I'm not as negative as maybe some of your commentary may indicate in terms of the outlook of our business. I want to remind the investment community once again, we still anticipate 2014 being a trough. And as I indicated earlier, what gets us between today and 2014, the driver to that is primarily our ongoing trends of our currently marketed products, as well as our cost containment efforts. The portfolio, the pipeline will be more indicative of what our growth prospects look like coming out of 2014. And I think that hinges back to what John stated earlier that today we're sitting on approximately 68 molecules in clinical stage development. We still anticipate having at least 10 molecules in Phase III development by the end of 2011, which we believe puts us in proximity to be able to begin to launch products as we're coming out of the Y-Z period and then returning to growth. When you think about our strategy, there are some, I guess, to your point about how do you mitigate risk or how do you dampen the sawtooth nature of the business that we're in? I think there's a couple of factors, one is the Elanco Animal Health business, it softens that. Secondly, we have some parts of our geographical business that's counter-cyclical to what you're seeing in the Y-Z. And then thirdly, if you come back to just biotech presence, the fact that roughly half of our portfolio is in biotech or a little bit more than 40%, half of our Phase II, Phase III portfolio is biotech. So when I think about our fundamental business strategy, I think it's still intact. And yes, we will continue to use our balance sheet and business development opportunities to bridge gaps that maybe there or to take advantage of emerging opportunities. But I still feel very confident about what we are pursuing in terms of our strategy."

I want to thank everybody again for taking time this morning for this update on Eli Lilly & Co. We appreciate your continued interest in Lilly. Clearly, this is a challenging time for the company and the industry, but it's also, we believe, a time, as I said earlier on the call, of great opportunity. We continue to believe that our innovation-based strategy, while not without risk, will provide the greatest value to our shareholders and to society.
Clearly, we're not sitting here passively reacting to events as they occur, but we're acting with focus and purpose to achieve our goals, to overcome upcoming patent losses and to return to growth. The consistent operational performance we've shared with you throughout this year are signs of progress and provide the wherewithal for us to meet our challenges. To date, we generated strong financial results with robust, volume-driven sales growth, continued leverage driven by cost containment and productivity efforts, and strong operating cash flow.
Thanks to the strong financial performance we've raised, our full year 2010 EPS guidance for the third time this year, we're seeing small growth in our Animal Health business and emerging markets and in Japan, as Nick commented, where we're the fastest-growing pharma company. Obviously, the strong financial performance is the fuel for our innovation strategy.
And because we know that setbacks are part of our business, we've been working hard to increase our shops on goal. We now have 68 assets in human testing, 28 in Phases II and III, including many with tremendous potential. Among them, we have Phase III trials ongoing for 1121B. This is the ImClone molecule in breast and gastric cancer. We recently started another Phase III study, in hepatocellular cancer, we'll be starting more in the near future. And we completed enrollment in our first Phase III trial for solanezumab, and the second is more than 80% enrolled.
Furthermore, a major part of our recent restructuring was aimed at accelerating our pipeline flow, and I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing. We've moved nearly four into Phase III, and we expect to begin Phase III trials of our BAFF antibody for RA and for lupus in early 2011. This molecule is the first of an emerging autoimmune portfolio that includes our IL-17 antibody and the JAK1/JAK2 with our partners from Incyte. We also advanced three more assets into Phase I and two into Phase II this quarter. We're going to continue to focus on speeding innovation to patients, and we remain on track to have at least 10 molecules in Phase III by the end of 2011 with more coming behind.
We continue to bolster our near to medium-term top line and earnings with targeted in licensing and acquisitions, and we are prudently reducing our headcount and managing our expenses to enable us to invest in the pipeline and provide a robust return of cash to shareholders with the dividend. As always, we'll keep you informed of our progress. Thank you again for your interest in Lilly."
