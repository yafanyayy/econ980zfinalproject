Welcome to our Fourth Quarter Conference Call. I would like to review key achievements of 2009 and provide some guidance for 2010.

I would like to review key achievements of 2009 and provide some guidance for 2010. Greg Hill will then discuss our Exploration and Production business, and John Rielly will review our financial results. Corporate net income for the full year 2009 was $740 million. Exploration and Production earned $1.04 billion, and Marketing and Refining earned $127 million. While our earnings were down versus the previous year, our results reflected strong financial performance, increasing crude low prices throughout 2009 and successful cost reduction efforts.In terms of our 2010 capital and exploratory program, we are revising our budget to $4.1 billion from $3.9 billion. This increase of $200 million is the result of the strategic asset trade with Shell announced in December, in which we will assume Shell's interest in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway in exchange for Hess' interest in the Clair field in the United Kingdom and all of Hess's interest in Gabon. The transaction is anticipated to close in the first quarter and be effective January 1, 2010.As another step to improve our portfolio, we completed the sale earlier this month of our interest in Jambi Merang in Indonesia receiving proceeds of $180 million. As in previous years, substantially all of our 2010 spending will be targeted to exploration and production with $2.4 billion budgeted for production operations, $800 million for developments and $850 million for exploration.With regard to exploration and production, in 2009, we replaced 103% of production at an FD&A cost of about $20 per barrel of oil equivalent. At year end, our approved reserves stood at $1.44 billion barrels of oil equivalent and our reserve life was 9.5 years.In 2009, we increased crude oil and natural gas production 7% to 408,000 barrel equivalent of oil equivalent per day. In 2010, we forecast that crude oil and natural gas production will average between 400,000 and 410,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This forecast includes a net reduction of about 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day resulting from the strategic asset trade with Shell. With regard to developments, the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in which Hess has a 30% interest, commence production in March and achieved a net rate of about $40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the second half of 2009.We also sanctioned our Bakken Shale development in North Dakota. We plan to build up to a 10-rate program our next 18 months and invest about $1 billion per year over the next five years. As a result, we expect net production to increase from 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day currently to 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. In exploration we have continued success at 100%-owned, WA-390-P block at offshore Australia, where in 2009 we drilled seven was, six of which were natural gas discoveries. In Libya, we successfully flow tested the A1 discovery well on our 100% owned Area 54 license, and subsequently drilled and successfully flow tested it down to appraisal well.With regard to Marketing and Refining, our full-year 2009 financial results were lower than 2008, as the weak economy continue to have a negative impact on our business. Our HOVENSA joint venture refinery experienced losses as a result of significantly lower distillate crack spreads and narrower light-heavy crude low differentials.In retail marketing, our financial results were adversely affected by lower gasoline volumes, which were 3% in the last year and weaker margins, partially offset by higher convenience sources which were up nearly 11% from last year. In Energy Marketing, we generated stronger financial results, and increased sales of fuel oil and electricity.In 2009, we maintained a strong financial position in the face of a difficult economic environment. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio at the year end was 24.8%, a slight increase over 2008. Our liquidity was enhanced by the February 2009 issuance of $1 billion of 10-year notes and $250 million of five-year notes to reduce short-term debt. Also in the fourth quarter of 2009, we refinanced notes due in 2011 by issuing $750 million of 30-year bonds.We are pleased with our performance during 2009, despite a challenging and volatile year. We remain committed to our strategy of investing to profitably grow our reserves and production on a sustainable basis. We are extremely excited about our future investment opportunities which we believe will create long-term value for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill."

In 2009, crude oil and natural gas production averaged 408,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was up 7% versus 2008. Production growth was underpinned by strong performance from the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, a full-year Phase II natural gas sales for the Malaysia-Thailand joint development area, and overall solid operating performance. In 2009, we had improved reserves of 157 million barrels of oil equivalent at an FD&A cost of about $20 per barrel of oil equivalent, yielding a replacement ratio of 103% and an R/P ratio of 9.5, a good result considering the capital spending reductions we made and our strong production growth in 2009. Including this year's results, our five-year average reserve replacement ratio is 162%, and our average FD&A cost is about $16 per barrel of oil equivalent. In December, we announced a strategic asset trade with Shell that provides us with an opportunity to consolidate our portfolio and double our interest in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway, which are long-lived producing assets with significant reserves and upside potential, which will further support our long-term objective of profitably growing our reserves and production.Turning to our capital program for 2010, we plan to invest nearly $1 billion in the Bakken Oil Plant in North Dakota, where we hold more than 500,000 net acres. We expect our average rig count to increase from three in 2009 to 10 in 2011. At Pony in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we plan to drill an additional appraisal well and anticipate unitization of Pony and Knotty Head in 2010, followed by a project sanction in 2011. The remainder of our capital program will focus on continued investment in a number of our core assets, including Shenzi, fields redevelopment at Valhall, an additional development drilling in Equatorial Guinea, the Malaysia-Thailand JDA and Pengka in Indonesia. Turning to exploration, in Australia, as a result of the 2009 drilling program on a 100% owned Western Australia 390-P license, we have now drilled 11 of the 16 commitment wells on the block and have had nine discoveries. We plan to drill additional five commitment wells during the first half of 2010, and are considering further appraisal wells. At the same time, we are continuing discussions regarding commercialization. Also at the Western Australia 404-P license, in  which half of the 50% interest, the operator, Woodside, will drill eight wells during 2010. Earlier this week, the operator announced that the first of these wells, Noblige-1 resulted in a natural gas discovery. By the end of the year, we should therefore have a much clearer picture of the future development options in Australia.In Libya, we have completed operations on two wells on our 100%-owned Area 54 license. In 2010, we will reprocess 3D seismic and begin discussions with the government about future plans and commercial options. In Brazil, we completed two wells, obtained 450 feet of core, and gathered a large amount of log and pressure data on the BM-S-22 license, in which Hess has a 40% interest. In 2010, the partnership will use this data to reprocess 3D seismic and drill a third well in the second half.In both Ghana and Sumai five [ph] in Indonesia, we continue to technically mature our 100% owned prospects during 2009, and expect to be in a position to drill in late 2010 or early 2011. Finally, in unconventional resources, we continue to selectively grow our position with the acquisition of 80,000 net acres in the Marcellus in 2009. In 2010, we will begin evaluation drilling and seek to acquire additional acreage. In closing, I'm very pleased with the performance of EP in 2009. We successfully navigated difficult business conditions in the early part of the year through tight spending controls and strong operating performance. We also continue to advance our portfolio of material exploration opportunities and strengthened our growth options for the future. Thank you. Now I'll hand the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare fourth quarter 2009 results to the third quarter. Fourth quarter 2009 consolidated results amounted to net income of $358 million, compared with $341 million in the third quarter.Turnin",1011,"Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare fourth quarter 2009 results to the third quarter. Fourth quarter 2009 consolidated results amounted to net income of $358 million, compared with $341 million in the third quarter.Turning to Exploration and Production, Exploration and Production operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 had income of $494 million compared with $397 million in the third quarter. The third quarter included after-tax income of $89 million relating to the resolution of a royalty dispute on production from certain leases subject to the U.S. Deep Water Royalty Relief Act. Excluding the effect of the royalty matter, the after-tax components of the improved results are as follows: Higher selling prices increased earnings by $151 million, higher sales volumes increased earnings by $49 million all other items net to a decrease in earnings of $14 million, for an overall increase in fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $186 million.In the fourth quarter of 2009, our E&P operations were over-lifted compared with production, which increased after-tax income by approximately $40 million. However, earnings were lower in the fourth quarter by $20 million, due to deliveries of natural gas to partially settle take-or-pay operations at the JDA [Malaysia Thailand Joint Development Area] for volumes previously paid four by the buyers at the lower price. The E&P effective income tax rate was 47% for the fourth quarter of 2009. The E&P effective income tax rate was 48% the full year of 2009, excluding items affecting comparability between periods. Turning to Marketing and Refining, Marketing and Refining operations had income of $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with income of $38 million in the third quarter, which included a non-recurring income tax benefit of $12 million. Refining operations lost $40 million in the fourth quarter compared with a loss of $15 million in the third quarter, excluding the non-recurring income tax benefit. The corporation share of HOVENSA's results after income taxes was a loss of $40 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $30 million in the third quarter, primarily reflecting lower margins. Port Reading broke even in the fourth quarter, compared with earnings of $16 million in the third quarter.Marketing earnings were $45 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $35 million in the third quarter, principally reflecting seasonally higher margins and refined product volumes in energy marketing operations. Trading activities generated income of $12 million in the fourth quarter, compared with income of $6 million in the third quarter.Turning to our bond offering and tender, in December 2009, the corporation issued $750 million of new 30-year bonds at a coupon of 6% and tendered for the $662 million of bonds due in August 2011. The corporation completed the repurchase of $546 million of 2011 bonds as of December 31. The remaining $116 million of bonds were redeemed in January and will result in an after-tax charge of approximately $7 million in the first quarter of 2010.Turning to Corporate, net Corporate expenses amounted to $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $33 million in the third quarter. Net corporate expenses in the fourth quarter included after-tax charges of $34 million for the repurchase of the $546 million of 2011 bonds referred to earlier, and $10 million for pension plan settlements related to employee retirements. Excluding the effect of these two items, net corporate expenses increased in the fourth quarter due to higher bank facility fees, employee-related expenses, insurance costs and lower returns from pension-related investments. For the full year 2009, net corporate expenses were $145 million, excluding items affecting comparability. After-tax interest expense was $56 million in the fourth quarter compared with $61 million in the third quarter. For the full year of 2009, after-tax interest expense was $224 million. Turning to cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter, including an increase of $256 million from changes in working capital, was $1,271,000,000. Net proceeds from the bond offering were $744 million. Repayments of debt amounted to $656 million. Capital expenditures were $925 million, all other items amounted to a decrease in cash flow of $29 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the fourth quarter of $405 million.We had $1,362,000,000 of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2009, and $908 million at December 31, 2008. Our available revolving credit capacity was $3 billion at December 31, 2009. Total debt was $4,467,000,000 at December 31, 2009, and $3,955,000,000 at December 31, 2008. The corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio at December 31, 2009, was 24.8% compared with 24.2% at the end of 2008. Now turning to 2010 guidance, in addition to the 2010 production and capital expenditure guidance given by John Hess, I would like to provide further information on certain 2010 financial metrics. Our E&P cash operating costs are expected to be in the range of $15 to $16 barrel oil equivalent produced. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges are expected to be in the range of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel for a total production unit cost of $29.50 to $31.50 per barrel of oil equivalent produced. For the full year of 2010, we currently expect our E&P effective tax rate to be in the range of 47% to 51%.In January 2010, HOVENSA commenced a turnaround of its FCC [fluid catalytic cracking] unit, which is expected to take approximately 40 days. The Corporation's estimated share after income taxes of HOVENSA's turnaround expenses is approximately $20 million. The Corporation is also planning a turnaround of approximately 35 days for the Port Reading refining facility in the second quarter 2010. The estimated after-tax expenses for the Port Reading turnaround are approximately $25 million.Net corporate expenses in 2010 are estimated to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million, and after-tax interest expense in 2010 is anticipated to be in the range of $220 million to $230 million. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

Of course, what happened in 2009, the oil price shock in the early part of the year, we were actually well advanced in our thinking in the Bakken in late 2008 and we actually put the brakes on a bit in 2009, just to wait and see where the oil price was actually going to go. That actually gave us some breathing space to really get all of our plans together, figure out our contracting strategy, et cetera. And so really over the course of 2009, that's what we did. We finalized our thinking. We finalized our contracting strategy and then at the end of the year, took sanction on that project. So nothing's really changed and I'm thinking about the Bakken, it was just a timing thing related to the oil price shock in early 2009. Again, I'd like to remind everyone, the Bakken is robust at $40. It returns the cost to capital at $40.

In the Bakken, and our cost are very competitive, we benchmark our drilling time and our cost there. So our cost are very competitive. But when you're in the Bakken and we're in a growth mode, as Greg said as we're ramping up to 10 rigs, the amount of drilling activity there, it's fairly intensive at this point. And the overall cash costs in the Bakken are higher than our average of our portfolio. So at this point in time, actually the Bakken is one of the reasons that our overall cash costs in our portfolio are growing up. Now as Greg said, the returns are very good. We like the returns in the Bakken and obviously, we like being in the U.S. in the Shale play and the lower risk. But if you're looking at the one line from the cash cost standpoint, the Bakken does have an average production cost higher than our portfolio."

When we had the analyst meeting, we were definitely in the investment mode to grow our reserves, with the ultimate objective of getting to a reserve production life of 10, which we reached last year, and we're close to in terms of where we were at the year end. Our targets going forward, as you're well aware, over the last year or so, have evolved to where on a sustainable basis, to optimize financial returns, to set a 3% growth target per year for reserves and a 3% production target as well on an annual basis. Now that's really to be looked at, because you know the E&P business being so capital intensive and lumpy in the timing of developments. It's over the longer term. Year in, year out, like last year we were over 7%, now to 3%, 2010 closer to flat on production. But our long-term targets, meaning a five-year rolling average, we still aspire to and certainly feel that we have captured the opportunities in our portfolio of Exploration and Developments and production investments to deliver 3% a year reserve growth and 3% a year production growth. So those are the targets going forward. You can't judge us on a one-year basis, you have to do it over the long term, because this is a long-term business. And we feel very good between our Bakken program our exploration projects that we have in queue, the Pony project going forward, that we're pretty much on trend to meet those objectives."

This increase of $200 million is the result of the strategic asset trade with Shell announced in December, in which we will assume Shell's interest in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway in exchange for Hess' interest in the Clair field in the United Kingdom and all of Hess's interest in Gabon. The transaction is anticipated to close in the first quarter and be effective January 1, 2010.As another step to improve our portfolio, we completed the sale earlier this month of our interest in Jambi Merang in Indonesia receiving proceeds of $180 million. As in previous years, substantially all of our 2010 spending will be targeted to exploration and production with $2.4 billion budgeted for production operations, $800 million for developments and $850 million for exploration.With regard to exploration and production, in 2009, we replaced 103% of production at an FD&A costs of about $20 per barrel of oil equivalent. At year-end, our improved reserves stood at $1.44 billion barrels of oil equivalent and our reserve life was 9.5 years.In 2009, we increased crude oil and natural gas production 7% to 408,000 barrel equivalent of oil equivalent per day. In 2010, we forecast that crude oil and natural gas production will average between 400,000 and 410,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This forecast includes a net reduction of about 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day resulting from the strategic asset trade with Shell. With regard to developments, the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in which Hess has a 30% interest, commence production in March and achieved a net rate of about $40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the second half of 2009.We also sanctioned our Bakken Shale development in North Dakota. We plan to build up to a 10-rate program our next 18 months and invest about $1 billion per year over the next five years. As a result, we expect net production to increase from 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day currently to 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. In exploration we have continued success at 100%-owned, WA-390-P block at offshore Australia, where in 2009 we drilled seven was, six of which were natural gas discoveries. In Libya, we successfully flow tested the A1 discovery well on our 100% owned Area 54 license, and subsequently drilled and successfully flow tested it down to appraisal well.With regard to Marketing and Refining, our full-year 2009 financial results were lower than 2008, as the weak economy continue to have a negative impact on our business. Our HOVENSA joint venture refinery experienced losses as a result of significantly lower distillate crack spreads and narrower light-heavy crude low differentials.In retail marketing, our financial results were adversely affected by lower gasoline volumes, which were 3% in the last year and weaker margins, partially offset by higher convenience sources which were up nearly 11% from last year. In Energy Marketing, we generated stronger financial results, and increased sales of fuel oil and electricity.In 2009, we maintained a strong financial position in the face of a difficult economic environment. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio at the year-end was 24.8%, a slight increase over 2008. Our liquidity was enhanced by the February 2009 issuance of $1 billion of 10-year notes and $250 million of five-year notes to reduce short-term debt. Also in the fourth quarter of 2009, we refinanced notes due in 2011 by issuing $750 million of 30-year bonds.We are pleased with our performance during 2009, despite a challenging and volatile year. We remain committed to our strategy of investing to profitably grow our reserves and production on a sustainable basis. We are extremely excited about our future investment opportunities which we believe will create long-term value for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill."

In 2009, crude oil and natural gas production averaged 408,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was up 7% versus 2008. Production growth was underpinned by strong performance from the Shenzi Field in",669,"Thank you, John. Let me begin with production. In 2009, crude oil and natural gas production averaged 408,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was up 7% versus 2008. Production growth was underpinned by strong performance from the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, a full-year Phase II natural gas sales for the Malaysia-Thailand joint development area, and overall solid operating performance. In 2009, we had improved reserves of 157 million barrels of oil equivalent and an FD&A cost of about $20 per barrel of oil equivalent, yielding a replacement ratio of 103% and an R/P ratio of 9.5, a good result considering the capital spending reductions we made and our strong production growth in 2009. Including this year's results, our five-year average reserve replacement ratio is 162%, and our average FD&A cost is about $16 per barrel of oil equivalent. In December, we announced a strategic asset trade with Shell that provides us with an opportunity to consolidate our portfolio and double our interest in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway, which are long-lived producing assets with significant reserves and upside potential, which will further support our long-term objective of profitably growing our reserves and production.Turning to our capital program for 2010, we plan to invest nearly $1 billion in the Bakken Oil Plant in North Dakota, where we hold more than 500,000 net acres. We expect our average rig count to increase from three in 2009 to 10 in 2011. At Pony in the deep water Gulf of Mexico, we plan to drill an additional appraisal well, and anticipate unitization of Pony and Knotty Head in 2010, followed by a project sanction in 2011. The remainder of our capital program will focus on continued investment in a number of our core assets, including Shenzi, fields redevelopment at Valhall, an additional development drilling in Equatorial Guinea, the Malaysia-Thailand JDA and Pengka in Indonesia. Turning to exploration, in Australia, as a result of the 2009 drilling program on a 100% owned Western Australia 390-P license, we have now drilled 11 of the 16 commitment wells on the block and have had nine discoveries. We plan to drill additional five commitment wells during the first half of 2010, and are considering further appraisal wells. At the same time, we are continuing discussions regarding commercialization. Also at the Western Australia 404-P license, in  which half of the 50% interest the operator would side, we'll drill eight wells during 2010. Earlier this week, the operator announced that the first of these wells, Noblige-1 resulted in a natural gas discovery. By the end of the year, we should therefore have a much clearer picture of the future development options in Australia.In Libya, we have completed operations on two wells on our 100%-owned Area 54 license. In 2010, we will reprocess 3D seismic and begin discussions with the government about future plans and commercial options.In Brazil, we completed two wells, obtained 450 feet of core, and gathered a large amount of log and pressure data on the BM-S-22 license, in which Hess has a 40% interest. In 2010, the partnership will use this data to reprocess 3D seismic and drill a third well in the second half.In both Ghana and Sumai five [ph] in Indonesia, we continue to technically mature our 100% owned prospects during 2009, and expect to be in a position to drill in late 2010 or early 2011. Finally, in unconventional resources, we continue to selectively grow our position with the acquisition of 80,000 net acres in the Marcellus in 2009. In 2010, we will begin evaluation drilling and seek to acquire additional acreage. In closing, I'm very pleased with the performance of EP in 2009. We successfully navigated difficult business conditions in the early part of the year through tight spending controls and strong operating performance. We also continue to advance our portfolio of material exploration opportunities and strengthened our growth options for the future. Thank you. Now I'll hand the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare fourth quarter 2009 results to the third quarter. Fourth quarter 2009 consolidated results amounted to net income of $358 million, compared with $341 million in the third quarter.Turnin",1011,"Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare fourth quarter 2009 results to the third quarter. Fourth quarter 2009 consolidated results amounted to net income of $358 million, compared with $341 million in the third quarter.Turning to Exploration and Production, Exploration and Production operations in the fourth quarter of 2009 had income of $494 million compared with $397 million in the third quarter. The third quarter included after-tax income of $89 million relating to the resolution of a royalty dispute on production from certain leases subject to the U.S. Deep Water Royalty Relief Act. Excluding the effect of the royalty matter, the after-tax components of the improved results are as follows: Higher selling prices increased earnings by $151 million, higher sales volumes increased earnings by $49 million all other items net to a decrease in earnings of $14 million, for an overall increase in fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $186 million.In the fourth quarter of 2009, our E&P operations were over-lifted compared with production, which increased after-tax income by approximately $40 million. However, earnings were lower in the fourth quarter by $20 million, due to deliveries of natural gas to partially settle take-or-pay operations at the JDA [Malaysia Thailand Joint Development Area] for volumes previously paid four by the buyers at the lower price. The E&P effective income tax rate was 47% for the fourth quarter of 2009. The E&P effective income tax rate was 48% the full year of 2009, excluding items affecting comparability between periods. Turning to Marketing and Refining, Marketing and Refining operations had income of $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with income of $38 million in the third quarter, which included a non-recurring income tax benefit of $12 million. Refining operations lost $40 million in the fourth quarter compared with a loss of $15 million in the third quarter, excluding the non-recurring income tax benefit. The corporation share of HOVENSA's results after income taxes was a loss of $40 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $30 million in the third quarter, primarily reflecting lower margins. Port Reading broke even in the fourth quarter, compared with earnings of $16 million in the third quarter.Marketing earnings were $45 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $35 million in the third quarter, principally reflecting seasonally higher margins and refined product volumes in energy marketing operations. Trading activities generated income of $12 million in the fourth quarter, compared with income of $6 million in the third quarter.Turning to our bond offering and tender, in December 2009, the corporation issued $750 million of new 30-year bonds at a coupon of 6% and tendered for the $662 million of bonds due in August 2011. The corporation completed the repurchase of $546 million of 2011 bonds as of December 31. The remaining $116 million of bonds were redeemed in January and will result in an after-tax charge of approximately $7 million in the first quarter of 2010.Turning to Corporate, net Corporate expenses amounted to $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $33 million in the third quarter. Net corporate expenses in the fourth quarter included after-tax charges of $34 million for the repurchase of the $546 million of 2011 bonds referred to earlier, and $10 million for pension plan settlements related to employee retirements. Excluding the effect of these two items, net corporate expenses increased in the fourth quarter due to higher bank facility fees, employee-related expenses, insurance costs and lower returns from pension-related investments. For the full year 2009, net corporate expenses were $145 million, excluding items affecting comparability. After-tax interest expense was $56 million in the fourth quarter compared with $61 million in the third quarter. For the full year of 2009, after-tax interest expense was $224 million. Turning to cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter, including an increase of $256 million from changes in working capital, was $1,271,000,000. Net proceeds from the bond offering were $744 million. Repayments of debt amounted to $656 million. Capital expenditures were $925 million, all other items amounted to a decrease in cash flow of $29 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the fourth quarter of $405 million.We had $1,362,000,000 of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2009, and $908 million at December 31, 2008. Our available revolving credit capacity was $3 billion at December 31, 2009. Total debt was $4,467,000,000 at December 31, 2009, and $3,955,000,000 at December 31, 2008. The corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio at December 31, 2009, was 24.8% compared with 24.2% at the end of 2008. Now turning to 2010 guidance, in addition to the 2010 production and capital expenditure guidance given by John Hess, I would like to provide further information on certain 2010 financial metrics. Our E&P cash operating costs are expected to be in the range of $15 to $16 barrel oil equivalent produced. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges are expected to be in the range of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel for a total production unit cost of $29.50 to $31.50 per barrel of oil equivalent produced. For the full year of 2010, we currently expect our E&P effective tax rate to be in the range of 47% to 51%.In January 2010, HOVENSA commenced a turnaround of its FCC [fluid catalytic cracking] unit, which is expected to take approximately 40 days. The Corporation's estimated share after income taxes of HOVENSA's turnaround expenses is approximately $20 million. The Corporation is also planning a turnaround of approximately 35 days for the Port Reading refining facility in the second quarter 2010. The estimated after-tax expenses for the Port Reading turnaround are approximately $25 million.Net corporate expenses in 2010 are estimated to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million, and after-tax interest expense in 2010 is anticipated to be in the range of $220 million to $230 million. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

Of course, what happened in 2009, the oil price shock in the early part of the year, we were actually well advanced in our thinking in the Bakken in late 2008 and we actually put the brakes on a bit in 2009, just to wait and see where the oil price was actually going to go. That actually gave us some breathing space to really get all of our plans together, figure out our contracting strategy, et cetera. And so really over the course of 2009, that's what we did. We finalized our thinking. We finalized our contracting strategy and then at the end of the year, took sanction on that project. So nothing's really changed and I'm thinking about the Bakken, it was just a timing thing related to the oil price shock in early 2009. Again, I'd like to remind everyone, the Bakken is robust at $40. It returns the cost to capital at $40. So that's why we feel very confident kind of pulling the trigger on the Bakken now, and aggressively going after a five-year program. I'll turn it over to John to answer the cost question."

When we had the analyst meeting, we were definitely in the investment mode to grow our reserves, with the ultimate objective of getting to a reserve production life of 10, which we reached last year, and we're close to in terms of where we were at the year end. Our targets going forward, as you're well aware, over the last year or so, have evolved to where on a sustainable basis, to optimize financial returns, to set a 3% growth target per year for reserves and a 3% production target as well on an annual basis. Now that's really to be looked at, because you know the E&P business being so capital intensive and lumpy in the timing of developments. It's over the longer term. Year in, year out, like last year we were over 7%, now to 3%, 2010 closer to flat on production. But our long-term targets, meaning a five-year rolling average, we still aspire to and certainly feel that we have captured the opportunities in our portfolio of Exploration and Developments and production investments to deliver 3% a year reserve growth and 3% a year production growth. So those are the targets going forward. You can't judge us on a one-year basis, you have to do it over the long term, because this is a long-term business. And we feel very good between our Bakken program our exploration projects that we have in queue, the Pony project going forward, that we're pretty much on trend to meet those objectives."

I will make a few brief comments, after which John Reilly will review our financial results.Net income for the first quarter of 2010 was $538 million versus a loss of $59 million a year a",744,"Thank you, Jay, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I will make a few brief comments, after which John Reilly will review our financial results.
Net income for the first quarter of 2010 was $538 million versus a loss of $59 million a year ago. Our earnings were positively impacted by higher crude oil and natural gas selling prices and production volumes that more than offset the impact of weaker refining results.
Exploration and Production earned $551 million. Crude oil and natural gas production averaged 423,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 8% above the year ago quarter. This increase resulted primarily from higher production from the Shenzi and Conger Fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand.
In January we closed the previously announced sale of our Jambi Merang asset in Indonesia, receiving proceeds of $183 million. 
At the end of March, we announced the sale of a package of mature, non-operated natural gas production and transportation assets in the U.K. North Sea for $423 million. The sale, which is expected to close in the third quarter, is part of the company's ongoing portfolio management efforts.
We also continue to make progress in finalizing our previously announced strategic asset trade with Shell, which is now expected to close in the second half of this year.  In this trade, Hess will assume Shell's 28.09% interest in the Valhall field and 25% interest in the satellite Hod field in Norway. In return, Shell will assume Hess' 9.29% interest in the Clair Field in the United Kingdom and all of Hess' interest in Gabon.
Although the net effect of these asset sales and the strategic asset trade with Shell is to reduce full year 2010 production by approximately 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, our 2010 production forecast remains at 400,000 to 410,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken reached 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in March. We currently have five rigs dedicated to drilling Bakken wells and we plan to add five additional rigs over the next 12 months.
With regard to exploration, drilling is continuing on Permits WA-390-P and WA-404-P in the Northwest Shelf of Australia. Also, discussions with potential partners regarding the commercialization of natural gas resources on our 100% owned WA-390-P Block are ongoing. 
In February, we spud the Pony No. 3 well on Green Canyon 469, in which Hess has a 100% working interest. This well, which is still drilling, is designed to test the eastern extent of the Pony structure.  Due to a previous farmout agreement regarding the Stena Forth drillship, we plan to release the rig in early June to another operator and then bring it back to finish drilling the well in the fourth quarter. 
In Brazil, the operator of Block BM-S-22 is in the process of completing the analysis of seismic, log and core data and plans to drill a third well in the second half of 2010. Hess has a 40% working interest in the block. 
In Indonesia, we have secured a rig to drill the Semai V prospect, in which Hess has 100% working interest. This well is expected to spud by the first quarter of 2011. With regard to our Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points Block in Ghana, we are seeking a rig and expect to spud by the first quarter of 2011 as well.
Turning to Marketing and Refining, we reported a profit of $87 million for the first quarter of 2010. Financial results at our HOVENSA joint venture were below the year ago quarter primarily due to costs associated with the planned turnaround of the FCC and higher refinery fuel costs. 
Marketing earnings were better than the first quarter last year. Retail marketing gasoline volumes on a per site basis were down 6%, but total convenience store sales were up 8%, due partly to new product offerings.  In Energy Marketing, although there were fewer heating degree days than the year ago quarter, the business delivered strong financial results. While fuel oil and natural gas sales volume declined year-over-year, electricity sales were higher. 
Solid operating performance and improving commodity prices have strengthened our cash and liquidity position. We remain committed to remaining our financial strength so we are positioned to fund our investment opportunities to profitably grow our reserves and production. 
I will now turn the call over to John Reilly."

First quarter 2010 consolidated results amounted to net income of $538 million compared with $358 million in the fourth quar",737,"Thank you, John. Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare first quarter 2010 results for the fourth quarter of 2009. 
First quarter 2010 consolidated results amounted to net income of $538 million compared with $358 million in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Exploration and Production. Exploration and Production operations in the first quarter of 2010 had income of $551 million compared with $494 million in the fourth quarter. The first quarter results included after-tax income of $58 million relating to the sale of the Corporation's interest in the Jambi Merang natural gas development project in Indonesia. Excluding the effect of this asset sale, the change in the after-tax components of the results are as follows.  Higher selling prices increased earnings by $48 million. Lower sales volumes decreased earnings by $95 million. Lower costs increased earnings by $48 million. All other items net to a decrease in earnings of $2 million for an overall decrease in first quarter adjusted earnings of $1 million.
Following a large overlift in the fourth quarter of 2009, E&P operations were underlifted compared with production in the first quarter of 2010, which decreased after-tax income by approximately $55 million. The E&P effective income tax rate was 45%.
Turning to Marketing and Refining. Marketing and Refining operations had income of $87 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared with income of $17 million in the fourth quarter. 
Refining operations lost $56 million in the first quarter compared with a loss of $40 million in the fourth quarter. The Corporation's share of HOVENSA's results, after income taxes, was a loss of $52 million in the first quarter compared with a loss of $40 million in the fourth quarter.  Port Reading generated a loss of $4 million in the first quarter and broke even in the fourth quarter.
During the first quarter, the planned turnaround of the FCC unit at the HOVENSA refinery in St. Croix was completed and operations re-commenced in March 2010. The Corporation's share of HOVENSA's turnaround expenses in the first quarter was approximately $20 million, after income taxes.  In addition, the scheduled turnaround for the Port Reading refining facility commenced in April and is expected to last approximately 35 days. The estimated after-tax expenses to be recorded in the second quarter for the Port Reading turnaround are approximately $20 million after tax.
Marketing earnings were $121 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared with $45 million in the fourth quarter, principally reflecting seasonally higher margins and refined product volumes in energy marketing operations. Trading activities generated income of $22 million in the first quarter compared with income of $12 million in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Corporate. Net Corporate expenses amounted to $48 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared with $97 million in the fourth quarter. Net Corporate expenses in the first quarter included an after-tax charge of $7 million for the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of bonds that were scheduled to mature in 2011. Net Corporate expenses in the fourth quarter included an after-tax charge of $34 million for the repurchase of $546 million of the 2011 bonds and $10 million for pension plan settlements related to employee retirements.  Excluding these special charges, net Corporate expenses were lower in the first quarter, primarily due to lower employee-related costs. 
After-tax interest expense was $52 million in the first quarter compared with $56 million in the fourth quarter.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter, including a decrease of $432 million from changes in working capital, was $825 million. Proceeds from the Jambi Merang asset sale were $183 million. Repayments of debt amounted to $142 million. Capital expenditures were $788 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $70 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the first quarter of $8 million.
We had $1,370 million of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2010 and $1,362 million at December 31, 2009. Our available revolving credit capacity was $3 billion at March 31, 2010.  Total debt was $4,335 million at March 31, 2010 and $4,467 million at December 31, 2009. The Corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio at March 31, 2010 was 23.6% compared with 24.8% at the end of 2009.
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

So cash flow from operating activities, and I'm excluding working capital, it was as you said $1.250 billion. There we're no real one-offs in there. You were asking about the tax rate, and if you're looking at our press release just from the E&P earnings, which includes the special, you'll see a tax rate around 40% for the group.  However, that includes a special item on the Jambi Merang sale, and that sale, due to that it was a share sale, did not have tax associated with it. So our run rate for the first quarter, excluding the special, was 45%. A little below our guidance, but basically really no one-offs in the first quarter from a cash flow standpoint. As you're going forward through the year, it's early in the year right now, so we have that guidance at $4.1 billion. You'll always have things that move in, move out of our CapEx profile.

I will make a few brief comments after which John Rielly will review our financial results.Net income for the first quarter of 2010 was $538 million versus a loss of $59 million a year ago",751,"Thank you, Jay and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I will make a few brief comments after which John Rielly will review our financial results.
Net income for the first quarter of 2010 was $538 million versus a loss of $59 million a year ago. Our earnings were positively impacted by higher crude oil and natural gas selling prices and production volumes that more than offset the impact of weaker refining results.
Exploration and Production earned $551 million. Crude oil and natural gas production averaged 423,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 8% above the year ago quarter. This increase resulted primarily from higher production from the Shenzi and Conger Fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand.
In January, we closed the previously announced sale of our Jambi Merang asset in Indonesia receiving proceeds of $183 million. At the end of March we announced the sale of a package of mature, non-operated natural gas production and transportation assets in the UK North Sea for $423 million. The sale, which is expected to close in the third quarter, is part of the company's ongoing portfolio management efforts.
We also continue to make progress in finalizing our previously announced strategic asset trade with Shell, which is now expected to close in the second half of this year. In this trade, Hess will assume Shell's 28.09% interest in the Valhall field and 25% interest in the satellite Hod field in Norway. In return, Shell will assume Hess's 9.29% interest in the Clair field, in the United Kingdom and all of Hess' interests in Gabon.
Although the net effect of these asset sales and the strategic asset trade with Shell is to reduce full year 2010 production by approximately 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, our 2010 production forecast remains at 400,000 to 410,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken reached 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in March. We currently have five rigs dedicated to drilling Bakken wells and we plan to add five additional rigs over the next 12 months. With regard to exploration, drilling is continuing on permits WA-390-P and WA-404-P in the North West Shelf of Australia. Also, discussions with potential partners regarding the commercialization of natural gas resources on our 100% owned WA-390-P block are ongoing.
In February we spud the Pony No. 3 well on Green Canyon 469 in which Hess has a 100% working interest. This well which is still drilling, is designed to test the eastern extent of the Pony structure. Due to a previous farmed out agreement regarding the Stena Forth drill ship, we plan to release the rig in early June to another operator and then bring it back to finish drilling the well in the fourth quarter.
In Brazil, the operator of Block BM-S-22 is in the process of completing the analysis of seismic, log and core data and plans to drill a third well in the second half of 2010. Hess has a 40% working interest in the block. And Indonesia, we have secured a rig to drill the Semai V prospect in which Hess has a 100% working interest. This well is expected to spud by the first quarter of 2011. With regard to our Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points Block in Ghana, we are seeking a rig and expect to spud the first as well by the first quarter of 2011 as well.
Turning to marketing and refining, we reported a profit of $87 million for the first quarter of 2010. Financial results at our HOVENSA joint venture were below the year ago quarter primarily due to costs associated with the planned turnaround of the FCC and higher refinery costs.
Marketing earnings were better than the first quarter last year. Retail marketing gasoline volumes on a per site basis were down 6%, but total convenience store sales were up 8%, due partly to new product offerings. 
In Energy Marketing, although there were fewer heating degree days than the year ago quarter, the business delivered strong financial results. While fuel oil and natural gas sales volumes declined year-over-year, electricity sales were higher.
Solid operating performance and improving commodity prices have strengthened our cash and liquidity position. We remain committed to maintaining our financial strength, so we are positioned to fund our investment opportunities to profitably grow our reserves and production. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.

In my remarks today, I will compare first quarter 2010 results to the fourth quarter of 2009. First quarter 2010 consolidated results amounted to net income of $538 million compared with $358 million in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Exploration and Production, Exploration and Production operations in the first quarter of 2010 had income of $551 million compared with $494 million in the fourth quarter. The first quarter results included after-tax income of $58 million relating to the sale of the Corporation's interest in the Jambi Merang natural gas development project in Indonesia. Excluding the effect of this asset sale, the change in the after-tax components of the results are as follows.
Higher selling prices increased earnings by $48 million. Lower sales volumes decreased earnings by$ 95 million. Lower costs increased earnings by $48 million. All other items net to a decrease in earnings of $2 million for an overall decrease in first quarter adjusted earnings of $1 million.
Following a large overlift in the fourth quarter of 2009, E&P operations were underlifted compared with production in the first quarter of 2010, which decreased after-tax income by approximately $55 million. The E&P effective income tax rate was 45%.
Turning to Marketing and Refining, Marketing and Refining operations had income of $87 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared with income of $17 million in the fourth quarter. Refining operations lost $56 million in the first quarter compared with a loss of $40 million in the fourth quarter. The Corporation's share of HOVENSA's results, after income taxes, was a loss of $52 million in the first quarter compared with a loss of $40 million in the fourth quarter. Port Reading generated a loss of $4 million in the first quarter and broke even in the fourth quarter.
During the first quarter, the planned turnaround of the FCC unit at the HOVENSA refinery in St. Croix was completed and operations recommenced in March 2010. The Corporation's share of HOVENSA's turnaround expenses in the first quarter was approximately $20 million after income taxes.
In addition, the scheduled turnaround for the Port Reading refining facility commenced in April and is expected to last approximately 35 days. The estimated after-tax expenses to be recorded in the second quarter for the Port Reading turnaround are approximately $20 million after-tax.
Marketing earnings were $121 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared with $45 million in the fourth quarter, principally reflecting seasonally higher margins and refined product volumes in energy marketing operations. Trading activities generated income of $22 million in the first quarter compared with income of $12 million in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Corporate, net Corporate expenses amounted to $48 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared with $97 million in the fourth quarter. Net Corporate expenses in the first quarter included an after-tax charge of $7 million for the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of bonds that were scheduled to mature in 2011.
Net Corporate expenses in the fourth quarter included an after-tax charge of $34 million for the repurchase of $546 million of the 2011 bonds and $10 million for pension plan settlements related to employee retirements. Excluding these special charges, net Corporate expenses were lower in the first quarter, primarily due to lower employee-related costs. After-tax interest expense was $52 million in the first quarter compared with $56 million in the fourth quarter.
Turning to cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter, including a decrease of $432 million from changes in working capital, was $825 million, Proceeds from the Jambi Merang asset sale were $183 million. Repayments of debt amounted to $142 million. Capital expenditures were $788 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $70 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the first quarter of $8 million.
We had $1.370 billion of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2010 and $1.362 billion at December 31, 2009. Our available revolving credit capacity was $3 billion at March 31, 2010. Total debt was $4.335 billion at March 31, 2010 and $4.467 billion at December 31, 2009. The Corporation's debt to capitalization ratio at March 31, 2010 was 23.6% compared with 24.8% at the end of 2009.
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.

The EUR is about one million barrels per well and the 30 day average IP for those dual laterals is around the 1000 barrels a day, so that's 450 to 500 barrels per lateral. 
If I turn to the Marcellus again, we're continuing to build our position in the Marcellus. We're at about 80,000 net acres now in the Marcellus, primarily in Wayne County, Pennsylvania. About 50,000 of that is Hess operated and the balance is part of this joint venture we have with Newfield.

So we anticipate drilling Semai early 2011, maybe we can squeeze it in, in late 2010. And then, as we move further into 2011, of course, Australia continues with appraisal and follow-up. And then the Stena Forth, after she finishes Pony 3, we'll then begin an exploration program in the Gulf of Mexico. So plans are she will stay in the Gulf and just continue an exploration program.

So, as John Hess mentioned, the UK gas assets as well as our trade with Shell are expected to be completed in the second half of the year, which will cause our production to decrease by approximately 5,000 barrels a day.

I will make a few brief comments, after which John Rielly will review our financial results.Net income for the first quarter of 2010 was $538 million versus a loss of $59 million a year a",744,"Thank you, Jay, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I will make a few brief comments, after which John Rielly will review our financial results.
Net income for the first quarter of 2010 was $538 million versus a loss of $59 million a year ago. Our earnings were positively impacted by higher crude oil and natural gas selling prices and production volumes that more than offset the impact of weaker refining results.
Exploration and Production earned $551 million. Crude oil and natural gas production averaged 423,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 8% above the year ago quarter. This increase resulted primarily from higher production from the Shenzi and Conger Fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand.
In January we closed the previously announced sale of our Jambi Merang asset in Indonesia, receiving proceeds of $183 million. 
At the end of March, we announced the sale of a package of mature, non-operated natural gas production and transportation assets in the U.K. North Sea for $423 million. The sale, which is expected to close in the third quarter, is part of the company's ongoing portfolio management efforts.
We also continue to make progress in finalizing our previously announced strategic asset trade with Shell, which is now expected to close in the second half of this year.  In this trade, Hess will assume Shell's 28.09% interest in the Valhall field and 25% interest in the satellite Hod field in Norway. In return, Shell will assume Hess' 9.29% interest in the Clair Field in the United Kingdom and all of Hess' interest in Gabon.
Although the net effect of these asset sales and the strategic asset trade with Shell is to reduce full year 2010 production by approximately 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, our 2010 production forecast remains at 400,000 to 410,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken reached 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in March. We currently have five rigs dedicated to drilling Bakken wells and we plan to add five additional rigs over the next 12 months.
With regard to exploration, drilling is continuing on Permits WA-390-P and WA-404-P in the Northwest Shelf of Australia. Also, discussions with potential partners regarding the commercialization of natural gas resources on our 100% owned WA-390-P Block are ongoing. 
In February, we spud the Pony No. 3 well on Green Canyon 469, in which Hess has a 100% working interest. This well, which is still drilling, is designed to test the eastern extent of the Pony structure.  Due to a previous farmout agreement regarding the Stena Forth drillship, we plan to release the rig in early June to another operator and then bring it back to finish drilling the well in the fourth quarter. 
In Brazil, the operator of Block BM-S-22 is in the process of completing the analysis of seismic, log and core data and plans to drill a third well in the second half of 2010.  Hess has a 40% working interest in the block. 
In Indonesia, we have secured a rig to drill the Semai V prospect, in which Hess has 100% working interest. This well is expected to spud by the first quarter of 2011. With regard to our Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points block in Ghana, we are seeking a rig and expect to spud by the first quarter of 2011 as well.
Turning to Marketing and Refining, we reported a profit of $87 million for the first quarter of 2010. Financial results at our HOVENSA joint venture were below the year ago quarter primarily due to costs associated with the planned turnaround of the FCC and higher refinery fuel costs. 
Marketing earnings were better than the first quarter last year. Retail marketing gasoline volumes on a per site basis were down 6%, but total convenience store sales were up 8%, due partly to new product offerings.  In Energy Marketing, although there were fewer heating degree days than the year ago quarter, the business delivered strong financial results. While fuel oil and natural gas sales volume declined year-over-year, electricity sales were higher. 
Solid operating performance and improving commodity prices have strengthened our cash and liquidity position. We remain committed to remaining our financial strength so we are positioned to fund our investment opportunities to profitably grow our reserves and production. 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare first quarter 2010 results for the fourth quarter of 2009. 
First quarter 2010 consolidated results amounted to net income of $538 million compared with $358 million in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Exploration and Production. Exploration and Production operations in the first quarter of 2010 had income of $551 million compared with $494 million in the fourth quarter. The first quarter results included after-tax income of $58 million relating to the sale of the Corporation's interest in the Jambi Merang natural gas development 
project in Indonesia. Excluding the effect of this asset sale, the change in the after-tax components of the results are as follows.  Higher selling prices increased earnings by $48 million. Lower sales volumes decreased earnings by $95 million. Lower costs increased earnings by $48 million. All other items net to a decrease in earnings of $2 million for an overall decrease in first quarter adjusted earnings of $1 million.
Following a large overlift in the fourth quarter of 2009, E&P operations were underlifted compared with production in the first quarter of 2010, which decreased after-tax income by approximately $55 million. The E&P effective income tax rate was 45%.
Turning to Marketing and Refining. Marketing and Refining operations had income of $87 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared with income of $17 million in the fourth quarter. 
Refining operations lost $56 million in the first quarter compared with a loss of $40 million in the fourth quarter. The Corporation's share of HOVENSA's results, after income taxes, was a loss of $52 million in the first quarter compared with a loss of $40 million in the fourth quarter.  Port Reading generated a loss of $4 million in the first 
quarter and broke even in the fourth quarter.
During the first quarter, the planned turnaround of the FCC unit at the HOVENSA refinery in St. Croix was completed and operations re-commenced in March 2010. The Corporation's share of HOVENSA's turnaround expenses in the first quarter was approximately $20 million, after income taxes.  In addition, the scheduled turnaround for the Port Reading refining facility commenced in April and is expected to last approximately 35 days. The estimated after-tax expenses to be recorded in the second quarter for the Port Reading 
turnaround are approximately $20 million after tax.
Marketing earnings were $121 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared with $45 million in the fourth quarter, principally reflecting seasonally higher margins and refined product volumes in energy marketing operations. Trading activities generated income of $22 million in the first quarter compared with income of $12 million in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Corporate. Net Corporate expenses amounted to $48 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared with $97 million in the fourth quarter. Net Corporate expenses in the first quarter included an after-tax charge of $7 million for the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of bonds that were scheduled to mature in 2011. Net Corporate expenses 
in the fourth quarter included an after-tax charge of $34 million for the repurchase of $546 million of the 2011 bonds and $10 million for pension plan settlements related to employee retirements.  Excluding these special charges, net Corporate expenses were lower in the first quarter, primarily due to lower employee-related costs. 
After-tax interest expense was $52 million in the first quarter compared with $56 million in the fourth quarter.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter, including a decrease of $432 million from changes in working capital, was $825 million.  Proceeds from the Jambi Merang asset sale were $183 million. Repayments of debt amounted to $142 million. Capital expenditures were $788 million. All other items amounted to a 
decrease in cash of $70 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the first quarter of $8 million.
We had $1,370,000,000 of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2010, and $1,362,000,000 at December 31, 2009. Our available revolving credit capacity was $3 billion at March 31, 2010.  Total debt was $4,335,000 at March 31, 2010, and $4,467,000 at December 31, 2009. The corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio at March 31, 2010, was 23.6% compared with 24.8% at the end of 2009.

You have fewer down hole equipment.  You 
have fewer surface facilities.  So we really believe that this dual lateral approach, combined with the application [indiscernible] manufacturing techniques and pad drilling, is going to result in superior returns for us on the Bakken, which is why we're going with that approach. Now I will say its early days.  As we learn, as we need to, we'll change 
and modify as appropriate.   But right now we're happy with the dual lateral performance."

last month or so, we expect them to come back once Mandan [ph] is back on stream. That's number one.  Number two, as the volumes go up, we're going to continue to look at different evacuation routes to maximum value and it would be premature now to say what those numbers are."

I will make a few brief comments, after which John Rielly will review our financial results. Net income for the second quarter of 2010 was $375 million versus $100 million a year ago. Ou",1022,"Thank you, Jay, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. I will make a few brief comments, after which John Rielly will review our financial results. 
Net income for the second quarter of 2010 was $375 million versus $100 million a year ago. Our results were positively impacted by higher crude oil and natural gas selling prices and lower exploration expense compared to the year-ago quarter.
Exploration and Production earned $488 million. Crude oil and natural gas production averaged 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 2% above the year-ago period. Higher year-over-year production resulted primarily from increased volume from the Shenzi Field in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Valhall field in Norway. 
Net production from the Bakken is currently more than 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we remain on track to exit this year at a net rate of about 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We added three additional rigs during the second quarter, and currently have eight rigs dedicated to drilling Bakken wells. 
As a result of strong year-to-date production performance, we have raised our full year 2010 production forecast to a range of 405,000 to 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from our previously forecasted range of 400,000 to 410,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Regarding the recent tragic accident in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we are deeply saddened by the devastating loss of life, ecological damage to the Gulf coast and severe economic impact on local communities. While our company believes we have extremely high performance requirements for the safety of drilling operations, we in our industry need to do all we can to learn from this disaster, and to take the necessary precautions to ensure such a tragedy never happens again.
The near term impact of the moratorium on Hess is expected to be relatively minimal. Our only operated rig in the Gulf of Mexico, the Stena Forth, left the Pony #3 location on Green Canyon 469 in June. That's part of a pre-existing farmout agreement. We anticipate completing the Pony #3 well as soon as practicable, following the lifting of the moratorium. The drilling of a production well at the Shenzi Field, in which Hess has a 28% interest, was suspended as a result of the moratorium.  But this delay is expected to have only a very modest impact on our 2010 production. 
In June, we announced our intent to preempt BP under acquisition of Total's interest in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway. Hess will pay $496 million in cash for an additional 7.85% interest in the Valhall field and 12.5% interest in the Hod fields, adding proved reserves of approximately 45 million barrels of oil equivalent. This preemption, along with the previously announced asset swap with Shell will result in our share of the Valhall and Hod fields increasing to 64.05% and 62.5%, respectively.  Both transactions are expected to close by the end of the third quarter.
During the second quarter, we made progress in our strategy to grow our global inventory of unconventional resource opportunities. In May, we announced a partnership with Toreador Resources under which Hess will invest up to $65 million in an initial exploration phase, and has the option to earn a 50% working interest and become operator in more than 1 million gross acres in the Paris Basin in France. An initial six-well program will commence in the fourth quarter and continue through 2011. 
Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of American Oil & Gas Inc. for 8.6 million shares of Hess common stock. This transaction will add approximately 85,000 net acres in the Williston Basin in North Dakota, build upon Hess' strong land position, leverage our infrastructure and enhance our growth profile in the Bakken oil play. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
With regard to exploration, we drilled two wells on our 100% owned permit WA-390-P in the Northwest Shelf of Australia, resulting in one discovery and one dry haul. We have now drilled 14 wells on the block resulting in 11 discoveries. We expect to complete our remaining two commitment wells during the third quarter, followed by an appraisal program that will include additional drilling and flow testing of several wells. Commercial discussions with potential partners regarding WA-390-P are ongoing.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to spot exploration wells on our 40% owned BM-S-22 block in Brazil and our 100% owned Tano Cape Three Points block in Ghana. In addition, we plan to drill our 100% owned Semai V prospect in Indonesia during the first quarter of 2011.
Turning to Marketing and Refining, we reported a loss of $19 million, an improvement over the year-ago quarter. Refining margins at our HOVENSA joint venture refinery improved from last year's second quarter as a result of higher distillate crack spreads and wider light heavy crude differentials. This improvement in Refining was more than offset by costs associated with the planned turnaround of the FCC and other related units at our Port Redding, New Jersey facility. Marketing results were better than the year-ago quarter, principally due to improved margins. Although retail marketing gasoline volumes on a per site basis were down about 4%, total convenience store sales were up nearly 7%. In Energy Marketing, oil sales were higher year-over-year, while natural gas and electricity sales were lower.
Capital and exploratory expenditures in the first half of 2010 were $1.8 billion, substantially all of which were related to Exploration and Production activities. For the full year 2010, our capital and exploratory expenditures forecast has increased to $5.5 billion from $4.1 billion. The increase primarily reflects the acquisition of additional interest in the Valhall and Hod fields from Total; the acquisition of American Oil & Gas Inc.; and further appraisal of permit WA-390-P in Australia. We are pleased to make these acquisitions that will help us sustain profitable growth in reserves and production. At the same time, we are maintaining our financial strength, which will provide us the ability to fund future investments. 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

Turning to Exploration and Production. Exploration and Production operations in the second quarter of 2010 had income of $488 million compared with $551 million in the first quarter. The first quarter results included after-tax income of $58 million relating to the sale of the corporation's interest in the Jambi Merang field in Indonesia. Excluding the effect of this asset sale, the change in the after-tax components of the results are as follows: lower selling prices, primarily natural gas, decreased earnings by $30 million; increased exploration expense reduced earnings by $18 million; increased depreciation expense reduced earnings by $11 million; lower cash operating costs increased earnings by $21 million. All other items net to an increase in earnings of $16 million, for an overall decrease in second quarter adjusted earnings of $5 million.
In the second quarter of 2010, our E&P operations were under-lifted compared with production, resulting in decreased after-tax income in the quarter of approximately $30 million. 
Total production unit costs for the first six months of the year amounted to $27.65 per barrel of oil equivalent. We are reducing our total production unit cost guidance for the full year by $1 per barrel to $28.50 to $30.50 per barrel. E&P cash operating costs are expected to be in the range of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel, down from the previous guidance of $15 to $16 per barrel.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges are expected to be in the range of $14 to $15 per barrel, down from $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel.  The E&P effective income tax rate was 43% in the second quarter. For the full year of 2010, we are reducing our E&P effective tax rate guidance to a range of 44% to 48%, down from 47% to 51%.
Turning to Marketing and Refining. Marketing and Refining operations generated a loss of $19 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with income of $87 million in the first quarter. Refining operations lost $31 million in the second quarter compared with $56 million in the first quarter. The corporation's share of HOVENSA's results after income taxes was a loss of $4 million in the second quarter compared with $52 million in the first quarter, reflecting improved refining margins in the second quarter. Also the first quarter included turnaround expenses of approximately $20 million after income taxes for scheduled maintenance on the FCC unit at HOVENSA. 
Port Redding generated a loss of $27 million in the second quarter compared to a loss of $4 million in the first quarter. During the second quarter, this refining facility was shut down for 41 days for a planned turnaround. The turnaround expenses recorded in the second quarter totaled approximately $27 million after income taxes.
Marketing earnings were $17 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with $121 million in the first quarter, principally reflecting seasonally lower margins and sales volumes in Energy Marketing operations. Trading activities generated a loss of $5 million in the second quarter compared with income of $22 million in the first quarter.
Turning to Corporate. Net Corporate expenses amounted to $42 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with $48 million in the first quarter. Net Corporate expenses in the first quarter included an after-tax charge of $7 million for the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of bonds that were scheduled to mature in 2011. After-tax interest was $52 million in both the second and first quarters. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter, including a decrease of $39 million from changes in working capital, was $981 million. Repayments of debt were $15 million. Capital expenditures were $901 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $72 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the second quarter of $7 million.
We had $1,363,000,000 of cash and cash equivalents at June 31, 2010, and $1,362,000,000 at December 31, 2009. Our available revolving credit capacity was $3 billion at June 30, 2010.  Total debt was $4,326,000,000 at June 30, 2010, and $4,467,000,000 million at December 31, 2009. The corporation's debt to capitalization ratio at June 30, 2010 was 22.9% compared with 24.8% at the end of 2009.
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

But what ends up happening with our forecast is the higher commodity price that you have, brings in more pre-tax income from other areas outside of Libya. And so Libya becomes a smaller percentage of our overall pre-tax income. And therefore, the effective rate becomes lower just when you put the portfolio together. So you have that coming about. And so with these higher commodity prices, we've been forecasting lower rate and that's why we're bringing down the guidance. Now going out, I mean, again, we'll give you the guidance for next year on our January call but the one thing you do see, our guidance is still higher for the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year. And some of the results of that is our Valhall swap. So we will be getting more interest in Valhall.

I will make a few brief comments, after which John Rielly will review our financial results. Net income for the second quarter of 2010 was $375 million versus $100 million a year ago. Ou",1024,"Thank you, Jay, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. I will make a few brief comments, after which John Rielly will review our financial results. 
Net income for the second quarter of 2010 was $375 million versus $100 million a year ago. Our results were positively impacted by higher crude oil and natural gas selling prices and lower exploration expense compared to the year-ago quarter.
Exploration and Production earned $488 million. Crude oil and natural gas production averaged 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 2% above the year-ago period. Higher year-over-year production resulted primarily from increased volume from the Shenzi Field in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Valhall field in Norway. 
Net production from the Bakken is currently more than 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we remain on track to exit this year at a net rate of about 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We added three additional rigs during the second quarter, and currently have eight rigs dedicated to drilling Bakken wells. 
As a result of strong year-to-date production performance, we have raised our full year 2010 production forecast to a range of 405,000 to 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from our previously forecasted range of 400,000 to 410,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Regarding the recent tragic accident in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we are deeply saddened by the devastating loss of life, ecological damage to the Gulf coast and severe economic impact on local communities. While our company believes we have extremely high performance requirements for the safety of drilling operations, we and our industry need to do all we can to learn from this disaster and to take the necessary precautions to ensure such a tragedy never happens again.
The near term impact of the moratorium on Hess is expected to be relatively minimal. Our only operated rig in the Gulf of Mexico, the Stena Forth, left the Pony No. 3 location on Green Canyon 469 in June as part of a pre-existing farmout agreement. We anticipate completing the Pony No. 3 well as soon as practicable, following the lifting of the moratorium. The drilling of a production well at the Shenzi Field, in which Hess has a 28% interest, was suspended as a result of the moratorium.  But this delay is expected to have only a very modest impact on our 2010 production. 
In June, we announced our intent to preempt BP under acquisition of Total's interest in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway. Hess will pay $496 million in cash for an additional 7.85% interest in the Valhall field and 12.5% interest in the Hod field, adding proved reserves of approximately 45 million barrels of oil equivalent. This preemption, along with the previously announced asset swap with Shell will result in our share of the Valhall and Hod fields increasing to 64.05% and 62.5%, respectively.  Both transactions are expected to close by the end of the third quarter.
During the second quarter, we made progress in our strategy to grow our global inventory of unconventional resource opportunities. In May, we announced a partnership with Toreador Resources under which Hess will invest up to $65 million in an initial exploration phase and has the option to earn a 50% working interest and become operator in more than 1 million gross acres in the Paris Basin in France. An initial six-well program will commence in the fourth quarter and continue through 2011. 
Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of American Oil & Gas Inc. for 8.6 million shares of Hess common stock. This transaction will add approximately 85,000 net acres in the Williston Basin in North Dakota, build upon Hess' strong land position, leverage our infrastructure and enhance our growth profile in the Bakken oil play. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
With regard to exploration, we drilled two wells on our 100% owned permit WA-390-P in the Northwest Shelf of Australia, resulting in one discovery and one dry haul. We have now drilled 14 wells on the block resulting in 11 discoveries. We expect to complete our remaining two commitment wells during the third quarter, followed by an appraisal program that will include additional drilling and flow testing of several wells. Commercial discussions with potential partners regarding WA-390-P are ongoing.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to spot exploration wells on our 40% owned BM-S-22 block in Brazil and our 100% owned Tano Cape Three Points block in Ghana. In addition, we plan to drill our 100% owned Semai V prospect in Indonesia during the first quarter of 2011.
Turning to Marketing and Refining, we reported a loss of $19 million, an improvement over the year-ago quarter. Refining margins at our HOVENSA joint venture refinery improved from last year's second quarter as a result of higher distillate crack spreads and wider light heavy crude differentials. This improvement in Refining was more than offset by costs associated with the planned turnaround of the FCC and other related units at our Port Redding, New Jersey facility. Marketing results were better than the year-ago quarter, principally due to improved margins. Although retail marketing gasoline volumes on a per site basis were down about 4%, total convenience store sales were up nearly 7%. In Energy Marketing, oil sales were higher year-over-year, while natural gas and electricity sales were lower.
Capital and exploratory expenditures in the first half of 2010 were $1.8 billion, substantially all of which were related to Exploration and Production activities. For the full year 2010, our capital and exploratory expenditures forecast has increased to $5.5 billion from $4.1 billion. The increase primarily reflects the acquisition of additional interest in the Valhall and Hod fields from Total; the acquisition of American Oil & Gas Inc.; and further appraisal of permit WA-390-P in Australia. We are pleased to make these acquisitions that will help us sustain profitable growth in reserves and production. At the same time, we are maintaining our financial strength, which will provide us the ability to fund future investments. 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare second quarter 2010 results to the first quarter. The corporation generated consolidated net income of $375 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with $538 million in the first quarter.
Turning to Exploration and Production. Exploration and Production operations in the second quarter of 2010 had income of $488 million compared with $551 million in the first quarter. The first quarter results included after-tax income of $58 million relating to the sale of the corporation's interest in the Jambi Merang field in Indonesia. Excluding the effect of this asset sale, the change in the after-tax components of the results are as follows: lower selling prices, primarily natural gas, decreased earnings by $30 million; increased exploration expense reduced earnings by $18 million; increased depreciation expense reduced earnings by $11 million; lower cash operating costs increased earnings by $21 million. All other items net to an increase in earnings of $16 million, for an overall decrease in second quarter adjusted earnings of $5 million.
In the second quarter of 2010, our E&P operations were under-lifted compared with production, resulting in decreased after-tax income in the quarter of approximately $30 million. 
Total production unit costs for the first six months of the year amounted to $27.65 per barrel of oil equivalent. We are reducing our total production unit cost guidance for the full year by $1 per barrel to $28.50 to $30.50 per barrel. E&P cash operating costs are expected to be in the range of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel, down from the previous guidance of $15 to $16 per barrel.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges are expected to be in the range of $14 to $15 per barrel, down from $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel.  The E&P effective income tax rate was 43% in the second quarter. For the full year of 2010, we are reducing our E&P effective tax rate guidance to a range of 44% to 48%, down from 47% to 51%.
Turning to Marketing and Refining. Marketing and Refining operations generated a loss of $19 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with income of $87 million in the first quarter. Refining operations lost $31 million in the second quarter compared with $56 million in the first quarter. The corporation's share of HOVENSA's results after income taxes was a loss of $4 million in the second quarter compared with $52 million in the first quarter, reflecting improved refining margins in the second quarter. Also the first quarter included turnaround expenses of approximately $20 million after income taxes for scheduled maintenance on the FCC unit at HOVENSA. 
Port Redding generated a loss of $27 million in the second quarter compared to a loss of $4 million in the first quarter. During the second quarter, this refining facility was shut down for 41 days for a planned turnaround. The turnaround expenses recorded in the second quarter totaled approximately $27 million after income taxes.
Marketing earnings were $17 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with $121 million in the first quarter, principally reflecting seasonally lower margins and sales volumes in Energy Marketing operations. Trading activities generated a loss of $5 million in the second quarter compared with income of $22 million in the first quarter.
Turning to Corporate. Net Corporate expenses amounted to $42 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with $48 million in the first quarter. Net Corporate expenses in the first quarter included an after-tax charge of $7 million for the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of bonds that were scheduled to mature in 2011. After-tax interest was $52 million in both the second and first quarters. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter, including a decrease of $39 million from changes in working capital, was $981 million. Repayments of debt were $15 million. Capital expenditures were $901 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $72 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the second quarter of $7 million.
We had $1,363,000,000 of cash and cash equivalents at June 31, 2010, and $1,362,000,000 at December 31, 2009. Our available revolving credit capacity was $3 billion at June 30, 2010.  Total debt was $4,326,000,000 at June 30, 2010, and $4,467,000,000 million at December 31, 2009. The corporation's debt to capitalization ratio at June 30, 2010 was 22.9% compared with 24.8% at the end of 2009.
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

So you do have -- you always have mix. You've got the concept of the under-lift that I mentioned. So it's not a big portion but Libya is a bit under-lifted here in this quarter. But what ends up happening with our forecast is the higher commodity price that you have, brings in more pre-tax income from other areas outside of Libya. And so Libya becomes a smaller percentage of our overall pre-tax income. And therefore, the effective rate becomes lower just when you put the portfolio together. So you have that coming about. And so with these higher commodity prices, we've been forecasting lower rate and that's why we're bringing down the guidance. Now going out, I mean, again, we'll give you the guidance for next year on our January call but the one thing you do see, our guidance is still higher for the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year. And some of the results of that is our Valhall swap. So we will be getting more interest in Valhall. It's a higher rate and so that will be bringing up our rate in the second half of the year, and obviously then we'll have a higher interest in Valhall going into 2011.

I will make a few brief comments, after which John Rielly will review our financial results. Net income for the second quarter of 2010 was $375 million versus $100 million a year ago. Ou",1024,"Thank you, Jay, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. I will make a few brief comments, after which John Rielly will review our financial results. 
Net income for the second quarter of 2010 was $375 million versus $100 million a year ago. Our results were positively impacted by higher crude oil and natural gas selling prices and lower exploration expense compared to the year-ago quarter.
Exploration and Production earned $488 million. Crude oil and natural gas production averaged 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 2% above the year-ago period. Higher year-over-year production resulted primarily from increased volume from the Shenzi Field in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Valhall field in Norway. 
Net production from the Bakken is currently more than 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we remain on track to exit this year at a net rate of about 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We added three additional rigs during the second quarter, and currently have eight rigs dedicated to drilling Bakken wells. 
As a result of strong year-to-date production performance, we have raised our full year 2010 production forecast to a range of 405,000 to 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from our previously forecasted range of 400,000 to 410,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Regarding the recent tragic accident in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we are deeply saddened by the devastating loss of life, ecological damage to the Gulf coast and severe economic impact on local communities. While our company believes we have extremely high performance requirements for the safety of drilling operations, we and our industry need to do all we can to learn from this disaster and to take the necessary precautions to ensure such a tragedy never happens again.
The near term impact of the moratorium on Hess is expected to be relatively minimal. Our only operated rig in the Gulf of Mexico, the Stena Forth, left the Pony No. 3 location on Green Canyon 469 in June as part of a pre-existing farmout agreement. We anticipate completing the Pony No. 3 well as soon as practicable, following the lifting of the moratorium. The drilling of a production well at the Shenzi Field, in which Hess has a 28% interest, was suspended as a result of the moratorium.  But this delay is expected to have only a very modest impact on our 2010 production. 
In June, we announced our intent to preempt BP under acquisition of Total's interest in the Valhall and Hod fields in Norway. Hess will pay $496 million in cash for an additional 7.85% interest in the Valhall field and 12.5% interest in the Hod field, adding proved reserves of approximately 45 million barrels of oil equivalent. This preemption, along with the previously announced asset swap with Shell will result in our share of the Valhall and Hod fields increasing to 64.05% and 62.5%, respectively.  Both transactions are expected to close by the end of the third quarter.
During the second quarter, we made progress in our strategy to grow our global inventory of unconventional resource opportunities. In May, we announced a partnership with Toreador Resources under which Hess will invest up to $65 million in an initial exploration phase and has the option to earn a 50% working interest and become operator in more than 1 million gross acres in the Paris Basin in France. An initial six-well program will commence in the fourth quarter and continue through 2011. 
Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of American Oil & Gas Inc. for 8.6 million shares of Hess common stock. This transaction will add approximately 85,000 net acres in the Williston Basin in North Dakota, build upon Hess' strong land position, leverage our infrastructure and enhance our growth profile in the Bakken oil play. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
With regard to exploration, we drilled two wells on our 100% owned permit WA-390-P in the Northwest Shelf of Australia, resulting in one discovery and one dry haul. We have now drilled 14 wells on the block resulting in 11 discoveries. We expect to complete our remaining two commitment wells during the third quarter, followed by an appraisal program that will include additional drilling and flow testing of several wells. Commercial discussions with potential partners regarding WA-390-P are ongoing.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to spot exploration wells on our 40% owned BM-S-22 block in Brazil and our 100% owned Tano Cape Three Points block in Ghana. In addition, we plan to drill our 100% owned Semai V prospect in Indonesia during the first quarter of 2011.
Turning to Marketing and Refining, we reported a loss of $19 million, an improvement over the year-ago quarter. Refining margins at our HOVENSA joint venture refinery improved from last year's second quarter as a result of higher distillate crack spreads and wider light heavy crude differentials. This improvement in Refining was more than offset by costs associated with the planned turnaround of the FCC and other related units at our Port Redding, New Jersey facility. Marketing results were better than the year-ago quarter, principally due to improved margins. Although retail marketing gasoline volumes on a per site basis were down about 4%, total convenience store sales were up nearly 7%. In Energy Marketing, oil sales were higher year-over-year, while natural gas and electricity sales were lower.
Capital and exploratory expenditures in the first half of 2010 were $1.8 billion, substantially all of which were related to Exploration and Production activities. For the full year 2010, our capital and exploratory expenditures forecast has increased to $5.5 billion from $4.1 billion. The increase primarily reflects the acquisition of additional interest in the Valhall and Hod fields from Total; the acquisition of American Oil & Gas Inc.; and further appraisal of permit WA-390-P in Australia. We are pleased to make these acquisitions that will help us sustain profitable growth in reserves and production. At the same time, we are maintaining our financial strength, which will provide us the ability to fund future investments. 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare second quarter 2010 results to the first quarter. The corporation generated consolidated net income of $375 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with $538 million in the first",772,"Thank you, John. Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare second quarter 2010 results to the first quarter. The corporation generated consolidated net income of $375 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with $538 million in the first quarter.
Turning to Exploration and Production. Exploration and Production operations in the second quarter of 2010 had income of $488 million compared with $551 million in the first quarter. The first quarter results included after-tax income of $58 million relating to the sale of the corporation's interest in the Jambi Merang field in Indonesia. Excluding the effect of this asset sale, the change in the after-tax components of the results are as follows: lower selling prices, primarily natural gas, decreased earnings by $30 million; increased exploration expense reduced earnings by $18 million; increased depreciation expense reduced earnings by $11 million; lower cash operating costs increased earnings by $21 million. All other items net to an increase in earnings of $16 million, for an overall decrease in second quarter adjusted earnings of $5 million.
In the second quarter of 2010, our E&P operations were under-lifted compared with production, resulting in decreased after-tax income in the quarter of approximately $30 million. 
Total production unit costs for the first six months of the year amounted to $27.65 per barrel of oil equivalent. We are reducing our total production unit cost guidance for the full year by $1 per barrel to $28.50 to $30.50 per barrel. E&P cash operating costs are expected to be in the range of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel, down from the previous guidance of $15 to $16 per barrel.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges are expected to be in the range of $14 to $15 per barrel, down from $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel.  The E&P effective income tax rate was 43% in the second quarter. For the full year of 2010, we are reducing our E&P effective tax rate guidance to a range of 44% to 48%, down from 47% to 51%.
Turning to Marketing and Refining. Marketing and Refining operations generated a loss of $19 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with income of $87 million in the first quarter. Refining operations lost $31 million in the second quarter compared with $56 million in the first quarter. The corporation's share of HOVENSA's results after income taxes was a loss of $4 million in the second quarter compared with $52 million in the first quarter, reflecting improved refining margins in the second quarter. Also the first quarter included turnaround expenses of approximately $20 million after income taxes for scheduled maintenance on the FCC unit at HOVENSA. 
Port Redding generated a loss of $27 million in the second quarter compared to a loss of $4 million in the first quarter. During the second quarter, this refining facility was shut down for 41 days for a planned turnaround. The turnaround expenses recorded in the second quarter totaled approximately $27 million after income taxes.
Marketing earnings were $17 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with $121 million in the first quarter, principally reflecting seasonally lower margins and sales volumes in Energy Marketing operations. Trading activities generated a loss of $5 million in the second quarter compared with income of $22 million in the first quarter.
Turning to Corporate. Net Corporate expenses amounted to $42 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with $48 million in the first quarter. Net Corporate expenses in the first quarter included an after-tax charge of $7 million for the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of bonds that were scheduled to mature in 2011. After-tax interest was $52 million in both the second and first quarters. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter, including a decrease of $39 million from changes in working capital, was $981 million. Repayments of debt were $15 million. Capital expenditures were $901 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $72 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the second quarter of $7 million.
We had $1,363,000,000 of cash and cash equivalents at June 31, 2010, and $1,362,000,000 at December 31, 2009. Our available revolving credit capacity was $3 billion at June 30, 2010.  Total debt was $4,326,000,000 at June 30, 2010, and $4,467,000,000 million at December 31, 2009. The corporation's debt to capitalization ratio at June 30, 2010 was 22.9% compared with 24.8% at the end of 2009.
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

There's been a lot of numbers speculated by different politicians about what the right cap level is. And some of the things that are being discussed now that we would be supportive of is rigs in the cap to $1 billion were the company that was doing the drilling would be responsible for that $1 billion exposure with insurance on its side. And then having some kind of a cooperative above that where all the investors and operators in the Gulf of Mexico would participate in some kind of insurance cooperative. That then would deal with catastrophic spills. So that kind of idea of having a company number going up to, let's say $1 billion. And then anything in excess of that being a group cooperative is something that we would be supportive of. Things higher than that, I think would be destructive to the competition in the Gulf, and wouldn't be in the United States' interest."

So you do have -- you always have mix. You've got the concept of the under-lift that I mentioned. So it's not a big portion but Libya is a bit under-lifted here in this quarter. But what ends up happening with our forecast is the higher commodity price that you have, brings in more pre-tax income from other areas outside of Libya. And so Libya becomes a smaller percentage of our overall pre-tax income. And therefore, the effective rate becomes lower just when you put the portfolio together. So you have that coming about. And so with these higher commodity prices, we've been forecasting lower rate and that's why we're bringing down the guidance. Now going out, I mean, again, we'll give you the guidance for next year on our January call but the one thing you do see, our guidance is still higher for the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year. And some of the results of that is our Valhall swap. So we will be getting more interest in Valhall. It's a higher rate and so that will be bringing up our rate in the second half of the year, and obviously then we'll have a higher interest in Valhall going into 2011. So that can cause that rate again to be a little higher than where it is right now."

I will make a few brief comments, after which John Rielly will review our financial results. Net income for the third quarter of 2010 was $1.154 billion versus $341 million a year ago. Our",682,"Thank you, Jay, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I will make a few brief comments, after which John Rielly will review our financial results. Net income for the third quarter of 2010 was $1.154 billion versus $341 million a year ago. Our third quarter operating results were positively impacted by higher crude oil and natural gas selling prices and sales volumes compared to the year-ago quarter. 
This quarter's results also included an after-tax gain of $1.072 billion associated with our strategic asset trade with Shell, which closed in September, as well as an after-tax charge of $347 million to write off the West Med Block 1 Concession, offshore Egypt.  Excluding these non-recurring items, Exploration and Production earned $552 million. 
Crude oil and natural gas production averaged 413,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 2% below the year-ago period. Lower year-over-year production resulted primarily from natural field declines at the Ceiba Field in Equatorial Guinea and planned downtime at the Valhall Field in Norway, which was partially offset by higher production from our Bakken program in North Dakota. 
Current net production from the Bakken is approximately 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with nine rigs working. We plan to add one additional rig in November and expect to exit this year with net production of about 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our acquisition of American Oil & Gas is progressing through the regulatory process and is expected to close by the end of the year. 
In September, we closed on both the strategic asset trade with Shell and the acquisition of Total's interests in the Valhall and Hod Fields in Norway, which together raised our interest in these fields to 64.05% and 62.5%, respectively.  Also in September, we announced the acquisition of an additional 20% interest in the Tubular Bells oil and gas field in the Gulf of Mexico from BP for $40 million. Following regulatory approval, Hess will have a 40% working interest and become the operator. 
In the United Kingdom, the sale of non-core North Sea natural gas assets is now expected to close in the fourth quarter. These assets have net production of 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and year-end 2009 proved reserves of 29 million barrels of oil equivalent. 
With regard to Exploration, we drilled two wells on our 100%-owned Permit WA-390-P in the Northwest Shelf of Australia, resulting in two discoveries. We have now completed our 16 commitment wells on the block with 13 discoveries. We have initiated an appraisal program that will continue through the middle of next year and include additional drilling and flow testing of several wells. Commercial discussions with potential partners regarding WA-390-P are ongoing. 
In December, we expect to spud exploration wells on our 40%-owned BM-S-22 block in Brazil, our 100%-owned Tano Cape Three Points block in Ghana and our 80%-owned North Red Sea Block 1 Concession in Egypt. In the first quarter of 2011, we plan to drill our 100%-owned Semai V block in Indonesia.  
In terms of unconventional resources, we plan to start drilling in the Eagle Ford in Texas in November and in the Paris Basin in France in the first quarter of 2011. 
Turning to Marketing and Refining. We reported a loss for the third quarter of $38 million. Refining margins weakened from last year's third quarter primarily due to lower gasoline and residual fuel oil crack spreads and higher fuel costs at our HOVENSA's joint venture refinery and lower gasoline crack spreads at our Port Reading, New Jersey facility. 
Marketing results were better than the year-ago quarter principally due to improved margins in our Energy Marketing business. Retail gasoline volumes on a per-site basis were up 1%, while convenience store sales rose nearly 3%. In Energy Marketing, natural gas sales were higher year-over-year, while fuel oil and electricity sales were lower. 
In conclusion, we are pleased with the recent transactions that we believe strengthen our global portfolio, and will contribute to our company's future reserve and production growth. 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."
249841,114225435,82258,"Hess Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Hess Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare third quarter 2010 results to the second quarter. The Corporation generated consolidated net income of over $1,154,000,000 in the third quarter of 2010, including after-tax income of $72",800,"Thanks, John. Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare third quarter 2010 results to the second quarter. 
The Corporation generated consolidated net income of over $1,154,000,000 in the third quarter of 2010, including after-tax income of $725 million from items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, compared with $375 million in the second quarter. 
Turning to Exploration and Production. Exploration and Production operations had income of $1,277,000,000 in the third quarter of 2010, compared with $488 million in the second quarter. The third quarter results included an after-tax gain of $1,072,000,000 relating to the exchange of the corporation's interests in Gabon and the Clair Field in the United Kingdom, for additional interests in the Valhall and Hod Fields in Norway. The results also included an after-tax charge totaling $347 million to write off our investments in the West Med Block, located offshore Egypt. 
The impairment resulted from the third quarter decision by Hess and the other concession partners to cease future exploration activities and to relinquish a significant portion of the block. 
Excluding the effect of these matters, the changes in the after-tax components of the results are as follows: higher sales volumes increased earnings by $127 million; increased Production expenses reduced earnings by $25 million; increased Exploration expenses reduced earnings by $16 million; increased depreciation reduced earnings by $13 million; lower selling prices decreased earnings by $6 million; all other items net to a decrease in earnings of $3 million, for an overall increase in third quarter adjusted earnings of $64 million. 
The previously mentioned exchange of the Corporation's interests in Gabon and the Clair Field increased our interest in the Valhall Field by 28.1% and the Hod Field by 25%. This exchange was accounted for at fair value and resulted in a gain in the quarter. 
In September 2010, the Corporation also completed the acquisition of a 7.85% interest in Valhall and a 12.5% in Hod for cash of $507 million. After completion of these acquisitions, the Corporation has total interest of 64.05% in the Valhall Field and 62.5% in the Hod Field. 
In the third quarter of 2010, our E&P operations were overlifted compared with Production, resulting in increased after-tax income in the quarter of approximately $60 million. The E&P effective income tax rate was 44% in the quarter and year-to-date in 2010. 
Turning to Marketing and Refining. Marketing and Refining operations generated losses of $38 million in the third quarter of 2010 compared with $19 million in the second quarter. 
Refining operations had losses of $50 million in the third quarter and $31 million in the previous quarter. The Corporation's share of HOVENSA's results, after income taxes, was a loss of $52 million in the third quarter, compared with $4 million in the second quarter, reflecting lower refining margins in the third quarter. 
Port Reading reported income of $2 million in the third quarter, compared to a loss of $27 million in the second quarter. During the second quarter, this refining facility was shut down for 41 days for a planned turnaround. The turnaround expenses recorded in the second quarter totaled approximately $27 million after income taxes. 
Marketing earnings were $40 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared with $17 million in the prior quarter, principally reflecting higher electricity margins and sales volumes. Trading activities generated a loss of $28 million in the third quarter, compared with $5 million in the second quarter. 
Turning to Corporate. Net Corporate expenses were $26 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared with $42 million in the second quarter. Net Corporate expenses were lower in the third quarter, primarily reflecting lower bank facility fees and other general and administrative expenses. 
After-tax interest expense was $59 million in the third quarter, compared with $52 million in the second quarter. In August 2010, the Corporation issued $1.25 billion of 30-year unsecured notes with a coupon of 5.6%. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter, including an increase of $136 million from changes in working capital, was $1,246,000,000. Net proceeds from the bond offering were $1,241,000,000. Capital expenditures were $1,462,000,000. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $35 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of $990 million. 
We had $2,353,000,000 of cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2010, and $1,362,000,000 at December 31, 2009. Our available revolving credit capacity was $3 billion at September 30, 2010. Total debt was $5,584,000,000 at September 30, 2010, and $4,467,000,000 at December 31, 2009. The Corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio at September 30, 2010, was 26.1%, compared with 24.8% at the end of 2009.

We're on track to exit the year at a net production rate of about 20,000 barrels a day. As we said, we're marching our way towards 80,000 barrels a day in our existing position in the Bakken. Regarding the American Oil & Gas position, of course, we have not yet acquired that. We're optimistic that, that will close, but it's early days. We'd like to get a few wells in the ground before we issue any additional production guidance associated with that. But obviously, we're excited about the acreage, otherwise, we wouldn't have acquired it. Just briefly, well costs are coming in at about $11 million each for dual lateral. EUR is about 1 million barrels per dual and our 30-day average IP rates are on the order of 400 to 500 barrels per day per lateral from 18-stage fracs. So that gives you kind of an overall update on the Bakken."

I will make a few brief comments after which John Rielly will review our financial results.Net income for the third quarter of 2010 was $1.154 billion, versus $341 million a year ago. Our",691,"Thank you, Jay and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I will make a few brief comments after which John Rielly will review our financial results.
Net income for the third quarter of 2010 was $1.154 billion, versus $341 million a year ago. Our third quarter operating results were positively impacted by higher crude oil and natural gas selling prices and sales volumes compared to the year ago quarter.
This quarter's results also included an after-tax gain of $1.072 billion associated with our strategic asset trade with Shell, which closed in September as well as an after-tax charge of $347 million to write-off the West Med Block 1 concession off shore Egypt.
Excluding these non-recurring items, exploration and production earned $552 million. Crude oil and natural gas production averaged 413,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 2% below the year-ago period.
Lower year-over-year production resulted primarily from natural field decline to the Ceiba Field in Equatorial Guinea and planned downtime at the Valhall field in Norway, which was partially offset by higher production from our Bakken program in North Dakota.
Current net production from the Bakken is approximately 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with nine rigs working. We plan to add one additional rig in November and expect to exit this year with net production of about 20,000 barrels of oil equipment per day.
Our acquisition of American Oil & Gas is progressing through the regulatory process and is expected to close by the end of the year. In September we closed on both the strategic asset trade with Shell and the acquisition of Total's interest in the Valhall and the Hod fields in Norway, which together raised our interest in these fields to 64.5% and 62.5% respectively.
Also, in September we announced the acquisition of an additional 20% interest in the Tubular Bells oil and gas field in the Gulf of Mexico from BP for $40 million. Following regulatory approval Hess will have a 40% working interest and become the operator.
In the United Kingdom, the sale of non-quartered, nor seen natural gas assets is now expected to close in the fourth quarter, these assets have net production of 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and year end 2009 proved reserves of 29 million barrels of oil barrel equivalent.
With regard to explorations we drilled two wells on our 100% owned permit WA390P in the Northwest Shelf of Australia, resulting in two discoveries. We have now completed our 16 commitment wells on the block with 13 discoveries. We have initiated an appraisal program that will continue through the middle of next year and include additional drilling and flow testing of several wells.
Commercial discussions with potential partners regarding WA309P are ongoing. In December we expect to spud exploration wells on our 40% owned BMS-22 block in Brazil, our 100% owned Tano/Cape Three Points Block in Ghana and our 80% owned North Red Sea Block One concession in Egypt.
In the first quarter of 2011 we plan to drill our 100% owned semi five block in Indonesia. In terms of unconventional resources, we plan to start drilling in the EagleFord in Texas in November and in the Paris base and in France in the first quarter of 2011.
Turning to marketing and refining, we reported a loss for the third quarter of $38 million. Refining margins weakened from last years third quarter, primarily due to lower gasoline and residual fuel oil crack spreads and higher fuel costs at our HOVENSA's joint venture refinery and lower gasoline crack spreads at our Port Reading, New Jersey facility.
Marketing results were better than the year ago quarter, principally due improved margins in our energy marketing business. Retail gasoline volumes on a per site basis were up 1% while convenient store sales rose nearly 3%. In energy marketing natural gas sales were higher year-over-year while fuel, oil and electricity sales were lower.
In conclusion we are pleased with the recent transactions that we believe strengthen our global portfolio and will contribute to our Company's future reserve and production growth.
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly.

In my remarks today I will compare third quarter 2010 results to the second quarter. The corporation generated consolidated net income of $1.154 billion in the third quarter of 2010, including after tax income of $725 million",816,"Thanks John. Hello everyone. In my remarks today I will compare third quarter 2010 results to the second quarter. The corporation generated consolidated net income of $1.154 billion in the third quarter of 2010, including after tax income of $725 million from items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, compared with $375 million in the second quarter.
Turing to exploration and production, exploration and production operations had income of $1.277 billion in the third quarter of 2010, compared with $488 million in the second quarter. The third quarter results included an after tax gain of $1.072 billion relating to the exchange in the corporations interest in Gabon and the Clare Field in the United Kingdom for additional interest in the Valhall and Hod Fields in Norway.
The results also included an after tax charge totaling $347 million to write off our investments in the West Med Block located off shore Egypt. The impairment resulted from third quarter decision by Hess and the other concession partners to cease future exploration activities and to relinquish a significant portion of the block.
Excluding the effect of these matters, the changes in the after tax components of the results are as follows. Higher sales volumes increased earnings by $127 million. Increased production expenses reduced earnings by $25 million. Increased exploration expenses reduced earnings by $16 million. Increased depreciation reduced earnings by $13 million. Lower selling prices decreased earnings by $6 million. All other items led to a decrease in earnings of $3 million for an overall increase in third quarter adjusted earnings of $64 million.
The previously mentioned exchange of the corporation's interest in Gabon and the Clair field increased our interest in the Valhall field by 28.1% and the Hod field by 25%. This exchange was accounted for its fair value and resulted in a gain in the quarter.
In September 2010, the corporation also completed the acquisition of a 7.85% interest in Valhall and a 12.5% interest in Hod for cash of $507 million. After completion of these acquisitions, the corporation has total interest of 64.05% in the Valhall field and 62.5% in the Hod field.
In the third quarter of 2010, our E&P operations were overliftsed compared with production, resulting in increased after-tax income in the quarter of approximately $60 million. The E&P effective income tax-rate was 44% in the quarter and year-to-date in 2010.
Turning to Marketing and Refining, Marketing and Refining operations generated losses of $38 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared with $19 million in the second quarter. Refining operations had losses of $50 million in the third quarter and $31 million in the previous quarter.
The corporation's share of HOVENSA's results after income taxes was a loss of $52 million in the third quarter, compared with $4 million in the second quarter, reflecting lower refining margins in the third quarter.
Port Reading reported income of $2 million in the third quarter, compared to a loss of $27 million in the second quarter. During the second quarter, this refining facility was shut down for 41 days for a planned turnaround. The turnaround expenses recorded in the second quarter totaled approximately $27 million after income taxes.
Marketing earnings were $40 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared with $17 million in the prior quarter, principally reflecting higher electricity margins and sales volumes. Trading activities generated a loss of $28 million in the third quarter compared with $5 million in the second quarter.
Turning to corporate, net corporate expenses were $26 million in the third quarter of 2010 compared with $42 million in the second quarter. Net corporate expenses were lower in the third quarter, primarily reflecting lower bank facility fees and other general and administrative expenses.
After-tax interest expense was $59 million in the third quarter, compared with $52 million in the second quarter. In August 2010, the corporation issued $1.25 billion of 30-year unsecured notes with a coupon of 5.6%.
Turning to cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter, including an increase of $136 million from changes in working capital was $1.246 billion. Net proceeds from the bond offering were $1.241 billion.
Capital expenditures were $1.462 billion. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $35 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of $990 million. We had $2.353 billion of cash and cash equivalent at September 30th 2010 and $1.362 billion at December 31st 2009.
Our available revolving credit capacity was $3 billion at September 30th 2010. Total debt was $5.584 billion at September 30th 2010 and $4.467 billion at December 31st 2009. The corporation's debt to capitalization ratio at September 30th 2010 was 26.1%, compared with 24.8% at the end of 2009.
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator.

So, that's the way you think about our production guidance but that really is a minimum and then as you rightfully point out as the Gulf of Mexico regulatory environment gets clarified hopefully we will be able to sanction both the pony and Tubular Bells developments that would be incremental to our picture. As well as hopefully some success either in other unconventional that Greg is talking about or some of the exploratory prospects that we have longer term.

So, we continue to make significant progress towards sanction of Pony, so we just signed a letter of agreement, a confidentiality agreement and a data trade agreement with the Knotty Head partners. So, the next step now is negotiate the JOA, which should be completed early next year. Obviously, the timing of the sanction is uncertain due to the permitting delays, but specifically due the Pony 3 well. We intend to get back to Pony 3 as soon as we can obtain the permit from the BOEM and we are in the process of filing all that paper work as we speak. And so, really, just for a planning assumption we're assuming that we can get back to Pony 3 sometime in the second half of 2011. Now that doesn't mean we're still not pursuing doing all the design work, the feed work, progressing the JOA, you know, with partners, all those things to move Pony forward.

I will make a few brief comments, after which John Rielly will review our financial results. Net income for the third quarter of 2010 was $1.154 billion versus $341 million a year ago. Our",682,"Thank you, Jay, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I will make a few brief comments, after which John Rielly will review our financial results. Net income for the third quarter of 2010 was $1.154 billion versus $341 million a year ago. Our third quarter operating results were positively impacted by higher crude oil and natural gas selling prices and sales volumes compared to the year-ago quarter. 
This quarter's results also included an after-tax gain of $1.072 billion associated with our strategic asset trade with Shell, which closed in September, as well as an after-tax charge of $347 million to write off the West Med Block 1 Concession, offshore Egypt.  Excluding these non-recurring items, Exploration and Production earned $552 million. 
Crude oil and natural gas production averaged 413,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 2% below the year-ago period. Lower year-over-year production resulted primarily from natural field declines at the Ceiba Field in Equatorial Guinea and planned downtime at the Valhall Field in Norway, which was partially offset by higher production from our Bakken program in North Dakota. 
Current net production from the Bakken is approximately 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with nine rigs working. We plan to add one additional rig in November and expect to exit this year with net production of about 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our acquisition of American Oil & Gas is progressing through the regulatory process and is expected to close by the end of the year. 
In September, we closed on both the strategic asset trade with Shell and the acquisition of Total's interests in the Valhall and Hod Fields in Norway, which together raised our interest in these fields to 64.05% and 62.5%, respectively.  Also in September, we announced the acquisition of an additional 20% interest in the Tubular Bells oil and gas field in the Gulf of Mexico from BP for $40 million. Following regulatory approval, Hess will have a 40% working interest and become the operator. 
In the United Kingdom, the sale of non-core North Sea natural gas assets is now expected to close in the fourth quarter. These assets have net production of 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and year-end 2009 proved reserves of 29 million barrels of oil equivalent. 
With regard to Exploration, we drilled two wells on our 100%-owned Permit WA-390-P in the Northwest Shelf of Australia, resulting in two discoveries. We have now completed our 16 commitment wells on the block with 13 discoveries. We have initiated an appraisal program that will continue through the middle of next year and include additional drilling and flow testing of several wells. Commercial discussions with potential partners regarding WA-390-P are ongoing. 
In December, we expect to spud exploration wells on our 40%-owned BM-S-22 block in Brazil, our 100%-owned Tano Cape Three Points block in Ghana and our 80%-owned North Red Sea Block 1 Concession in Egypt. In the first quarter of 2011, we plan to drill our 100%-owned Semai V block in Indonesia.  
In terms of unconventional resources, we plan to start drilling in the Eagle Ford in Texas in November and in the Paris Basin in France in the first quarter of 2011. 
Turning to Marketing and Refining. We reported a loss for the third quarter of $38 million. Refining margins weakened from last year's third quarter primarily due to lower gasoline and residual fuel oil crack spreads and higher fuel costs at our HOVENSA's joint venture refinery and lower gasoline crack spreads at our Port Reading, New Jersey facility. 
Marketing results were better than the year-ago quarter principally due to improved margins in our Energy Marketing business. Retail gasoline volumes on a per-site basis were up 1%, while convenience store sales rose nearly 3%. In Energy Marketing, natural gas sales were higher year-over-year, while fuel oil and electricity sales were lower. 
In conclusion, we are pleased with the recent transactions that we believe strengthen our global portfolio, and will contribute to our company's future reserve and production growth. 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare third quarter 2010 results to the second quarter. The Corporation generated consolidated net income of $1,154,000,000 in the third quarter of 2010, including after-tax income of $725 mil",800,"Thanks, John. Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare third quarter 2010 results to the second quarter. 
The Corporation generated consolidated net income of $1,154,000,000 in the third quarter of 2010, including after-tax income of $725 million from items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, compared with $375 million in the second quarter. 
Turning to Exploration and Production. Exploration and Production operations had income of $1,277,000,000 in the third quarter of 2010, compared with $488 million in the second quarter. The third quarter results included an after-tax gain of $1,072,000,000 relating to the exchange of the corporation's interests in Gabon and the Clair Field in the United Kingdom, for additional interests in the Valhall and Hod Fields in Norway. The results also included an after-tax charge totaling $347 million to write off our investments in the West Med Block, located offshore Egypt. 
The impairment resulted from the third quarter decision by Hess and the other concession partners to cease future exploration activities and to relinquish a significant portion of the block. 
Excluding the effect of these matters, the changes in the after-tax components of the results are as follows: higher sales volumes increased earnings by $127 million; increased Production expenses reduced earnings by $25 million; increased Exploration expenses reduced earnings by $16 million; increased depreciation reduced earnings by $13 million; lower selling prices decreased earnings by $6 million; all other items net to a decrease in earnings of $3 million, for an overall increase in third quarter adjusted earnings of $64 million. 
The previously mentioned exchange of the Corporation's interests in Gabon and the Clair Field increased our interest in the Valhall Field by 28.1% and the Hod Field by 25%. This exchange was accounted for at fair value and resulted in a gain in the quarter. 
In September 2010, the Corporation also completed the acquisition of a 7.85% interest in Valhall and a 12.5% interest in Hod for cash of $507 million. After completion of these acquisitions, the Corporation has total interest of 64.05% in the Valhall Field and 62.5% in the Hod Field. 
In the third quarter of 2010, our E&P operations were overlifted compared with Production, resulting in increased after-tax income in the quarter of approximately $60 million. The E&P effective income tax rate was 44% in the quarter and year-to-date in 2010. 
Turning to Marketing and Refining. Marketing and Refining operations generated losses of $38 million in the third quarter of 2010 compared with $19 million in the second quarter. 
Refining operations had losses of $50 million in the third quarter and $31 million in the previous quarter. The Corporation's share of HOVENSA's results, after income taxes, was a loss of $52 million in the third quarter, compared with $4 million in the second quarter, reflecting lower refining margins in the third quarter. 
Port Reading reported income of $2 million in the third quarter, compared to a loss of $27 million in the second quarter. During the second quarter, this refining facility was shut down for 41 days for a planned turnaround. The turnaround expenses recorded in the second quarter totaled approximately $27 million after income taxes. 
Marketing earnings were $40 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared with $17 million in the prior quarter, principally reflecting higher electricity margins and sales volumes. Trading activities generated a loss of $28 million in the third quarter, compared with $5 million in the second quarter. 
Turning to Corporate. Net Corporate expenses were $26 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared with $42 million in the second quarter. Net Corporate expenses were lower in the third quarter, primarily reflecting lower bank facility fees and other general and administrative expenses. 
After-tax interest expense was $59 million in the third quarter, compared with $52 million in the second quarter. In August 2010, the Corporation issued $1.25 billion of 30-year unsecured notes with a coupon of 5.6%. 
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter, including an increase of $136 million from changes in working capital, was $1,246,000,000. Net proceeds from the bond offering were $1,241,000,000. Capital expenditures were $1,462,000,000. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $35 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of $990 million. 
We had $2,353,000,000 of cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2010, and $1,362,000,000 at December 31, 2009. Our available revolving credit capacity was $3 billion at September 30, 2010. Total debt was $5,584,000,000 at September 30, 2010, and $4,467,000,000 at December 31, 2009. The Corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio at September 30, 2010, was 26.1%, compared with 24.8% at the end of 2009. 
This concludes my remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

Regarding the American Oil & Gas position, of course, we have not yet acquired that. We're optimistic that, that will close, but it's early days. We'd like to get a few wells in the ground before we issue any additional production guidance associated with that. But obviously, we're excited about the acreage, otherwise, we wouldn't have acquired it. Just briefly, well costs are coming in at about $11 million each for dual lateral.

I will make a few brief comments, after which John Rielly will review our financial results.Net income for the second quarter of 2010 was $375 million versus $100 million a year ago. Our",1021,"Thank you, Jay, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. I will make a few brief comments, after which John Rielly will review our financial results.
Net income for the second quarter of 2010 was $375 million versus $100 million a year ago. Our results were positively impacted by higher crude oil and natural gas selling prices and lower exploration expense compared to the year-ago quarter.
Exploration and Production earned $488 million. Crude oil and natural gas production averaged 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 2% above the year-ago period. Higher year-over-year production resulted primarily from increased volumes from the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Valhall Field in Norway.
Net production from the Bakken is currently more than 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we remain on track to exit this year at a net rate of about 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We added three additional rigs during the second quarter and currently have eight rigs dedicated to drilling Bakken wells.
As a result of strong year-to-date production performance, we have raised our full year 2010 production forecast to a range of 405,000 to 415,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, from our previously forecasted range of 400,000 to 410,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Regarding the recent tragic accident in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we are deeply saddened by the devastating loss of life, ecological damage to the Gulf Coast and severe economic impact on local communities. While our company believes we have extremely high performance requirements for the safety of drilling operations, we and our industry need to do all we can to learn from this disaster and to take the necessary precautions to ensure such a tragedy never happens again.
The near-term impact of the moratorium on Hess is expected to be relatively minimal. Our only operated rig in the Gulf of Mexico, the Stena Forth, left the Pony #3 location on Green Canyon 469 in June as part of a pre-existing farm-out agreement. We anticipate completing the Pony #3 well as soon as practicable, following the lifting of the moratorium. The drilling of a production well at the Shenzi Field, in which Hess has a 28% interest, was suspended as a result of the moratorium, but this delay is expected to have only a very modest impact on our 2010 production.
In June, we announced our intent to preempt BP on their acquisition of Total's interest in the Valhall and Hod Fields in Norway. Hess will pay $496 million in cash for an additional 7.85% interest in the Valhall Field and 12.5% interest in the Hod Field, adding proved reserves of approximately 45 million barrels of oil equivalent. This preemption, along with the previously announced asset swap with Shell, will result in our share of the Valhall and Hod Fields increasing to 64.05% and 62.5%, respectively. Both transactions are expected to close by the end of the third quarter.
During the second quarter, we made progress in our strategy to grow our global inventory of unconventional resource opportunities. In May, we announced a partnership with Toreador Resources under which Hess will invest up to $65 million in an initial exploration phase and has the option to earn a 50% working interest and become the operator in more than 1 million gross acres in the Paris Basin in France. An initial six-well program will commence in the fourth quarter and continue through 2011.
Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of American Oil & Gas Inc. for 8.6 million shares of Hess common stock. This transaction will add approximately 85,000 net acres in the Williston Basin in North Dakota, build upon Hess' strong land position, leverage our infrastructure and enhance our growth profile in the Bakken oil play. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
With regard to exploration, we drilled two wells on our 100% owned Permit WA-390-P in the Northwest Shelf of Australia, resulting in one discovery and one dry hole. We have now drilled 14 wells on the block, resulting in 11 discoveries. We expect to complete our remaining two commitment wells during the third quarter, followed by an appraisal program that will include additional drilling and flow testing of several wells. Commercial discussions with potential partners regarding WA-390-P are ongoing.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to spud exploration wells on our 40% owned BM-S-22 Block in Brazil and our 100% owned Tano Cape Three Points Block in Ghana. In addition, we plan to drill our 100% owned Semai V prospect in Indonesia during the first quarter of 2011.
Turning to Marketing and Refining, we reported a loss of $19 million, an improvement over the year-ago quarter. Refining margins at our HOVENSA joint venture refinery improved from last year's second quarter as a result of higher distillate crack spreads and wider light/heavy crude differentials. This improvement in refining was more than offset by costs associated with the planned turnaround of the FCC and other related units at our Port Redding, New Jersey facility.
Marketing results were better than the year-ago quarter, principally due to improved margins. Although, Retail Marketing gasoline volumes on a per site basis were down about 4%, total convenience store sales were up nearly 7%. In Energy Marketing, oil sales were higher year-over-year, while natural gas and electricity sales were lower.
Capital and exploratory expenditures in the first half of 2010 were $1.8 billion, substantially all of which were related to Exploration and Production activities. For the full year 2010, our capital and exploratory expenditures forecast has increased to $5.5 billion from $4.1 billion. The increase primarily reflects the acquisition of additional interests in the Valhall and Hod Fields from Total, the acquisition of American Oil & Gas, and further appraisal of Permit WA-390-P in Australia.
We are pleased to make these acquisitions that will help us sustain profitable growth in reserves and production. At the same time, we are maintaining our financial strength, which will provide us the ability to fund future investments. 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare second quarter 2010 results to the first quarter.
The corporation generated consolidated net income of $375 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with $538 million in the first quarter.
Turning to Exploration and Production. Exploration and Production operations in the second quarter of 2010 had income of $488 million compared with $551 million in the first quarter. The first quarter results included after-tax income of $58 million, relating to the sale of the corporation's interest in the Jambi Merang field in Indonesia. Excluding the effect of this asset sale, the change in the after-tax components of the results are as follows: Lower selling prices, primarily natural gas, decreased earnings by $13 million; increased exploration expense reduced earnings by $18 million; increased depreciation expense reduced earnings by $11 million; lower cash operating costs increased earnings by $21 million; all other items net to an increase in earnings of $16 million; for an overall decrease in second quarter adjusted earnings of $5 million.
In the second quarter of 2010, our E&P operations were under lifted compared with production, resulting in decreased after-tax income in the quarter of approximately $30 million.
Total production unit costs for the first six months of the year amounted to $27.65 per barrel of oil equivalent. We are reducing our total production unit cost guidance for the full year by $1 per barrel to $28.50 to $30.50 per barrel. E&P cash operating costs are expected to be in the range of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel, down from the previous guidance of $15 to $16 per barrel. Depreciation, depletion and amortization charges are expected to be in the range of $14 to $15 per barrel, down from $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel.
The E&P effective income tax rate was 43% in the second quarter. For the full year of 2010, we are reducing our E&P effective tax rate guidance to a range of 44% to 48%, down from 47% to 51%.
Turning to Marketing and Refining. Marketing and Refining operations generated a loss of $19 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with income of $87 million in the first quarter.
Refining operations lost $31 million in the second quarter compared with $56 million in the first quarter. The corporation's share of HOVENSA's results, after income taxes, was a loss of $4 million in the second quarter compared with $52 million in the first quarter, reflecting improved refining margins in the second quarter. Also, the first quarter included turnaround expenses of approximately $20 million, after income taxes, for scheduled maintenance on the FCC unit at HOVENSA.
Port Redding generated a loss of $27 million in the second quarter compared to a loss of $4 million in the first quarter. During the second quarter, this refining facility was shut down for 41 days for a planned turnaround. The turnaround expenses recorded in the second quarter totaled approximately $27 million, after income taxes.
Marketing earnings were $17 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with $121 million in the first quarter, principally reflecting seasonally lower margins and sales volumes in Energy Marketing operations. Trading activities generated a loss of $5 million in the second quarter compared with income of $22 million in the first quarter.
Turning to Corporate. Net Corporate expenses amounted to $42 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with $48 million in the first quarter. Net Corporate expenses in the first quarter included an after-tax charge of $7 million for the repurchase of the remaining $116 million of bonds that were scheduled to mature in 2011.
After-tax interest was $52 million in both the second and first quarters.
Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter, including a decrease of $39 million from changes in working capital, was $981 million. Repayments of debt were $15 million. Capital expenditures were $901 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $72 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the second quarter of $7 million.
We had $1,363,000,000 of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2010, and $1,362,000,000 at December 31, 2009. Our available revolving credit capacity was $3 billion at June 30, 2010. Total debt was $4,326,000,000 at June 30, 2010, and $4,467,000,000 at December 31, 2009. The corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio at June 30, 2010, was 22.9% compared with 24.8% at the end of 2009.
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

So you do have -- you always have mix, you've got the concept of the under lift that I mentioned. So it's not a big portion, but Libya is a bit under lifted here in this quarter. But what ends up happening with our forecast is the higher commodity price that you have brings in more pretax income from other areas outside of Libya. And so Libya becomes a smaller percentage of our overall pretax income. And therefore, the effective rate becomes lower just when you put the portfolio together, so you have that coming about. So with these higher commodity prices, we've been forecasting lower rate and that's why we're bringing down the guidance. Now going out, I mean, again, we will give you the guidance for next year on our January call. But the one thing you do see, our guidance is still higher for the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year. And some of the results of that is our Valhall swaps. So we will be getting more interest in Valhall. It's a higher rate.

There is a much lower threshold today that for all practical purposes, BP has said: ""We're going to pay all reasonable costs well above that cap."" They're obviously very prominent, large, global company. You all may not be as large as BP, but you're also pretty well known. Is it practical to think a liability cap does have meaning for a company like Hess? Hopefully, there won't be further catastrophic damages. Hopefully, it wouldn't involve you, if there is one, but you never know. Do you think practically speaking, that if there is a liability cap, you could effect it? Or like BP, do you just face so much pressure that you end up paying all that you have to pay?"

Obviously, this was a catastrophe. God willing, it doesn't happen again. But having said that, the world has change. And with the world changing, the cap should be raised. It should reflect the risk that one has in drilling in deepwater. And we've heard a lot of numbers out there, so we want our voice heard. And we think a middle ground of saying $1 billion, which is a big number, but the cost of drilling the wells and the exposure of drilling wells in deepwater is high. So you have to have a cap that reflects that. But then again, for a catastrophe, I think that's where mutual insurance, cooperative insurance comes in. And that's why above the $1 billion, I think it makes sense for a group to ensure the risk as opposed to any sole company. Because otherwise, just one or two companies would drill in the Gulf, and I don't think that would be a good outcome for anybody."
