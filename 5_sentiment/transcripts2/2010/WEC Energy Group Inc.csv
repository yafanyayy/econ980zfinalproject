We appreciate you joining us on our conference call to review the company’s 2009 year end results. 
Let me begin as always by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy Management team who are here with me today. We have Rick Kuester, President and CEO of We Generation; Alan Leverett, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Fleming, our venerable General Counsel; Jeff West, Treasurer; and Steve Dickson, Controller. Allen will of course review our financial results in detail in just a moment. 
As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $3.20 a share for 2009. This compares with $3.03 a share for 2008. While we saw a significant decline in the sale of electricity, because of the recession and a very cool summer, our 2009 earnings were boosted by a full year’s contribution from our Power, the Future investments in the second generating unit at Port Washington, and the water intake system at Oak Creek, and by significant cost reductions across our business. 
Overall I’m very pleased with our financial and operational performance. From customer satisfaction to network reliability, to progress on our Power the Future plan, the company made great strides during the year, and in a tough economy, we posted solid financial results. 
Now I’d like to spend just a moment on our continuing effort to upgrade the energy infrastructure in Wisconsin. Our Power the Future plan is fundamental to the principle of energy self-sufficiency. Key components of our focus on self-sufficiency include investing in two combined cycle gas fired units at Port Washington, north of Milwaukee; the construction of two supercritical pulverized coal units at Oak Creek, which is south of the city; and building a significant amount of renewable generation. 
As we’ve discussed on our previous calls, both units at Port Washington are in service. Construction was completed on time and on budget. The units are among the most efficient in the Midwest market that are operating well, and our customers are now benefiting from the low price of natural gas that fuels these units. 
Let’s turn now to the status of the two new coal fired units at Oak Creek: I’m delighted to report that Unit 1 has passed all of its performance tests and was declared commercial today at a minute after midnight. The critical performance measures included an efficiency test, various emission tests, a capacity test, and a 15-day reliability run. 
I’d like to mention to you that the results of these tests are of particular note. The efficiency tests or what we call the heat rate test, measures the efficiency at which the unit converts fuel into electricity. The more efficient the unit, the less coal we have to burn, and therefore the lower the cost for each unit of electricity produced. 
For Unit 1 of the Oak Creek expansion, the demonstrated heat rate is 5% better than the guarantee, and places this unit among the best four or five coal fired plants in the country in terms of efficiency. 
With regard to emissions, we have been even more impressed by the plant’s initial performance. The recorded emission levels for each of the 15 pollutants measured at the stack were significantly lower than the levels allowed by our air permit. In many cases such as sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and mercury, the levels were actually a fraction of that allowed. 
The guaranteed capacity as you know of each unit is 615 megawatts net. This means that the unit must be capable of delivering 615 megawatts into the transmission network. Well, during the testing, the output was measured at 622 megawatts, and we believe the unit can actually deliver significantly more than 622 megawatts, based on the extra margin available in both the boiler and the steam turbine generator. 
Of course time flies when you’re having fun, but we first announced our Power the Future plan ten years ago, to break Wisconsin’s dependence on expensive out of state energy, and to ensure a reliable supply of electricity to our customers in the decade ahead. With today’s announcement, we have take in a huge step towards completing the Power the Future plan. 
As you know, the new coal units at Oak Creek have been particularly challenging. Four of the project’s five major permits faced legal challenges, all of which have now been resolved. We had to battle two of the worst winters in history, including the ‘07, ‘08 winter, which saw the highest recorded snowfall in Milwaukee in 100 years, but with the focus and determination of Bechtel, and thousands of skilled craft workers, we were able to complete this first unit at Oak Creek within 120 hours of the revised guaranteed in-service date. 
As for Unit 2, I’m pleased to report that Bechtel continues to make good progress. Unit 2 is now approximately 87% complete, and Bechtel has started turning over the major systems from its construction group to its start-up team. The boiler and feed water systems have been successfully pressure tested in Unit 2, and the unit’s piping is now being chemically cleaned to prepare for first fire on gas. That’s the next major milestone, first fire on gas, and it’s scheduled for mid April. 
The turbine generator has been installed at Unit 2. It’s been aligned and enclosed, and the turbine bearing oil is currently being flushed in preparation for the turbine to be placed on the turning gear. Although the new guaranteed in-service date is November 28 for Unit 2, Bechtel is still targeting commercial operation by the end of August. 
Now as we reported to you in December, we have settled all claims with Bechtel that were raised in the arbitration proceeding. Through its claims, Bechtel was seeking additional construction costs of $517 million, and schedule relief of seven months and four months for the completion of Units 1 and 2 respectively. 
Our settlement includes the following elements: We agreed to pay Bechtel $72 million, including a $10 million payment that was made in December, and $62 million to be paid in six additional installments tied to the achievement of specific project milestones. As one of three co-owners, we are responsible for approximately 85% of the $72 million. Bechtel received 120 days of scheduled relief for Unit 1, and 60 days of scheduled relief of Unit 2. This extended the guaranteed turnover date for Unit 1 to January 27 of this year, and for Unit 2 till November 28, again of this year. 
Finally, Bechtel released us from all matters related to their claims in the arbitration, and in return we’ve released Bechtel from all matters related to our claims in the arbitration. As we move forward, we will continue to update you on the progress of Unit 2, as well as recovery of any costs that might be above the approved amount. 
Turning now to other important developments over the last few months; a bill containing an extensive set of policy recommendations, designed to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases was introduced in the Wisconsin legislature. The bill would establish statewide goals for carbon dioxide reductions, increase the requirements for generating electricity from renewable sources, and establish new efficiency targets across the state. 
First, the bill would strengthen Wisconsin’s existing renewable portfolio standard, by moving up the deadline for the 10% mandate from the year 2015 to 2013; and the bill would also set new goals of 20% renewable by 2020 and 25% by 2025. Next, the bill would set a state-wide goal to achieve a 2% reduction in energy usage by the year 2015 and annual reductions thereafter. The bill would also authorize the Wisconsin Commission to allow an investor owned utility to earn a return on capital that would be invested in energy conservation or efficiency equipment that would be installed on a customer’s premise. 
Finally, the bill proposes a number of changes to the regulation of nuclear power plants. One of those proposals would allow the Wisconsin Commission to approve a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to build a new nuclear plant. 
The next steps include a series of public hearings that are set to take place between now and late February. We expect some form of the bill would then be considered by both houses of the Wisconsin legislature. Of course our renewable investment plans were designed to meet the standards that are currently in place in Wisconsin. These standards call for an increase in the amount of electricity we supply with renewable sources from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level. 
The standard sets targets, as you may recall for each of the utilities using an historical baseline. Using that baseline, approximately 8.25% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewables in the year 2015. With the completion of our Blue Sky Greenfield Wind Farm in 2008, we took a major step toward meeting Wisconsin’s goals to reduce its carbon footprint. With a total of 88 turbines, each with a capacity of 1.65 megawatts, Blue Sky Greenfield is the largest wind farm to date in Wisconsin. It was completed under budget and ahead of schedule. 
Then in 2008, we purchased a new wind farm development site that’s approximately 45 miles northeast of Madison. The site was purchased from FPL Energy as part of our sale of the Point Beach Nuclear Plant. This site, which we call the Glacier Hills Wind Park, is an ideal location for our newest wind farm. Last week the Wisconsin Commission approved our request for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to build up to 90 wind turbines capable of producing between 135 and 207 megawatts, depending of course on the turbines we select. 
As part of the authorization, the Commission changed certain of the criteria, which could impact our ability to cite a few of the proposed turbines. The precise number of turbines therefore at Glacier Hills will be determined in the coming months, as we incorporate the commission’s citing requirements into the project design, but we’re pleased to be moving forward on what will certainly be a sizable new wind farm to help us meet the renewable mandate in Wisconsin. 
The first full year of operation for Glacier Hills is projected to be 2012. Our current estimate for capital costs for Glacier Hills ranges from $335 million to $414 million, again depending upon which turbines are selected. Our range of estimates does not include any AFUDC or reimbursable transmission costs. 
Last fall, we also announced our plans to build a 50 megawatt biomass fuel power plant at a paper mill site in northern Wisconsin. The paper mill is owned and operated by Domtar Corporation. The purchase of wood, waste wood, and saw dust will be managed by Domtar. We’re fortunate to be close to significant forest lands that can be harvested, and are being harvested in a sustainable manner. These forests have large amounts of wood waste that can be purchased to fuel the plant. 
Diversification of our renewable energy supply is one of our important goals. As compared to wind, the clear benefit from an operational standpoint is that we will be able to dispatch the biomass unit. Our gross investment in this biomass project is expected to be approximately $250 million, with a targeted in-service date in late 2013. With the potential investment tax credit of 30%, our net investment would be approximately $175 million. Our current plan is to file for construction authority with the Wisconsin Commission by the end of the first quarter of this year. 
Finally, we’re also considering approximately 12.5 megawatts of solar projects, with a targeted in-service date of 2013 for the initial investment. Of course, all of these projects are subject to commission review and approval. 
Construction is also underway on a major upgrade of the air quality controls for the existing coal fired units at Oak Creek. We plan to invest approximately $960 million. This is the second largest construction project in our company’s history, and that $960 million estimate includes allowance for funds used during construction, for the installation of a Wet Flue Gas Desulfurization, and selective catalytic reduction facilities. Expect these controls to be completed in the year 2012. 
Turning now to rate case developments; as I’m sure you’re aware, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission in December authorized adjustments to electric, natural gas, and steam rates for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. The Commission approved an increase of approximately $85.8 million or about 3.35% in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric. 
The Commission also approved a decrease of approximately $2 million or about a third of a percent for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric, an increase of approximately $5.7 million or seven-tenth of a percent for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas customers, and a decrease of about $400,000 or about 1.6% for Wisconsin Electric’s downtown Milwaukee steam utility, and a decrease of approximately $100,000 or a little less than 0.5% for our Milwaukee County steam operations. All of these rate adjustments were effective January 1, 2010. 
In addition, the Commission lowered the return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%. The capital structure of the utilities remains unchanged. The authorized common equity range for Wisconsin Electric is 48.5% to 53.5%, and for Wisconsin Gas, the equity range is 45% to 50%. 
In Michigan, on December 16 the Public Service Commission there approved our modified self-implementation plan, to raise electric rates in the state of Michigan by approximately $12 million or 9.5%, effective with the commercial operation of Unit 1 at the Oak Creek expansion. This rate increase is subject to refund with interest, depending upon the Michigan Commission’s final decision on the company’s $42 million annual rate request. We expect the Commission to issue its final order in July of this year. 
Last, but certainly not the least, in January our Board of Directors approved an increase in the annual dividend from $1.35 to $1.60 a share. Our dividend policy continues to target a pay out ratio of 40% to 45% of earnings for this year and for 2011, and starting in 2012, we’ll be targeting a 45% to 50% payout ratio. The first quarterly dividend for this year will be payable on March 1 at a rate of $0.40 a share. 
Now I’ll turn the call over to Allen, who will give you more details on our financial performance for 2009. Allen.

315117,84665721,48020,"Wisconsin Energy Corp., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-02-2010",2010-02-02,"Earnings Calls","WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gale.

I will focus on operating income by segment, and then I’ll touch on other income statement items. I’ll also discuss cash flows for the year, and cover our earnings guidance for 2010. 
Now, our consolidated operating income in 2009 was $664 million as compared to $659 million in 2008, or a slight increase of $5 million. Operating income in our utility energy segment totaled $554 million, a decrease of $27 million versus 2008. 
As Gale mentioned earlier, our utility operations were hurt by lower sales of electricity. Our Management team worked hard to mitigate the decline in sales with strong cost control measures. Our operating income was approximately $66 million lower, because of a decline in retail electricity sales associated with the economy. In addition, we estimate that weather reduced our operating income by $30 million, primarily driven by the cooler summer. 
Depreciation expense was $12 million higher in our utility segment. Partially offsetting these unfavorable factors were favorable fuel recoveries of $19 million, reductions in our O&M costs totaling $38 million, and pricing increases totaling $17 million. The O&M reductions came across all areas of our company. We lowered staffing levels, and we reduced other controllable areas of spending. The net of these items, plus another $7 million in favorable variances brings us to the $27 million reduction in utility operating income. 
Operating income in the non-utility energy segment, which primarily includes We Power, was up $31 million. The key drivers of this increase were a full year’s earnings contribution from Unit 2 at Port Washington, which was placed into service in May of 2008, and earnings from the water in-take system at Oak Creek, which was placed into service in January 2009. 
Corporate and other affiliates had an operating loss of $10 million in 2009, compared to an operating loss of $11 million in 2008. In the future, we project to have only slight operating losses in this area, as we will have minimal business operations in this segment. Taking the changes for each of these segments brings you back to the $5 million increase in operating income for 2009.
During 2009, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company increased by almost $7 million. Our total earnings from American Transmission Company were $59 million in 2009. Other income increased by $11 million primarily because of increased AFUDC and large utility construction projects, including the air quality control systems at our existing Oak Creek Plants.
Net interest expense increased almost $3 million. Consolidated income tax expense increased by approximately $1 million because of higher pretax earnings partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2009 was 36.6% compared to 37.7% in 2008.
This decline was primarily a result of a greater level of wind and production tax credits. I expect that our effective tax rate in 2010 will be between 35% and 36%. Combining all of these items brings you to $377 million of net income from continuing operations for 2009 or earnings of $3.20 per share.
During 2009, we generated $629 million of cash from operations on a GAAP basis, which is down $108 million from the same period in 2008. Now as we discussed on prior conference calls, during 2009, we contributed $289 million to our benefit trust, which is approximately $241 million greater than 2008.
On an adjusted basis, our cash from operations totaled $821 million. The adjusted number includes the $192 million of cash impacts from the Point Beach bill credits. Now under GAAP, the cash from the bill credits is reflected as a change in restricted cash, which GAAP defines as an investing activity, but from a management standpoint, we consider this as a source of cash as it directly relates to the bill credits.
Our total capital expenditures were approximately $818 million in 2009 about $550.1 million of this was dedicated to our utility business and $251 million was for the generating units being constructed as part of our Power the Future plan. This year, our total capital budget is approximately $950 million, $815 million of this is in our utility operations and about $135 million is for our Power the Future program.
Of the $815 million in utility spending, nearly $100 million is for renewables and $300 million is for environmental related upgrades at our Power Plants. We also paid $158 million in common dividends in 2009 and we expect to pay $187 million in 2010. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio was 58.1% as of December 31 and we were at 55.2% on an adjusted basis.
These ratios are slightly better than our December 31, 2008 levels. The adjusted amount treats half of our $500 million in hybrid securities as common equity, which is the approach used by the majority of the rating agencies. Our goal is to maintain our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at no more than 60% during the period we’re constructing our new coal fired generation.
We were using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options, and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. Given the contribution that we made to our pension trust in 2009 and the trust returns of 15% in 2009, our pension plan was nearly fully funded at year end. So we do not plan on making a contribution to the pension trust this year.
Going forward, we are assuming long term asset returns of 7.25%. I expect that our pension expense will be about $47 million this year as compared to $21 million in 2009. However, the increased pension expense was considered when our rates were set. Now, as shown in the earnings package we posted on our website this morning, our actual 2009 retail sales of electricity declined 8.1% as compared to sales in 2008.
On a weather normalized basis, 2009 retail electric sales declined 7.1%. This is somewhat better than the 8.5% weather normalized decline we had forecast back in October of last year. Looking to 2010, we are forecasting essentially flat sales of electricity versus normalized 2009 levels.
Underlying this flat overall sales outlook is a slight up tick in large commercial and industrial sales and some additional decline in sales to small commercial customers. We expect sales to residential customers to be flat on a weather normalized basis, and I’d add that the commercial and industrial sales outlook is consistent with the one included for purposes of rate making in our Wisconsin retail rate case last year.
In December of last year, Wisconsin Electric issued $250 million of unsecured notes. The notes have a 4.25% coupon rate and a 10 year maturity. Looking to this year, we expect to complete the permanent debt financings for the two new units at Oak Creek. We also expect to reissue the $147 million of tax exempt bonds at the Wisconsin Electric level that we repurchased last year pending more favorable tax exempt rates.
Also, we may do a Wisconsin Electric debt offering late this year. On a consolidated basis, we have approximately $1.6 billion of available undrawn credit facilities that expire in March and April of 2011. Now we anticipate renewing and resizing our credit facilities later this year. Our earnings guidance range remains the same as what we provided to you in December.
We expect our earnings in 2010 to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 per share. Underlying this range was the assumption that the first unit at Oak Creek would go into service in mid-January and that the second unit would be placed into service at the end of August. The schedule for unit one slipped by a couple of weeks, but we’re still comfortable with our guidance range of $3.65 to $3.75 per share.
Just for reference, we estimate that a one month move in the in service date for unit two would change earnings by about $0.02 per share. The earnings contribution from our utility segment, which includes Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, was $2.53 per share in 2009. Average rate base for the combined utilities was about $5.3 billion in 2009, and we essentially earned our allowed rate of return on equity of 10.75% in 2009. 
Now looking to this year, combined rate base is expected to grow to $5.8 billion. However, we believe that our earned rate of return on equity will be about 10% in 2010. This would reduce the earnings contribution of the utility segment to $2.51 per share in 2010. Three key items are expected to drive the roughly 40 basis point differential between the 10.4% allowed return on equity and the projected 10% earned return on equity.
The first is electric fuel recovery. We currently estimate we’ll under recover our fuel cost by between $10 million and $15 million this year. Next is the timing of rate recovery in Michigan. We did receive an interim increase there that we are implementing in conjunction with the commercial operation of unit one at Oak Creek. However, we do not expect our full request to be acted on until the middle of this year.
Finally, although the Wisconsin Commission accepted our electric sales forecast for the commercial and industrial classes, they did not reflect our residential forecast when they set rates. On weather normalized basis, our outlook for residential sales in 2010 is flat. The Commission assumed that residential sales would grow by 1.6%.
Of course, actual costs and sales will impact our return, but at this point our best estimate is about a 10% earned return on equity for the utilities segment in 2010. We expect the earnings contribution from our investment in the American Transmission Company to grow from $0.30 per share in 2009 to $0.32 per share this year.
Moving to We Power, which includes the units at Port Washington as well as units in Oak Creek we expect the earnings contribution from We Power to increase from $0.42 per share in 2009 to $1.04 per share this year. Note that in order to be consistent with a basis for presentation we’ve used in the past, this includes an allocation of holding company interest to We Power and does not include any impact of capitalized interest.
Finally, moving to the holding company, we expect that the earnings reduction from unallocated holding company debt will increase from $0.05 to $0.17 per share. This is being driven by the fact that as the units at Oak Creek go into service, we will not be able to capitalize as much interest in 2010 as we did in 2009.
So to review, starting from the $3.20 per share that we earned in 2009, utility earnings were expected to decline $0.02 per share, which is offset by $0.02 per share increase at ATC. We expect We Power to add $0.62 per share and holding company interest to reduce earnings $0.12 per share. Adding these changes together brings you from the actual base of earnings of $3.20 per share in 2009 to $3.70 of share, which is the midpoint of our guidance range for this year.
I would also like to provide some input on our expectations for earnings in the first quarter. The earnings contribution from We Power is expected to be higher now that Unit 1 at Oak Creek is in service. However, our utility earnings will be impacted by weather and fuel recoveries.
In the first quarter of 2009, we had cold weather as well as $28 million in favorable electric fuel recoveries. Weather in the first quarter is uncertain, but we project that the swing in fuel recoveries alone will result in $0.15 to $0.17 per share reduction in earnings in the first quarter of 2010 as compared to the first quarter of 2009.
As a result, we would expect first quarter 2010 earnings to be below first quarter 2009 earnings. However, our annual earnings guidance range for 2010 is $3.65 to $3.75 per share, which represents a significant amount of growth as compared to our $3.20 per share result in 2009.
So with that, I’ll turn things back over to Gale.

So let’s say for example, if the bill were in effect now, this coming fall we would file our expected fuel cost for the year 2011.
The Commission would then set a fuel rate, the Commission would have a mini hearing, would set a fuel rate beginning January 1 of 2011, which would obviously significantly reduce the lag if we were under recovering and would also reduce any over recovery and would make it much, much more streamlined for there to eliminate these wild swings of fuel under and over recovery.

So that’s being driven by earning below the actuarially assumed rates of return in past years, so back in 2008 and then lowering the expected return on assets going forward.

The economy here has been hurt like every other state, but unemployment is better than the national average. Certainly housing delinquencies have held up better than the national average.

Now these would take the form of proposed regulations. They would be open for comment, and I think she and everyone else believes that these proposed regulations once they would go through the comment period and become effective are headed for a very long court challenge. I don’t think there’s any question about that.
So on the regulatory front I think we will see some action. The real key is what would, EPA determine is the best available control technology for a fossil fueled plant that obviously emits CO2, since there is no widely acceptable or commercially widely available technology for CO2 capture today and she seems very cognizant of that problem and that issue. So it will be very interesting to see how the regulations unfold, but regardless of how they unfold, I think the industry and the EPA and other industries are in for a very long court fight.

We talked about a flat outlook for residential. So flat is in weather normalized terms. So you weather normalize 2009 and then you look at 2010 forecast, so the key driver that we see for residential is Wisconsin housing stock and we’re assuming that there will be essentially no growth in Wisconsin housing stock in 2010 as compared to 2009.
So that’s what’s really driving the flat weather normalized outlook for residential. If you look at commercial, really what we see as being the key forecast driver for commercial sales is the level of employment, absolute level of employment, and we really believe that employment in 2010 is going to be even below 2009 levels.
We think employment is going to decline about another 1.5%. So that’s what’s driving our forecast for commercial and then finally on industrial, we believe there’s going to be about a 2% increase in the U.S. industrial production output index and so that’s what’s driving our roughly 2% increase in sales to large commercial and industrial.

We are very far ahead of the curve on the traditional pollutants, given the modern advanced emission controls that we’re putting in place.
Remember we just did a huge upgrade that we completed a couple of years ago at our Pleasant Prairie plant, which is a very large coal fire powered plant that came online in 1984, and that now has all of the moderate emission controls. The existing Oak Creek units will have all of the modern emission controls online by 2012, by the end of 2012. Obviously the new Oak Creek units are in great shape.

For example, we have an older plant, which we call the Valley Plant, which is just south of downtown Milwaukee. Well, that’s an older plant, it burns coal, but, it provides steam to virtually every downtown Milwaukee building. Retiring that would be a real problem. It provides significant voltage support for the downtown Milwaukee demand pocket. So it really is a case-by-case analysis, and as we’ve done our case-by-case analysis, we feel quite good.

Good afternoon everyone, we appreciate you taking part in our conference call today to review the company's 2010 first quarter results.

Good afternoon everyone, we appreciate you taking part in our conference call today to review the company's 2010 first quarter results. Let me begin as always by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me. We have Rick Kuester, President and CEO of V-Generation, Allen Leverett our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Fleming our General Counsel, Jeff West Treasure and Steve Dickson, Controller. Allen will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, as you saw from our News Release this morning we reported earnings from continuing operations of $1.10 a share for the first quarter 2010. This compares with $1.20 a share for the first quarter 2009. As we mentioned on our conference call back in February, we expected our first quarter to be lower than last year because of fuel recoveries.
Fuel recoveries caused a negative swing for $0.26 share for the quarter but on the other side of the ledger we benefited from earnings related to the first expansion unit at Oak Creek, which was placed into commercial service one minute after midnight on February 2. Overall, we're pleased with our first quarter's results.
Now, I'd like spend just a moment on our continuing effort to upgrade the energy infrastructure in Wisconsin. Our power of the future plan is fundamental to the principle of energy self sufficiency. Key component on our focus of self-sufficiency include investing in two combined cycle natural gas fired unit at Port Washington, North of Milwaukee. The construction of two super critical plant arise cold unit at Oak Creek which is south of the City and building a significant amount of renewable generation. As we discussed on previous calls, both unit at Port Washington are in service, construction was completed on time and on three budgets. The units are among the most efficient in the mid-west market, they're operating well and our customers are now benefiting from the low price of natural gas that fuels these units.
Turning now to the status of the two new coal fired units at Oak Creek. Unit one passed all of its performance tests was placed into commercial service as I mentioned on February 2 and is currently on-line. Since early February, Bechtel has been addressing a number of punch list items and resolving several warranty issues that were identified after the turnover. This type of activity is quite normal for a major new generating unit in its first year of operation. We're very optimistic about the long-term performance of the Oak Creek expansion units. The demonstrated heat rate for unit one is outstanding. And based on that data, we believe that the Oak Creek expansion will rank among the 4 or 5 most efficient coal fired power plants in the country.
We also made significant progress on the construction of unit two during the quarter. In fact, the first fire of unit two with natural gas was successfully achieved on April 20. Bechtel is now working on steam blows, a process used to clean scale and debris from the thousands of feet of tubes and pipes in the unit. Once steam blows are complete the unit will be re-configured so that steam can be directed to the high pressure turbine. The unit will then be fired again on natural gas and the turbine generator will be synchronized to the grid for the first time this is scheduled to occur by the end of June or early July, we then expect the boiler to be fired on full for the first time. From there we will follow a routine similar to the commissioning schedule we saw in unit one. Testing and tuning will be conducted, as the output of the unit is gradually raised from 0 to 100% capacity. The final step will be a series of rigorous performance tests.
Now there's no question that we're benefiting from the lessoned learns on unit one. As a result, we expect the unit two at Oak Creek to have a smoother and shorter time line for commissioning. The guaranteed turnover date as you recall, for unit two, which was set as part of the settlement agreement with Bechtel is November 28 of this year. Now, as we first reported to you last December, we have settled all claims with Bechtel that were raised in the arbitration proceeding. Through its claim Bechtel was seeking additional construction costs of $517 million and scheduled relief of seven months and 4 months for the completion of units 1 and Unit 2 respectively.
Our settlement includes the following elements. We agreed to pay Bechtel $72 million or about $0.14 on the dollar. Including $55 million, that has been paid to date and $17 million to be paid in five additional installments that are tied to specific milestone at the site, as one of the three co-owners of the Oak Creek we're responsible for approximately 85% of these amounts. Bechtel received 120 days of scheduled relief for unit 1 and 60 days of scheduled relief for unit two. This extended the guaranteed turnover date for unit two to November 28, 2010. And finally Bechtel released us from all matters related to their claims in the arbitration and we leased Bechtel from all matters related to our clams in the arbitration.
As we move forward now, we'll continue to update you on the progress of unit two, as well as the recovery of any costs that might be incurred above the improved amount. In other developments in the first quarter, we reached an agreement to sell to a live energy our 25% interest in Edgewater unit five. Edgewater five is an existing 380 megawatt coal fired unit in eastern Wisconsin. The 95 megawatts capacity that we own at Edgewater will be sold for our net book value including working capital. As a result, we did not expect any book gain or loss on this transaction. And a lint, which already owns 75% of the plant's capacity will then become the plant's 100% owner.
The sale is subject to the course to customer regulatory reviews including Wisconsin and Michigan commissions. If approved, we expect the sale to close by the end of this year. Pre-tax proceeds should be in the range of $40 to $45 million depending on the final working capital balances. This proposed sale of our minority interest in Edgewater five is a result of our normal ongoing review and analysis of the assets in our generation portfolio. I should also point out that today, this morning actually we closed on the sale of our Edison Sault utility in Sault Ste in Marie Michigan; we expect the final pretax proceeds from the sale to be approximately $61.5 million.
Turning now to other developments, the Wisconsin state legislature completed its session for the five-year - I'm sorry for the year and adjourned on April 23. In our most recent call I had mentioned a bill being debated that was intended to address climate change. It did not receive a vote in either house. As a result, the current renewable portfolio standards in Wisconsin remain in effect and remain unchanged. To refresh your memory, the standards call for an increase in the amount of electricity we supply with renewable sources from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level. The standard set targets for each of the Wisconsin utilities using an historical baseline. Using that baseline, approximately 8.25% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewable by the year 2015.
With the completion of our Blue Sky Green Field wind farm in 2008, we took a major step toward meeting Wisconsin's goal to reduce its carbon footprint. With a total of 88 turbines each with the capacity of 1.65 megawatts. Blue Sky Greenfield is the largest wind farm to date in Wisconsin's he was completed under budget and on time and actually ahead of schedule as well. Also in 2008 you may recall we purchased a new wind farm development site approximately 45 miles Northeast of Madison. The site was purchased from FPL Energy as part of the point beach transaction. This site, which we call the Glacier Hills Wind Park, is one the best location for a wind farm in the state. On January 22 of this year, the Wisconsin commission approved our request for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to build up to 90 wind turbines at Glacier Hills and in March we finalized an agreement with vest as wind systems for the delivery of 1.8 megawatt turbines by mid 2011. The initial order was issued for 81 turbines with the expectation of up to nine additional turbines will be added when all turbine placements have been finalized at the site.
If 90 turbines are finally installed, Glacier Hills will have a generating capacity of 162 megawatts, we're pleased to be moving forward on what certainly will be a new sizable new wind farm the first year full year of operation for Glacier Hills is projected to be 2012 and our current estimate for capital cost for Glacier Hills is approximately $367 million, against assuming 90-best turbines are installed. This estimate does not include any allowance for funds used during construction or reimbursable transmission costs.
Now as you may recall last fall we also announced our plans to build a 50-megawatt biomass fuel power plant at a paper mill site in Morgan was Wisconsin. The paper mill is own and operated by Domtar Corporation, we're fortunate to be close to significant forest lands that can be harvested and are being harvested in a sustainable manner. These forests have large amounts of wood waste that can be purchased to fuel the plant. Diversification of our renewable energy supply is one of our very important goals, as compared to wind; the clear benefit from an operational stand point is that we will be able to dispatch the biomass unit. Our investment in this project is projected to be approximately $255 million without an allowance the fund used during construction.
On March 15, we filed an application for approval of this project with the Wisconsin commission. We expect the commission to make a decision by year-end the targeted in service date would be late 2013. Construction is also underway on a major upgrade of the air quality controls for the existing units at Oak Creek. We plan to invest approximately $950 million including allowance for funds used during construction, for the installation of wet-flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities; we expect these controls to be completed in 2012. Construction is actually progressing very well. The project is about 30% complete as we speak today and we're on time and on budget.
Turning now to our Michigan operations. On December 16, last year the Michigan public service commission approved ourselves implementation plant to raise electric rates by approximately $12 million or 9.5% effective with the commercial operation of unit one of the Oak Creek expansion. This rate increase is subject to refund with interest, depending on the final decision by the Michigan commission on the company's overall rate requests for $42 million annually. The commission staff has filed testimony supporting an increase of approximately $28 million. Right now, the case is before the administrative law judge. After the law judge issues his opinion, the case will then move to the commission. We expect a final order from the commission in July of this year.
Now, before I turn the call over to Allen, I'd like to touch briefly on the direction of the economy in our region. We are beginning to see modest improvement in economic activity. The impact of the recession in our service area was deep. But thankfully in terms of unemployment levels it was not as painful as many other regions of the country experienced and for now it certainly appears that the worst is behind us. Specifically, we're seeing three sectors of the economy showing some strength. Iron ore mining. Specialty steel, paper production and printing and now with more detail on or first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2010. Here's Allen.

Now, as Gale mentioned earlier, our 2010 first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $1 and $0.10 a share I will focus on operating income by segment and then touch on other income statement items. I will also discuss cash flow",1695,"Thank you, Gale. Now, as Gale mentioned earlier, our 2010 first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $1 and $0.10 a share I will focus on operating income by segment and then touch on other income statement items. I will also discuss cash flows in the quarter. Our consolidated operating income in the first quarter of 2010 was $230 million, as compared to $243 million in 2009, a decline of $13 million. Now, as expected, our utility operating earnings were lower because of fuel recoveries, but earnings from our non-utility energy segment were up with a commercial operation of the first unit at Oak Creek.
Operating income in our utility energy segment totaled $179 million for a decrease of $37 million versus 2009. On the positive side, our electric revenues excluding fuel collections were up $43 million. This increase is primarily related to our Wisconsin electric retail rates that were effective January 1st. You may remember we received a 3.4% increase in Wisconsin retail electric rates, which included a 13.8% decrease in fuel related revenues. Also, our utility depreciation expense was $15 million lower in the first quarter as we implemented new depreciation rates in connection with the new electric rates. Finally, last year we had a $10 million reduction in revenues related to my so-charges. We did not have a similar charge in 2010.
On the negative side, our fuel recoveries were $52 million lower as compared to the first quarter of 2009. In the first quarter 2010, we under recovered our fuel costs by $24 million. In the same period in 2009, we had a favorable recovery of fuel costs totaling $28 million. This represents a $52 million negative swing when we compare 2010 versus 2009. In addition, our utility owned and cost increase by $28 million in the first quarter, because of increased costs to run the new coal unit, recoveries of regulatory amortization associated with the power to future release, as well as deferred bad debt cost these increased costs were considered when setting our 2010 rates.
Finally we estimate that weather had a $23 million negative impact on operating income. During the first quarter of 2010 we experienced weather that was slightly warmer than normal. Last year, we had a colder than normal winter. In addition to these items, the net of all other factors was $2 million, which leads to the $37 million reduction in utility operating income in the first quarter. Also, on March 25th of this year, we received rate relief under the current fuel rules. Pending our final review of our fuel rate, the revenue collected are subject to refund. With the new fuel recovery rate in place, I expect we will under recover our fuel costs by approximately $20 million for the full calendar year.
Operating income in the non-utility energy segment, which primarily includes We-Power, was up $24 million because of the commercial operation of unit one at Oak Creek on February 2, now in 2011 when all of the plants are expected to be operating for a full year, we expect the total earnings contribution of the four units that We-Power will be $1.03 per share. After allocating $375 million of holding company debt. Taking the changes for each of these segments together and rounding brings you back to the $13 million decrease in operating income for the first quarter of 2010. During the first quarter of 2010 earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $15 million, which was a slight increase over 2009.
Net interest expense increased by $8 million, primarily because of interest expense associated with unit one at Oak Creek. In February, we issued $530 million of long-term debt to replace short-term debt used to finance the construction of unit one. In addition, once unit, one achieved commercial operation; we stopped capitalizing interest on the construction in progress. In the first quarter of 2009, we capitalized $11.2 million of interest related to unit one. We also expect increases in interest expense when unit two achieves commercial operation. Consolidated income tax expense decreased by approximately$9 million because of the lower pretax earnings and a slightly lower effect of tax rate.
Our effective tax rate for2010 is expected to be - between 35 and 36%. Combining all of these items brings you to $130 million of net income from continuing operations, for the first quarter of 2010 or earnings of $1.10 per share. During the first quarter, we generated $304 million of cash from operations on a GAAP basis, which is up $284 million from the same period in 2009. As we discussed, on prior conference calls, we contributed $289 million to our benefit trusts, in January of 2009. No contributions are expected this year. On an adjusted basis, our cash from operations totaled $347 million. The adjusted number includes $43 million of cash impacts from the point each bill credits. Under GAAP the cash from the bill credits is reflected as a change in restricted cash which GAAP defines as an investing activity.
From a management stand point however we consider this as a source of cash. Our total capital expenditures were approximately $195 million in the first quarter of 2010. About $131 million of this was dedicated to our utility businesses and the balance was primarily associated with the generating units being constructed, as part of our power of the future plan. This year, our total capital budget is approximately $950 million. $815 million of this is in your utility operations. And about $135 million is for our Power the Future program. Of the $815 million in utility spending, nearly $100 million is for renewables and $300 million is for environmental upgrades at our power plants.
We also paid $47 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2010, which was an 18% increase over the same period last year.
On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio was 57.2% and we were at 54.3% on an adjusted basis. These ratios are slightly better than our December 31, 2009, levels. The adjusted amount treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401K plan, options and other programs. Going forward we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
Now, as shown in the earnings package we posted on our website this morning, our actual first quarter retail sales of electricity increased 0.3%, as compared to 2009. On a weather normalized basis, first quarter retail electric sales increased 2.2%.
Excluding the sales for our largest customer, the iron ore mines on a weather normalized basis, retail sales decreased 0.4%, which is in line with our first quarter projection of a declining of 0.6%.
Consumption by our residential customers declined in the first quarter by 3.6%. This was driven by the mild winter weather. Our small commercial and industrial class declined by 3.3%, due in part to the mild winter as well as continued difficult economic conditions.
On a weather normalized basis, both of these classes performed better than our first quarter projection. Sales to the large commercial and industrial class increased 7.8%, for the first quarter of 2010 over 2009. Excluding the sales to the iron ore mines the large commercial and industrial class increased 0.6%. Overall, sales are tracking well against forecasts.
In February, we completed the permanent debt financing for the first in unit at Oak Creek. We issued a total of $530 million of senior notes in two tranches. The first tranche was a $255 million note with a coupon rate of approximately 5.2% and a final maturity of February 11, 2030.
The second tranche was a $275 million note with a coupon rate of 6.09% and a final maturity of February 11, 2040. We use the net proceeds to repay debt incurred to finance the construction of Unit 1 at Oak Creek. We anticipate that the permanent debt financing for Unit 2 at Oak Creek will occur this fall.
On a consolidated basis, we have approximately $1.6 billion of available undrawn credit facility that expire in March and April of 2011. We anticipate renewing and downsizing our credit facilities later this year before they expire in 2011.
Our earnings guidance remains the same as what we provided to you in our February conference call. We expect our earnings for 2010 to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 per share.
Now before I turn things back over to Gale, I would like to briefly discuss our earnings outlook for the second quarter. Now let me start by saying that we project our second quarter earnings to be above the $0.54 per share we earned in the second quarter of 2009.
Now, as you may remember from our second quarter call last year, our 2009 second quarter earnings benefited by $0.05 per share because of an issue stemming from refund of credits relating to MISO. We will not have this benefit in the second quarter of 2010. So the adjusted 2009 base, if you will, is $0.49 per share.
And as we look to this year, the key positive driver is the full quarter's contribution from Oak Creek Unit 1. I expect this will add $0.11 per share. Note that this also includes an increase in net interest expense because of the reduction in capitalized interest associated with the Unit.
I also expect that fuel recovery will be a very slight positive versus last year. Although, we project that the company will under recover fuel cost in the second quarter, we are currently projected to have less of an under recovery than last year.
At this point, we cannot say how much of an earnings driver weather will be. April weather was mild. However, whether in the second quarter of 2009 was also mild.
So to summarize, if you start with a $0.54 per share from last year, subtract $0.05 for the 2009 MISO item and then add $0.11 per share for Oak Creek Unit 1 you get a good starting point of $0.60 per share for your second quarter earnings estimate.
So with that, I'll turn things back over to Gale.

So for right now, my outlook for 2011 for the utilities is $2.61. It was slightly higher back in September and really the differential between the two is the, the allowed rates of return at the utilities.
So they're down somewhat because remember in September that's before we got the outcome and the rate case. And the Power the Future earnings contribution is up slightly. I think the ATC contribution was about the same, Bill, if you looked at the September version versus the current version. But bottom line, our expectation is still for at least $4 a share in 2011.

Again, simply because of the way fuel recoveries work, as Allen said, when you go out farther, it's really not possible to pinpoint precisely what our fuel recovery situation is going to look like, so on our farther out years we do assume neutral fuel recovery. You're correct that a bill passed the legislature this past session. That would in essence be an improvement in the way the recovery mechanism works. In that the commission would be allowed under this piece of legislation that passed to basically ask all the utilities to project their annual fuel costs in the fall of the year prior to the New Year.
So for example, the commission could ask the utilities to come in, in October or November, with a pretty firm projection of their fuel costs for the following calendar year. And then theoretically after a hearing, the commission could set a new fuel rate that would be effective January 1. If that should occur, it would obviously damp even and reduce the volatility in our fuel recovery. We think that would be a positive improvement. The bill ended up being very non-controversial, which was a very good thing. It actually passed the state Senate on a voice vote and was supported by all the parties involved.
The Wisconsin commission testified on behalf of the bill, the consumers utility board and the industrial groups, the industrial owner groups testified on behalf of it. The utilities were obviously in favor of it. So it was a, it was a well supported piece of legislation. And the remaining step is, the governor would need to sign the bill and we'll, we'll be able to determine whether that happens over the course of the next 20 days.

Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review the company’s 2010 second quarter results.

We appreciate you joining us as we review the company’s 2010 second quarter results. Let me begin as always by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today.
We have Rick Kuester, President and CEO of We Generation; Allen Leverett, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Fleming, our General Counsel; Jeff West, Treasurer and Steve Dickson, Controller. Allen, of course, will review our financial results in detail in just a moment.
But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $0.74 a share for the second quarter of 2010. This compares with $0.53 a share for the comparable period last year.
Our second quarter 2010 results were helped by a return to more normal weather, continuing cost controls and earnings from our $1.2 billion investment in the first expansion unit at Oak Creek. Overall, we’re quite pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date performance.
Now I’d like to spend just a moment on our continuing effort to upgrade the energy infrastructure in Wisconsin. Our Power the Future plan is fundamental to the principle of energy self sufficiency.
Key components of our focus on self sufficiency include, investing in two combined cycle gas-fired units at Port Washington, which is North of Milwaukee; the construction of two supercritical pulverized coal units at Oak Creek, which is south of the city, and building a significant amount of renewable generation.
As we’ve discussed on previous calls, both units at Port Washington are in service. Construction was completed on time and on budget. The units are among the most efficient in the Midwest market. They are operating well and our customers are now benefiting from the low price of natural gas that fuels these units.
Turning now to the status of the coal-fired units at Oak Creek. As you’ll recall, Unit 1 passed all of its performance tests, and was placed into commercial service on February 2 of this year. Our general contractor at Oak Creek, Bechtel Power Corporation is now focusing its efforts on completing the commissioning and testing of Unit 2 and I’m pleased to report the effort is proceeding well.
First fire on coal in the Unit 2 boiler was achieved on July 8. The generator has been synchronized to the grid for the first time on July 16 and since July 16 the unit has operated up to 30% of its rated capacity.
Over the coming weeks, Bechtel will gradually increase the output of the unit while conducting a range of tests along the way. After it reaches its full rated capacity, the unit will be shut down for a scheduled two-week outage. Bechtel will use this time to address punch list items and remove startup equipment. And then the unit will be returned to service for a further tuning and a series of rigorous performance tests.
Now, as with any two-unit plant, the second unit should benefit from the lessons learned on the first, thus shortening the startup and commissioning schedule. As a reminder, the guaranteed turnover date for Unit 2 at Oak Creek, a date that was set as a part of our settlement agreement with Bechtel is now November 28. We expect Bechtel to meet or beat this completion date. However, our current view is that commercial operation of Unit 2 is indeed likely to be a fourth quarter event.
Turning now to other important developments, on May 18, Wisconsin Act 403 was signed into law by Governor Doyle. This action directs the Wisconsin Public Service Commission to develop a new set of rules that will govern how electric utilities in the state recover their fuel and purchase power costs.
In short, the new law provides for a modified escrow accounting mechanism for fuel costs with annual true-up. The next step in the process is for the Commission to draft and seek comment on a new rule that will actually implement the law. It’s possible that the Commission could complete its work on the new rule by September 1.
The rule would then move to the State Legislature where the Standing Committees in each House generally have 30 days to take any action. If no action is taken, the rule would automatically go into effect. As it stands today, the new rule could be in place for calendar-year 2011.
Now I’d like to update you on our progress toward meeting the Renewable Portfolio Standard that the State of Wisconsin has in place for the year 2015. To refresh your memory, the Standard calls for an increase in the amount of electricity we supply with renewable resources, from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level.
The Standard sets targets for each of the Wisconsin utilities using an historical base line. Using that base line, approximately 8.25% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewable sources in the year 2015.
With the completion of our Blue Sky Green Field wind farm in 2008, we took a major step toward meeting Wisconsin’s goal to reduce its carbon footprint. Blue Sky Green Field has a total of 88 turbines, each with the capacity of 1.65 megawatts. It was completed under budget and ahead of schedule.
Also in 2008, as you may recall, we purchased a new wind farm development site, approximately 45 miles northeast of Madison. This site, which we call, the Glacier Hills Wind Park, has a strong wind resource, close proximity to transmission, and low population density, making it one of the best locations for a major wind farm in Wisconsin.
On January 22 of this year, the Wisconsin Commission approved our request for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to build up to 90 wind turbines at the Glacier Hills site. After reconfiguring the layout to comply with the Commission’s order, we finalized an agreement with Vestas Wind Systems for a supply of 90 1.8 megawatt turbines to be delivered by mid-2011.
With the installation of 90 turbines, Glacier Hills will have a generating capacity of approximately 162 megawatts. We broke ground and began construction at Glacier Hills in the second quarter, and we’re pleased to be moving forward on what will be Wisconsin’s largest wind farm to-date. The first full year of operation for Glacier Hills is projected to be 2012.
Our current estimate of the capital cost at Glacier Hills is approximately $367 million. This estimate does not include any allowance for funds used during construction or reimbursable transmission costs.
Now as you may recall, last fall, we also announced our plans to build a 50 megawatt cogeneration plant that will be fueled by biomass at a paper mill site in northern Wisconsin. The paper mill is owned and operated by Domtar Corporation. We are fortunate that it will be close to significant forest lands that can be harvested in a sustainable manner. These forests have large amounts of wood waste that can be purchased to help fuel the plant.
Now diversification of our renewable energy supply is one of our important goals. As compared to wind, for example, the clear benefit from an operational standpoint is that we will be able to dispatch the biomass unit. The unit will also supply steam to the Domtar mill and of course cogenerating electricity and insignificantly improves the overall efficiency of the unit.
Our investment in this project is projected to be approximately $255 million without allowance for funds used during construction. On March 15, we filed an application for approval of this project with the Wisconsin Commission. We expect the Commission to make a decision in this case by year end or certainly early 2011. Our targeted in-service date for the biomass project is late 2013.
Construction is also underway on a major upgrade of the air quality controls for the existing older coal-fired units at Oak Creek. We plan to invest approximately $950 million, including allowance for funds used during construction for the installation of wet flue gas desulphurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities.
We expect these controls to be completed and in service in 2012. Construction, I am pleased to report, is progressing very well. The project is now almost 40% complete and we are on time and on budget.
Turning now to our Michigan operations, on December 16 of last year, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved our self-implementation plan to raise electric rates by approximately $12 million effective with the commercial operation of Unit 1 at Oak Creek.
Subsequently, the Michigan Commission authorized an additional increase of $11.5 million that was effective just very recently on July 2. The total rate increase of $23.5 million annually for our Michigan operations is subject to a 30-day appeal period.
Finally, before I turn the call over to Allen, I’d like to touch briefly on the direction of the economy in our region. The good news is that we continue to see improvement in the economic activity in the second quarter. During our last call, we mentioned the strength we were seeing in three sectors of our service area; iron ore mining, specialty steel and paper production.
During the second quarter, these sectors remain strong and we began to see rising electricity use in several additional sectors, most notably in metal fabrication, rubber and plastic products transportation equipment and healthcare.
Our second quarter electric sales to our largest customers grew by 14%, if you exclude the iron ore mines, sales to our largest customers grew by 7% during the quarter; however, we remained well below 2008 sales levels.
Now, with more details on our second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2010, here is Allen.

Now, as Gale mentioned earlier, our 2010 second quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.74 a share. Now, I will focus on operating income by segment and then touch on other income statement items. I will also discuss cash flows in the quarter and the first half of the year.
Our consolidated operating income in the second quarter of 2010 was $163 million as compared to $118 million in 2009, an increase of $45 million. The bulk of the increased earnings came from We Power, as we benefited from a full quarter’s earnings from the first unit at Oak Creek.
Our utility segment also showed increased earnings driven y more favorable weather and some improvement in economic conditions. Operating income in our utility energy segment totaled $98 million, an increase of $9 million versus 2009.
Now, as background, effective January 1 of this year, we received a 3.4% increase in our Wisconsin electric retail rates. This rate increase covered many items including expected increases in utility operating costs associated with Oak Creek and changes in our depreciation expense.
When we look at the second quarter, we see $46 million in revenues related to pricing increases excluding fuel. In addition, the second quarter benefited by $16 million because of lower utility depreciation expense as a result of the new rates and $7 million of increased electric and gas margins caused by more favorable weather in 2010.
On the negative side, we experienced $48 million of increased non-fuel O&M costs, primarily associated with the recovery of regulatory amortizations and cost to operate Oak Creek.
We also had a $10 million positive MISO item in 2009 that did not occur in 2010. Finally, our recoveries of fuel and purchase power were down $2 million when compared with the second quarter of 2009. These factors led to the $9 million increase in utility operating income in the second quarter.
Operating income in the Non-Utility Energy segment, which primarily includes the We Power, was up $36 million because of the commercial operation of Unit 1 at Oak Creek on February 2. Taking the changes for these two segments, you arrive at the $45 million increase in operating income for the second quarter of 2010.
During the second quarter of 2010, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $15 million, which was a slight increase over 2009. Other income increased by $2 million because of higher AFUDC on our utility construction projects.
Net interest expense increased by $13 million primarily because of interest expense associated with Unit 1 at Oak Creek. In February, we issued $530 million in long-term debt to replace short-term debt used to finance the construction of Unit 1.
In addition, once Unit 1 achieved commercial operation, we stopped capitalizing interest on the construction work-in-progress. We also expect increases in interest expense when Unit 2 achieves commercial operation. The interest on the permanent debt for these projects is covered by the lease payments and thus included in customer rates.
Consolidated income tax expense increased by approximately $10 million because of higher pre-tax earnings offset by a slightly lower effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2010 is expected to be between 35% and 36%.
Combining all of these items brings you to $88 billion of net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2010, or earnings of $0.74 per share.
During the first six months of 2010, we generated $424 million of cash from operations on a GAAP basis, which is up $193 million from the same period in 2009. As we discussed on prior conference calls, we contributed $289 million to our benefit trust in January of 2009. No contributions are expected this year.
On an adjusted basis, our cash from operations totaled $506 million for the first six months of 2010. The adjusted number includes the $82 million of cash impacts from the Point Beach bill credits.
Under GAAP, the cash from the bill credits is reflected as a change in restricted cash, which GAAP defines as an investing activity. From a management standpoint, we consider this as a source of cash.
Our total capital expenditures were approximately $379 million in the first six months of 2010. About $300 million of this was dedicated to our utility business and the balance was primarily associated with the generating units being constructed as part of our Power the Future plan.
At the beginning of the year, we projected our total capital budget to be approximately $950 million. Now as we reforecast the rest of the year, we estimate that our 2010 capital spending will be reduced from $950 million to approximately $820 million. We have also revised our capital spending estimate for the three-year period from 2010 to 2012. Our revised forecast is approximately $250 million less than our previous forecast. We also paid $94 million in common dividends in the first half of 2010, which was an 18% increase over the same period last year.
On a GAAP basis, our debt to capital ratio was 57.2% and we were at 54.3% on an adjusted basis. These ratios are slightly better than our June 30, 2009 levels of 58.2% and 55.2% respectively. The adjusted amount treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.
As shown in the earnings package that we posted on our website this morning, our actual second quarter retail sales of electricity increased 7.2% as compared to 2009.On a weather normalized basis, second quarter retail electric sales increased 4%. Excluding the sales to our largest customer, the iron ore mines, on a weather normalized basis, retail sales increased 1.2%, which is ahead of our second quarter projection that called for an increase of 0.1%.
Consumption by our residential customers increased in the second quarter by 1.7% and in our small commercial and industrial class by 4.7%, both driven by the warmer weather as compared to last year.
We believe that conservation efforts by residential customers contributed to the decline and weather normalized usage in the residential class as compared with our original projections. However, weather-normalized sales to our small commercial and industrial came in stronger than our projections.
When we turn to our largest customers we see that sales to the large commercial and industrial class increased 14.3% for the second quarter of 2010 over 2009. Excluding sales to the iron ore mines, the large commercial and industrial class increased 7.1%.
On a weather-normalized basis, large commercial and industrial sales excluding the mines increased 4.7%, which was better than our projections. Overall, our retail sales excluding the mines are tracking well against forecast. Based on the results to-date, we have adjusted the forecast for the mines. The revenue and margin for this increase was reflected in the Michigan rate case results.
In February, we completed the permanent debt financing for the first unit at Oak Creek. Net proceeds were used to repay incurred to finance the construction of Unit 1. We anticipate that the permanent debt financing for Unit 2 at Oak Creek will occur upon commercial operation of the unit.
Now, given the strong cash flows relative to our financial plan, I do not expect that we will need any long-term financing at our utilities this year. However, we do expect to complete long-term financing at the utilities in 2011.
On a consolidated basis, we have approximately $1.6 billion of available undrawn credit facilities that expire in March and April of 2011. We anticipate renewing and downsizing our credit facilities later this year before they expire in 2011.
I would now like to discuss our earnings guidance for this year. Our original outlook for the year assumed we would earn about a 10% return on equity in our utility segment as compared to 10.4% allowed rate of return. This differential was expected to be driven by fuel under-recovery, timing of rate recovery in Michigan and the electric sales forecast that the Wisconsin Commission used to set our retail rates.
As compared to this original outlook, we are doing somewhat worse on fuel recovery. Now we expect to under-recover fuel cost by $30 million to $35 million for the full year, partly due to the warm weather in July. Timing of the Michigan case was as we expected and we are doing somewhat better than planned on electric sales.
In addition, the hot summer weather has brought about a higher than expected number of severe storms and we expect our storm cost to exceed our original budget.
Taking all of this together, I currently expect that we will earn about 10.3% return on equity in our Utility segment. This move from 10% to 10.3% represents approximately $0.07 per share in earnings. However, as Gale mentioned, we now expect Unit 2 at Oak Creek will enter service in the fourth quarter.
Our original guidance assumes commercial operation in Unit 2 at the end of August. In November 1 in-service date would reduce the outlook by about $0.04 per share, so the better-than-anticipated utility results are expected to be partially offset by the assumption of a November 1 in-service date.
Given all of these factors, we are tightening our earnings guidance range, but not moving the top end at this time. Our new 2010 earnings guidance range is $3.70 to $3.75 per share.
Now, I’d like to move to our earnings outlook for the third quarter. Let me start by saying that we project our third quarter earnings to be significantly above the $0.50 per share we earned in the third quarter of 2009. We see two key drivers for higher earnings in the third quarter as compared to last year.
First, we project another full quarter earnings contribution from Oak Creek Unit #1. I expect this will add $0.11 per share. I do not expect an earnings contribution in the third quarter from Oak Creek Unit 2.
The other driver is expected to be weather. Summer weather in the third quarter of 2009 was quite mild. This year we are seeing a significant difference. For the first 20 days of this month, Milwaukee has experienced the hottest July weather in the last 60 years.
While we cannot predict the rest of the weather for the quarter, it is safe to say that we expect to benefit from the warmer weather as compared to last summer. If weather in the third quarter was normal overall, we estimate it would add $0.18 per share as compared to last year.
At this point, there is a fair likelihood that weather will be better than normal in the third quarter, however it is also likely that third quarter earnings will be negatively impacted by storm and higher fuel costs.
Taking these drivers together, I would estimate our third quarter earnings this year to be between $0.80 per share and $0.85 per share.
Before I turn things back over to Gale, I would also like to briefly discuss our outlook for 2011 and 2012. As we have said in the past, we expect 2011 to be a watershed as it would be the first year that we expect to have 12 months of earnings from all four of our Power the Future units.
Our current expectation for earnings in 2011 is $4.10 per share to $4.20 per share. At the midpoint of this range or $4.15, I estimate the return on equity in our Utility segment would be about 10%.
Moving now to 2012, we are not prepared to give earnings guidance for 2012, however I did want to give you input on each of the segments, starting with Utility segment. Average total rate base for the combined utilities is expected to grow from approximately $5.7 billion in 2010 to $7 billion in 2012.
Total rate base includes net plan and service, as well as construction work in progress, working capital and other capital invested in the business. I would note that the $7 billion figure for 2012 is consistent with the revised three-year spending outlook I mentioned earlier.
At We Power, as in 2011, we expect all four of the new plants will be operational for all of 2012. As a result, the total earnings contribution from this segment is projected to be approximately $1.33 per share including allocation of $375 million of holding company debt.
The earnings contribution from our investment in American Transmission Company should be about $0.34 per share and on allocated holding company interest expense should amount to a $0.17 per share reduction. We hope this information will help you develop your own estimates of 2012 earnings.
So, with that, I will turn things back over to Gale.

If there’s going to be any kind of bandwidth, it has to be symmetrical on the upside and on the downside. Right now, it appears that the commission would like to have somewhere between a 1% and 2% bandwidth. There are two major differences in how the fuel clause going forward is likely to work compared to how it’s been working.
One is that the Commission would ask each utility to, if it expected a change in fuel costs in the new year to come in, in the fall of the prior year, and essentially present a fuel case in a one-day hearing, and then assuming the commission agreed that that was reasonable, the new fuel rate would go into effect January 1. That in and of itself would help considerably in introducing any kind of lag in recovery.
And then the second is, you wouldn’t have to go in the next calendar year unless something extraordinary happened because either above the 2% bandwidth or below the 2% bandwidth, there would be escrow accounting. So that’s essentially the developments in this new fuel rule as it seems to be taking shape. But I think it would be a significant help in terms of more current recovery and less sort of lag of our fuel cost recovery.

And thank you for joining us as we review the company’s 2010 third quarter results. Let me begin as always by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today.
We have Rick Kuester, President and CEO of We Generation, Allen Leverett, our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Fleming, General Counsel, Jeff West, our Treasurer and Steve Dickson, Controller. Allen will review our financial results in detail in just a moment.
But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $0.95 a share for the third quarter of 2010. This compares with $0.49 a share from continuing operations in the same period last year.
Our 2010 third quarter results were boosted by warm humid weather, continuing cost controls and a full quarter of earnings from our investment in the first new generating unit at Oak Creek. Overall, we’re pleased with our solid financial performance that we’ve recorded in the third quarter and for the first nine months of this year.
Our customers clearly responded to the return of summer temperatures in the Midwest. In fact in July, our residential customers used more electricity than during any other month in history. And during the dark days of August, our small commercial and industrial customers used more electric energy than during any other single month in history.
Now, I would like to spend just a moment on our continuing effort to upgrade the energy infrastructure in Wisconsin. Our Power the Future plan is fundamental to the principal of energy self-sufficiency. Key components of our focus on self-sufficiency include investing in tow Combined Cycle Natural Gas Fired units at Port Washington, which is north of Milwaukee. 
The construction of two super critical pauperized coal units at Oak Creek, which is south of the city, and building a significant amount of renewable generation. We’re now nearing completion of the new coal fired unit at Oak Creek. As you recall, unit one passed all of its performance tests and was placed in the commercial service on February 2 of this year.
Over the past several months, our general contractor at Oak Creek, Bechtel Power Corporation has focused on completing the commissioning and testing of Unit 2. So, we fire on the coal on the Unit 2 boiler was achieved on July the 8. The Unit 2 generator was then synchronized with the grid for the first time on July 16 and since that time the unit is operated up to and exceeded 100% of its rated capacity. Bechtel recently completed a timed outage and brought Unit 2 back online. The unit is now undergoing final performance testing.
However, Bechtel is experiencing some equipment issues that may delay completion of the testing. Depending on the revolution, the turnover date for Unit 2 could be delayed a few days or even a few weeks. We still though expect commercial operation of Unit 2 to be a fourth quarter event. As a reminder, the guaranteed turnover date for Unit 2 at Oak Creek, which was set as part of our settlement agreement with Bechtel is November 28.
Turning now to other recent developments, on May 16, Wisconsin Act 403, was signed in the law by Governor Doyle. This law authorizes the Wisconsin public service commission to develop new rules for recovery of fuel and purchase power cost that are incurred by Wisconsin’s electric utilities. The legislation was designed to streamline the current combustion process for fuel recovery in the States. In short, the law establishes a modified escrow accounting mechanism with an annual crew up for fuel cost.
On August 31, the commission forwarded a set of new proposed rules to the state legislature where standing committees and each house generally have up to 60 days for review. On October 20, the standing committee in the state ordered to send the new rule back to the commission for modifications. 
The standing committee in the state assembly is also scheduled to review the rule at a hearing set for November 9. We do not expect any final action from the commission until they receive feedback from both legislative committees. Once the commission responds, the standing committees will then have another 10 days for review. If no action is taken after 10 days, the rule would automatically go into effect. So, as it stands today, we expect the new rules to be in place in 2011.
Now, I’d like to update you on our progress toward meeting the renewable portfolio standard that the State of Wisconsin has in place for the year 2015. To refresh your memory, the standard calls for an increase in the amount of electricity we supply with renewable resources from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level.
The standard sets targets for each Wisconsin utility using an historical baseline. Using that baseline, about 8.25% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewable sources in 2015.
With the completion of our Blue Sky Green Field Wind Farm in 2008, we took a major step towards meeting Wisconsin’s goal of reducing its carbon footprint. Blue Sky Green Field has a total of 88 turbines, each with a capacity of 1.65 megawatts. It was completed under budget and ahead of schedule.
Also in 2008, we purchased a new wind farm development site, approximately 45 miles northeast of Madison. This site, which we call the Glacier Hills Wind Park, has a strong wind resource, close proximity to transmission and low population density making it one of the best locations for a major wind farm in the region.
On January 22 of this year, the Wisconsin Commission approved our request for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to build up to 90 wind turbines at the Glacier Hills site. In the second quarter, we finalized an agreement with Vestas Wind Systems for a supply of 90, 1.8 megawatt turbines and we began construction at Glacier Hills. I’m pleased to report that construction is progressing very well, completed all the turbine foundations and all the access roads in preparation for delivery of the turbines themselves which should arrive in mid 2011.
With 90 turbines, Glacier Hills will have a generating capacity of 162 megawatts. This will make Glacier Hills the largest wind farm to-date in Wisconsin. The first full year of operation is projected to be 2012. Our current estimate of the capital cost of Glacier Hills is approximately $367 million. This estimate does not include any allowance for funds used during construction or any reimbursable transmission costs.
Now as you may recall, last fall we also announced our plans to build a 50 megawatt cogeneration plant fueled with biomass at a paper mill site in Northern Wisconsin. The mill is owned and operated by Domtar Corporation. We are fortunate to be close to significant forest lands that are being harvested in a sustainable manner. These forests have large amounts of wood waste that can be purchased to fuel the plant.
Now, diversification our renewable energy supply is one of our very important goals. As compared, for examples to wind the clear benefit from an operational standpoint is that we will be able to dispatch the biomass unit. The unit will also supply steam to the Domtar paper mill and of course cogenerating electricity and steam improves the overall efficiency of the unit.
Our investment in this project is projected to be approximately $255 million without allowance for funds used during construction. On March 15, we filed an application for approval of this project with the Wisconsin Commission. We have now received all the local permits necessary to move forward and the commission is scheduled public and technical hearings for late November and early December. Based on this schedule, we expect the commission to make their decision in the case in early 2011. Our targeted in-service date for the biomass project is late 2013.
Construction also continues to progress very well on a major upgrade of the air quality controls for the existing coal-fired units at Oak Creek. We are investing approximately $950 million, including allowance for funds used during construction for the installation of wet flue gas desulphurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities. We expect these controls to be operational in 2012. The project now is about 56% complete, we remain on time and on budget.
Turning to our Michigan operations, on December 16 of last year, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved our self-implementation plan to raise electric rates by approximately $12 million effective with the commercial operation of Unit 1 at the Oak Creek expansion. Subsequently, the Michigan Commission authorized an additional increase of $11.5 million that was effective on July 2 of this year. The total rate increase $23.5 million annually for our Michigan operations was appealed by one of our industrial customers.
The Michigan Commission recently ruled on this appeal and accepted several mathematical corrections. These corrections reduce the amount of the increase by $256,000 annually. The adjustment will take effect in just a few days on November 1. 
Now, I’d like to touch briefly on the direction of the economy in our region. During the summer months, we continue to see a rebound in economic activity across our service area. On previous calls, we mentioned recovery in three large sectors. Iron ore mining, specialty steel and paper production. These sectors remain strong during the third quarter and several other sectors showed real signs of life as well. Most notably, primary metals and metal fabrication, rubber and plastic products, transportation equipment and health care.
Our third quarter electric sales to our largest customers actually grew by 11% as compared to the third quarter of 2009. But if you exclude the iron ore mines, sales to our largest customers grew by 4% during the quarter and if you normalized for weather, we saw a growth rate of about 1.5%. 
However, we remain below 2008 levels in sales to our large commercial and industrial customers. And I should add that in September, signs of slowing began to emerge in the phase of the recovery in our region.
Finally, as Allen and I both mentioned during our public presentations in September, we expect that our board will review our dividend policy at its meeting this December. It’s important to note that the components of our financial goals related to credit ratings and the issuance of new equity will remain the same. 
The credit rating objective for our utilities remains at the A category and as we said consistently, we do not want to raise our dividend payout to a level that would require us to issue new shares to finance our growth. In the course of our discussions with the board; however we will review the company’s earnings and cash flow projections and we’ll update our outlook for capital spending and other cash requirements such as pension funding.
As you know, our current policy calls for a 40% to 45% payout ratio next year and then a 45% to 50% payout in 2012 and thereafter. If there are any changes to the policy, I expect it will be announced soon after our board meeting on December 2. And now with more details on our third quarter and the outlook for the remainder of 2010, here is Allen.

I’ll focus on operating income by segment and then touch on other income statement items. I’ll also discuss clash flows for the first nine months and discuss our earnings guidance for the remainder of the year.
Our consolidated operating income was $203 million as compared to $104 million in the third quarter of 2009 or an increase of $99 million. Operating income in our utility energy segment totaled $134 million, which is $60 million higher than the third quarter of 2009. The most significant factor helping our utility earnings was the weather. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we estimate that weather increased our electric margins by $65 million. This year, we experienced a hot and humid summer, which helped electric margins by approximately $30 million when compared to normal.
Last summer, we experienced an unseasonably cool summer, which reduced electric margins by approximately $35million. So, when you combine these two variances from normal weather conditions, you get the $65 million year-over-year benefit related to weather.
As we mentioned earlier in the year, during 2010 we received price increases to cover increased cost. We estimate that these price increases excluding fuel revenues helped operating income by $47 million. Also, our lower depreciation rates contributed to a $16 million reduction in utility depreciation expense. On the negative side, our utility O&M expenses were $56 million higher because of increased amortization cost and cost involved to operate the new plant at Oak Creek.
These costs were considered in our most recent rate cases. Finally, our fuel recoveries were $12 million unfavorable compared to last year. When we net all of these factors together, we come to utility operating income that was $60 million higher than the third quarter of 2009.
Operating income in the non-utility energy segment, which primarily includes We Power was up $36 million because of the beginning of commercial operation of Unit 1 at Oak Creek on February 2nd. Taking the changes for these two segments and adding $3 million of other items brings you back to the $99 million increase in operating income for this quarter.
During the third quarter of 2010, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $15 million, which is a slight increase over 2009. All other income of $10 million was level with 2009. Net interest expense increased from $38 million to $53 million for a total of a $15 million increase, primarily because of interest expenses associated with Unit 1 at Oak Creek.
In February of this year, we issued $530 million in long-term debt to replace short-term debt used to finance the construction of Unit 1. In addition, once Unit 1 achieved commercial operation, we stopped capitalizing interest on the construction in progress. The interest expense on the permanent debt for the Power to Future project is covered by the lease payments, and thus is included in customer rates.
Consolidated income tax expense increase from $33 million to $63 million for a total increase of $30 million primarily because of higher pre-tax earnings, I except that our annual effective tax rate in 2010 will be in the range of 35% to 36%. 
Combining all of these items brings you to $112 million of net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2010, our earnings of $0.95 per share. During the first nine months of 2010, we generated $654 million of cash from operations on a GAAP basis, which is up $220 million from the same period in 2009. Last year, our cash flows from operations included a $289 million contribution to our benefit plans. We did not make any contributions in the first nine months of this year.
On an adjusted basis, our cash from operations totaled $786 million as compared to $583 million in the first nine months of 2009. The adjusted number includes $132 million of cash impact from the bill credits in 2010 and $150 million in bill credits and refunds in 2009. These bill credits arose from the gain on the sale of our Point Beach Nuclear plant in 2007. Under GAAP, cash from the bill credits is reflected in the change in restricted cash, which GAAP defines as an investing activity. From the management standpoint, we consider this a source of cash as it directly relates to customer bill credits.
The bill credits are scheduled to sunset at the end of this year. At that point, we will have returned the gain on the sale, as well as retained nuclear decommissioning trust assets to our customers. Our total capital expenditures were approximately $546 million in the first nine months of 2010. Approximately $445 million of this was dedicated to our utility business and the balance was primarily related to our new coal units at Oak Creek. 
We also paid $140 million in common dividends in the first nine months of 2010, which was an 18% increase over the same period last year. On a GAAP basis, our debt to capital ratio was 56.7% as of September 30, 2010 and we were at 53.9% on an adjusted basis. This has improved slightly from our December 31, 2009 levels. I would expect our year end debt to capital ratios just to be somewhat below our December 31, 2009 ratios.
We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. As shown in the earnings package that was posted in our website this morning, our actual third quarter retail sale of electricity increased 13.8% as compared to 2009. 
On a weather normalized basis, third quarter retail electric sales increased 1.5%. Excluding the sales to our largest customer, the iron ore mines, on a weather normalized basis, retail sales decreased 1.1%, which is slightly behind our third quarter projection that called for a decrease of 0.2%. 
The normalization process is at best and in perfects science and is less precise in times of extreme weather swings. This year, we had significantly warmer weather and last year we had significantly cooler summer weather. 
Consumption by our residential customers increased in the third quarter by 26.4% and our small commercial and industrial class increased by 6%, both driven by the hot and humid summer weather.
We believe that conservation efforts by residential customers contributed to the decline in weather normalized usage in the residential class as compared with our original projections. However, weather-normalized sales to our small commercial and industrial class came in stronger than our projections. Overall, our retail sales excluding the mines are tracking well against forecast.
In February, we completed the permanent debt financing for the first unit at Oak Creek. Net proceeds were used to repay debt incurred to finance the construction on Unit 1. As we have consistently stated in the past, we anticipate that the permanent debt financing for Unit 2 at Oak Creek will occur upon commercial operation of the unit.
Given the strong cash flows relative to our financial plan, we do not expect to need any long-term financing in our utilities this year. However, we do expect to complete long-term financing at the utilities in 2011.
Also on April 1 of next year, we will have a debt maturity at the Wisconsin Energy level. We expect to retire $450 million at 6.5% Notes using internally generated cash and short-term debt at the Wisconsin Energy level.
On a consolidated basis, we have approximately $1.6 billion of available undrawn credit facilities that expire in March and April of next year. We anticipate renewing and downsizing our credit facilities later this year before they expire in 2011.
I would now like to discuss our earnings guidance for this year. We are increasing the range for guidance for 2010 by a nickel, from $3.70 to $3.75 per share up to $3.75 to $3.80 per share.
Let me give you the background for how we arrived at this range. Through the first nine months of the year, we earn $2.78 per share. Now this is $0.14 per share ahead of the plan that we presented to all of you in February. That plan called for $3.70 per share for the year, the midpoint of our original guidance range.
Now let me step back and give you my view of how I see the fourth quarter shaping up versus our original plan. At this point, I see three factors that are likely to drive us below the original plan earnings for the fourth quarter. 
The first factor is the timing of the commercial operation at Oak Creek Unit 2. Our original plan called for in service date of October 1, which would have resulted in a full quarter earnings contribution from the unit this year. Of course the commercial and service date for Unit 2 is not certain at this point. However, it is probably safe to say that we will be at least $0.03 to $0.04 per share below the original plan due to this item.
Next, electric fuel recovery has continued to be a disappointment this year. Assuming we had a $50 million under recovered balance for the year, we would come at about $0.03 per share below the original plan in the fourth quarter.
Finally, the plan called for normal weather in the fourth quarter. At this point, it appears that October this year will be warmer than normal resulting another $0.01 per share below plan earnings for the fourth quarter.
Taking these factors together, I would expect that our actual earnings in the fourth quarter will be $0.07 to $0.08 per share below our original plan. Backing this away from the $0.14 per share of favorable performance for the first nine months, we would arrive at an estimate of $0.06 to $0.07 per share of net over performance for the year. When added to the original level of planned earnings for the year that brings you into our new guidance range of $3.75 to $3.80 for 2010. This translates into an earnings guidance range of $0.97 to $1.02 per share for the fourth quarter.
So with that, I’ll turn things back over to Gale.

The race for governor, which I think would be the key race related to future strategy that the State might follow regarding renewable, the race for governor is tight, the last publicly available polls show the Republican slightly ahead, three to five points perhaps and I do think there is a difference of philosophy between the two candidates for governor as it relates to additional renewable portfolio standards beyond the year 2015. 
So, let me start by saying, regardless of which candidate wins the elections, I don’t believe any of the plans that we have laid out here regarding Glacier Hills or regarding the Biomass project would see any material change.
We have a state standard in place for 2015, I think everyone expects us to meet that State standard and regardless of which governor or which candidate is in the governor’s match and after January, I don’t see any change in that standard for 2015. The change that might come if for example the Republican wins the race, because it is I think he would probably want us to step back and take our foot of the accelerator and not have a stronger standard for the year 2020 or 2025.
On the other hand if the Democratic candidate is the Mayor of Milwaukee wins he would express the definite interest in having a renewable portfolio standard at a higher level for the year 2025. So, in essence of the plans we had laid out and that our folks are working on in terms of construction and planning related to the new wind farm at Glacier Hills related to the new Biomass units, I see no impact from the election and we’ll just have to see how things play out regarding any standard for the State beyond 2015. I hope that answers your question, Greg.

Coming off of that, we didn’t make any contributions at all to either the [Inaudible] trust or the pension trust in 2010. 
I would expect that we would make a contribution to both of those, and candidly we are still finalizing those numbers and there will be somewhat impacted by what the final liability account rate turns out to be for the year. So that’s certainly one thing that will be new in 2011 as opposed to 2010. 
I would expect the deferred tax liability balanced to continue to build up in 2011 and as we have both of these plants, the large coal plants online and generating tax depreciation I’d expect that to continued to be a source of cash if you will. 
Other than capital spending and just earnings from the business, those would be the two that I’d point out. Do keep in mind that the capital spending forecast that we have currently for 2011 is about $1 billion. So it’s pretty significant budget in 2011.

Now having said that, we also continue to see modest customer growth, we were serving several thousand more customers at the end of September this year than at the end of September last year. We are actually seeing an up tick in gas distribution customers as well. So, you are going to see some conservation, you are going to see, I hope continued customer growth and then if we get any kind of economic rebound from here, remember our industrial sales are below 2008 level still, so if we get any kind of economic rebound from here that also will help in terms of kilowatt hour sales. 
So, at the moment, I don’t think there is any cause for alarm or concern here related to any kind of real change against our forecast with what we are seeing in the real world. And then on your question about the coupling, I am still a bit of a skeptic as it relates to that dramatic change in the business model, particularly on the electric side. I think frankly the Wisconsin Commission is a bit skeptical as well. 
One other utility in the state has a pilot program for the coupling underway, I think every one has agreed to step back and let see the results down the road of that small coupling experiment to see if that’s the right track to go down, but at the moment, I don’t see a need for any dramatic change in the business model.

Let me just say this, the forecast for 2011 based on what we have seen so far is unchanged from the forecast that we used in our rate case for 2011. But first a little bit of color on the slowdown, about the second to third week of September and we track, by the way Jim, we track 17 large sectors, large industrial sectors of the economy here every week.
So, I see, Allen sees, Rick sees, we all see a weekly report on industrial energies by sector across these 17 large customer segments. For the third quarter, 13 of the 17 segments were green, in other words 13 of the 17 segments showed growth over the third quarter of a year ago. We are still seeing the majority of the segments have growth, but there is no question that about the second to third week of September, it’s almost like our industrial customers took a collective breath, it’s not one single segment, but a kind of across the board. 
The growth rate slowed down and we are really kind of seeing a pause. Now, that pause has continued into October, I cannot tell you if it’s permanent, if it’s a blip or if we’re starting to see the early signs of a downturn, but I can tell you its pretty visible in terms of at least a pause in the phase of the recovery and it’s pretty much across the board.
