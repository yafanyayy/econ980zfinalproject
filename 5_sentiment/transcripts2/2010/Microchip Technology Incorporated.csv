I want to apologize, I guess we were having some trouble with the IR Page on our website, and so we are working diligently to get that updated. But we wanted to start the call and hopefully that gets up and running",1383,"Thank you, and good morning, everybody. I want to apologize, I guess we were having some trouble with the IR Page on our website, and so we are working diligently to get that updated. But we wanted to start the call and hopefully that gets up and running here shortly. So during the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company. We wish to caution you that such statements or predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today, as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations. In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchipâ€™s President and CEO; Ganesh Moorthy, Executive Vice President and COO; Gordon Parnell, Vice President, Business Development and Investor Relations.We will conduct today's conference call in two separate parts. The first part of the call will be our normal earnings call, followed by a question-and-answer session. And the second part of today's call, we will summarize our announced acquisition of SST, and then hold a separate question and answer session relating to the acquisition. For our normal earnings call, I will comment on our third quarter fiscal 2010 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment, discuss our guidance for the March quarter and update other pertinent matters regarding our business. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. Again, please hold any questions related to the acquisition of SST until you are prompted to queue up.Net sales for the December quarter were $250.1 million, up approximately 10.3% from net sales of $226.7 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 30.1% from net sales of $192.2 million in the December 2008 quarter. On a geographic basis, revenue in the Americas was up 6.1% in the December quarter, Europe was up 10.2% and Asia was up 12.4%. Asia continues to be our largest geographic region, representing 52.3% of sales in the December quarter. The Americas were 23.7% of sales and Europe was 24% of sales. These measurements are based on where the product is delivered for manufacturing purposes for our customers, but does not necessarily represent where design activity is taking place or where the end product consumption is occurring. We are continuing to include information on our press release on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on our Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $70.1 million or $0.38 per diluted share, an increase of 31.2% from non-GAAP net income of $53.2 million or $0.29 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter. The after-tax impact on the December 2009 quarterly earnings that have been excluded from our non-GAAP results include: $8.5 million from a favorable tax settlement with the IRS; $7.7 million in share-based compensation expense; $1 million in non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt; and $0.5 million in charges associated with our acquisition activities. GAAP net income was $69.4 million in the December quarter or $0.37 per diluted share. The favorable impact on GAAP EPS from the settlement with the IRS was $.045 and will not be a recurring item in the March 2009 quarter. I will now go through the some of the operating results for the December quarter. I will be referring to gross margin and operating expense information on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effect of share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses.Gross margins were 59% in the December quarter, compared to 55.5% in the September quarter. The 350 basis point quarterly increase in gross profit margin was driven by a variety of factors, including higher production activity in our factories and continued cost reduction efforts from our global manufacturing operations. With the increase in revenue, we were able to achieve operating leverage on the business, with total operating expenses of 26.2% of sales in the December quarter, compared to 27.7% in the prior quarter. Research and development costs were $27.2 million, representing 10.9% of sales. Sales in general and administrative expenses were $38.4 million, representing 15.3% of sales. Our non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of sales were at approximately the same level in December 2009 quarter as they were in September 2008 quarter, which was Microchip's peak earnings quarter. The December operating expenses includes a substantial portion of all the cuts that we took in our employee compensation programs during the global financial crisis, and the forecast that we have provided for the March 2010 quarter includes the full run rate of these programs. On a full GAAP basis, gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 58.4%. Total operating expenses were $73.4 million or 29.4% of sales, and include share-based compensation of $7.6 million and acquisition-related expenses of $0.3 million. On a non-GAAP basis, the tax rate for the December quarter was 13.4%. The GAAP effective tax rate for the December quarter was 0.7%. The difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates was driven from an $8.5 million favorable settlement with the IRS related to fiscal years 2002 through 2004, as well as the higher tax rate that applies to the non-cash interest expense on our convertible debt. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits and the percentage of our cash that is invested in tax-advantaged securities. We expect our going forward, non-GAAP tax rate to be between 12.5% and 13%. The dividend declared today of $0.341 per share we paid on March 4, 2010, to shareholders of record on February 18, 2010. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $62.9 million. Moving onto the balance sheet, Microchip's inventory balance at December 31, 2009, was $112.8 million, representing approximately 99 days. Inventory on Microchip's balance sheet increased by $4.3 million or three days and days of inventory at our distributors increased to 40 days, compared to 35 days at the end of the prior quarter. I would like to remind you that Microchip recognizes its distribution revenue on a sell-through basis in its worldwide distribution channel. At the end of the December quarter, the combined inventory on Microchip's balance sheet and its distributors was 139 days, which is in the lower range of our historical averages. During the December quarter, we aggressively increased our manufacturing output so we can continue to satisfy the needs of our customers, by providing industry best lead times. We expect inventory days in our balance sheet in the March quarter to be about flat. The increases in our production output will have an ongoing positive impact from Microchip's gross margin percentage. At December 31, our receivables were $113.8 million, an increase of $7.1 million or 6.7% from the balance as of the September quarter. Receivable balances are in great condition with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers. Over the past year, we have not had any significant bad debt writeoffs in our business. We continue to closely monitor customer activity to ensure we are protecting the receivable assets on our balance sheet. As of December 31, Microchip's cash and total investment position was approximately $1.5 billion. Our cash generation from the business was $89.4 million, prior to the payment of a $62.5 million dividends. Our cash generation continues to be strong, and our total cash and investment position is projected to grow again in the March 2010 quarter. Capital spending was approximately $18.7 million for the December quarter and our fiscal 2010 capital expenditure forecast is currently $50 million. We are investing in equipments, support the revenue growth of our new products and technologies and are also taking advantage of low-cost equipment opportunities in the marketplace that will position us well for future growth. Depreciation expense for the December quarter was $21.7 million, which was flat to depreciation in the September quarter. I will now ask Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?"

We continue to see the",704,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I will now comment on the individual product lines. All three of our product lines, microcontrollers, analog and serial EEPROMs [ph] delivered outstanding growth in the December quarter. We continue to see the results of our strategy to stay invested in our new product development and demand creation resources during the global recession. By employing a shared sacrifice to cut costs instead of resorting to mass layoffs, we believe we are seeing the continuation of differentiated revenue growth and operating profit results. Let me now take a closer look at each of product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our Microcontroller business delivered superb results, and was up a strong 10% on a sequential basis and up 30% from the year-ago quarter. The December quarter was also the third consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential growth for the Microcontroller business. Flash microcontrollers represented 81.3% of our Microcontroller business in the December quarter. Our 8-bit Microcontroller business had another excellent quarter, as all segments of our 8-bit product lines experienced very strong growth. Our 16-bit Microcontroller business achieved another record for quarterly revenue, with strong sequential growth of 10% building upon the 49% sequential growth we had last quarter. 16-bit microcontrollers also grew over 101% from the year-ago quarter. New customers and new designs go into production continued to help drive growth as a number of volume 16-bit customers grew by 239 customers to 2,289. Our 32-bit microcontroller product line meanwhile continues to make good progress, with 44% sequential growth albeit from a smaller base, building upon the 56% sequential growth we had last quarter. We now have 173 32-bit microcontroller customers in volume production. Moving to development tools, we had another record quarter, with 41,492 development tools shipped in the December quarter. The third consecutive quarter of record development tool sales. As you have seen from our growth in recent quarters, development tool sales are in excellent leading a indicator of continued strong design and activity, and acceptance of our solutions by our customers. And the continued strength of record development tool sales should bode well for future growth.Now moving to the Analog products, our Analog business also delivered outstanding results, with very strong sequential growth of 14.1% and 40% growth versus the year-ago quarter to achieve record high revenues. This also marked the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for our Analog business, and the first time we have crossed the greater than $100 million annualized revenue run rate. Those where the especially strong in the linear, interface, safety and security product lines. I was very pleased with the design wins and revenue momentum of our Analog business has shown.We continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new products that we expect will contribute to a continued strong revenue growth in the coming quarters. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of ZeroG wireless, an innovator in low power wifi solutions in the embedded market that complements our broad portfolio of microcontrollers. ZeroG was a private company located in Silicon Valley and is at an early revenue stage. Now moving to Serial EE [ph] memory products this business was up 9.8% sequentially. We were pleased to see solid growth in this area for our embedded control products. We continue to run this business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. At a time when many of our competitors have significantly pushed out their lead times of between 14 and 26 weeks, Microchip's investment in inventory use the flexible rotating time-off in our factories during the recession, and ongoing operational excellence has enabled us to  continue to provide industry-leading lead times. In the current environment, this is translating to further growth in our market share as we are better able to respond to rapidly rising customer demand, capitalize on our competitor's inability to supply product as well as to instill confidence in customers who as they should commit new designs or as to who they should commit new designs to, so that they are assured of future supply. Let me now go back to Steve for some general comments as well as our guidance for the March quarter. Steve?"

And today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the December quarter, and I would answer some of the investor and analyst concerns that we have heard in the last few months, then I will talk about our guidance for March 2010 quarter. Reflecting on the December quarter, I want to thank the entire Microchip team for delivering an outstanding quarter in every respect. We beat the upper end of our revised guidance in the next sales, gross margins, operating profits, earnings per share and free cash flow by a significant margin. It is also the first time in our 15 years that we have achieved three consecutive quarters, with over 10% sequential growth in net sales. We also beat the lower end of our operating expense and inventory guidance by a good margin. We have now been profitable for 77 consecutive quarters and the March quarter will be our 78. From a geographical standpoint, as Eric discussed, we achieved substantial sequential growth in all major geographies of the world. And on product lines, the story was impressive too. As Ganesh discussed, we achieved significant sequential growth in all of our product lines with microcontrollers up 10%, 16-bit microcontrollers up by 10% sequentially and analog up by 14.1% sequentially. I also wanted to highlight the comparison to SIA numbers that were recently released. While Microchip does not participate in SIA and short-term SIA numbers are up from suspect, many of the investors and analysts follow those numbers. So based on this SIA data, calendar year 2009 industry sales for eight plus 16-bit microcontrollers were down 23.6% from calendar 2008. Microchip's eight plus 16-bit sales for calendar 2009 were down 14.6% from calendar 2008 to 23.6% from the industry and 14.6% for Microchip. If you look at December quarter 2009 over December quarter 2008, so last quarter over a year ago quarter, then the industry eight plus 16-bit microcontrollers sales were up 12.3% while Microchip's eight plus 16-bit MCU sales were up a whopping 29.6%. So industry at 12.3% up and Microchip up 29.6%, showing significant market share gains. We are gaining share on both eight as well as 16-bit microcontrollers. Next, I would like to discuss four concerns that investors and analysts have raised in the last several months. The first of these concerns is where are Microchip's growth drivers? The best way to prove their growth is by posting strong sequential growth, which we have been doing for several quarters. Beyond that, there are five major drivers of growth: First, is our multi-year demand creation program, in which we added 28% additional sales and application personnel three years ago, and then we retained them through the global financial crisis of last year. They have created a steady stream of new customers and new design wins that are turning to production adding to our growth. Second, we have an industry-leading design engineering awareness of our eight, 16 and 32-bit microcontroller solutions. On 8-bit microcontrollers, we are the number one choice of designers by a wide margin. On 16 and 32-bit, we are tied in the number first place. Number three, we have significantly expanded our served available market with the introduction of over 400 new products in the last three years, covering several key trust areas like eXtreme Low Power, Touch Sense, USB interface, Advanced Graphics, high-performance analog, ethernet connectivity, RF connectivity, motor control and digital power supply. Number four, our Analog business is growing and gaining market share. We are gaining by attaching Analog to our microcontroller applications, as well as embedding analog functionality on the microcontroller dye.  And number five, we're gaining share from large but financially strapped competitors. The second area of concern that investors and analysts have shown is the gross margin percentage. In the earnings call in November, we shared our internal plan for calendar year '10. We gave a non-GAAP gross margin of 58.5% for the year, which was lower than our prior peak. That left the impression that gross margins are challenged. We have already exceeded that gross margin for December '09 quarter and we have guided 60% gross margin for the March 2010 quarter. We now believe that we will achieve our previous record gross margin of 61.6% non-GAAP by the end of the fiscal year '11. The third area of concern has been operating expenses. Analysts have the impression that there are large operating expenses coming that are not in the model. That is not correct. In the quarter, we just announced the operating expense was 26.2% non-GAAP, which matched the operating expense in our record quarter of fiscal Q2 '09. From September to December quarter that we just completed, our operating expenses grew by 4.3%, while sales grew by 10.3%. In the March 2010 quarter, we have all of the employee compensation programs back in the operating expenses, and we expect the operating expenses to stay in this range of 26.2% as a percentage of sales. The final concern shown has been that the inventories are getting replenished and hence, it is at the cycle top. Microchip's inventories plus our distributor's inventories combined are in the lower end of historical days of sales. We have always differentiated ourselves from the competition by maintaining some short lead times. If we could say anything about our inventory, our inventory at Microchip is lower than we would ideally like while our distribution and inventory is in a reasonable range. We are continuing to make the necessary changes to bring inventories in-line with customer's needs, and maintain the best lead times in the industry. But because of strong growth that we are experiencing, we expect inventory to really stay flat in the March quarter as Eric talked about. Having addressed these investors and analysts concerns, I will now move to provide guidance for March 2010 quarter.Our book-to-bill ratio for December quarter was 1.12, and we started the March quarter with an all-time record high backlog, so the visibility is improving significantly. The bookings rate so far in the quarter has been very strong. This quarter, we see significantly higher shipping days in U.S. and Europe, but lower shipping days in Asia because of Lunar New Year. Considering all that, we expect our net sales for the March quarter to be up between 3% and 7% sequentially above what normal seasonality is for our business. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 59.75% and 60.25%, which is 75 to 125 basis point improvement over the December quarter and we expect our GAAP gross margin to be between 58.85% and 59.35%. Regarding earnings per share for the March quarter, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.39 and $0.41. We expect GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.34 and $0.36. Now I would like to comment on the longer-term outlook for our calendar year '10, and this outlook for calendar year '10 excludes the acquisition of SST that we just announced. We will talk about it later. Last quarter, we shared our internal plan for calendar year '10 with investors in the financial community. We talked about calendar year '10 revenue of $1.05 billion, up 26% from calendar year '09. This internal forecast met with skepticism from several of the analysts. I'm happy to tell you that after one quarter, we see our calendar year '10 plan to be quite conservative. With just the March quarter's revenue times four, we meet our internal plan. And I've already talked about gross margin for calendar year '10 to be well above our internal plan while we won't be revising our internal plan every quarter, we are confident of beating it by a significant margin. So as we said in the start of the call, we will first take questions from investors and analysts about our earnings and our guidance. And after that, we will make some more commentary about the SST acquisition, followed by a second question-and-answers period. With that, operator, would you please pull up for questions."

We sell across thousands of applications, 70,000 customers and we're seeing a broad-based recovery in every geography around the world. And beyond that, we can't really give you an end market commentary. We are seeing our business grow significantly better than our competitors. I did some comparisons to SIA this time in the last two or three times also. So we're seeing significant share gains, our new product pipeline is really the best it has been in a long time because we stay committed with our resources and product designs in the last year and a half for many of our competitors laid off people and killed the product pipelines. Our lead times shorter, our customer service is excellent so customers are designing with us. So we feel a very, very strong outlook in every way we look at it."

We're excited about this acquisition and we would now like to give you a brief overview of who SST is, why we decided to acquire them, how we plan to handle the financial reporting for the various SST businesses and then summarize the overall transaction. So let's start with an overview of who SST is. SST is a global leader in embedded flash technology and in licensing of these technologies. SST also has several other businesses nested within the company including Serial, Parallel and Specialty Flash Memories, 8051 microcontrollers and NAND controllers. NAND drives that provide solid state storage, power amplifiers and low noise amplifiers for Wi-Fi applications. SST is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California and has 574 employees worldwide. SST has approximately $180 million in cash and liquid trading securities on their balance sheet and no debt. We see a compelling strategic rationale to acquire SST for the following reasons: First, their proprietary Superflash technology is a critical building block technology for advanced microcontrollers. For example, this Superflash technology is licensed by most major foundries and microcontroller OEM. This acquisition secure us critical embedded flash technology for Microchip's core, Microcontroller business and it also enables us to get earlier access to advance technologies versus waiting until their in production at the foundries. This acquisition also gives us the ability to customize technology variants that would give us an advantage over competing technologies. Second, SST adds a strong patent portfolio to Microchip's intellectual property portfolio. SST is over 360 graphic patterns and over 180 patents that are pending. And third, we would add 8051 microcontrollers and NAND controllers to our microcontroller portfolio, NAND controllers essentially are specialized microcontrollers for a given application.Now let's move to the financial reporting plan. The Licensing business, 8051 microcontrollers and NAND controllers will be consolidated into Microchip's financial reporting of continuing operations. We plan to continue investing in Superflash technology, consistent with enabling our technology needs and growing the Licensing business. We plan to rationalize the Serial, Parallel and Specialty Flash Memory businesses consistent with supporting and growing the Licensing business and emulating Microchip's high margin Serial EEPROM business model. We will treat the memory business model as an asset held for sale until the rationalizing is complete. And we plan to divest the NAND drive and Wi-Fi amplifier businesses, and we'll hold them as assets held for sale.Finally, let me provide you with a transaction summary. A $2.85 per share acquisition price translates to a transaction value of $275 million. However, once you account for SST's $180 million in cash and liquid trading and securities, the net transaction value is approximately $95 million. We expect the blended, non-GAAP operating margins to be excellent after we complete the planned divestitures and rationalize the Memory business. We expect the transaction to be accretive on a non-GAAP basis in the first quarter full quarter after the transaction closes, and expect to close the transaction in the second calendar quarter of 2010. A presentation for the key points we have reviewed with you today will be available from our website after this conference call. And with that, we would be happy to take your questions about the SST acquisition."

Other said their dividend will be cut, we were the one company that didn't cut it, maintained the dividend now we're slowly growing it again, still keeping it at industry high. And yes, for the last 18 months we have done five acquisitions, but most of them had been quite small. This is the largest acquisition, which will use about $95 million to $100 million. Many others have been really single-digits to low single-digits kind of numbers. So our strategy with this acquisitions is elbow out with each and every acquisition, we are slowly and steadily elbowing out to the adjacent sockets and under microcontroller or helping act to a microcontroller whether it add Wi-Fi capability to a microcontroller with ZeroG, whether it added touchscreen with the Hampshire acquisition, whether it give us the world-class C compilers with the software acquisition we did. And in this particular case, the Superflash technology, nearly 4 billion plus microcontrollers a year are built on SST flash technology, majority of our competitors and major foundries have licensed their technology.

Now the flash that were done inside, is significantly more reliable. We are one of the only competitors, I believe, there maybe always others and then we say only there's the risk of being wrong. Our internal flash doesn't require added connection to go into even the most complexed and reliability sensitive applications like automotive. Some of the SST flash applications in automotive, for example, require an added collection mechanism. So our internal technology leads in reliability, leads in accident reliability, low power and other stuff. So we address the market inside with our products which have those characteristics. They're often lower density products, they're often low-powered products and other things. Now microcontroller market is very, very diverse. Everybody doesn't need low power, everybody doesn't need low-density, some need high-density but they also need reliability for. So SST flash, definitely more microcontrollers in the world shipped on SST flash than probably in any other technology, we can probably safely say that.

The first part of the call will be our normal earnings call, followed by a question-and-answer session. And the second part of today's call, we will summarize our announced acquisition of SST, and then hold a separate question and answer session relating to the acquisition. For our normal earnings call, I will comment on our third quarter fiscal 2010 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment, discuss our guidance for the March quarter and update other pertinent matters regarding our business. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. Again, please hold any questions related to the acquisition of SST until you are prompted to queue up.Net sales for the December quarter were $250.1 million, up approximately 10.3% from net sales of $226.7 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 30.1% from net sales of $192.2 million in the December 2008 quarter. On a geographic basis, revenue in the Americas was up 6.1% in the December quarter, Europe was up 10.2% and Asia was up 12.4%. Asia continues to be our largest geographic region, representing 52.3% of sales in the December quarter. The Americas were 23.7% of sales and Europe was 24% of sales. These measurements are based on where the product is delivered for manufacturing purposes for our customers, but does not necessarily represent where design activity is taking place or where the end product consumption is occurring. We are continuing to include information on our press release on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on our Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $70.1 million or $0.38 per diluted share, an increase of 31.2% from non-GAAP net income of $53.2 million or $0.29 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter. The after-tax impact on the December 2009 quarterly earnings that have been excluded from our non-GAAP results include: $8.5 million from a favorable tax settlement with the IRS; $7.7 million in share-based compensation expense; $1 million in non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt; and $0.5 million in charges associated with our acquisition activities. GAAP net income was $69.4 million in the December quarter or $0.37 per diluted share. The favorable impact on GAAP EPS from the settlement with the IRS was $.045 and will not be a recurring item in the March 2009 quarter. I will now go through the some of the operating results for the December quarter. I will be referring to gross margin and operating expense information on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effect of share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses.Gross margins were 59% in the December quarter, compared to 55.5% in the September quarter. The 350 basis point quarterly increase in gross profit margin was driven by a variety of factors, including higher production activity in our factories and continued cost reduction efforts from our global manufacturing operations. With the increase in revenue, we were able to achieve operating leverage on the business, with total operating expenses of 26.2% of sales in the December quarter, compared to 27.7% in the prior quarter. Research and development costs were $27.2 million, representing 10.9% of sales. Sales in general and administrative expenses were $38.4 million, representing 15.3% of sales. Our non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of sales were at approximately the same level in December 2009 quarter as they were in September 2008 quarter, which was Microchip's peak earnings quarter. The December operating expenses includes a substantial portion of all the cuts that we took in our employee compensation programs during the global financial crisis, and the forecast that we have provided for the March 2010 quarter includes the full run rate of these programs. On a full GAAP basis, gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 58.4%. Total operating expenses were $73.4 million or 29.4% of sales, and include share-based compensation of $7.6 million and acquisition-related expenses of $0.3 million. On a non-GAAP basis, the tax rate for the December quarter was 13.4%. The GAAP effective tax rate for the December quarter was 0.7%. The difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates was driven from an $8.5 million favorable settlement with the IRS related to fiscal years 2002 through 2004, as well as the higher tax rate that applies to the non-cash interest expense on our convertible debt. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits and the percentage of our cash that is invested in tax-advantaged securities. We expect our going forward, non-GAAP tax rate to be between 12.5% and 13%. The dividend declared today of $0.341 per share we paid on March 4, 2010, to shareholders of record on February 18, 2010. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $62.9 million. Moving onto the balance sheet, Microchip's inventory balance at December 31, 2009, was $112.8 million, representing approximately 99 days. Inventory on Microchip's balance sheet increased by $4.3 million or three days and days of inventory at our distributors increased to 40 days, compared to 35 days at the end of the prior quarter. I would like to remind you that Microchip recognizes its distribution revenue on a sell-through basis in its worldwide distribution channel. At the end of the December quarter, the combined inventory on Microchip's balance sheet and its distributors was 139 days, which is in the lower range of our historical averages. During the December quarter, we aggressively increased our manufacturing output so we can continue to satisfy the needs of our customers, by providing industry best lead times. We expect inventory days in our balance sheet in the March quarter to be about flat. The increases in our production output will have an ongoing positive impact from Microchip's gross margin percentage. At December 31, our receivables were $113.8 million, an increase of $7.1 million or 6.7% from the balance as of the September quarter. Receivable balances are in great condition with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers. Over the past year, we have not had any significant bad debt writeoffs in our business. We continue to closely monitor customer activity to ensure we are protecting the receivable assets on our balance sheet. As of December 31, Microchip's cash and total investment position was approximately $1.5 billion. Our cash generation from the business was $89.4 million, prior to the payment of a $62.5 million dividends. Our cash generation continues to be strong, and our total cash and investment position is projected to grow again in the March 2010 quarter. Capital spending was approximately $18.7 million for the December quarter and our fiscal 2010 capital expenditure forecast is currently $50 million. We are investing in equipments, support the revenue growth of our new products and technologies and are also taking advantage of low-cost equipment opportunities in the marketplace that will position us well for future growth. Depreciation expense for the December quarter was $21.7 million, which was flat to depreciation in the September quarter. I will now ask Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?"

We continue to see the",704,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I will now comment on the individual product lines. All three of our product lines, microcontrollers, analog and serial EEPROMs [ph] delivered outstanding growth in the December quarter. We continue to see the results of our strategy to stay invested in our new product development and demand creation resources during the global recession. By employing a shared sacrifice to cut costs instead of resorting to mass layoffs, we believe we are seeing the continuation of differentiated revenue growth and operating profit results. Let me now take a closer look at each of product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our Microcontroller business delivered superb results, and was up a strong 10% on a sequential basis and up 30% from the year-ago quarter. The December quarter was also the third consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential growth for the Microcontroller business. Flash microcontrollers represented 81.3% of our Microcontroller business in the December quarter. Our 8-bit Microcontroller business had another excellent quarter, as all segments of our 8-bit product lines experienced very strong growth. Our 16-bit Microcontroller business achieved another record for quarterly revenue, with strong sequential growth of 10% building upon the 49% sequential growth we had last quarter. 16-bit microcontrollers also grew over 101% from the year-ago quarter. New customers and new designs go into production continued to help drive growth as a number of volume 16-bit customers grew by 239 customers to 2,289. Our 32-bit microcontroller product line meanwhile continues to make good progress, with 44% sequential growth albeit from a smaller base, building upon the 56% sequential growth we had last quarter. We now have 173 32-bit microcontroller customers in volume production. Moving to development tools, we had another record quarter, with 41,492 development tools shipped in the December quarter. The third consecutive quarter of record development tool sales. As you have seen from our growth in recent quarters, development tool sales are in excellent leading a indicator of continued strong design and activity, and acceptance of our solutions by our customers. And the continued strength of record development tool sales should bode well for future growth.Now moving to the Analog products, our Analog business also delivered outstanding results, with very strong sequential growth of 14.1% and 40% growth versus the year-ago quarter to achieve record high revenues. This also marked the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for our Analog business, and the first time we have crossed the greater than $100 million annualized revenue run rate. Those where the especially strong in the linear, interface, safety and security product lines. I was very pleased with the design wins and revenue momentum of our Analog business has shown.We continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new products that we expect will contribute to a continued strong revenue growth in the coming quarters. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of ZeroG wireless, an innovator in low power wifi solutions in the embedded market that complements our broad portfolio of microcontrollers. ZeroG was a private company located in Silicon Valley and is at an early revenue stage. Now moving to Serial EE [ph] memory products this business was up 9.8% sequentially. We were pleased to see solid growth in this area for our embedded control products. We continue to run this business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. At a time when many of our competitors have significantly pushed out their lead times of between 14 and 26 weeks, Microchip's investment in inventory use the flexible rotating time-off in our factories during the recession, and ongoing operational excellence has enabled us to  continue to provide industry-leading lead times. In the current environment, this is translating to further growth in our market share as we are better able to respond to rapidly rising customer demand, capitalize on our competitor's inability to supply product as well as to instill confidence in customers who as they should commit new designs or as to who they should commit new designs to, so that they are assured of future supply. Let me now go back to Steve for some general comments as well as our guidance for the March quarter. Steve?"

And today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the December quarter, and I would answer some of the investor and analyst concerns that we have heard in the last few months, then I will talk about our guidance for March 2010 quarter. Reflecting on the December quarter, I want to thank the entire Microchip team for delivering an outstanding quarter in every respect. We beat the upper end of our revised guidance in the next sales, gross margins, operating profits, earnings per share and free cash flow by a significant margin. It is also the first time in our 15 years that we have achieved three consecutive quarters, with over 10% sequential growth in net sales. We also beat the lower end of our operating expense and inventory guidance by a good margin. We have now been profitable for 77 consecutive quarters and the March quarter will be our 78. From a geographical standpoint, as Eric discussed, we achieved substantial sequential growth in all major geographies of the world. And on product lines, the story was impressive too. As Ganesh discussed, we achieved significant sequential growth in all of our product lines with microcontrollers up 10%, 16-bit microcontrollers up by 10% sequentially and analog up by 14.1% sequentially. I also wanted to highlight the comparison to SIA numbers that were recently released. While Microchip does not participate in SIA and short-term SIA numbers are up from suspect, many of the investors and analysts follow those numbers. So based on this SIA data, calendar year 2009 industry sales for eight plus 16-bit microcontrollers were down 23.6% from calendar 2008. Microchip's eight plus 16-bit sales for calendar 2009 were down 14.6% from calendar 2008 to 23.6% from the industry and 14.6% for Microchip. If you look at December quarter 2009 over December quarter 2008, so last quarter over a year ago quarter, then the industry eight plus 16-bit microcontrollers sales were up 12.3% while Microchip's eight plus 16-bit MCU sales were up a whopping 29.6%. So industry at 12.3% up and Microchip up 29.6%, showing significant market share gains. We are gaining share on both eight as well as 16-bit microcontrollers. Next, I would like to discuss four concerns that investors and analysts have raised in the last several months. The first of these concerns is where are Microchip's growth drivers? The best way to prove their growth is by posting strong sequential growth, which we have been doing for several quarters. Beyond that, there are five major drivers of growth: First, is our multi-year demand creation program, in which we added 28% additional sales and application personnel three years ago, and then we retained them through the global financial crisis of last year. They have created a steady stream of new customers and new design wins that are turning to production adding to our growth. Second, we have an industry-leading design engineering awareness of our eight, 16 and 32-bit microcontroller solutions. On 8-bit microcontrollers, we are the number one choice of designers by a wide margin. On 16 and 32-bit, we are tied in the number first place. Number three, we have significantly expanded our served available market with the introduction of over 400 new products in the last three years, covering several key trust areas like eXtreme Low Power, Touch Sense, USB interface, Advanced Graphics, high-performance analog, ethernet connectivity, RF connectivity, motor control and digital power supply. Number four, our Analog business is growing and gaining market share. We are gaining by attaching Analog to our microcontroller applications, as well as embedding analog functionality on the microcontroller dye.  And number five, we're gaining share from large but financially strapped competitors. The second area of concern that investors and analysts have shown is the gross margin percentage. In the earnings call in November, we shared our internal plan for calendar year '10. We gave a non-GAAP gross margin of 58.5% for the year, which was lower than our prior peak. That left the impression that gross margins are challenged. We have already exceeded that gross margin for December '09 quarter and we have guided 60% gross margin for the March 2010 quarter. We now believe that we will achieve our previous record gross margin of 61.6% non-GAAP by the end of the fiscal year '11. The third area of concern has been operating expenses. Analysts have the impression that there are large operating expenses coming that are not in the model. That is not correct. In the quarter, we just announced the operating expense was 26.2% non-GAAP, which matched the operating expense in our record quarter of fiscal Q2 '09. From September to December quarter that we just completed, our operating expenses grew by 4.3%, while sales grew by 10.3%. In the March 2010 quarter, we have all of the employee compensation programs back in the operating expenses, and we expect the operating expenses to stay in this range of 26.2% as a percentage of sales. The final concern shown has been that the inventories are getting replenished and hence, it is at the cycle top. Microchip's inventories plus our distributor's inventories combined are in the lower end of historical days of sales. We have always differentiated ourselves from the competition by maintaining some short lead times. If we could say anything about our inventory, our inventory at Microchip is lower than we would ideally like while our distribution and inventory is in a reasonable range. We are continuing to make the necessary changes to bring inventories in-line with customer's needs, and maintain the best lead times in the industry. But because of strong growth that we are experiencing, we expect inventory to really stay flat in the March quarter as Eric talked about. Having addressed these investors and analysts concerns, I will now move to provide guidance for March 2010 quarter.Our book-to-bill ratio for December quarter was 1.12, and we started the March quarter with an all-time record high backlog, so the visibility is improving significantly. The bookings rate so far in the quarter has been very strong. This quarter, we see significantly higher shipping days in U.S. and Europe, but lower shipping days in Asia because of Lunar New Year. Considering all that, we expect our net sales for the March quarter to be up between 3% and 7% sequentially above what normal seasonality is for our business. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 59.75% and 60.25%, which is 75 to 125 basis point improvement over the December quarter and we expect our GAAP gross margin to be between 58.85% and 59.35%. Regarding earnings per share for the March quarter, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.39 and $0.41. We expect GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.34 and $0.36. Now I would like to comment on the longer-term outlook for our calendar year '10, and this outlook for calendar year '10 excludes the acquisition of SST that we just announced. We will talk about it later. Last quarter, we shared our internal plan for calendar year '10 with investors in the financial community. We talked about calendar year '10 revenue of $1.05 billion, up 26% from calendar year '09. This internal forecast met with skepticism from several of the analysts. I'm happy to tell you that after one quarter, we see our calendar year '10 plan to be quite conservative. With just the March quarter's revenue times four, we meet our internal plan. And I've already talked about gross margin for calendar year '10 to be well above our internal plan while we won't be revising our internal plan every quarter, we are confident of beating it by a significant margin. So as we said in the start of the call, we will first take questions from investors and analysts about our earnings and our guidance. And after that, we will make some more commentary about the SST acquisition, followed by a second question-and-answers period. With that, operator, would you please pull up for questions."

And we also indicated earlier that we should get back to our prior peak gross margins of 61.6% non-GAAP over the next four quarters by the end of fiscal year '11. And that gets to the prior peak gross margins, and that's where we believe that without SST, that sort of where our business model is."

We're excited about this acquisition and we would now like to give you a brief overview of who SST is, why we decided to acquire them, how we plan to handle the financial reporting for the various SST businesses and then summarize the overall transaction. So let's start with an overview of who SST is. SST is a global leader in embedded flash technology and in licensing of these technologies. SST also has several other businesses nested within the company including Serial, Parallel and Specialty Flash Memories, 8051 microcontrollers and NAND controllers. NAND drives that provide solid state storage, power amplifiers and low noise amplifiers for Wi-Fi applications. SST is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California and has 574 employees worldwide. SST has approximately $180 million in cash and liquid trading securities on their balance sheet and no debt. We see a compelling strategic rationale to acquire SST for the following reasons: First, their proprietary Superflash technology is a critical building block technology for advanced microcontrollers. For example, this Superflash technology is licensed by most major foundries and microcontroller OEM. This acquisition secure us critical embedded flash technology for Microchip's core, Microcontroller business and it also enables us to get earlier access to advance technologies versus waiting until their in production at the foundries. This acquisition also gives us the ability to customize technology variants that would give us an advantage over competing technologies. Second, SST adds a strong patent portfolio to Microchip's intellectual property portfolio. SST is over 360 graphic patterns and over 180 patents that are pending. And third, we would add 8051 microcontrollers and NAND controllers to our microcontroller portfolio, NAND controllers essentially are specialized microcontrollers for a given application.Now let's move to the financial reporting plan. The Licensing business, 8051 microcontrollers and NAND controllers will be consolidated into Microchip's financial reporting of continuing operations. We plan to continue investing in Superflash technology, consistent with enabling our technology needs and growing the Licensing business. We plan to rationalize the Serial, Parallel and Specialty Flash Memory businesses consistent with supporting and growing the Licensing business and emulating Microchip's high margin Serial EEPROM business model. We will treat the memory business model as an asset held for sale until the rationalizing is complete. And we plan to divest the NAND drive and Wi-Fi amplifier businesses, and we'll hold them as assets held for sale.Finally, let me provide you with a transaction summary. A $2.85 per share acquisition price translates to a transaction value of $275 million. However, once you account for SST's $180 million in cash and liquid trading and securities, the net transaction value is approximately $95 million. We expect the blended, non-GAAP operating margins to be excellent after we complete the planned divestitures and rationalize the Memory business. We expect the transaction to be accretive on a non-GAAP basis in the first quarter full quarter after the transaction closes, and expect to close the transaction in the second calendar quarter of 2010. A presentation for the key points we have reviewed with you today will be available from our website after this conference call. And with that, we would be happy to take your questions about the SST acquisition."

And yes, for the last 18 months we have done five acquisitions, but most of them had been quite small. This is the largest acquisition, which will use about $95 million to $100 million. Many others have been really single-digits to low single-digits kind of numbers. So our strategy with this acquisitions is elbow out with each and every acquisition, we are slowly and steadily elbowing out to the adjacent sockets and under microcontroller or helping act to a microcontroller whether it add Wi-Fi capability to a microcontroller with ZeroG, whether it added touchscreen with the Hampshire acquisition, whether it give us the world-class C compilers with the software acquisition we did. And in this particular case, the Superflash technology, nearly 4 billion plus microcontrollers a year are built on SST flash technology, majority of our competitors and major foundries have licensed their technology. So we believe that, that technology in our hands will have significant advantage to get advance leading access to that."

Our internal flash doesn't require added connection to go into even the most complexed and reliability sensitive applications like automotive. Some of the SST flash applications in automotive, for example, require an added collection mechanism. So our internal technology leads in reliability, leads in accident reliability, low power and other stuff. So we address the market inside with our products which have those characteristics. They're often lower density products, they're often low-powered products and other things. Now microcontroller market is very, very diverse. Everybody doesn't need low power, everybody doesn't need low-density, some need high-density but they also need reliability for.

And the second part of today's call, we will summarize our announced acquisition of SST, and then hold a separate question and answer session relating to the acquisition. For our normal earnings call, I will comment on our third quarter fiscal 2010 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment, discuss our guidance for the March quarter and update other pertinent matters regarding our business. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. Again, please hold any questions related to the acquisition of SST until you are prompted to queue up.Net sales for the December quarter were $250.1 million, up approximately 10.3% from net sales of $226.7 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 30.1% from net sales of $192.2 million in the December 2008 quarter. On a geographic basis, revenue in the Americas was up 6.1% in the December quarter, Europe was up 10.2% and Asia was up 12.4%. Asia continues to be our largest geographic region, representing 52.3% of sales in the December quarter. The Americas were 23.7% of sales and Europe was 24% of sales. These measurements are based on where the product is delivered for manufacturing purposes for our customers, but does not necessarily represent where design activity is taking place or where the end product consumption is occurring. We are continuing to include information on our press release on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on our Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $70.1 million or $0.38 per diluted share, an increase of 31.2% from non-GAAP net income of $53.2 million or $0.29 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter. The after-tax impact on the December 2009 quarterly earnings that have been excluded from our non-GAAP results include: $8.5 million from a favorable tax settlement with the IRS; $7.7 million in share-based compensation expense; $1 million in non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt; and $0.5 million in charges associated with our acquisition activities. GAAP net income was $69.4 million in the December quarter or $0.37 per diluted share. The favorable impact on GAAP EPS from the settlement with the IRS was $.045 and will not be a recurring item in the March 2009 quarter. I will now go through the some of the operating results for the December quarter. I will be referring to gross margin and operating expense information on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effect of share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses.Gross margins were 59% in the December quarter, compared to 55.5% in the September quarter. The 350 basis point quarterly increase in gross profit margin was driven by a variety of factors, including higher production activity in our factories and continued cost reduction efforts from our global manufacturing operations. With the increase in revenue, we were able to achieve operating leverage on the business, with total operating expenses of 26.2% of sales in the December quarter, compared to 27.7% in the prior quarter. Research and development costs were $27.2 million, representing 10.9% of sales. Sales in general and administrative expenses were $38.4 million, representing 15.3% of sales. Our non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of sales were at approximately the same level in December 2009 quarter as they were in September 2008 quarter, which was Microchip's peak earnings quarter. The December operating expenses includes a substantial portion of all the cuts that we took in our employee compensation programs during the global financial crisis, and the forecast that we have provided for the March 2010 quarter includes the full run rate of these programs. On a full GAAP basis, gross margins including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses were 58.4%. Total operating expenses were $73.4 million or 29.4% of sales, and include share-based compensation of $7.6 million and acquisition-related expenses of $0.3 million. On a non-GAAP basis, the tax rate for the December quarter was 13.4%. The GAAP effective tax rate for the December quarter was 0.7%. The difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates was driven from an $8.5 million favorable settlement with the IRS related to fiscal years 2002 through 2004, as well as the higher tax rate that applies to the non-cash interest expense on our convertible debt. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits and the percentage of our cash that is invested in tax-advantaged securities. We expect our going forward, non-GAAP tax rate to be between 12.5% and 13%. The dividend declared today of $0.341 per share we paid on March 4, 2010, to shareholders of record on February 18, 2010. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $62.9 million. Moving onto the balance sheet, Microchip's inventory balance at December 31, 2009, was $112.8 million, representing approximately 99 days. Inventory on Microchip's balance sheet increased by $4.3 million or three days and days of inventory at our distributors increased to 40 days, compared to 35 days at the end of the prior quarter. I would like to remind you that Microchip recognizes its distribution revenue on a sell-through basis in its worldwide distribution channel. At the end of the December quarter, the combined inventory on Microchip's balance sheet and its distributors was 139 days, which is in the lower range of our historical averages. During the December quarter, we aggressively increased our manufacturing output so we can continue to satisfy the needs of our customers, by providing industry best lead times. We expect inventory days in our balance sheet in the March quarter to be about flat. The increases in our production output will have an ongoing positive impact from Microchip's gross margin percentage. At December 31, our receivables were $113.8 million, an increase of $7.1 million or 6.7% from the balance as of the September quarter. Receivable balances are in great condition with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers. Over the past year, we have not had any significant bad debt writeoffs in our business. We continue to closely monitor customer activity to ensure we are protecting the receivable assets on our balance sheet. As of December 31, Microchip's cash and total investment position was approximately $1.5 billion. Our cash generation from the business was $89.4 million, prior to the payment of a $62.5 million dividends. Our cash generation continues to be strong, and our total cash and investment position is projected to grow again in the March 2010 quarter. Capital spending was approximately $18.7 million for the December quarter and our fiscal 2010 capital expenditure forecast is currently $50 million. We are investing in equipments, support the revenue growth of our new products and technologies and are also taking advantage of low-cost equipment opportunities in the marketplace that will position us well for future growth. Depreciation expense for the December quarter was $21.7 million, which was flat to depreciation in the September quarter. I will now ask Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?"

We continue to see the",704,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I will now comment on the individual product lines. All three of our product lines, microcontrollers, analog and serial EEPROMs [ph] delivered outstanding growth in the December quarter. We continue to see the results of our strategy to stay invested in our new product development and demand creation resources during the global recession. By employing a shared sacrifice to cut costs instead of resorting to mass layoffs, we believe we are seeing the continuation of differentiated revenue growth and operating profit results. Let me now take a closer look at each of product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our Microcontroller business delivered superb results, and was up a strong 10% on a sequential basis and up 30% from the year-ago quarter. The December quarter was also the third consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential growth for the Microcontroller business. Flash microcontrollers represented 81.3% of our Microcontroller business in the December quarter. Our 8-bit Microcontroller business had another excellent quarter, as all segments of our 8-bit product lines experienced very strong growth. Our 16-bit Microcontroller business achieved another record for quarterly revenue, with strong sequential growth of 10% building upon the 49% sequential growth we had last quarter. 16-bit microcontrollers also grew over 101% from the year-ago quarter. New customers and new designs go into production continued to help drive growth as a number of volume 16-bit customers grew by 239 customers to 2,289. Our 32-bit microcontroller product line meanwhile continues to make good progress, with 44% sequential growth albeit from a smaller base, building upon the 56% sequential growth we had last quarter. We now have 173 32-bit microcontroller customers in volume production. Moving to development tools, we had another record quarter, with 41,492 development tools shipped in the December quarter. The third consecutive quarter of record development tool sales. As you have seen from our growth in recent quarters, development tool sales are in excellent leading a indicator of continued strong design and activity, and acceptance of our solutions by our customers. And the continued strength of record development tool sales should bode well for future growth.Now moving to the Analog products, our Analog business also delivered outstanding results, with very strong sequential growth of 14.1% and 40% growth versus the year-ago quarter to achieve record high revenues. This also marked the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for our Analog business, and the first time we have crossed the greater than $100 million annualized revenue run rate. Those where the especially strong in the linear, interface, safety and security product lines. I was very pleased with the design wins and revenue momentum of our Analog business has shown.We continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new products that we expect will contribute to a continued strong revenue growth in the coming quarters. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of ZeroG wireless, an innovator in low power wifi solutions in the embedded market that complements our broad portfolio of microcontrollers. ZeroG was a private company located in Silicon Valley and is at an early revenue stage. Now moving to Serial EE [ph] memory products this business was up 9.8% sequentially. We were pleased to see solid growth in this area for our embedded control products. We continue to run this business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. At a time when many of our competitors have significantly pushed out their lead times of between 14 and 26 weeks, Microchip's investment in inventory use the flexible rotating time-off in our factories during the recession, and ongoing operational excellence has enabled us to  continue to provide industry-leading lead times. In the current environment, this is translating to further growth in our market share as we are better able to respond to rapidly rising customer demand, capitalize on our competitor's inability to supply product as well as to instill confidence in customers who as they should commit new designs -- as to who they should commit new designs to, so that they are assured of future supply. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments as well as our guidance for the March quarter. Steve?"

Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the December quarter, then I would answer some of the investor and analyst concerns that we have heard in the last few months, then I will talk about our guidance for March 2010 quarter. Reflecting on the December quarter, I want to thank the entire Microchip team for delivering an outstanding quarter in every respect. We beat the upper end of our revised guidance in the net sales, gross margins, operating profits, earnings per share and free cash flow by a significant margin. It is also the first time in over 15 years that we have achieved three consecutive quarters, with over 10% sequential growth in net sales. We also beat the lower end of our operating expense and inventory guidance by a good margin. We have now been profitable for 77 consecutive quarters and the March quarter will be our 78. From a geographical standpoint, as Eric discussed, we achieved substantial sequential growth in all major geographies of the world. And on product lines, the story was impressive too. As Ganesh discussed, we achieved significant sequential growth in all of our product lines with microcontrollers up 10%, 16-bit microcontrollers up by 10% sequentially and analog up by 14.1% sequentially. I also wanted to highlight the comparison to SIA numbers that were recently released. While Microchip does not participate in SIA, and short-term SIA numbers are often suspect, many of the investors and analysts follow those numbers. So based on this SIA data, calendar year 2009 industry sales for eight plus 16-bit microcontrollers were down 23.6% from calendar 2008. Microchip's eight plus 16-bit sales for calendar 2009 were down 14.6% from calendar 2008, so 23.6% for the industry and 14.6% for Microchip. If you look at December quarter 2009 over December quarter 2008, so last quarter over a year ago quarter, then the industry eight plus 16-bit microcontrollers sales were up 12.3% while Microchip's eight plus 16-bit MCU sales were up a whopping 29.6%. So industry at 12.3% up, and Microchip up 29.6%, showing significant market share gains. We are gaining share on both eight as well as 16-bit microcontrollers. Next, I would like to discuss four concerns that investors and analysts have raised in the last several months. The first of these concerns is where are Microchip's growth drivers? The best way to prove the growth is by posting strong sequential growth, which we have been doing for several quarters. Beyond that, there are five major drivers of growth: First, is our multi-year demand creation program, in which we added 28% additional sales and application personnel three years ago, and then we retained them through the global financial crisis of last year. They have created a steady stream of new customers and new design wins that are turning to production, adding to our growth. Second, we have an industry-leading design engineering awareness of our eight, 16 and 32-bit microcontroller solutions. On 8-bit microcontrollers, we are the number one choice of designers by a wide margin. On 16 and 32-bit, we are tied in the number first place. Number three, we have significantly expanded our served available market with the introduction of over 400 new products in the last three years, covering several key thrust areas like eXtreme Low Power, Touch Sense, USB interface, Advanced Graphics, high-performance analog, ethernet connectivity, RF connectivity, motor control and digital power supply. Number four, our Analog business is growing and gaining market share. We are gaining by attaching Analog to our microcontroller applications, as well as embedding analog functionality on the microcontroller dye.  And number five, we're gaining share from large but financially strapped competitors. The second area of concern that investors and analysts have shown is the gross margin percentage. In the earnings call in November, we shared our internal plan for calendar year '10. We gave a non-GAAP gross margin of 58.5% for the year, which was lower than our prior peak. That left the impression that gross margins are challenged. We have already exceeded that gross margin for December '09 quarter and we have guided 60% gross margin for the March 2010 quarter. We now believe that we will achieve our previous record gross margin of 61.6% non-GAAP by the end of the fiscal year '11. The third area of concern has been operating expenses. Analysts have the impression that there are large operating expenses coming that are not in the model. That is not correct. In the quarter, we just announced the operating expense was 26.2% non-GAAP, which matched the operating expense in our record quarter of fiscal Q2 '09. From September to December quarter that we just completed, our operating expenses grew by 4.3%, while sales grew by 10.3%. In the March 2010 quarter, we have all of the employee compensation programs back in the operating expenses, and we expect the operating expenses to stay in this range of 26.2% as a percentage of sales. The final concern shown has been that the inventories are getting replenished and hence, it is at the cycle top. Microchip's inventories plus our distributor's inventories combined are in the lower end of historical days of sales. We have always differentiated ourselves from the competition by maintaining some short lead times. If we could say anything about our inventory, our inventory at Microchip is lower than we would ideally like while our distribution and inventory is in a reasonable range. We are continuing to make the necessary changes to bring inventories in-line with customer's needs, and maintain the best lead times in the industry. But because of strong growth that we are experiencing, we expect inventory to really stay flat in the March quarter as Eric talked about. Having addressed these investors and analysts concerns, I will now move to provide guidance for March 2010 quarter.Our book-to-bill ratio for December quarter was 1.12, and we started the March quarter with an all-time record high backlog, so the visibility is improving significantly. The bookings rate so far in the quarter has been very strong. This quarter, we see significantly higher shipping days in U.S. and Europe, but lower shipping days in Asia because of Lunar New Year. Considering all that, we expect our net sales for the March quarter to be up between 3% and 7% sequentially above what normal seasonality is for our business. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 59.75% and 60.25%, which is 75 to 125 basis point improvement over the December quarter and we expect our GAAP gross margin to be between 58.85% and 59.35%. Regarding earnings per share for the March quarter, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.39 and $0.41. We expect GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.34 and $0.36. Now I would like to comment on the longer-term outlook for our calendar year '10, and this outlook for calendar year '10 excludes the acquisition of SST that we just announced. We will talk about it later. Last quarter, we shared our internal plan for calendar year '10 with investors in the financial community. We talked about calendar year '10 revenue of $1.05 billion, up 26% from calendar year '09. This internal forecast met with skepticism from several of the analysts. I'm happy to tell you that after one quarter, we see our calendar year '10 plan to be quite conservative. With just the March quarter's revenue times four, we meet our internal plan. And I've already talked about gross margin for calendar year '10 to be well above our internal plan while we won't be revising our internal plan every quarter, we are confident of beating it by a significant margin. So as we said in the start of the call, we will first take questions from investors and analysts about our earnings and our guidance. And after that, we will make some more commentary about the SST acquisition, followed by a second question-and-answers period. With that, operator, would you please pull up for questions."

We're excited about this acquisition and we would now like to give you a brief overview of who SST is, why we decided to acquire them, how we plan to handle the financial reporting for the various SST businesses and then summarize the overall transaction. So let's start with an overview of who SST is. SST is a global leader in embedded flash technology and in licensing of these technologies. SST also has several other businesses nested within the company including Serial, Parallel and Specialty Flash Memories, 8051 microcontrollers and NAND controllers. NAND drives that provide solid state storage, power amplifiers and low noise amplifiers for Wi-Fi applications. SST is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California and has 574 employees worldwide. SST has approximately $180 million in cash and liquid trading securities on their balance sheet and no debt. We see a compelling strategic rationale to acquire SST for the following reasons: First, their proprietary Superflash technology is a critical building block technology for advanced microcontrollers. For example, this Superflash technology is licensed by most major foundries and microcontroller OEM. This acquisition secure us critical embedded flash technology for Microchip's core, Microcontroller business and it also enables us to get earlier access to advance technologies versus waiting until their in production at the foundries. This acquisition also gives us the ability to customize technology variants that would give us an advantage over competing technologies. Second, SST adds a strong patent portfolio to Microchip's intellectual property portfolio. SST is over 360 graphic patterns and over 180 patents that are pending. And third, we would add 8051 microcontrollers and NAND controllers to our microcontroller portfolio, NAND controllers essentially are specialized microcontrollers for a given application.Now let's move to the financial reporting plan. The Licensing business, 8051 microcontrollers and NAND controllers will be consolidated into Microchip's financial reporting of continuing operations. We plan to continue investing in Superflash technology, consistent with enabling our technology needs and growing the Licensing business. We plan to rationalize the Serial, Parallel and Specialty Flash Memory businesses consistent with supporting and growing the Licensing business and emulating Microchip's high margin Serial EEPROM business model. We will treat the memory business model as an asset held for sale until the rationalizing is complete. And we plan to divest the NAND drive and Wi-Fi amplifier businesses, and we'll hold them as assets held for sale.Finally, let me provide you with a transaction summary. A $2.85 per share acquisition price translates to a transaction value of $275 million. However, once you account for SST's $180 million in cash and liquid trading and securities, the net transaction value is approximately $95 million. We expect the blended, non-GAAP operating margins to be excellent after we complete the planned divestitures and rationalize the Memory business. We expect the transaction to be accretive on a non-GAAP basis in the first quarter full quarter after the transaction closes, and expect to close the transaction in the second calendar quarter of 2010. A presentation for the key points we have reviewed with you today will be available from our website after this conference call. And with that, we would be happy to take your questions about the SST acquisition."

Other said their dividend will be cut, we were the one company that didn't cut it, maintained the dividend now we're slowly growing it again, still keeping it at industry high. And yes, for the last 18 months we have done five acquisitions, but most of them had been quite small. This is the largest acquisition, which will use about $95 million to $100 million. Many others have been really single-digits to low single-digits kind of numbers. So our strategy with this acquisitions is elbow out with each and every acquisition, we are slowly and steadily elbowing out to the adjacent sockets and under microcontroller or helping act to a microcontroller whether it add Wi-Fi capability to a microcontroller with ZeroG, whether it added touchscreen with the Hampshire acquisition, whether it give us the world-class C compilers with the software acquisition we did. And in this particular case, the Superflash technology, nearly 4 billion plus microcontrollers a year are built on SST flash technology, majority of our competitors and major foundries have licensed their technology.

Our internal flash doesn't require added connection to go into even the most complexed and reliability sensitive applications like automotive. Some of the SST flash applications in automotive, for example, require an added collection mechanism. So our internal technology leads in reliability, leads in accident reliability, low power and other stuff. So we address the market inside with our products which have those characteristics.

We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions. Again, please hold any questions related to the acquisition of SST until you are prompted to queue up.Net sales for the December quarter were $250.1 million, up approximately 10.3% from net sales of $226.7 million in the immediately preceding quarter, and up 30.1% from net sales of $192.2 million in the December 2008 quarter. On a geographic basis, revenue in the Americas was up 6.1% in the December quarter, Europe was up 10.2% and Asia was up 12.4%. Asia continues to be our largest geographic region, representing 52.3% of sales in the December quarter. The Americas were at 23.7% of sales and Europe was 24% of sales. These measurements are based on where the product is delivered for manufacturing purposes for our customers, but does not necessarily represent where design activity is taking place or where the end product consumption is occurring. We are continuing to include information on our press release on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on our Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $70.1 million or $0.38 per diluted share, an increase of 31.2% from non-GAAP net income of $53.2 million or $0.29 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter. The after-tax impact on the December 2009 quarterly earnings that have been excluded from our non-GAAP results include, $8.5 million from a favorable tax settlement with the IRS, $7.7 million in share-based compensation expense, $1 million in non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt and $0.5 million in charges associated with our acquisition activities. GAAP net income was $69.4 million in the December quarter or $0.37 per diluted share. The favorable impact on GAAP EPS from the settlement with the IRS was $.045, that will not be a recurring item in the March 2009 quarter. I will now go through some of the operating results for the December quarter. I will be referring to gross margin and operating expense information on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effect of share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses.Gross margins were 59% in the December quarter compared to 55.5% in the September quarter. The 350 basis point quarterly increase in gross profit margin was driven by a variety of factors, including higher production activity in our factories and continued cost reduction efforts from our global manufacturing operations. With the increase in revenue, we were able to achieve operating leverage on the business, with total operating expenses of 26.2% of sales in the December quarter compared to 27.7% in the prior quarter. Research and development costs were $27.2 million, representing 10.9% of sales. Sales in general and administrative expenses were $38.4 million, representing 15.3% of sales. Our non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of sales were at approximately the same level in December 2009 quarter as they were in September 2008 quarter, which was Microchip's peak earnings quarter. The December operating expenses includes a substantial portion of all the cuts that we took in our employee compensation programs during the global financial crisis, and the forecast that we have provided for the March 2010 quarter includes the full run rate of these programs. On a full GAAP basis, gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 58.4%. Total operating expenses were $73.4 million or 29.4% of sales, and include share-based compensation of $7.6 million and acquisition-related expenses of $0.3 million. On a non-GAAP basis, the tax rate for the December quarter was 13.4%. The GAAP effective tax rate for the December quarter was 0.7%. The difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates was driven from an $8.5 million favorable settlement with the IRS related to fiscal years 2002 through 2004, as well as the higher tax rate that applies to the non-cash interest expense on our convertible debt. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits and the percentage of our cash that is invested in tax-advantaged securities. We expect our going forward non-GAAP tax rate to be between 12.5% and 13%. The dividend declared today of $0.341 per share will be paid on March 4, 2010, to shareholders of record on February 18, 2010. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $62.9 million. Moving on to the balance sheet, Microchip's inventory balance at December 31, 2009, was $112.8 million, representing approximately 99 days. Inventory on Microchip's balance sheet increased by $4.3 million or three days, and days of inventory at our distributors increased to 40 days compared to 35 days at the end of the prior quarter. I would like to remind you that Microchip recognizes its distribution revenue on a sell-through basis in its worldwide distribution channel. At the end of the December quarter, the combined inventory on Microchip's balance sheet and its distributors was 139 days, which is in the lower range of our historical averages. During the December quarter, we aggressively increased our manufacturing output so we can continue to satisfy the needs of our customers by providing industry best lead times. We expect inventory days in our balance sheet in the March quarter to be about flat. The increases in our production output will have ongoing positive impact from Microchip's gross margin percentage. At December 31, our receivables were $113.8 million, an increase of $7.1 million or 6.7% from the balance as of the September quarter. Receivable balances are in great condition with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers. Over the past year, we have not had any significant bad debt write-offs in our business. We continue to closely monitor customer activity to ensure we are protecting the receivable assets on our balance sheet. As of December 31, Microchip's cash and total investment position was approximately $1.5 billion. Our cash generation from the business was $89.4 million prior to the payment of a $62.5 million dividend. Our cash generation continues to be strong, and our total cash and investment position is projected to grow again in the March 2010 quarter. Capital spending was approximately $18.7 million for the December quarter and our fiscal 2010 capital expenditure forecast is currently $50 million. We are investing in equipment to support the revenue growth of our new products and technologies and are also taking advantage of low-cost equipment opportunities in the marketplace that will position us well for future growth. Depreciation expense for the December quarter was $21.7 million, which was flat to depreciation in the September quarter. I will now ask Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?"

We continue t",705,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I will now comment on the individual product lines. All three of our product lines, microcontrollers, analog and Serial EEPROMs [ph] (1:10:03) delivered outstanding growth in the December quarter. We continue to see the results of our strategy to stay invested in our new product development and demand creation resources during the global recession. By employing a shared sacrifice to cut costs instead of resorting to mass layoffs, we believe we are seeing the continuation of differentiated revenue growth and operating profit results. Let me now take a closer look at each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our Microcontroller business delivered superb results, and was up a strong 10% on a sequential basis and up 30% from the year-ago quarter. The December quarter was also the third consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential growth for the Microcontroller business. Flash microcontrollers represented 81.3% of our Microcontroller business in the December quarter. Our 8-bit Microcontroller business had another excellent quarter, as all segments of our 8-bit product lines experienced very strong growth. Our 16-bit Microcontroller business achieved another record for quarterly revenue, with strong sequential growth of 10% building upon the 49% sequential growth we had last quarter. 16-bit microcontrollers also grew over 101% from the year-ago quarter. New customers and new designs go into production continued to help drive growth as a number of volume 16-bit customers grew by 239 customers to 2,289. Our 32-bit microcontroller product line meanwhile continues to make good progress, with 44% sequential growth, albeit from a smaller base, building upon the 56% sequential growth we had last quarter. We now have 173 32-bit microcontroller customers in volume production. Moving to development tools, we had another record quarter, with 41,492 development tools shipped in the December quarter. The third consecutive quarter of record development tool sales. As you have seen from our growth in recent quarters, development tool sales are an excellent leading a indicator of continued strong design and activity and acceptance of our solutions by our customers. And the continued strength of record development tool sales should bode well for future growth.Now moving to the Analog products, our Analog business also delivered outstanding results, with very strong sequential growth of 14.1%, and 40% growth versus the year-ago quarter to achieve record high revenues. This also marked the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for our Analog business, and the first time we have crossed a greater than $100 million annualized revenue run rate. Those were especially strong in the linear, interface, safety and security product lines. I was very pleased with the design wins and revenue momentum of our Analog business has shown.We continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new products that we expect will contribute to continued strong revenue growth in the coming quarters. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of ZeroG Wireless, an innovator in low power Wi-Fi solutions in the embedded market that complements our broad portfolio of microcontrollers. ZeroG was a private company located in Silicon Valley and is at an early revenue stage. Now moving to Serial EE [ph] (1:13:32) memory products, this business was up 9.8% sequentially. We were pleased to see solid growth in this area for our embedded control products. We continue to run this business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. At a time when many of our competitors have significantly pushed out their lead times of between 14 and 26 weeks, Microchip's investments in inventory used the flexible rotating time-off in our factories during the recession, and ongoing operational excellence has enabled us to continue to provide industry-leading lead times. In the current environment, this is translating to further growth in our market share as we are better able to respond to rapidly rising customer demand, capitalize on our competitor's inability to supply product as well as to instill confidence in customers who as they should commit new designs -- as to who they should commit new designs to, so that they are assured of future supply. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments as well as our guidance for the March quarter. Steve?"

Today, I would like to first reflect on the results of the December quarter, then I would answer some of the investor and analyst concerns that we have heard in the last few months, then I will talk about our guidance for March 2010 quarter. Reflecting on the December quarter, I want to thank the entire Microchip team for delivering an outstanding quarter in every respect. We beat the upper end of our revised guidance in the net sales, gross margins, operating profits, earnings per share and free cash flow by a significant margin. It is also the first time in over 15 years that we have achieved three consecutive quarters, with over 10% sequential growth in net sales. We also beat the lower end of our operating expense and inventory guidance by a good margin. We have now been profitable for 77 consecutive quarters and the March quarter will be our 78. From a geographical standpoint, as Eric discussed, we achieved substantial sequential growth in all major geographies of the world. And on product lines, the story was impressive too. As Ganesh discussed, we achieved significant sequential growth in all of our product lines with microcontrollers up 10%, 16-bit microcontrollers up by 10% sequentially and analog up by 14.1% sequentially. I also wanted to highlight the comparison to SIA numbers that were recently released. While Microchip does not participate in SIA, and short-term SIA numbers are often suspect, many of the investors and analysts follow those numbers. So based on this SIA data, calendar year 2009 industry sales for eight plus 16-bit microcontrollers were down 23.6% from calendar 2008. Microchip's eight plus 16-bit sales for calendar 2009 were down 14.6% from calendar 2008, so 23.6% for the industry and 14.6% for Microchip. If you look at December quarter 2009 over December quarter 2008, so last quarter over a year ago quarter, then the industry eight plus 16-bit microcontrollers sales were up 12.3% while Microchip's eight plus 16-bit MCU sales were up a whopping 29.6%. So industry at 12.3% up, and Microchip up 29.6%, showing significant market share gains. We are gaining share on both eight as well as 16-bit microcontrollers. Next, I would like to discuss four concerns that investors and analysts have raised in the last several months. The first of these concerns is where are Microchip's growth drivers? The best way to prove the growth is by posting strong sequential growth, which we have been doing for several quarters. Beyond that, there are five major drivers of growth: First, is our multi-year demand creation program, in which we added 28% additional sales and application personnel three years ago, and then we retained them through the global financial crisis of last year. They have created a steady stream of new customers and new design wins that are turning to production, adding to our growth. Second, we have an industry-leading design engineering awareness of our eight, 16 and 32-bit microcontroller solutions. On 8-bit microcontrollers, we are the number one choice of designers by a wide margin. On 16 and 32-bit, we are tied in the number first place. Number three, we have significantly expanded our served available market with the introduction of over 400 new products in the last three years, covering several key thrust areas like eXtreme Low Power, Touch Sense, USB interface, Advanced Graphics, high-performance analog, Ethernet connectivity, RF connectivity, motor control and digital power supply. Number four, our Analog business is growing and gaining market share. We are gaining by attaching Analog to our microcontroller applications, as well as embedding analog functionality on the microcontroller dye.  And number five, we're gaining share from large but financially strapped competitors. The second area of concern that investors and analysts have shown is the gross margin percentage. In the earnings call in November, we shared our internal plan for calendar year '10. We gave a non-GAAP gross margin of 58.5% for the year, which was lower than our prior peak. That left the impression that gross margins are challenged. We have already exceeded that gross margin for December '09 quarter and we have guided 60% gross margin for the March 2010 quarter. We now believe that we will achieve our previous record gross margin of 61.6% non-GAAP by the end of fiscal year '11. The third area of concern has been operating expenses. Analysts have the impression that there are large operating expenses coming that are not in the model. That is not correct. In the quarter, we just announced the operating expense was 26.2% non-GAAP, which matched the operating expense in our record quarter of fiscal Q2 '09. From September to December quarter that we just completed, our operating expenses grew by 4.3%, while sales grew by 10.3%. In the March 2010 quarter, we have all of the employee compensation programs back in the operating expenses, and we expect the operating expenses to stay in this range of 26.2% as a percentage of sales. The final concern shown has been that the inventories are getting replenished and hence, it is at the cycle top. Microchip's inventories plus our distributor's inventories combined are in the lower end of historical days of sales. We have always differentiated ourselves from the competition by maintenance of short lead times. If we could say anything about our inventory, our inventory at Microchip is lower than we would ideally like, while our distribution and inventory is in a reasonable range. We are continuing to make the necessary changes to bring inventories in-line with customers' needs and maintain the best lead times in the industry. But because of strong growth that we are experiencing, we expect inventory to really stay flat in the March quarter as Eric talked about. Having addressed these investors' and analysts' concerns, I will now move to provide guidance for March 2010 quarter.Our book-to-bill ratio for December quarter was 1.12, and we started the March quarter with an all-time record high backlog, so the visibility is improving significantly. The bookings rate so far in the quarter has been very strong. This quarter, we see significantly higher shipping days in U.S. and Europe, but lower shipping days in Asia because of Lunar New Year. Considering all that, we expect our net sales for the March quarter to be up between 3% and 7% sequentially, above what normal seasonality is for our business. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 59.75% and 60.25%, which is 75 to 125 basis points improvement over the December quarter, and we expect our GAAP gross margin to be between 58.85% and 59.35%. Regarding earnings per share for the March quarter, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.39 and $0.41. We expect GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.34 and $0.36. Now I would like to comment on the longer-term outlook for our calendar year '10, and this outlook for calendar year '10 excludes the acquisition of SST that we just announced. We will talk about it later. Last quarter, we shared our internal plan for calendar year '10 with investors in the financial community. We talked about calendar year '10 revenue of $1.05 billion, up 26% from calendar year '09. This internal forecast met with skepticism from several of the analysts. I'm happy to tell you that after one quarter, we see our calendar year '10 plan to be quite conservative. With just the March quarter's revenue times four, we meet our internal plan. And I've already talked about gross margin for calendar year '10 to be well above our internal plan. While we won't be revising our internal plan every quarter, we are confident of beating it by a significant margin. So as we said in the start of the call, we will first take questions from investors and analysts about our earnings and our guidance. And after that, we will make some more commentary about the SST acquisition, followed by a second questions-and-answers period. With that, operator, would you please pull for questions."

As most of you are aware by now, earlier today, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Silicon Storage Technology Inc. or otherwise known as SST. We're excited about this acquisition and we would now like to give you a brief overview of who",557,"Okay. As most of you are aware by now, earlier today, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Silicon Storage Technology Inc. or otherwise known as SST. We're excited about this acquisition and we would now like to give you a brief overview of who SST is, why we decided to acquire them, how we plan to handle the financial reporting for the various SST businesses, and then summarize the overall transaction. So let's start with an overview of who SST is. SST is a global leader in embedded flash technology and in the licensing of these technologies. SST also has several other businesses nested within the company including Serial, Parallel and Specialty Flash Memories, 8051 microcontrollers and NAND controllers. NAND drives that provide solid state storage, power amplifiers and low noise amplifiers for Wi-Fi applications. SST is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, and has 574 employees worldwide. SST has approximately $180 million in cash and liquid trading securities on their balance sheet and no debt. We see a compelling strategic rationale to acquire SST for the following reasons: First, their proprietary SuperFlash technology is a critical building block technology for advanced microcontrollers. For example, their SuperFlash technology is licensed by most major foundries and microcontroller OEMs. This acquisition secures critical embedded flash technology for Microchip's core Microcontroller business, and it also enables us to get earlier access to advance technologies versus waiting until their in production at the foundries. This acquisition also gives us the ability to customize technology variants that would give us an advantage over competing technologies. Second, SST adds a strong patent portfolio to Microchip's intellectual property portfolio. SST has over 360 graphic patterns and over 180 patents that are pending. And third, we would add 8051 microcontrollers and NAND controllers to our microcontroller portfolio, NAND controllers essentially are specialized microcontrollers for a given application.Now let's move to the financial reporting plan. The Licensing business, 8051 microcontrollers and NAND controllers will be consolidated into Microchip's financial reporting of continuing operations. We plan to continue investing in SuperFlash technology, consistent with enabling our technology needs and growing the Licensing business. We plan to rationalize the Serial, Parallel and Specialty Flash Memory businesses, consistent with supporting and growing the Licensing business and emulating Microchip's high margin Serial EEPROM business model. We will treat the Memory business as an asset held for sale until the rationalizing is complete. And we plan to divest the NAND drive and Wi-Fi Amplifier businesses, and we'll hold them as assets held for sale.Finally, let me provide you with our transaction summary. A $2.85 per share acquisition price translates to a transaction value of $275 million. However, once you account for SST's $180 million in cash and liquid trading and securities, the net transaction value is approximately $95 million. We expect the blended non-GAAP operating margins to be excellent after we complete the planned divestitures and rationalize the Memory business. We expect the transaction to be accretive on a non-GAAP basis in the first quarter full quarter after the transaction closes, and we expect to close the transaction in the second calendar quarter of 2010. A presentation for the key points we have reviewed with you today will be available from our website after this conference call. And with that, we would be happy to take your questions about the SST acquisition."

Other said, their dividend would be cut, we were the one company that didn't cut it, maintained the dividend. Now we're slowly growing it again, still keeping it at industry high. And yes, in the last 18 months we have done five acquisitions, but most of them had been quite small. This is the largest acquisition which will use about $95 million to $100 million. Many others have been really single digits to low single digits kind of numbers. So our strategy with these acquisitions is elbow out. With each and every acquisition, we are slowly and steadily elbowing out to the adjacent sockets and under microcontroller, helping act to a microcontroller whether it adds Wi-Fi capability to a microcontroller with ZeroG, whether it added touchscreens with the Hampshire acquisition, whether it give us the world-class C compilers with the software acquisition we did. And in this particular case, the SuperFlash technology, nearly 4 billion plus microcontrollers a year are built on SST flash technology. Majority of our competitors and major foundries have licensed their technology. So we believe that, that technology, in our hands, will have significant advantage to get advanced leading us -- has access to that."

They're often lower-density products, they're often low-powered products and other things. Now microcontroller market is very, very diverse. Everybody doesn't need low power, or everybody doesn't need low density, some need high density but they also need reliability for. So SST flash, definitely more microcontrollers in the world shipped on SST flash than probably on any other technology, we can probably safely say that. So having that in our hands, giving us early access to that technology, being able to use it inside as well as at foundries and being able to create variants of that technology for our own competitive advantage, I think, is a significant benefit for our long-term Microcontroller business."

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchipâ€™s business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are Ganesh Moorthy, Microchipâ€™s Chief Operating Officer, Eric Bjornholt, Chief Financial Officer and Gordon Parnell, Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations.
I will first comment on the status of the restructuring and integration of Silicon Storage Technology. All of our financial reserves flow from the understanding of how this acquisition is being accounted for. Eric Bjornholt will then give you the details of our financial performance. Ganesh will give his comments on the results of the product line, and then I will discuss the current business environment and discuss our guidance. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
Microchip acquired Silicon Storage Technology, SST, on April 8, 2010. At that time we determined that we would hold SSTâ€™s super flash memory solid state drive, smart card and RF businesses as assets held for sale.
On May 21, 2010 we consummated and announced a transaction in which we sold solid state drive, smart card and certain older flash memory product lines to Greenline Systems Inc. Then we announced a second transaction on July 8, 2010 in which we exclusively licensed certain flash memory products in certain geographic markets of Asia, mainly Taiwan and China to Professional Computer Technology, or PCT.
After that, we still had remaining super flash memory business and RF business held for sale. After operating the SST business for two quarters, we have found synergy between SSTâ€™s RF business and Microchipâ€™s wireless controller and analog business. On the memory side, after selling the low margin end of the business to PCT of Taiwan, we have substantially improved our gross margin for the rest of the super flash memory business.
Additionally, we have found and running from volume on the memory business is critical to proving out the technology before it can be licensed. There are also significant operational synergies with Microchipâ€™s memory business and technology synergies with Microchipâ€™s micro controller business.
As such, we have very substantially eliminated the excess overhead and dramatically reduced the operating expenses of the SST business. With that, we have decided to keep the super flash memory and RF businesses of SST as ongoing businesses of Microchip.
In this press release and in future filings with the SEC, the first quarter of fiscal quarter of 2011 will be presented as if the SST super flash memory and RF divisions were always included in the continuing operations of Microchip.
Microchipâ€™s second quarter of fiscal 2011 guidance provided on August 5, 2010 did not include the super flash memory and RF divisions of SST. Without these divisions, Microchip guided its net sales to be $340 to $343 million for the September quarter, and compared to that, our actual results for these businesses achieved $343.3 million, which is near the high end of our previous guidance.
The super flash memory and RF divisions of SST added approximately $40 million of revenue in the September 2010 quarter. The restructuring and integration of SST is now complete. We have transformed SST into a very profitable entity that is an accretive to Microchipâ€™s non-GAAP earnings per share by about $0.08 for the September quarter.
We expect SST to add approximately $0.32 to Microchipâ€™s non-GAAP earnings for fiscal â€˜11 compared to our original of EPS accretion for fiscal year â€˜11 of only $0.14 to $0.18. For fiscal year â€˜12, we expect the SST business to add about $0.40 to our earnings per share.
We are very pleased to have completed this project and believe that we have delivered on our commitment of providing significant shareholder value through this acquisition.
I will now pass this on to Eric Bjornholt who will cover the financials on a fully consolidated basis including all continuing operations of Microchip on the revised basis including the super flash memory and RF businesses of SST.

We are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on our investor relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will go through some of the operating results on a fully consolidated basis for the September quarter. Any comparisons I make to the June quarter will also be based on a fully consolidated basis, which is revised to include the RF and super flash memory businesses of SST.
I will begin by referring to gross margin and operating expense information on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effect of share based compensation and acquisition related expenses. Net sales in the September quarter were a record $382.3 million, and were up approximately 7% from net sales of $357.1 million in the immediately preceding quarter and were up 68.7% from net sales of $226.7 million in the September 2009 quarter.
Non-GAAP gross margins were 60.2% in the September compared to 60.3% in the June quarter. Our factories produced record output during the quarter and our cost structures remained in excellent condition.
With the increase in revenue in the September quarter, and our continued focus on prudent spending, operating expenses were 24% of sales compared to 24.5% in the June quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was 36.2% of sales. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was $119.6 million or a record $0.63 per diluted share, an increase of 8.8% from non-GAAP net income of $109.9 million or $0.58 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter.
On a full GAAP basis, gross margins including share based compensation and acquisition related expenses which include the sell through our written up inventory and intangible amortization were 58.9%. Total operating expenses were $101.9 million or 26.6% of sales and include share based compensation of $7.2 million, acquisition related expenses of $2.2 million and $.6 million in severance and office closure charges that are classified as a special charge within operating expenses.
GAAP net income from continuing operations was $104.8 million or $0.55 per diluted share, an increase of 14% from GAAP net income of $91.9 million or $0.48 per diluted share in the immediately preceding quarter.
In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 13.2% and the GAAP tax rate was 13.4%. Our tax rate is impacted by the mix of geographical profits and a percentage of our cash that is invested in tax advantage securities. We expect our combined forward-looking effective tax rate to be about 13%.
To summarize the after tax impact that the non-GAAP adjustments had on Microchipâ€™s earnings per share in the September quarter, share based compensation was about $0.041 cents, acquisition related were about $0.031 and non-cash interest expense was about $0.06.
As indicated in our press release today, Microchip will be paying two dividends in the December quarter. The first dividend of $0.344 per share will be paid on December 2, 2010 to shareholders of record on November 18, 2010. The cash payment associated with this dividend will be approximately $64.1 million.
The second dividend is an acceleration of the March 2011 dividend into December 2010 to allow our shareholders to take advantage of the lower tax rate that will apply in 2010 compared to what is expected for 2011. This dividend is $0.345 per share and will be paid on December 27, 2010 to shareholders of record on December 13, 2010. The cash payment associated with this dividend is expected to be $64.3 million.
Moving on to the balance sheet, keeping the super flash memory and RF business of SST, increased the dollar amount of Microchipâ€™s inventory in support of these businesses as we closed the September quarter with $166.6 million of inventory, representing approximately 97 days, which is down one day from the prior quarter levels.
Inventory at our distributors was 34 days, which is up one day from the prior quarter level. At the end of September the combined inventory on Microchipâ€™s balance sheet and at its distributors was 131 days or flat to the prior quarter.
I want to point out that the deferred income on shipment to distributors increased 22.4% sequentially, but this was impacted by the inclusion of the super flash memory and RF divisions of SST and the conversion of certain SST stocking reps into sell through distributors during the September quarter.
I would like to remind you that Microchip recognizes its distribution revenue on a sell through basis in its worldwide distribution channel. During the September quarter, we continue to increase our manufacturing output to allow us to satisfy the needs of our customers.
We forecast inventory days on our balance sheet to increase in the December quarter, but the amount of the increase will be dependent on the levels of inventory our distributors decide to hold for their customers, overall demand for our products and production levels.
Inventory on Microchipâ€™s balance sheet has been too low for the past several quarters and building some inventory this quarter, will help bring our lead times closer to the levels our customers have come to expect.
At September 30, Microchipâ€™s accounts receivable balance was $202.8 million, an increase of 4.8% from the balance as of the end of June. Receivables are in great condition with excellent payment performance continuing from our customers.
As of September 30, Microchipâ€™s cash and total investment position was approximately $1.57 billion. The September quarter set a new record for Microchip with $156.9 million of cash generation prior to the dividend payment of $63.9 million.
Our cash generation continues to be strong and our total cash and investment position is projected to grow by approximately $125 to $135 million in the December quarter prior to the dividend payments.
Capital spending was approximately $31.8 million for the September quarter. We are continuing to invest in equipment to support the revenue growth of our new products and technologies and our capital expenditure forecast for fiscal 2011 is about $120 million.
Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $23.9 million, which was up from depreciation of $22.4 million in the June quarter.
If you have questions related to the financials for the June or September quarters due to the inclusion of the super flash memory and RF businesses of SST, please refer to the supplemental financial information tab on the investor relations page of Microchipâ€™s website. Gordon and I will also be available to answer questions from investors and analysts following todayâ€™s call.
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter.

Micro controllers, analog and memory products delivered another quarter of strong growth in the September quarter. Letâ€™s now take a closer look at each of our product lines as well as flash IP licensing which starting last quarter, became our fourth reporting segment.
Starting with micro controllers, this business delivered another strong quarter with revenue up 4.7% on a sequential basis and up 39.4% from the year ago quarter, achieving a new record. Micro controller business also broke through $1 billion annualized revenue for the first time ever, reflecting the strong growth in our micro controller business in 2010. We expect to ship our nine billionth cumulative micro controller shipped in the December quarter, having shipped the eight billionth micro controller just in the March quarter of this year.
Our 8-bit micro controller business had another strong quarter, achieving a new record as all segment of our 8-bit product line again experienced very strong growth. Our 16-bit micro controller business also achieved another record for quarterly revenue, with strong sequential growth of 22% and up 102% from the year ago quarter.
New customers and new designs going into production continued to drive significant growth as the number of volume 16-bit customers grew to over 3,200 customers.
Our 32-bit micro controller product line, which had 36% sequential growth in March, and 86% sequential growth in the June quarter, took a pause and declined 10.9% in the September quarter. This is quite normal for a new product line where revenue growth tends to be more lumpy as we saw during similar phases of growth in our 16-bit and analog businesses several years ago.
32-bit micro controller revenue for the first six months of fiscal year â€˜11 was 320% higher than the equivalent period in fiscal year â€˜10 and I fully expect we will set a new record in the December quarter. The number of customers and volume production for 32-bit micro controller grew by 56% to 417 as we continue to build broad based customers to grow this business.
Moving to development tools, we shipped 48,970 development tools in the September quarter including our one millionth cumulative development tools. Development tool sales remain an excellent leading indicator of continued strong design and activity and acceptance of our solutions by our customers, and the continued trend strong development tools sales bodes well for our future growth.
Now moving to our analog products, this business also delivered outstanding results with strong sequential growth of 11.6% and 99.8% growth versus the year ago quarter to achieve another record high for revenue. The marks the sixth consecutive quarter of double digit growth for our analog business.
In the first six months of fiscal year â€˜11, our analog business has grown 110.8% as compared to the same six months of fiscal year â€˜10. Weâ€™re very pleased with the design win and revenue momentum of our analog business so far, and we continue to introduce a steady stream of innovative new products which we expect will contribute to ongoing strong revenue growth in the coming quarters.
Moving to memory, our memory business is now comprised of our dsPIC memory products as well as our super flash memory products. This business was up 12.5% on a sequential basis and we continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistent profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our micro controller customers to complete their solutions.
In regards to flash IP licensing, the revenue for the September quarter was $17.3 million, up 12.5% from the June quarter. We are very optimistic about the potential for this business to add to our ongoing growth and profitability.
Moving to manufacturing and lead times, during the quarter, we continued to increase our manufacturing output at a measured rate to support our growth. Our current lead times are predominately at approximately six weeks and still well below where most of our competitors are at.
We continue to capitalize on this strength to further grow our market share by enabling existing as well as new customers to achieve their business objectives with Microchip solutions.
I will now pass it to Steve for some general comments as well as our guidance going forward.

As I reflect on the September quarter, it was yet Microchips best quarter ever in our history. I want to thank the entire Microchip team including the employees that joined us from SST for delivering an outstanding quarter in many, many respects.
We made new records in many aspects of our business. We achieved record sales in micro controllers, analog and licensing businesses. We also achieved record non-GAAP operating profit of $138.2 million and record cash flow of $156.9 million in September quarter.
The September quarter also marked our 80â€™th consecutive profitable quarter. This is 20 years of making profit every quarter in good times and in bad, a record that is unmatched among our peers and is testimony to the resiliency of the business model that we have developed and fine-tuned over time.
I will now provide guidance for December 2010 quarter. Microchipâ€™s book to bill ratio for September was .87. While our own inventory and distributorâ€™s inventories are in check, and were flat in days from June quarter, we are seeing an industry inventory correction. December quarter is historically the weakest quarter of the year for Microchip.
Considering all that, we expect our net sales for the December quarter to be down between 2% to 8% sequentially. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be between 59.1% to 59.3% for the December quarter and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.55 and $0.59.
Given all the complications of accounting for a large acquisition including purchased inventory write up, amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges, like many other companies have done, Microchip will continue to provide guidance and track itâ€™s results on non-GAAP basis.
We believe that non-GAAP results will provide more meaningful comparisons to prior quarters and we request that the analysts continue to report the non-GAAP estimates for this call.
With that, operator would you please poll for questions.

There was also some backlog that was scheduled for December quarter which got pushed out into March as customers decided to adjust their inventory and the backlog.
We get this question in every cycle. If you look at the history of Microchip, there have been only two or three instances where we have had a back to back two quarter decline in revenue. One was during the global financial crisis in December of â€˜08 and then down further in March of â€˜09. And the other one was I believe going back to the tech bust of 2000.
In most other cases, I think in every other case almost, we usually see one quarter decline, which we are experiencing here in the December quarter, and then the inventory corrects, and then we usually start the recovery.
As you know, Microchip does accounting very, very conservatively. We do not book any revenue around the world based on a shipment to distributor. We look at sales out 100%. There are many of our competitors who track the results based on sell in and there are some others who are hybrid, who many of them take U.S. at sell out, but Europe and Asia they go sell in. Microchip goes sell out worldwide as we recognize the revenue.
So itâ€™s pretty conservative accounting and therefore, what is in distribution, whether distribution lowers or increases their inventory, does not have effect on our revenue. We only have effect with the end customers that are adjusting their inventory and we expect that to happen this quarter.

Now the combined gross margin with the licensing are still very healthy, but these two businesses, gross margin will further increase into the next year under Microchipâ€™s cloak. We expect our overall non-GAAP gross margin to go back to have a 61 or something in front of it as it historically has been. I think our long-term guidance always has been in that 61, 62 range, and we should be able to get back in that range over the next year.

We expect another record in the December quarter even though all the other results will be down. So the licensing business should model approximately to the industry average growth plus the new licenses, the new technology, the new license weâ€™re able to do.
So these licenses are largely to micro controller and smart card customers and foundries who produce micro controllers and smart cards and some of the Logic products for some of our competitors and other companies, which could include micro controllers, SST kind of product, custom chips, DSPâ€™s, smart cards and some of the Logic chips.
So the royalty stream of that will largely be similar really to what the industry average is doing because thatâ€™s the royalty we get. On top of that you have to add the new licenses, because weâ€™re expanding it, getting more foundries, more competitors, more technologies into the fold.
So all that, how we can model it long term, I donâ€™t really know yet (inaudible).

So the part of the wireless business that ties with the embedded control business is very much connected to our micro controllers. Often, the software that is running the system to enable the wireless communication to take place is running on our micro controllers, and so the solution is not just the wireless product, but itâ€™s the wireless product, the software and the micro controller all sold together as a solution.
We also have the RF business from SST that actually has other areas that it plays in, which are not necessarily all tied to micro controllers. It does also connect to micro controllers, but works with higher speed Wi-Fi systems and solutions and those could be going into market. Traditionally we donâ€™t play as much as for example in cell phones.
So thereâ€™s different components of the business. Some of it will grow with the micro controllers. Some of it will grow outside of the micro controllers.

But there are always two components in improving gross margin. One is time. Another is revenue, because revenue provides the leverage in most things to absorb expenses, to create automation, to do more pilot testing, to have lower prices and materials and assembly and test and all that.
So thereâ€™s always a revenue issue. Many times I get that question from the street. They just think itâ€™s kind of time based. Itâ€™s time and revenue based. Time obviously allows shrink products to get in and products to succeed which are trying to bring a lower cost. It is also a revenue equation. If the revenue does not grow for any given product line, then it becomes margin challenged.
So here, we believe that into the next year, weâ€™ll have to have all of those things; the market environment would be better than what weâ€™re experiencing in December and with the product shrink assembly and test and all the Microchip infrastructure and our skills to improve margin, you will not be displeased with the margin.
