Our fourth quarter caps off the biggest year in Salesforce.com's history, and I'm delighted to be able to share with you today our outstanding results. While most software companies are still trying to forget the past year, our fiscal 2010 was perhaps our most memorable and exciting year ever. And some of the highlights from our full year included: $1.3 billion in revenue, the first enterprise cloud-computing company ever to reach this scale; revenue growth of more than 20%, the fastest growth of any comparably-sized software company in the world; while most of the software companies went backwards last year, Salesforce.com went forward in a dramatic way; and more at a quarter of a billion dollars in operating cash flow and a balance sheet with more than $1.7 billion in cash and equivalents, and more than 72,000 customers globally, including an amazing 17,000 net new customers joining our ranks in the fiscal year, this represents a 31% year-over-year increase in our customer base; more than 2 million subscribers, including more than 500,000 net additions during the year, an increase of roughly 35% year-over-year; and we closed the year by hosting the biggest cloud computing event ever, Dreamforce 2009, in December. It was simply an amazing year. And we closed the year by delivering the biggest financial quarter in our history. Fourth quarter revenue rose 22% to $354 million. At this level, we've broken through yet another huge milestone, the $1.4 billion annual revenue run rate. Fourth quarter growth of 22% was our best performance in more than a year. GAAP EPS of $0.16 increased from $0.11 a year ago. That's an increase of more than 40% and more EPS at a single quarter than we achieved in all of fiscal year 2008. Cash from operations increased 21% to $92 million. And finally, deferred revenue broke through that $700 million threshold for the first time ever to finish at $704 million, an increase of 19%. That was our best growth performance of the year. By virtually every financial measure, our fourth quarter was amazing. Equally important, we saw a continued improvement in our business for the second quarter in a row. That's why we're stepping it up and hiring heavily into next year. After a year of reduced investment levels, the time is now right to invest in our continued growth and leadership of the cloud computing market. Graham will have more to say about our outlook in a moment.Our amazing fourth quarter numbers are powered by another quarter of fantastic wins against our competitors. We had another huge quarter and a huge series of wins against Oracle, including: The Huntington National Bank, GE, Pfizer, KCI, Autodesk, BC and Aramark. And we won impressive business against Microsoft during the quarter, and many companies including Univision, Aspen Pharmaceutical, Cross National Bank, KONE, Ingenix and Sagecom [ph]. And finally, we beat SAP at Schneider Electrics, SAS, Nobel Biocare Services, AG, Kimberly-Clark, Bridgestone Golf and Wolters Kluwer. These customers are coming to us because they want the most innovative products and services in the enterprise today. Not just the best products in the cloud, but the best products available, period. And they're coming in, in everly-increasing numbers. In the fourth quarter alone, we added roughly 4,600 net new customers to bring our full year customer community roughly 72,500, an increase of 31% in our customers. In fact, for the full year, we added more than 17,000 net new customers. That's more customer addition than we recorded in our first six full years of being in business. Wow, that's amazing. All three for our primary services, Sales Cloud 2, Service Cloud 2 and Custom Cloud 2 reported record quarters in the fourth quarter. The multi-product success is key to our growth strategy. Five years ago, our growth was entirely driven by our flagship namesake sales force automation, Sales Cloud service. But today, we have three pillars of growth with the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud and the Custom Cloud, powered by our Force.com platform. We believe that growth opportunity for each of these businesses is massive over the next decade, and the Gartner Group agrees. Gartner estimates the CRM Market, including sales and service, to be roughly $16 billion, and the custom application of open market at more than $50 billion. In our launch of Chatter, the collaboration cloud, which is expected later this year, further expands our market opportunity by creating a fourth leg of growth. Essentially, every business of every size in every industry, with access to the Internet through any device, is now a prospect for our sales force. Our growth opportunity has never been more exciting at Salesforce.com and in cloud computing. As evidenced of our multi-product success, we delivered our most diverse quarter of new business ever with more than 30% of our new business coming from non-Salesforce automation services compared to 25% a year ago. That's a pretty amazing achievement when you consider that our core sales force automation, Sales Cloud business, continues to grow at a strong double-digit clip. In our flagship Sales Cloud 2, we knocked some big wins this quarter including Nippon Express in Japan, GE Energy, Avaya, Cisco, MX Manpower [ph] and First Tennessee Bank National Association as well as Beckman Coulter. And just a year after its launch, the Service Cloud is on fire. And this killer app is clearly our next lever of growth. New business volume for the Service Cloud more than doubled from the year-ago quarter as did the volume of Service Cloud transactions.Customers need the next generation of customer service and support, customer portals and call center solutions, and Salesforce.com is ready to deliver this with Service Cloud 2. Customers realized that the call center of the '90s won't work in the age of social computing, and it is abundantly clear that our competitors in this space just can't keep up. Traditional customer service vendors still regard the web itself as foreign territory. And the Service Cloud 2 features the world's first real time knowledge base in the cloud built on our multi-tenant platform, Force.com; the world's first integration with social networks, like Facebook and Twitter; the world's first most customizable service applications available; and the world's best, most efficient agent console in the cloud as a service, all running on top of Force.com, the world's most trusted, reliable, secure and transparent cloud computing platform today. This is what makes Service Cloud 2 the spectacular success for the quarter, and why we believe that as we enter fiscal year '11, we are entering the year of the Service Cloud. That adds up to an unbeatable value proposition for the Service Cloud, the technology vision for tomorrow's contact centers and customer service organizations, backed by the scale and efficiency that only cloud computing and Salesforce.com can offer. Our huge list of Service Cloud wins in the fourth quarter include: The Huntington National Bank, Dun & Bradstreet, Bausch & Lomb, Wyndham Hotel Group, Wells Fargo Bank, FDL Financial, Allianz, and Chronopost. Look, while companies are poised to build for the future, they're not going to double down on the softer mistakes of the past using old technology like Microsoft .NET. That's why the Force.com Custom Cloud is selling such fantastic results. Developing custom apps on Force.com is five times faster and half the cost of traditional programs like .NET and Java according to a recent study completed by IDC and available on our website. The value proposition was behind several key Custom Cloud wins for the fourth quarter, including: Fast Retailing Co. of Japan, Pfizer, Sepracor, the Japan Research Institute, Avon, McGraw-Hill and Fairchild Semi, Wordzilla, Genentech and Honda, all now our Force.com customers building the next generation of applications of cloud computing, their custom apps, their private cloud apps on Force.com. And we're just getting started. During the quarter, we also announced the key addition to our platform with the addition of Force.com Visual Process Manager, which allows corporate IT to focus on innovation, not infrastructure, with point-and-click, very easy-to-use process design instead of low-level coding. Similar key platform milestones in the fourth quarter included more than 19 million customizations now made by our customers that we're holding in our multi-tenant database. That's up more than 40% from a year ago. Nearly 150,000 custom applications, up from around roughly 100,000 last year, all on Force.com, more than 275 million lines of Force.com code, up 10-fold year-over-year. That's amazing, considering we are one of the very first multi-tenant virtual machines who are hosting our customer's code. We've also added more than a hundred thousand developers to our growing global developer community, a community that boasts more than 230,000 members. And our core transactions, the actual transactions that our customers are completing, whether it's the Sales Cloud, The Service Cloud, the Custom Cloud and soon with Chatter, well, those total transactions grew to 19 billion for the quarter. That's up to more than 46% versus a year ago. You know what, that growth in usage of our platform underscores in a key important point. We have built a service that customers just don't subscribe to, they use. With transactions growing even faster than subscriptions, it's clear that more customers are finding more ways of integrating us into their core operations on a daily basis. Our Sales Cloud, Service Cloud and Custom Clouds have been propelled by the widespread recognition that cloud computing is easy to use, has lower costs and produces faster results than traditional enterprise software. The reality is, that's the very premise that we started Salesforce.com on. It was just about 11 years ago when we asked ourselves the question, why is all enterprise software not as easy to use as Amazon.com? No software to buy, no hardware to buy, nothing to install or upgrade or maintain. You know, when companies like Microsoft, now 10 years later, which have the most salutes from the client software finally embraced cloud computing, you know there's no doubt in customer mind about where the future is headed. It's headed towards cloud computing. But you know what, the game is evolving again. And we believe the stakes are even higher this time, much, much higher. Back in 1999, we asked that simple question about Amazon.com. But today, the question has changed. The question is, why is all enterprise software not like Facebook? You know what, Facebook, you don't waste time searching for the right data going from app to app. The data finds you in real time. That's what customer's getting. Not from outdated collaboration applications like Microsoft SharePoint and Lotus Notes. Now, SharePoint is owned by a lot of businesses, used by far fewer and enjoyed practically by none. When was the last time everyone said they really loved using Microsoft SharePoint or Lotus Notes? The reality is, customers want to track their co-workers who matter to them, the most critical conversations, the apps they depend on, the contents they create and share, all using the new mobile devices that they're carrying around in their hand. And they want to collaborate without the cost, complexity, inflexibility and overall enterprise dead weight of enterprise software hardware and data centers. Look, that's the idea behind Salesforce Chatter, our first enterprise-wide application. And I'm excited to report that the next generation of enterprise collaboration has begun. Last week, we announced the private beta of 100 customers who are the first to get their hands on this game-changing technology. Reaction has been incredible. In fact, we encourage you to search Twitter for the hash tag, Salesforce, to get a sense of it. We believe that enterprises are more ready to cut their losses on failed collaboration apps like Lotus Notes and Microsoft SharePoint and join the conversation using cloud computing and Salesforce Chatter. Take a look at www.salesforce.com/chatter or go to YouTube and see the demonstrations of Salesforce Chatter. Just type Salesforce Chatter in the YouTube search box, and you'll see a demonstration of this exciting technology right now. So please join us as we take Chatter on the road in the coming months. We'll be in New York City for a major event on April 8. With that, let me hand the call over to Graham to discuss our amazing fourth quarter financial results."

Our fourth quarter was a great finish to a fiscal year that started with some uncertainty but it ended with superb execution in terms of new business, revenue and cash flow. The last 12 to 18 months tampered many company's business models",2440,"Thank you, Marc. Our fourth quarter was a great finish to a fiscal year that started with some uncertainty but it ended with superb execution in terms of new business, revenue and cash flow. The last 12 to 18 months tampered many company's business models, and yet Salesforce.com was able to deliver another outstanding year with record revenues, operating income and cash flow, our filed computing model was tested, and we passed, we believe, with flying colors. So fourth quarter revenue rose 22% from a year ago to roughly $354 million, strong e-business along with good, in-quarter linearity and lower attrition rates helped to drive this result.Our business continues to show strength across the board, with Europe and Asia slightly outpacing growth in the Americas. As a result, international revenues reached 31% of our total revenue. That's the highest level in our history. Let me briefly review revenue performance by region. In the Americas, Q4 revenue growth was 17% year-over-year, with roughly $244 million of revenue in the Americas this quarter. We are fast approaching an annual revenue run rate of more than $1 billion in that region alone. In Europe, fourth quarter revenue rose 33% from a year ago to $64 million, while a weaker dollar added 13 percentage points to this growth rate. Constant-currency growth was still a very solid 20%. And finally, Asia continues to be really strong. The baked deal activity we've been discussing in Japan throughout the past year contributed to Q4 revenue in Asia of $46 million. That's an increase of 42% from the year-ago quarter. In constant-currency terms, growth was 40%. Our Asian business alone now has an annual revenue run rate of almost $200 million. In total, foreign currency boosted our Q4 revenue growth rate by two percentage points.Turning next to gross margin, we set a new high watermark in the fourth quarter at almost 81%. Our mix of business continues to shift toward higher-margin Subscription business and away from professional services, which represented just 7.5% of revenue in Q4, that's down from 8.1% a year ago. For the full year, GAAP gross margin was 80.2%, that's an improvement of roughly 70 basis points from a year ago. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter, as a percentage of revenue, were roughly 74%, essentially flat from a year ago. For the full year, OpEx declined from roughly 74% of revenue to roughly 71%, reflecting the impact of our relatively-slow hiring during the year. Hiring in the fourth quarter was essentially the same as in Q3, with approximately 160 net new hires. After adding roughly 90 people in the first half of last year, we added more than 300 in the second half across all areas of the business. We exited the year with just under 4,000 employees.Given the huge, long-term opportunity we see for cloud computing, the improving IT spending environment and our strong execution, we plan to invest aggressively in fiscal 2011, with particular emphasis on sales hiring. This will have ramifications for our operating margin growth and operating cash flow, which I will discuss in due course. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 7.2%, it was down from Q3 but it's up 260 basis points from a year ago. Similar to last year, this sequential decline was in part of consequence of our Dreamforce event and also seasonally-high Q4 sales incentives payments. For the full year, our GAAP operating margin of 8.8% was up roughly 290 basis points from last year. This was the third year in a row that we've been able to grow operating margin by roughly 300 basis points. At the same time, as we are leveraging our operating model, revenues grow with a CAGR of 38% over the same three-year period from just under $500 million to more than $1.3 billion. Growth continues to be our number one priority, but we are also committed to continued margin expansion. Stock-based compensation amounted to approximately 7% of revenue for both Q4 and the full year. Our GAAP tax rate of 35% in Q4 was a bit lower than we expected entering the quarter. This was the result of a number of factors, including additional R&D, tax credits associated with the exercise of stock options. The net effects for the lower Q4 rate was to reduce our full year FY '10 GAAP tax rate to approximately 40%. Marc has already covered our EPS performance, I'll now move onto cash.Q4 operating cash flow was approximately $92 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year. Capital spending was a bit lower in Q4 than in past quarters at roughly $7 million, that's primarily due to a decline in leasehold improvement spending. And for the full fiscal year, operating cash flow has increased 18% to approximately $271 million and included approximately $19 million of increased tax payments as we transition to being a cash tax payer. This equated to just over $2.10 per share of operating cash flow. Capital spending decreased 12% for the full year to approximately $54 million. And then free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx, was approximately $217 million. That's an increase of 29%, and that's equated to almost $1.70 per share of free cash flow. We ended the year with total cash and marketable securities in excess of $1.7 billion, excluding the proceeds from our January debt offering, our net cash is now in excess of $1.25 billion or nearly $10 a share.Moving to the balance sheet. Similar to previous years, accounts receivable increased significantly in Q4, as we invoiced a large proportion of our renewals as well as a lot of new business. And ended the year just under $321 million with a DSO of 82 days, which is a two-day improvement over last year's number of 84 days. Deferred revenue finished the year at $704 million. In spite of a strengthening dollar, the fourth quarter sequential increase of almost $160 million was our biggest ever and deferred revenue is up 19% from a year ago. Off balance sheet back flow, or business that is contracted but not yet invoiced, finished the year at more than $1 billion. The combined total of this backlog and the on-balance sheet deferred revenue now totals more than $1.7 billion. On the new business front, we had a stronger growth quarter in two years for several reasons. First, Add-on and Upgrade business improved both sequentially and year-over-year. Add-on/upgrade represented more than half of all new business orders during the quarter. Second, our Service Comp business had yet another record quarter and continues to gain traction in the marketplace, together with our Custom Cloud business, as Marc mentioned, our non-Sales Cloud business has represented more than 30% of total new business in the fourth quarter. And then finally, although our average deal size was down slightly versus a year ago, we closed a lot more transactions in the quarter than we did a year ago.Turning to attrition, our dollar-attrition rate remains in the high teens. But we were encouraged to see the rate decline slightly for the second quarter in a row. Next, I'd like to discuss two important items that will affect next fiscal '11. First, as you know, we closed a $575-million convertible debt issuance in January. The notes, which were issued at par, are due in 2015. Interest is payable at a coupon rate of 0.75% annually, and the initial conversion rate is at a 25% premium, which equates to a stock price of approximately $85 per share. In connection with the issuance of the debt, the company entered into a convertible note hedge transaction that covered a number of shares of our common stock that are underlying the notes. Hedge transactions are designed but not guaranteed to reduce or eliminate the potential dilution arising upon conversion. At the same time, the company also entered into a transaction with a hedge count product involving the sale of warrants. The strike price of the warrant transactions is just under $120 per share, effectively raising the conversion price from $85 to this new level. The net proceeds from all of these transactions were approximately $500 million. In accounting for the debt in our fourth quarter results, the $575 million par value of the notes was allocated on our balance sheet to two places, liabilities and equity. The portion allocated to liabilities was based on an imputed market sort of non-convertible debt interest rate of approximately 5.9%. And the portion allocated to equity represents the value of the conversion feature today. So this allocation created a debt discount of approximately $125 million. And that is the difference you'll see between the $575 million par value and the $450 million liability on our balance sheet, and that debt discount of approximately $125 million is being amortized to interest expense over the five-year term of the notes. Our GAAP operating results will reflect the 5.9% imputed market interest rate to debt, which includes the coupon rate of 0.75%. And that brings me to the second item, which David mentioned in his opening remarks. Beginning in Q1, we will report our operating results in both GAAP and non-GAAP format. We decided to provide this additional disclosure for two primary reasons: First, we believe the supplemental information will prove useful to investors in which to consider the impact of certain non-cash items on the company's offering performance; and second, the great majority of our industry peers report non-GAAP operating results. And we believe this additional disclosure will enable a better comparison of our relative performance.Consequently, we plan to provide non-GAAP operating results beginning when we report first quarter results, and they will exclude the effects of the following items: Stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and the amortization of the convertible debt discount, which I just discussed, and that's also referred to often as non-cash interest expense. We will of course also exclude the tax consequences of these three items. And reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures provided in this call to their GAAP counterparts are available in the earnings release, which we issued earlier this afternoon.So before I discuss specific guidance for fiscal 2011, I do want to provide some context. Fiscal 2010 was the year of two halfs: In the first half, we responded to an uncertain IT spending environment by slowing our rate of investment, which we believe is quite the prudent thing to do; and the second half, the combination of improving IT spending plans together with better execution on our part so our attrition decline in new business return to a strong growth trajectory. Given these improving trends, we will continue to invest for growth in FY '11, particularly in sales. These investments will have an effect on our operating margin expansion and cash flow growth in the near term. We believe this trade-off is essential for us to extend our leadership position and is in the best long-term interest of our customers and our shareholders. The other significant practice affecting our fiscal 2011 guidance are interest income expense, foreign exchange rates and the non-controlling interest charge, sometimes referred to as minority interest. I'm just going to go through each of those one by one. First, as I mentioned a few moments ago, GAAP accounting rules require that we expense interest for our convertible debt liability at a market rate of approximately 5.9% instead of the 0.75% coupon rate. The resulting interest expense of approximately $27 million or roughly $0.12 of EPS will be a GAAP-interest expense in FY '11 and the next four years after that. Second, while we have more cash to invest, we believe our portfolio will yield approximately $6 million or roughly $0.03 of EPS less interest income in fiscal '11, as interest rates have generally contracted and a number of our high-yielding, longer-term investments have matured. Third, the dollar has strengthened by about 9% since we had our last conference call, which has a significant impact on our revenue and operating income. And then finally, because our Japanese subsidiary has been so successful in fiscal '10, its profitability in fiscal '11 will drive approximately a $9 million after-tax, non-controlling interest charge. And that's certainly higher than we thought it would be last year.Let me now offer our specific outlook starting with full fiscal year 2011. Given our strong fourth quarter finish, we're very pleased to be able to raise our full fiscal year 2011 revenue guidance to a range of 16% to 17% growth over our 2010 result, in spite of the stronger dollar. Given the aggressive investment I mentioned earlier, we're planning for operating margin expansion of roughly 125 to 150 basis points, and Marc and I certainly talked about that on our last call. The fact that we thought, certainly, margin expansion this year would be a little less than previous year. We think GAAP EPS for the full year will be in the range of $0.58 to $0.60 at this point. Non-GAAP EPS, we believe, it will be in the range of $1.25 to $1.27. The details for reconciling our GAAP and non-GAAP EPS estimates can be found in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon. Given our investment profile in FY '11, we expect operating cash flow to grow at a slightly lower rate than revenue. Turning to Q1, we are initiating the following guidance: Revenue is expected to be in the range of $365 million to $367 million; GAAP EPS, we expect in the range of $0.12 to $0.13; and non-GAAP EPS, we expect to be approximately $0.29 to $0.30. One final point on Q1. As we have discussed in the past, our recurring revenue business model, combined with a seasonally strong fourth quarter each year, leads to a spike in accounts receivable and deferred revenue at each year end. Similar to past experience, we expect Q1 deferred revenue to decline from Q4 and probably buy more in dollar terms than it did a year ago. We also expect strong Q1 cash flow to be partially offset by higher investment levels in Q1, the net effect being an operating cash result that is slightly up year-over-year.So to close, Q4 was an amazing finish to fiscal 2010. We're executing well, and we enter FY '11 with incredibly strong product offerings. There's never been a better time to be in cloud computing, and we believe no company's better positioned for growth in this market than Salesforce.com.  I look forward to describing our progress when we release our Q1 results in May. With that, let me turn the call back to the operator so we can take your questions."

We just want to be in a position this year to have the flexibility to invest in sales, marketing and so on. So I just think it makes sense for us, heading into this year with a great Q4 performance behind us, to give ourselves a little bit more flexibility around the operating margin percentage improvement."

They're not just able to sale sales force automation, but they recognize the potential for Service Cloud. And they understand the differentiation that Custom Cloud brings it in. I don't know if you saw on YouTube last week, we put a kind of a preview what's coming April 8 with the next version of Service Cloud integrated with Chatter. But that's up on YouTube. And I think that when you see that, you realize, we are really on our way to a huge breakthrough in terms of what we can do for customers, in terms of productivity. So I'm very excited about that opportunity. And then we want to couple that with the distribution expansion. And we want to hire as many salespeople as we can to get out and reach customers all over the world, small, medium and large-sized customers in the U.S., in Asia and Europe. Still relative against our main competitors in the enterprise Oracle, ASP and Microsoft, our sales force is extremely small. And when we get in there, we're more likely to win because their technology is outdated. So we're trying to expand distribution, while at the same time, being mindful that our investors want us to have operating margin expense. And certainly this year, we delivered operating margin expansion. As Graham said, we're going for another 125 to 150 basis points of operating margin while also continuing to grow the top line. And we're very focused on that $2 billion revenue number. We're really going, gee, when are we going to get into that zone? It's only a year or two ago we're talking about a billion internally. All of our planning is around getting to that $2 billion number as fast as possible, and that's all about distribution."

They didn't really have a successful SFA [Sales Force Automation] business, and they certainly didn't have a platform business. They had an ERM business or Employee-Relationship Management business, which mostly failed and the UAM [Unified Activity Management] business, which mostly failed. We haven't entered any new businesses that have failed, because we have one integrated offering. Our sales service and platform are all integrated services, as well as the collaboration. They all kind of are meshed together and make a synergistically make that a better technology overall. I think you'll find that when I do my demonstration tomorrow at the Goldman Sachs Conference in the morning and the Pacific Crest Keynote at lunch tomorrow on Thursday. You'll be seeing me demonstrate some new technologies that emphasize the enhanced competitiveness of both the sales technology, the Sales Cloud, the customer service call center, customer portal technology, the Service Cloud, when it's enhanced with Chatter and how those services are deeply integrated. We still see strong growth obviously by, you can see by these numbers in Salesforce automation, in customer service and support and also the platform. And we're all also entering the collaboration cloud. I've said this before and I still believe it, that this is mostly a distribution-constrained organization. And that we have the market opportunity and the products and the technology. And we need to expand our distribution rapidly to take advantage of the kind of very weak and poor execution by our competitors. And especially, when you look at companies like SAP to kind of try to hold the cloud computing industry back, they provide all this kind of fear, uncertainty and doubt, lack of vision. I mean its one of the key reasons I think that they've had such a big shake up there. I mean they've really become the anti-cloud in so many ways. So that's why I think customers are hungry for new technology, new solutions, lower cost, easier to use. Of course they want social, they want mobile, they want real time. And that, I think, is a huge refresh cycle on sales service, on all applications and especially collaboration.

When you look at the global data centers, a marketplace and how companies run and execute their products, we have almost 75,000 companies using Salesforce.com now. I asked Craig Mundee at the World Economic forum, I was sitting next to him. I said, if Salesforce.com did not exist, how many servers would have had in SQL servers and application servers and software and hardware data centers would have to bid bought and installed? How much energy would have to be consumed as a direct comparison to what we're doing. And he said, well yes, probably more than 100,000 servers would have had to be bought and consumed that all the energy and all the waste that goes with that. I mean, we have only a couple of thousands servers in our whole company and their PCs, and those are shared by those 75,000 customers. I mean, that's an incredible economy of scale. Then you take our software, which is the kind of the integration of the Sales Service platform and collaboration. That's kind of one piece of software. It gets integrated into that, into those couple of thousand PCs. And then we get just tremendous economies of scale and efficiency. And then you add onto that some of this great new technology. We've had tremendous success with Dell's new Nehalem technology. We had tried it in several of our servers over the weekend, and we saw massive, massive capability that we did not see before through a hardware change. It just was awesome, what is happening on the hardware side. It really emphasizes what a scam traditional enterprise software and hardware is. And also what a huge hog it is on kind of a world that is constrained by energy, having to install more of these servers and data centers. This is a time we need to break out. So I just think that when you look at the Service Cloud, we have a sales force who understands how to sell it. We have the data centers in place. We have the software ready to go. We just need the enlightenment from the customers that -- I'll give you an example, we have a customer that we recently sold and they are our U.K. customer, and they have two data centers for 500 call center agents. They have 500 servers in two data centers backed up doing DR [ph] against each other on the TEMS, running technology that they bought in 1995. That's right. So you look at that, and you go, this is just an opportunity for great efficiency, great enhancement. And the way our company is set up, we can deliver economies of scale because we essentially have one offering. And yes, we have different names for that offering, and they can morph and they change for each customer. But the Service Cloud 3, we're really ready to go. I guess I just tipped off the announcement for April 8. Well, anyway you got the idea that we're moving this product forward very, very rapidly."

And I just want to congratulate for my finance organization of pulling off what I thought was just a spectacular transaction for the company to help us, fundamentally, give us flexibility to make investments and to maintain leadership and to grow and then to advance. That said, our strategy's fundamentally unchanged. We want the flexibility, we want the cash-in-hand to be able to move, if there is, a deal to be done. But we're really focused on our three clouds, and now the fourth cloud with Chatter. We have our hands full of technology and product and innovation. And we're going to continue to focus on our fundamental core, I would call it, organic growth. I mean this is a company that is just growing organically. Only if we saw some technology that could really make one of those clouds that were in better, more differentiated, grow faster, expand our distribution, would we start to look at something. At the same time, we're going to be very, very, very conservative in doing that because everything is working so well here. That's why what you've seen us do is a lot of very, very small deals. Our most recent one was with this company called GroupSwim, which was this kind of intelligence on -- it's a future version of Chatter that's coming farther down the road. That'll be smarter, about how you get your feeds and become really intelligent. We're to using Chatter now internally at Salesforce, and it's amazing. I think, fundamentally changing our work. If you're with a Salesforce.com employee, have them show you what it looks like in production. It's really spectacular. I'll be showing it off tomorrow at the two conferences that I'll be speaking at. So when we go to look at M&A, look, we're really going to mostly just focus on the strategy that we have, and it's working. Because that seems like our best opportunity. We want to be opportunistic, but the reality is, at the same time, we don't want to feel rush to do anything. But boy, it's great to have $1.7 billion in cash.

Our fourth quarter caps off the biggest year in Salesforce.com's history, and I'm delighted to be able to share with you today our outstanding results. While most software companies are still trying to forget the past year, our fiscal 2010 was perhaps our most memorable and exciting year ever. And some of the highlights from our full year included: $1.3 billion in revenue, the first enterprise cloud-computing company ever to reach this scale; revenue growth of more than 20%, the fastest growth of any comparably-sized software company in the world; while most of the software companies went backwards last year, Salesforce.com went forward in a dramatic way; and more at a quarter of a billion dollars in operating cash flow and a balance sheet with more than $1.7 billion in cash and equivalents, and more than 72,000 customers globally, including an amazing 17,000 net new customers joining our ranks in the fiscal year, this represents a 31% year-over-year increase in our customer base; more than 2 million subscribers, including more than 500,000 net additions during the year, an increase of roughly 35% year-over-year; and we closed the year by hosting the biggest cloud computing event ever, Dreamforce 2009, in December. It was simply an amazing year. And we closed the year by delivering the biggest financial quarter in our history. Fourth quarter revenue rose 22% to $354 million. At this level, we've broken through yet another huge milestone, the $1.4 billion annual revenue run rate. Fourth quarter growth of 22% was our best performance in more than a year. GAAP EPS of $0.16 increased from $0.11 a year ago. That's an increase of more than 40% and more EPS at a single quarter than we achieved in all of fiscal year 2008. Cash from operations increased 21% to $92 million. And finally, deferred revenue broke through that $700 million threshold for the first time ever to finish at $704 million, an increase of 19%. That was our best growth performance of the year. By virtually every financial measure, our fourth quarter was amazing. Equally important, we saw a continued improvement in our business for the second quarter in a row. That's why we're stepping it up and hiring heavily into next year. After a year of reduced investment levels, the time is now right to invest in our continued growth and leadership of the cloud computing market. Graham will have more to say about our outlook in a moment.Our amazing fourth quarter numbers are powered by another quarter of fantastic wins against our competitors. We had another huge quarter and a huge series of wins against Oracle, including: The Huntington National Bank, GE, Pfizer, KCI, Autodesk, BC and Aramark. And we won impressive business against Microsoft during the quarter, and many companies including Univision, Aspen Pharmaceutical, Cross National Bank, KONE, Ingenix and Sagecom [ph]. And finally, we beat SAP at Schneider Electrics, SAS, Nobel Biocare Services, AG, Kimberly-Clark, Bridgestone Golf and Wolters Kluwer. These customers are coming to us because they want the most innovative products and services in the enterprise today. Not just the best products in the cloud, but the best products available, period. And they're coming in, in everly-increasing numbers. In the fourth quarter alone, we added roughly 4,600 net new customers to bring our full year customer community roughly 72,500, an increase of 31% in our customers. In fact, for the full year, we added more than 17,000 net new customers. That's more customer addition than we recorded in our first six full years of being in business. Wow, that's amazing. All three for our primary services, Sales Cloud 2, Service Cloud 2 and Custom Cloud 2 reported record quarters in the fourth quarter. The multi-product success is key to our growth strategy. Five years ago, our growth was entirely driven by our flagship namesake sales force automation, Sales Cloud service. But today, we have three pillars of growth with the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud and the Custom Cloud, powered by our Force.com platform. We believe that growth opportunity for each of these businesses is massive over the next decade, and the Gartner Group agrees. Gartner estimates the CRM Market, including sales and service, to be roughly $16 billion, and the custom application of open market at more than $50 billion. In our launch of Chatter, the collaboration cloud, which is expected later this year, further expands our market opportunity by creating a fourth leg of growth. Essentially, every business of every size in every industry, with access to the Internet through any device, is now a prospect for our sales force. Our growth opportunity has never been more exciting at Salesforce.com and in cloud computing. As evidenced of our multi-product success, we delivered our most diverse quarter of new business ever with more than 30% of our new business coming from non-Salesforce automation services compared to 25% a year ago. That's a pretty amazing achievement when you consider that our core sales force automation, Sales Cloud business, continues to grow at a strong double-digit clip. In our flagship Sales Cloud 2, we knocked some big wins this quarter including Nippon Express in Japan, GE Energy, Avaya, Cisco, MX Manpower [ph] and First Tennessee Bank National Association as well as Beckman Coulter. And just a year after its launch, the Service Cloud is on fire. And this killer app is clearly our next lever of growth. New business volume for the Service Cloud more than doubled from the year-ago quarter as did the volume of Service Cloud transactions.Customers need the next generation of customer service and support, customer portals and call center solutions, and Salesforce.com is ready to deliver this with Service Cloud 2. Customers realized that the call center of the '90s won't work in the age of social computing, and it is abundantly clear that our competitors in this space just can't keep up. Traditional customer service vendors still regard the web itself as foreign territory. And the Service Cloud 2 features the world's first real time knowledge base in the cloud built on our multi-tenant platform, Force.com; the world's first integration with social networks, like Facebook and Twitter; the world's first most customizable service applications available; and the world's best, most efficient agent console in the cloud as a service, all running on top of Force.com, the world's most trusted, reliable, secure and transparent cloud computing platform today. This is what makes Service Cloud 2 the spectacular success for the quarter, and why we believe that as we enter fiscal year '11, we are entering the year of the Service Cloud. That adds up to an unbeatable value proposition for the Service Cloud, the technology vision for tomorrow's contact centers and customer service organizations, backed by the scale and efficiency that only cloud computing and Salesforce.com can offer. Our huge list of Service Cloud wins in the fourth quarter include: The Huntington National Bank, Dun & Bradstreet, Bausch & Lomb, Wyndham Hotel Group, Wells Fargo Bank, FDL Financial, Allianz, and Chronopost. Look, while companies are poised to build for the future, they're not going to double down on the softer mistakes of the past using old technology like Microsoft .NET. That's why the Force.com Custom Cloud is selling such fantastic results. Developing custom apps on Force.com is five times faster and half the cost of traditional programs like .NET and Java according to a recent study completed by IDC and available on our website. The value proposition was behind several key Custom Cloud wins for the fourth quarter, including: Fast Retailing Co. of Japan, Pfizer, Sepracor, the Japan Research Institute, Avon, McGraw-Hill and Fairchild Semi, Wordzilla, Genentech and Honda, all now our Force.com customers building the next generation of applications of cloud computing, their custom apps, their private cloud apps on Force.com. And we're just getting started. During the quarter, we also announced the key addition to our platform with the addition of Force.com Visual Process Manager, which allows corporate IT to focus on innovation, not infrastructure, with point-and-click, very easy-to-use process design instead of low-level coding. Similar key platform milestones in the fourth quarter included more than 19 million customizations now made by our customers that we're holding in our multi-tenant database. That's up more than 40% from a year ago. Nearly 150,000 custom applications, up from around roughly 100,000 last year, all on Force.com, more than 275 million lines of Force.com code, up 10-fold year-over-year. That's amazing, considering we are one of the very first multi-tenant virtual machines who are hosting our customer's code. We've also added more than a hundred thousand developers to our growing global developer community, a community that boasts more than 230,000 members. And our core transactions, the actual transactions that our customers are completing, whether it's the Sales Cloud, The Service Cloud, the Custom Cloud and soon with Chatter, well, those total transactions grew to 19 billion for the quarter. That's up to more than 46% versus a year ago. You know what, that growth in usage of our platform underscores in a key important point. We have built a service that customers just don't subscribe to, they use. With transactions growing even faster than subscriptions, it's clear that more customers are finding more ways of integrating us into their core operations on a daily basis. Our Sales Cloud, Service Cloud and Custom Clouds have been propelled by the widespread recognition that cloud computing is easy to use, has lower costs and produces faster results than traditional enterprise software. The reality is, that's the very premise that we started Salesforce.com on. It was just about 11 years ago when we asked ourselves the question, why is all enterprise software not as easy to use as Amazon.com? No software to buy, no hardware to buy, nothing to install or upgrade or maintain. You know, when companies like Microsoft, now 10 years later, which have the most salutes from the client software finally embraced cloud computing, you know there's no doubt in customer mind about where the future is headed. It's headed towards cloud computing. But you know what, the game is evolving again. And we believe the stakes are even higher this time, much, much higher. Back in 1999, we asked that simple question about Amazon.com. But today, the question has changed. The question is, why is all enterprise software not like Facebook? You know what, Facebook, you don't waste time searching for the right data going from app to app. The data finds you in real time. That's what customer's getting. Not from outdated collaboration applications like Microsoft SharePoint and Lotus Notes. Now, SharePoint is owned by a lot of businesses, used by far fewer and enjoyed practically by none. When was the last time everyone said they really loved using Microsoft SharePoint or Lotus Notes? The reality is, customers want to track their co-workers who matter to them, the most critical conversations, the apps they depend on, the contents they create and share, all using the new mobile devices that they're carrying around in their hand. And they want to collaborate without the cost, complexity, inflexibility and overall enterprise dead weight of enterprise software hardware and data centers. Look, that's the idea behind Salesforce Chatter, our first enterprise-wide application. And I'm excited to report that the next generation of enterprise collaboration has begun. Last week, we announced the private beta of 100 customers who are the first to get their hands on this game-changing technology. Reaction has been incredible. In fact, we encourage you to search Twitter for the hash tag, Salesforce, to get a sense of it. We believe that enterprises are more ready to cut their losses on failed collaboration apps like Lotus Notes and Microsoft SharePoint and join the conversation using cloud computing and Salesforce Chatter. Take a look at www.salesforce.com/chatter or go to YouTube and see the demonstrations of Salesforce Chatter. Just type Salesforce Chatter in the YouTube search box, and you'll see a demonstration of this exciting technology right now. So please join us as we take Chatter on the road in the coming months. We'll be in New York City for a major event on April 8. With that, let me hand the call over to Graham to discuss our amazing fourth quarter financial results."

Our fourth quarter was a great finish to a fiscal year that started with some uncertainty but it ended with superb execution in terms of new business, revenue and cash flow. The last 12 to 18 months tampered many company's business models, and yet Salesforce.com was able to deliver another outstanding year with record revenues, operating income and cash flow, our filed computing model was tested, and we passed, we believe, with flying colors. So fourth quarter revenue rose 22% from a year ago to roughly $354 million, strong e-business along with good, in-quarter linearity and lower attrition rates helped to drive this result.Our business continues to show strength across the board, with Europe and Asia slightly outpacing growth in the Americas. As a result, international revenues reached 31% of our total revenue. That's the highest level in our history. Let me briefly review revenue performance by region. In the Americas, Q4 revenue growth was 17% year-over-year, with roughly $244 million of revenue in the Americas this quarter. We are fast approaching an annual revenue run rate of more than $1 billion in that region alone. In Europe, fourth quarter revenue rose 33% from a year ago to $64 million, while a weaker dollar added 13 percentage points to this growth rate. Constant-currency growth was still a very solid 20%. And finally, Asia continues to be really strong. The baked deal activity we've been discussing in Japan throughout the past year contributed to Q4 revenue in Asia of $46 million. That's an increase of 42% from the year-ago quarter. In constant-currency terms, growth was 40%. Our Asian business alone now has an annual revenue run rate of almost $200 million. In total, foreign currency boosted our Q4 revenue growth rate by two percentage points.Turning next to gross margin, we set a new high watermark in the fourth quarter at almost 81%. Our mix of business continues to shift toward higher-margin Subscription business and away from professional services, which represented just 7.5% of revenue in Q4, that's down from 8.1% a year ago. For the full year, GAAP gross margin was 80.2%, that's an improvement of roughly 70 basis points from a year ago. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter, as a percentage of revenue, were roughly 74%, essentially flat from a year ago. For the full year, OpEx declined from roughly 74% of revenue to roughly 71%, reflecting the impact of our relatively-slow hiring during the year. Hiring in the fourth quarter was essentially the same as in Q3, with approximately 160 net new hires. After adding roughly 90 people in the first half of last year, we added more than 300 in the second half across all areas of the business. We exited the year with just under 4,000 employees.Given the huge, long-term opportunity we see for cloud computing, the improving IT spending environment and our strong execution, we plan to invest aggressively in fiscal 2011, with particular emphasis on sales hiring. This will have ramifications for our operating margin growth and operating cash flow, which I will discuss in due course. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 7.2%, it was down from Q3 but it's up 260 basis points from a year ago. Similar to last year, this sequential decline was in part of consequence of our Dreamforce event and also seasonally-high Q4 sales incentives payments. For the full year, our GAAP operating margin of 8.8% was up roughly 290 basis points from last year. This was the third year in a row that we've been able to grow operating margin by roughly 300 basis points. At the same time, as we are leveraging our operating model, revenues grow with a CAGR of 38% over the same three-year period from just under $500 million to more than $1.3 billion. Growth continues to be our number one priority, but we are also committed to continued margin expansion. Stock-based compensation amounted to approximately 7% of revenue for both Q4 and the full year. Our GAAP tax rate of 35% in Q4 was a bit lower than we expected entering the quarter. This was the result of a number of factors, including additional R&D, tax credits associated with the exercise of stock options. The net effects for the lower Q4 rate was to reduce our full year FY '10 GAAP tax rate to approximately 40%. Marc has already covered our EPS performance, I'll now move onto cash.Q4 operating cash flow was approximately $92 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year. Capital spending was a bit lower in Q4 than in past quarters at roughly $7 million, that's primarily due to a decline in leasehold improvement spending. And for the full fiscal year, operating cash flow has increased 18% to approximately $271 million and included approximately $19 million of increased tax payments as we transition to being a cash tax payer. This equated to just over $2.10 per share of operating cash flow. Capital spending decreased 12% for the full year to approximately $54 million. And then free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx, was approximately $217 million. That's an increase of 29%, and that's equated to almost $1.70 per share of free cash flow. We ended the year with total cash and marketable securities in excess of $1.7 billion, excluding the proceeds from our January debt offering, our net cash is now in excess of $1.25 billion or nearly $10 a share.Moving to the balance sheet. Similar to previous years, accounts receivable increased significantly in Q4, as we invoiced a large proportion of our renewals as well as a lot of new business. And ended the year just under $321 million with a DSO of 82 days, which is a two-day improvement over last year's number of 84 days. Deferred revenue finished the year at $704 million. In spite of a strengthening dollar, the fourth quarter sequential increase of almost $160 million was our biggest ever and deferred revenue is up 19% from a year ago. Off balance sheet back flow, or business that is contracted but not yet invoiced, finished the year at more than $1 billion. The combined total of this backlog and the on-balance sheet deferred revenue now totals more than $1.7 billion. On the new business front, we had a stronger growth quarter in two years for several reasons. First, Add-on and Upgrade business improved both sequentially and year-over-year. Add-on/upgrade represented more than half of all new business orders during the quarter. Second, our Service Comp business had yet another record quarter and continues to gain traction in the marketplace, together with our Custom Cloud business, as Marc mentioned, our non-Sales Cloud business has represented more than 30% of total new business in the fourth quarter. And then finally, although our average deal size was down slightly versus a year ago, we closed a lot more transactions in the quarter than we did a year ago.Turning to attrition, our dollar-attrition rate remains in the high teens. But we were encouraged to see the rate decline slightly for the second quarter in a row. Next, I'd like to discuss two important items that will affect next fiscal '11. First, as you know, we closed a $575-million convertible debt issuance in January. The notes, which were issued at par, are due in 2015. Interest is payable at a coupon rate of 0.75% annually, and the initial conversion rate is at a 25% premium, which equates to a stock price of approximately $85 per share. In connection with the issuance of the debt, the company entered into a convertible note hedge transaction that covered a number of shares of our common stock that are underlying the notes. Hedge transactions are designed but not guaranteed to reduce or eliminate the potential dilution arising upon conversion. At the same time, the company also entered into a transaction with a hedge count product involving the sale of warrants. The strike price of the warrant transactions is just under $120 per share, effectively raising the conversion price from $85 to this new level. The net proceeds from all of these transactions were approximately $500 million. In accounting for the debt in our fourth quarter results, the $575 million par value of the notes was allocated on our balance sheet to two places, liabilities and equity. The portion allocated to liabilities was based on an imputed market sort of non-convertible debt interest rate of approximately 5.9%. And the portion allocated to equity represents the value of the conversion feature today. So this allocation created a debt discount of approximately $125 million. And that is the difference you'll see between the $575 million par value and the $450 million liability on our balance sheet, and that debt discount of approximately $125 million is being amortized to interest expense over the five-year term of the notes. Our GAAP operating results will reflect the 5.9% imputed market interest rate to debt, which includes the coupon rate of 0.75%. And that brings me to the second item, which David mentioned in his opening remarks. Beginning in Q1, we will report our operating results in both GAAP and non-GAAP format. We decided to provide this additional disclosure for two primary reasons: First, we believe the supplemental information will prove useful to investors in which to consider the impact of certain non-cash items on the company's offering performance; and second, the great majority of our industry peers report non-GAAP operating results. And we believe this additional disclosure will enable a better comparison of our relative performance.Consequently, we plan to provide non-GAAP operating results beginning when we report first quarter results, and they will exclude the effects of the following items: Stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and the amortization of the convertible debt discount, which I just discussed, and that's also referred to often as non-cash interest expense. We will of course also exclude the tax consequences of these three items. And reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures provided in this call to their GAAP counterparts are available in the earnings release, which we issued earlier this afternoon.So before I discuss specific guidance for fiscal 2011, I do want to provide some context. Fiscal 2010 was the year of two halfs: In the first half, we responded to an uncertain IT spending environment by slowing our rate of investment, which we believe is quite the prudent thing to do; and the second half, the combination of improving IT spending plans together with better execution on our part so our attrition decline in new business return to a strong growth trajectory. Given these improving trends, we will continue to invest for growth in FY '11, particularly in sales. These investments will have an effect on our operating margin expansion and cash flow growth in the near term. We believe this trade-off is essential for us to extend our leadership position and is in the best long-term interest of our customers and our shareholders. The other significant practice affecting our fiscal 2011 guidance are interest income expense, foreign exchange rates and the non-controlling interest charge, sometimes referred to as minority interest. I'm just going to go through each of those one by one. First, as I mentioned a few moments ago, GAAP accounting rules require that we expense interest for our convertible debt liability at a market rate of approximately 5.9% instead of the 0.75% coupon rate. The resulting interest expense of approximately $27 million or roughly $0.12 of EPS will be a GAAP-interest expense in FY '11 and the next four years after that. Second, while we have more cash to invest, we believe our portfolio will yield approximately $6 million or roughly $0.03 of EPS less interest income in fiscal '11, as interest rates have generally contracted and a number of our high-yielding, longer-term investments have matured. Third, the dollar has strengthened by about 9% since we had our last conference call, which has a significant impact on our revenue and operating income. And then finally, because our Japanese subsidiary has been so successful in fiscal '10, its profitability in fiscal '11 will drive approximately a $9 million after-tax, non-controlling interest charge. And that's certainly higher than we thought it would be last year.Let me now offer our specific outlook starting with full fiscal year 2011. Given our strong fourth quarter finish, we're very pleased to be able to raise our full fiscal year 2011 revenue guidance to a range of 16% to 17% growth over our 2010 result, in spite of the stronger dollar. Given the aggressive investment I mentioned earlier, we're planning for operating margin expansion of roughly 125 to 150 basis points, and Marc and I certainly talked about that on our last call. The fact that we thought, certainly, margin expansion this year would be a little less than previous year. We think GAAP EPS for the full year will be in the range of $0.58 to $0.60 at this point. Non-GAAP EPS, we believe, it will be in the range of $1.25 to $1.27. The details for reconciling our GAAP and non-GAAP EPS estimates can be found in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon. Given our investment profile in FY '11, we expect operating cash flow to grow at a slightly lower rate than revenue. Turning to Q1, we are initiating the following guidance: Revenue is expected to be in the range of $365 million to $367 million; GAAP EPS, we expect in the range of $0.12 to $0.13; and non-GAAP EPS, we expect to be approximately $0.29 to $0.30. One final point on Q1. As we have discussed in the past, our recurring revenue business model, combined with a seasonally strong fourth quarter each year, leads to a spike in accounts receivable and deferred revenue at each year end. Similar to past experience, we expect Q1 deferred revenue to decline from Q4 and probably buy more in dollar terms than it did a year ago. We also expect strong Q1 cash flow to be partially offset by higher investment levels in Q1, the net effect being an operating cash result that is slightly up year-over-year.So to close, Q4 was an amazing finish to fiscal 2010. We're executing well, and we enter FY '11 with incredibly strong product offerings. There's never been a better time to be in cloud computing, and we believe no company's better positioned for growth in this market than Salesforce.com.  I look forward to describing our progress when we release our Q1 results in May. With that, let me turn the call back to the operator so we can take your questions."

And we want to hire as many salespeople as we can to get out and reach customers all over the world, small, medium and large-sized customers in the U.S., in Asia and Europe. Still relative against our main competitors in the enterprise Oracle, ASP and Microsoft, our sales force is extremely small. And when we get in there, we're more likely to win because their technology is outdated. So we're trying to expand distribution, while at the same time, being mindful that our investors want us to have operating margin expense. And certainly this year, we delivered operating margin expansion. As Graham said, we're going for another 125 to 150 basis points of operating margin while also continuing to grow the top line. And we're very focused on that $2 billion revenue number. We're really going, gee, when are we going to get into that zone? It's only a year or two ago we're talking about a billion internally.

And the reason why is, is that Siebel was mostly a customer service and call center company. They didn't really have a successful SFA [Sales Force Automation] business, and they certainly didn't have a platform business. They had an ERM business or Employee-Relationship Management business, which mostly failed and the UAM [Unified Activity Management] business, which mostly failed. We haven't entered any new businesses that have failed, because we have one integrated offering. Our sales service and platform are all integrated services, as well as the collaboration. They all kind of are meshed together and make a synergistically make that a better technology overall. I think you'll find that when I do my demonstration tomorrow at the Goldman Sachs Conference in the morning and the Pacific Crest Keynote at lunch tomorrow on Thursday. You'll be seeing me demonstrate some new technologies that emphasize the enhanced competitiveness of both the sales technology, the Sales Cloud, the customer service call center, customer portal technology, the Service Cloud, when it's enhanced with Chatter and how those services are deeply integrated. We still see strong growth obviously by, you can see by these numbers in Salesforce automation, in customer service and support and also the platform. And we're all also entering the collaboration cloud. I've said this before and I still believe it, that this is mostly a distribution-constrained organization. And that we have the market opportunity and the products and the technology. And we need to expand our distribution rapidly to take advantage of the kind of very weak and poor execution by our competitors. And especially, when you look at companies like SAP to kind of try to hold the cloud computing industry back, they provide all this kind of fear, uncertainty and doubt, lack of vision. I mean its one of the key reasons I think that they've had such a big shake up there. I mean they've really become the anti-cloud in so many ways. So that's why I think customers are hungry for new technology, new solutions, lower cost, easier to use. Of course they want social, they want mobile, they want real time. And that, I think, is a huge refresh cycle on sales service, on all applications and especially collaboration. Especially when you look at Chatter against these really legacy products, like SharePoint and Lotus Notes. I mean Lotus Notes was conceived before Mark Zuckerberg was. I mean, come on."

When you look at the global data centers, a marketplace and how companies run and execute their products, we have almost 75,000 companies using Salesforce.com now. I asked Craig Mundee at the World Economic forum, I was sitting next to him. I said, if Salesforce.com did not exist, how many servers would have had in SQL servers and application servers and software and hardware data centers would have to bid bought and installed? How much energy would have to be consumed as a direct comparison to what we're doing. And he said, well yes, probably more than 100,000 servers would have had to be bought and consumed that all the energy and all the waste that goes with that. I mean, we have only a couple of thousands servers in our whole company and their PCs, and those are shared by those 75,000 customers. I mean, that's an incredible economy of scale. Then you take our software, which is the kind of the integration of the Sales Service platform and collaboration. That's kind of one piece of software. It gets integrated into that, into those couple of thousand PCs. And then we get just tremendous economies of scale and efficiency. And then you add onto that some of this great new technology. We've had tremendous success with Dell's new Nehalem technology. We had tried it in several of our servers over the weekend, and we saw massive, massive capability that we did not see before through a hardware change. It just was awesome, what is happening on the hardware side. It really emphasizes what a scam traditional enterprise software and hardware is. And also what a huge hog it is on kind of a world that is constrained by energy, having to install more of these servers and data centers. This is a time we need to break out. So I just think that when you look at the Service Cloud, we have a sales force who understands how to sell it. We have the data centers in place. We have the software ready to go. We just need the enlightenment from the customers that -- I'll give you an example, we have a customer that we recently sold and they are our U.K. customer, and they have two data centers for 500 call center agents. They have 500 servers in two data centers backed up doing DR [ph] against each other on the TEMS, running technology that they bought in 1995. That's right. So you look at that, and you go, this is just an opportunity for great efficiency, great enhancement. And the way our company is set up, we can deliver economies of scale because we essentially have one offering. And yes, we have different names for that offering, and they can morph and they change for each customer. But the Service Cloud 3, we're really ready to go. I guess I just tipped off the announcement for April 8. Well, anyway you got the idea that we're moving this product forward very, very rapidly."

At the same time, we're going to be very, very, very conservative in doing that because everything is working so well here. That's why what you've seen us do is a lot of very, very small deals.

That'll be smarter, about how you get your feeds and become really intelligent. We're to using Chatter now internally at Salesforce, and it's amazing. I think, fundamentally changing our work. If you're with a Salesforce.com employee, have them show you what it looks like in production. It's really spectacular. I'll be showing it off tomorrow at the two conferences that I'll be speaking at.

Our fourth quarter caps off the biggest year in Salesforce.com's history, and I'm delighted to be able to share with you today our outstanding results. While most software companies are still trying to forget the past year, our fiscal 2010 was perhaps our most memorable and exciting year ever. And some of the highlights from our full year included: $1.3 billion in revenue, the first enterprise cloud-computing company ever to reach this scale; revenue growth of more than 20%, the fastest growth of any comparably-sized software company in the world; while most of the software companies went backwards last year, Salesforce.com went forward in a dramatic way; and more at a quarter of a billion dollars in operating cash flow and a balance sheet with more than $1.7 billion in cash and equivalents, and more than 72,000 customers globally, including an amazing 17,000 net new customers joining our ranks in the fiscal year, this represents a 31% year-over-year increase in our customer base; more than 2 million subscribers, including more than 500,000 net additions during the year, an increase of roughly 35% year-over-year; and we closed the year by hosting the biggest cloud computing event ever, Dreamforce 2009, in December. It was simply an amazing year. And we closed the year by delivering the biggest financial quarter in our history. Fourth quarter revenue rose 22% to $354 million. At this level, we've broken through yet another huge milestone, the $1.4 billion annual revenue run rate. Fourth quarter growth of 22% was our best performance in more than a year. GAAP EPS of $0.16 increased from $0.11 a year ago. That's an increase of more than 40% and more EPS at a single quarter than we achieved in all of fiscal year 2008. Cash from operations increased 21% to $92 million. And finally, deferred revenue broke through that $700 million threshold for the first time ever to finish at $704 million, an increase of 19%. That was our best growth performance of the year. By virtually every financial measure, our fourth quarter was amazing. Equally important, we saw a continued improvement in our business for the second quarter in a row. That's why we're stepping it up and hiring heavily into next year. After a year of reduced investment levels, the time is now right to invest in our continued growth and leadership of the cloud computing market. Graham will have more to say about our outlook in a moment.Our amazing fourth quarter numbers are powered by another quarter of fantastic wins against our competitors. We had another huge quarter and a huge series of wins against Oracle, including: The Huntington National Bank, GE, Pfizer, KCI, Autodesk, BC and Aramark. And we won impressive business against Microsoft during the quarter, and many companies including Univision, Aspen Pharmaceutical, Cross National Bank, KONE, Ingenix and SageCom. And finally, we beat SAP at Schneider Electrics, SAS, Nobel Biocare Services, AG, Kimberly-Clark, Bridgestone Golf and Wolters Kluwer. These customers are coming to us because they want the most innovative products and services in the enterprise today. Not just the best products in the cloud, but the best products available, period. And they're coming in, in everly-increasing numbers. In the fourth quarter alone, we added roughly 4,600 net new customers to bring our full year customer community to roughly 72,500, an increase of 31% in our customers. In fact, for the full year, we added more than 17,000 net new customers. That's more customer addition than we recorded in our first six full years of being in business. Wow, that's amazing. All three for our primary services, Sales Cloud 2, Service Cloud 2 and Custom Cloud 2 reported record quarters in the fourth quarter. The multi-product success is key to our growth strategy. Five years ago, our growth was entirely driven by our flagship namesake sales force automation, Sales Cloud service. But today, we have three pillars of growth with the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud and the Custom Cloud, powered by our Force.com platform. We believe the growth opportunity for each of these businesses is massive over the next decade, and the Gartner Group agrees. Gartner estimates the CRM Market, including sales and service, to be roughly $16 billion, and the custom application of open market at more than $50 billion. In our launch of Chatter, the collaboration cloud, which is expected later this year, further expands our market opportunity by creating a fourth leg of growth. Essentially, every business of every size in every industry, with access to the Internet through any device, is now a prospect for our sales force. Our growth opportunity has never been more exciting at Salesforce.com and in cloud computing. As evidenced of our multi-product success, we delivered our most diverse quarter of new business ever with more than 30% of our new business coming from non-Salesforce automation services compared to 25% a year ago. That's a pretty amazing achievement when you consider that our core sales force automation, Sales Cloud business, continues to grow at a strong double-digit clip. In our flagship Sales Cloud 2, we notched some big wins this quarter including Nippon Express in Japan, GE Energy, Avaya, Cisco, MX Manpower [ph] and First Tennessee Bank National Association as well as Beckman Coulter. And just a year after its launch, the Service Cloud is on fire. And this killer app is clearly our next lever of growth. New business volume for the Service Cloud more than doubled from the year-ago quarter as did the volume of Service Cloud transactions.Customers need the next generation of customer service and support, customer portals and call center solutions, and Salesforce.com is ready to deliver this with Service Cloud 2. Customers realized that the call center of the '90s won't work in the age of social computing, and it is abundantly clear that our competitors in this space just can't keep up. Traditional customer service vendors still regard the web itself as foreign territory. And the Service Cloud 2 features the world's first real time knowledge base in the cloud built on our multi-tenant platform, Force.com; the world's first integration with social networks, like Facebook and Twitter; the world's first most customizable service applications available; and the world's best, most efficient agent console in the cloud as a service, all running on top of Force.com, the world's most trusted, reliable, secure and transparent cloud computing platform today. This is what makes Service Cloud 2 the spectacular success for the quarter, and why we believe that as we enter fiscal year '11, we are entering the year of the Service Cloud. That adds up to an unbeatable value proposition for the Service Cloud, the technology vision for tomorrow's contact centers and customer service organizations, backed by the scale and efficiency that only cloud computing and Salesforce.com can offer. Our huge list of Service Cloud wins in the fourth quarter include: The Huntington National Bank, Dun & Bradstreet, Bausch & Lomb, Wyndham Hotel Group, Wells Fargo Bank, FDL Financial, Allianz, and Chronopost. Look, while companies are poised to build for the future, they're not going to double down on the software mistakes of the past using old technology like Microsoft .NET. That's why the Force.com Custom Cloud is showing such fantastic results. Developing custom apps on Force.com is 5x faster and half the cost of traditional programs like .NET and Java according to a recent study completed by IDC and available on our website. The value proposition was behind several key Custom Cloud wins for the fourth quarter, including: Fast Retailing Co. of Japan, Pfizer, Sepracor, The Japan Research Institute, Avon, McGraw-Hill and Fairchild Semi, Wordzilla, Genentech and Honda, all now our Force.com customers building the next generation of applications of cloud computing, their custom apps, their private cloud apps on Force.com. And we're just getting started. During the quarter, we also announced the key addition to our platform with the addition of Force.com Visual Process Manager, which allows corporate IT to focus on innovation, not infrastructure, with point-and-click, very easy-to-use process design instead of low-level coding. Some of our key platform milestones in the fourth quarter included more than 19 million customizations now made by our customers that we're holding in our multi-tenant database. That's up more than 40% from a year ago. Nearly 150,000 custom applications, up from around roughly 100,000 last year, all on Force.com, more than 275 million lines of Force.com code, up 10-fold year-over-year. That's amazing, considering we are one of the very first multi-tenant virtual machines who are hosting our customer's code. We've also added more than 100,000 developers to our growing global developer community, a community that boasts more than 230,000 members. And our core transactions, the actual transactions that our customers are completing, whether it's the Sales Cloud, The Service Cloud, the Custom Cloud and soon with Chatter, well, those total transactions grew to 19 billion for the quarter. That's up to more than 46% versus a year ago. You know what, that growth and usage of our platform underscores in a key important point. We have built a service that customers just don't subscribe to, they use. With transactions growing even faster than subscriptions, it's clear that more customers are finding more ways of integrating us into their core operations on a daily basis. Our Sales Cloud, Service Cloud and Custom Clouds have been propelled by the widespread recognition that cloud computing is easy to use, has lower costs and produces faster results than traditional enterprise software. The reality is, that's the very premise that we started Salesforce.com on. It was just about 11 years ago when we asked ourselves the question, why is all enterprise software not as easy to use as Amazon.com? No software to buy, no hardware to buy, nothing to install or upgrade or maintain. You know, when companies like Microsoft, now 10 years later, which have the most to lose from the decline of software finally embrace cloud computing, you know there's no doubt in customer mind about where the future is headed. It's headed towards cloud computing. But you know what, the game is evolving again. And we believe the stakes are even higher this time, much, much higher. Back in 1999, we asked that simple question about Amazon.com. But today, the question has changed. The question is, why is all enterprise software not like Facebook? You know what, Facebook, you don't waste time searching for the right data going from app to app. The data finds you in real time. That's what customer's getting. Not from outdated collaboration applications like Microsoft SharePoint and Lotus Notes. Now, SharePoint is owned by a lot of businesses, used by far fewer and enjoyed practically by none. When was the last time everyone said they really loved using Microsoft SharePoint or Lotus Notes? The reality is, customers want to track their co-workers who matter to them, the most critical conversations, the apps they depend on, the contents they create and share, all using the new mobile devices that they're carrying around in their hand. And they want to collaborate without the cost, complexity, inflexibility and overall enterprise dead weight of enterprise software hardware and data centers. Look, that's the idea behind Salesforce Chatter, our first enterprise-wide application. And I'm excited to report that the next generation of enterprise collaboration has begun. Last week, we announced the private beta of 100 customers who are the first to get their hands on this game-changing technology. Reaction has been incredible. In fact, we encourage you to search Twitter for the hash tag, Salesforce, to get a sense of it. We believe that enterprises are more ready to cut their losses on failed collaboration apps like Lotus Notes and Microsoft SharePoint and join the conversation using cloud computing and Salesforce Chatter. Take a look at www.salesforce.com/chatter or go to YouTube and see the demonstrations of Salesforce Chatter. Just type Salesforce Chatter in the YouTube search box, and you'll see a demonstration of this exciting technology right now. So please join us as we take Chatter on the road in the coming months. We'll be in New York City for a major event on April 8. With that, let me hand the call over to Graham to discuss our amazing fourth quarter financial results."

Our fourth quarter was a great finish to a fiscal year that started with some uncertainty but it ended with superb execution in terms of new business, revenue and cash flow. The last 12 to 18 months tampered many company's business models",2440,"Thank you, Marc. Our fourth quarter was a great finish to a fiscal year that started with some uncertainty but it ended with superb execution in terms of new business, revenue and cash flow. The last 12 to 18 months tampered many company's business models, and yet Salesforce.com was able to deliver another outstanding year with record revenues, operating income and cash flow, our filed computing model was tested, and we passed, we believe, with flying colors. So fourth quarter revenue rose 22% from a year ago to roughly $354 million, strong e-business along with good, in-quarter linearity and lower attrition rates helped to drive this result.Our business continues to show strength across the board, with Europe and Asia slightly outpacing growth in the Americas. As a result, international revenues reached 31% of our total revenue. That's the highest level in our history. Let me briefly review revenue performance by region. In the Americas, Q4 revenue growth was 17% year-over-year, with roughly $244 million of revenue in the Americas this quarter. We are fast approaching an annual revenue run rate of more than $1 billion in that region alone. In Europe, fourth quarter revenue rose 33% from a year ago to $64 million, while a weaker dollar added 13 percentage points to this growth rate. Constant-currency growth was still a very solid 20%. And finally, Asia continues to be really strong. The baked deal activity we've been discussing in Japan throughout the past year contributed to Q4 revenue in Asia of $46 million. That's an increase of 42% from the year-ago quarter. In constant-currency terms, growth was 40%. Our Asian business alone now has an annual revenue run rate of almost $200 million. In total, foreign currency boosted our Q4 revenue growth rate by two percentage points.Turning next to gross margin, we set a new high watermark in the fourth quarter at almost 81%. Our mix of business continues to shift toward higher-margin Subscription business and away from professional services, which represented just 7.5% of revenue in Q4, that's down from 8.1% a year ago. For the full year, GAAP gross margin was 80.2%, that's an improvement of roughly 70 basis points from a year ago. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter, as a percentage of revenue, were roughly 74%, essentially flat from a year ago. For the full year, OpEx declined from roughly 74% of revenue to roughly 71%, reflecting the impact of our relatively-slow hiring during the year. Hiring in the fourth quarter was essentially the same as in Q3, with approximately 160 net new hires. After adding roughly 90 people in the first half of last year, we added more than 300 in the second half across all areas of the business. We exited the year with just under 4,000 employees.Given the huge, long-term opportunity we see for cloud computing, the improving IT spending environment and our strong execution, we plan to invest aggressively in fiscal 2011, with particular emphasis on sales hiring. This will have ramifications for our operating margin growth and operating cash flow, which I will discuss in due course. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 7.2%, it was down from Q3 but it's up 260 basis points from a year ago. Similar to last year, this sequential decline was in part of consequence of our Dreamforce event and also seasonally-high Q4 sales incentives payments. For the full year, our GAAP operating margin of 8.8% was up roughly 290 basis points from last year. This was the third year in a row that we've been able to grow operating margin by roughly 300 basis points. At the same time, as we are leveraging our operating model, revenues grow with a CAGR of 38% over the same three-year period from just under $500 million to more than $1.3 billion. Growth continues to be our number one priority, but we are also committed to continued margin expansion. Stock-based compensation amounted to approximately 7% of revenue for both Q4 and the full year. Our GAAP tax rate of 35% in Q4 was a bit lower than we expected entering the quarter. This was the result of a number of factors, including additional R&D, tax credits associated with the exercise of stock options. The net effects for the lower Q4 rate was to reduce our full year FY '10 GAAP tax rate to approximately 40%. Marc has already covered our EPS performance, I'll now move onto cash.Q4 operating cash flow was approximately $92 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year. Capital spending was a bit lower in Q4 than in past quarters at roughly $7 million, that's primarily due to a decline in leasehold improvement spending. And for the full fiscal year, operating cash flow has increased 18% to approximately $271 million and included approximately $19 million of increased tax payments as we transition to being a cash tax payer. This equated to just over $2.10 per share of operating cash flow. Capital spending decreased 12% for the full year to approximately $54 million. And then free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx, was approximately $217 million. That's an increase of 29%, and that's equated to almost $1.70 per share of free cash flow. We ended the year with total cash and marketable securities in excess of $1.7 billion, excluding the proceeds from our January debt offering, our net cash is now in excess of $1.25 billion or nearly $10 a share.Moving to the balance sheet. Similar to previous years, accounts receivable increased significantly in Q4, as we invoiced a large proportion of our renewals as well as a lot of new business. And ended the year just under $321 million with a DSO of 82 days, which is a two-day improvement over last year's number of 84 days. Deferred revenue finished the year at $704 million. In spite of a strengthening dollar, the fourth quarter sequential increase of almost $160 million was our biggest ever and deferred revenue is up 19% from a year ago. Off balance sheet back flow, or business that is contracted but not yet invoiced, finished the year at more than $1 billion. The combined total of this backlog and the on-balance sheet deferred revenue now totals more than $1.7 billion. On the new business front, we had a stronger growth quarter in two years for several reasons. First, Add-on and Upgrade business improved both sequentially and year-over-year. Add-on/upgrade represented more than half of all new business orders during the quarter. Second, our Service Comp business had yet another record quarter and continues to gain traction in the marketplace, together with our Custom Cloud business, as Marc mentioned, our non-Sales Cloud business has represented more than 30% of total new business in the fourth quarter. And then finally, although our average deal size was down slightly versus a year ago, we closed a lot more transactions in the quarter than we did a year ago.Turning to attrition, our dollar-attrition rate remains in the high teens. But we were encouraged to see the rate decline slightly for the second quarter in a row. Next, I'd like to discuss two important items that will affect next fiscal '11. First, as you know, we closed a $575-million convertible debt issuance in January. The notes, which were issued at par, are due in 2015. Interest is payable at a coupon rate of 0.75% annually, and the initial conversion rate is at a 25% premium, which equates to a stock price of approximately $85 per share. In connection with the issuance of the debt, the company entered into a convertible note hedge transaction that covered a number of shares of our common stock that are underlying the notes. Hedge transactions are designed but not guaranteed to reduce or eliminate the potential dilution arising upon conversion. At the same time, the company also entered into a transaction with a hedge count product involving the sale of warrants. The strike price of the warrant transactions is just under $120 per share, effectively raising the conversion price from $85 to this new level. The net proceeds from all of these transactions were approximately $500 million. In accounting for the debt in our fourth quarter results, the $575 million par value of the notes was allocated on our balance sheet to two places, liabilities and equity. The portion allocated to liabilities was based on an imputed market sort of non-convertible debt interest rate of approximately 5.9%. And the portion allocated to equity represents the value of the conversion feature today. So this allocation created a debt discount of approximately $125 million. And that is the difference you'll see between the $575 million par value and the $450 million liability on our balance sheet, and that debt discount of approximately $125 million is being amortized to interest expense over the five-year term of the notes. Our GAAP operating results will reflect the 5.9% imputed market interest rate to debt, which includes the coupon rate of 0.75%. And that brings me to the second item, which David mentioned in his opening remarks. Beginning in Q1, we will report our operating results in both GAAP and non-GAAP format. We decided to provide this additional disclosure for two primary reasons: First, we believe the supplemental information will prove useful to investors in which to consider the impact of certain non-cash items on the company's offering performance; and second, the great majority of our industry peers report non-GAAP operating results. And we believe this additional disclosure will enable a better comparison of our relative performance.Consequently, we plan to provide non-GAAP operating results beginning when we report first quarter results, and they will exclude the effects of the following items: Stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and the amortization of the convertible debt discount, which I just discussed, and that's also referred to often as non-cash interest expense. We will of course also exclude the tax consequences of these three items. And reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures provided in this call to their GAAP counterparts are available in the earnings release, which we issued earlier this afternoon.So before I discuss specific guidance for fiscal 2011, I do want to provide some context. Fiscal 2010 was the year of two halfs: In the first half, we responded to an uncertain IT spending environment by slowing our rate of investment, which we believe is quite the prudent thing to do; and the second half, the combination of improving IT spending plans together with better execution on our part so our attrition decline in new business return to a strong growth trajectory. Given these improving trends, we will continue to invest for growth in FY '11, particularly in sales. These investments will have an effect on our operating margin expansion and cash flow growth in the near term. We believe this trade-off is essential for us to extend our leadership position and is in the best long-term interest of our customers and our shareholders. The other significant practice affecting our fiscal 2011 guidance are interest income expense, foreign exchange rates and the non-controlling interest charge, sometimes referred to as minority interest. I'm just going to go through each of those one by one. First, as I mentioned a few moments ago, GAAP accounting rules require that we expense interest for our convertible debt liability at a market rate of approximately 5.9% instead of the 0.75% coupon rate. The resulting interest expense of approximately $27 million or roughly $0.12 of EPS will be a GAAP-interest expense in FY '11 and the next four years after that. Second, while we have more cash to invest, we believe our portfolio will yield approximately $6 million or roughly $0.03 of EPS less interest income in fiscal '11, as interest rates have generally contracted and a number of our high-yielding, longer-term investments have matured. Third, the dollar has strengthened by about 9% since we had our last conference call, which has a significant impact on our revenue and operating income. And then finally, because our Japanese subsidiary has been so successful in fiscal '10, its profitability in fiscal '11 will drive approximately a $9 million after-tax, non-controlling interest charge. And that's certainly higher than we thought it would be last year.Let me now offer our specific outlook starting with full fiscal year 2011. Given our strong fourth quarter finish, we're very pleased to be able to raise our full fiscal year 2011 revenue guidance to a range of 16% to 17% growth over our 2010 result, in spite of the stronger dollar. Given the aggressive investment I mentioned earlier, we're planning for operating margin expansion of roughly 125 to 150 basis points, and Marc and I certainly talked about that on our last call. The fact that we thought, certainly, margin expansion this year would be a little less than previous year. We think GAAP EPS for the full year will be in the range of $0.58 to $0.60 at this point. Non-GAAP EPS, we believe, it will be in the range of $1.25 to $1.27. The details for reconciling our GAAP and non-GAAP EPS estimates can be found in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon. Given our investment profile in FY '11, we expect operating cash flow to grow at a slightly lower rate than revenue. Turning to Q1, we are initiating the following guidance: Revenue is expected to be in the range of $365 million to $367 million; GAAP EPS, we expect in the range of $0.12 to $0.13; and non-GAAP EPS, we expect to be approximately $0.29 to $0.30. One final point on Q1. As we have discussed in the past, our recurring revenue business model, combined with a seasonally strong fourth quarter each year, leads to a spike in accounts receivable and deferred revenue at each year end. Similar to past experience, we expect Q1 deferred revenue to decline from Q4 and probably buy more in dollar terms than it did a year ago. We also expect strong Q1 cash flow to be partially offset by higher investment levels in Q1, the net effect being an operating cash result that is slightly up year-over-year.So to close, Q4 was an amazing finish to fiscal 2010. We're executing well, and we enter FY '11 with incredibly strong product offerings. There's never been a better time to be in cloud computing, and we believe no company's better positioned for growth in this market than Salesforce.com.  I look forward to describing our progress when we release our Q1 results in May. With that, let me turn the call back to the operator so we can take your questions."

They're not just able to sale sales force automation, but they recognize the potential for Service Cloud. And they understand the differentiation that Custom Cloud brings it in. I don't know if you saw on YouTube last week, we put a kind of a preview what's coming April 8 with the next version of Service Cloud integrated with Chatter. But that's up on YouTube. And I think that when you see that, you realize, we are really on our way to a huge breakthrough in terms of what we can do for customers, in terms of productivity. So I'm very excited about that opportunity. And then we want to couple that with the distribution expansion. And we want to hire as many salespeople as we can to get out and reach customers all over the world, small, medium and large-sized customers in the U.S., in Asia and Europe. Still relative against our main competitors in the enterprise Oracle, ASP and Microsoft, our sales force is extremely small. And when we get in there, we're more likely to win because their technology is outdated. So we're trying to expand distribution, while at the same time, being mindful that our investors want us to have operating margin expense. And certainly this year, we delivered operating margin expansion. As Graham said, we're going for another 125 to 150 basis points of operating margin while also continuing to grow the top line. And we're very focused on that $2 billion revenue number. We're really going, gee, when are we going to get into that zone? It's only a year or two ago we're talking about a billion internally. All of our planning is around getting to that $2 billion number as fast as possible, and that's all about distribution."

And the reason why is, is that Siebel was mostly a customer service and call center company. They didn't really have a successful SFA [Sales Force Automation] business, and they certainly didn't have a platform business. They had an ERM business or Employee-Relationship Management business, which mostly failed and the UAM [Unified Activity Management] business, which mostly failed. We haven't entered any new businesses that have failed, because we have one integrated offering. Our sales service and platform are all integrated services, as well as the collaboration. They all kind of are meshed together and make a synergistically make that a better technology overall. I think you'll find that when I do my demonstration tomorrow at the Goldman Sachs Conference in the morning and the Pacific Crest Keynote at lunch tomorrow on Thursday. You'll be seeing me demonstrate some new technologies that emphasize the enhanced competitiveness of both the sales technology, the Sales Cloud, the customer service call center, customer portal technology, the Service Cloud, when it's enhanced with Chatter and how those services are deeply integrated. We still see strong growth obviously by, you can see by these numbers in Salesforce automation, in customer service and support and also the platform. And we're all also entering the collaboration cloud. I've said this before and I still believe it, that this is mostly a distribution-constrained organization. And that we have the market opportunity and the products and the technology. And we need to expand our distribution rapidly to take advantage of the kind of very weak and poor execution by our competitors. And especially, when you look at companies like SAP, who kind of tried to hold the cloud computing industry back, they provide all this kind of fear, uncertainty and doubt, lack of vision. I mean its one of the key reasons I think that they've had such a big shake up there. I mean they've really become the anti-cloud in so many ways. So that's why I think customers are hungry for new technology, new solutions, lower cost, easier to use. Of course they want social, they want mobile, they want real time. And that, I think, is a huge refresh cycle on sales service, on all applications and especially collaboration. Especially when you look at Chatter against these really legacy products, like SharePoint and Lotus Notes. I mean Lotus Notes was conceived before Mark Zuckerberg was. I mean, come on."

When you look at the global data centers, a marketplace and how companies run and execute their products, we have almost 75,000 companies using Salesforce.com now. I asked Craig Mundee at the World Economic forum, I was sitting next to him. I said, if Salesforce.com did not exist, how many servers would have had in SQL servers and application servers and software and hardware data centers would have to bid bought and installed? How much energy would have to be consumed as a direct comparison to what we're doing. And he said, well yes, probably more than 100,000 servers would have had to be bought and consumed that all the energy and all the waste that goes with that. I mean, we have only a couple of thousands servers in our whole company and their PCs, and those are shared by those 75,000 customers. I mean, that's an incredible economy of scale. Then you take our software, which is the kind of the integration of the Sales Service platform and collaboration. That's kind of one piece of software. It gets integrated into that, into those couple of thousand PCs. And then we get just tremendous economies of scale and efficiency. And then you add onto that some of this great new technology. We've had tremendous success with Dell's new Nehalem technology. We had tried it in several of our servers over the weekend, and we saw massive, massive capability that we did not see before through a hardware change. It just was awesome, what is happening on the hardware side. It really emphasizes what a scam traditional enterprise software and hardware is. And also what a huge hog it is on kind of a world that is constrained by energy, having to install more of these servers and data centers. This is a time we need to break out. So I just think that when you look at the Service Cloud, we have a sales force who understands how to sell it. We have the data centers in place. We have the software ready to go. We just need the enlightenment from the customers that -- I'll give you an example, we have a customer that we recently sold and they are our U.K. customer, and they have two data centers for 500 call center agents. They have 500 servers in two data centers backed up doing DR [ph] against each other on the TEMS, running technology that they bought in 1995. That's right. So you look at that, and you go, this is just an opportunity for great efficiency, great enhancement. And the way our company is set up, we can deliver economies of scale because we essentially have one offering. And yes, we have different names for that offering, and they can morph and they change for each customer. But the Service Cloud 3, we're really ready to go. I guess I just tipped off the announcement for April 8. Well, anyway you got the idea that we're moving this product forward very, very rapidly."

And I just want to congratulate for my finance organization of pulling off what I thought was just a spectacular transaction for the company to help us, fundamentally, give us flexibility to make investments and to maintain leadership and to grow and then to advance. That said, our strategy's fundamentally unchanged. We want the flexibility, we want the cash-in-hand to be able to move, if there is, a deal to be done. But we're really focused on our three clouds, and now the fourth cloud with Chatter. We have our hands full of technology and product and innovation. And we're going to continue to focus on our fundamental core, I would call it, organic growth. I mean this is a company that is just growing organically. Only if we saw some technology that could really make one of those clouds that were in better, more differentiated, grow faster, expand our distribution, would we start to look at something. At the same time, we're going to be very, very, very conservative in doing that because everything is working so well here. That's why what you've seen us do is a lot of very, very small deals. Our most recent one was with this company called GroupSwim, which was this kind of intelligence on -- it's a future version of Chatter that's coming farther down the road. That'll be smarter, about how you get your feeds and become really intelligent. We're to using Chatter now internally at Salesforce, and it's amazing. I think, fundamentally changing our work. If you're with a Salesforce.com employee, have them show you what it looks like in production. It's really spectacular. I'll be showing it off tomorrow at the two conferences that I'll be speaking at. So when we go to look at M&A, look, we're really going to mostly just focus on the strategy that we have, and it's working. Because that seems like our best opportunity. We want to be opportunistic, but the reality is, at the same time, we don't want to feel rush to do anything. But boy, it's great to have $1.7 billion in cash. So that if there ever was a situation, we could actively had to."

Several of the other fast firms that have had more muted margin guidance have sided the fact that the recent bookings surge in the last couple of quarters creates natural accounting-driven margin pressure going forward, as you need to expense the number of cost and obviously defer revenue recognition.

We've successfully come close and demonstrated 300 basis points a year. I think this year, we signaled early that we would probably not be expecting to quite be at that rate. And that's because I think this year, we feel we're back in high-growth mode. We've got huge opportunity, and we want to be at a higher salespeople.

Our fourth quarter caps off the biggest year in Salesforce.com's history, and I'm delighted to be able to share with you today our outstanding results. While most software companies are still trying to forget the past year, our fiscal 2010 was perhaps our most memorable and exciting year ever. And some of the highlights from our full year included: $1.3 billion in revenue, the first enterprise cloud-computing company ever to reach this scale; revenue growth of more than 20%, the fastest growth of any comparably-sized software company in the world; while most of the software companies went backwards last year, Salesforce.com went forward in a dramatic way; and more at a quarter of a billion dollars in operating cash flow and a balance sheet with more than $1.7 billion in cash and equivalents, and more than 72,000 customers globally, including an amazing 17,000 net new customers joining our ranks in the fiscal year, this represents a 31% year-over-year increase in our customer base; more than 2 million subscribers, including more than 500,000 net additions during the year, an increase of roughly 35% year-over-year; and we closed the year by hosting the biggest cloud computing event ever, Dreamforce 2009, in December. It was simply an amazing year. And we closed the year by delivering the biggest financial quarter in our history. Fourth quarter revenue rose 22% to $354 million. At this level, we've broken through yet another huge milestone, the $1.4 billion annual revenue run rate. Fourth quarter growth of 22% was our best performance in more than a year. GAAP EPS of $0.16 increased from $0.11 a year ago. That's an increase of more than 40% and more EPS at a single quarter than we achieved in all of fiscal year 2008. Cash from operations increased 21% to $92 million. And finally, deferred revenue broke through that $700 million threshold for the first time ever to finish at $704 million, an increase of 19%. That was our best growth performance of the year. By virtually every financial measure, our fourth quarter was amazing. Equally important, we saw a continued improvement in our business for the second quarter in a row. That's why we're stepping it up and hiring heavily into next year. After a year of reduced investment levels, the time is now right to invest in our continued growth and leadership of the cloud computing market. Graham will have more to say about our outlook in a moment.Our amazing fourth quarter numbers are powered by another quarter of fantastic wins against our competitors. We had another huge quarter and a huge series of wins against Oracle, including: The Huntington National Bank, GE, Pfizer, KCI, Autodesk, BC and Aramark. And we won impressive business against Microsoft during the quarter, and many companies including Univision, Aspen Pharmaceutical, Cross National Bank, KONE, Ingenix and SageCom. And finally, we beat SAP at Schneider Electrics, SAS, Nobel Biocare Services, AG, Kimberly-Clark, Bridgestone Golf and Wolters Kluwer. These customers are coming to us because they want the most innovative products and services in the enterprise today. Not just the best products in the cloud, but the best products available, period. And they're coming in, in everly-increasing numbers. In the fourth quarter alone, we added roughly 4,600 net new customers to bring our full year customer community to roughly 72,500, an increase of 31% in our customers. In fact, for the full year, we added more than 17,000 net new customers. That's more customer addition than we recorded in our first six full years of being in business. Wow, that's amazing. All three for our primary services, Sales Cloud 2, Service Cloud 2 and Custom Cloud 2 reported record quarters in the fourth quarter. The multi-product success is key to our growth strategy. Five years ago, our growth was entirely driven by our flagship namesake sales force automation, Sales Cloud service. But today, we have three pillars of growth with the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud and the Custom Cloud, powered by our Force.com platform. We believe the growth opportunity for each of these businesses is massive over the next decade, and the Gartner Group agrees. Gartner estimates the CRM Market, including sales and service, to be roughly $16 billion, and the custom application of open market at more than $50 billion. In our launch of Chatter, the collaboration cloud, which is expected later this year, further expands our market opportunity by creating a fourth leg of growth. Essentially, every business of every size in every industry, with access to the Internet through any device, is now a prospect for our sales force. Our growth opportunity has never been more exciting at Salesforce.com and in cloud computing. As evidenced of our multi-product success, we delivered our most diverse quarter of new business ever with more than 30% of our new business coming from non-Salesforce automation services compared to 25% a year ago. That's a pretty amazing achievement when you consider that our core sales force automation, Sales Cloud business, continues to grow at a strong double-digit clip. In our flagship Sales Cloud 2, we notched some big wins this quarter including Nippon Express in Japan, GE Energy, Avaya, Cisco, MX Manpower [ph] and First Tennessee Bank National Association as well as Beckman Coulter. And just a year after its launch, the Service Cloud is on fire. And this killer app is clearly our next lever of growth. New business volume for the Service Cloud more than doubled from the year-ago quarter as did the volume of Service Cloud transactions.Customers need the next generation of customer service and support, customer portals and call center solutions, and Salesforce.com is ready to deliver this with Service Cloud 2. Customers realized that the call center of the '90s won't work in the age of social computing, and it is abundantly clear that our competitors in this space just can't keep up. Traditional customer service vendors still regard the web itself as foreign territory. And the Service Cloud 2 features the world's first real time knowledge base in the cloud built on our multi-tenant platform, Force.com; the world's first integration with social networks, like Facebook and Twitter; the world's first most customizable service applications available; and the world's best, most efficient agent console in the cloud as a service, all running on top of Force.com, the world's most trusted, reliable, secure and transparent cloud computing platform today. This is what makes Service Cloud 2 the spectacular success for the quarter, and why we believe that as we enter fiscal year '11, we are entering the year of the Service Cloud. That adds up to an unbeatable value proposition for the Service Cloud, the technology vision for tomorrow's contact centers and customer service organizations, backed by the scale and efficiency that only cloud computing and Salesforce.com can offer. Our huge list of Service Cloud wins in the fourth quarter include: The Huntington National Bank, Dun & Bradstreet, Bausch & Lomb, Wyndham Hotel Group, Wells Fargo Bank, FDL Financial, Allianz, and Chronopost. Look, while companies are poised to build for the future, they're not going to double down on the software mistakes of the past using old technology like Microsoft .NET. That's why the Force.com Custom Cloud is showing such fantastic results. Developing custom apps on Force.com is 5x faster and half the cost of traditional programs like .NET and Java according to a recent study completed by IDC and available on our website. The value proposition was behind several key Custom Cloud wins for the fourth quarter, including: Fast Retailing Co. of Japan, Pfizer, Sepracor, The Japan Research Institute, Avon, McGraw-Hill and Fairchild Semi, Wordzilla, Genentech and Honda, all now our Force.com customers building the next generation of applications of cloud computing, their custom apps, their private cloud apps on Force.com. And we're just getting started. During the quarter, we also announced the key addition to our platform with the addition of Force.com Visual Process Manager, which allows corporate IT to focus on innovation, not infrastructure, with point-and-click, very easy-to-use process design instead of low-level coding. Some of our key platform milestones in the fourth quarter included more than 19 million customizations now made by our customers that we're holding in our multi-tenant database. That's up more than 40% from a year ago. Nearly 150,000 custom applications, up from around roughly 100,000 last year, all on Force.com, more than 275 million lines of Force.com code, up 10-fold year-over-year. That's amazing, considering we are one of the very first multi-tenant virtual machines who are hosting our customer's code. We've also added more than 100,000 developers to our growing global developer community, a community that boasts more than 230,000 members. And our core transactions, the actual transactions that our customers are completing, whether it's the Sales Cloud, The Service Cloud, the Custom Cloud and soon with Chatter, well, those total transactions grew to 19 billion for the quarter. That's up to more than 46% versus a year ago. You know what, that growth and usage of our platform underscores in a key important point. We have built a service that customers just don't subscribe to, they use. With transactions growing even faster than subscriptions, it's clear that more customers are finding more ways of integrating us into their core operations on a daily basis. Our Sales Cloud, Service Cloud and Custom Clouds have been propelled by the widespread recognition that cloud computing is easy to use, has lower costs and produces faster results than traditional enterprise software. The reality is, that's the very premise that we started Salesforce.com on. It was just about 11 years ago when we asked ourselves the question, why is all enterprise software not as easy to use as Amazon.com? No software to buy, no hardware to buy, nothing to install or upgrade or maintain. You know, when companies like Microsoft, now 10 years later, which have the most to lose from the decline of software finally embrace cloud computing, you know there's no doubt in customer mind about where the future is headed. It's headed towards cloud computing. But you know what, the game is evolving again. And we believe the stakes are even higher this time, much, much higher. Back in 1999, we asked that simple question about Amazon.com. But today, the question has changed. The question is, why is all enterprise software not like Facebook? You know what, Facebook, you don't waste time searching for the right data going from app to app. The data finds you in real time. That's what customer's getting. Not from outdated collaboration applications like Microsoft SharePoint and Lotus Notes. Now, SharePoint is owned by a lot of businesses, used by far fewer and enjoyed practically by none. When was the last time everyone said they really loved using Microsoft SharePoint or Lotus Notes? The reality is, customers want to track their co-workers who matter to them, the most critical conversations, the apps they depend on, the contents they create and share, all using the new mobile devices that they're carrying around in their hand. And they want to collaborate without the cost, complexity, inflexibility and overall enterprise dead weight of enterprise software hardware and data centers. Look, that's the idea behind Salesforce Chatter, our first enterprise-wide application. And I'm excited to report that the next generation of enterprise collaboration has begun. Last week, we announced the private beta of 100 customers who are the first to get their hands on this game-changing technology. Reaction has been incredible. In fact, we encourage you to search Twitter for the hash tag, Salesforce, to get a sense of it. We believe that enterprises are more ready to cut their losses on failed collaboration apps like Lotus Notes and Microsoft SharePoint and join the conversation using cloud computing and Salesforce Chatter. Take a look at www.salesforce.com/chatter or go to YouTube and see the demonstrations of Salesforce Chatter. Just type Salesforce Chatter in the YouTube search box, and you'll see a demonstration of this exciting technology right now. So please join us as we take Chatter on the road in the coming months. We'll be in New York City for a major event on April 8. With that, let me hand the call over to Graham to discuss our amazing fourth quarter financial results."

Our fourth quarter was a great finish to a fiscal year that started with some uncertainty but it ended with superb execution in terms of new business, revenue and cash flow. The last 12 to 18 months tampered many company's business models",2440,"Thank you, Marc. Our fourth quarter was a great finish to a fiscal year that started with some uncertainty but it ended with superb execution in terms of new business, revenue and cash flow. The last 12 to 18 months tampered many company's business models, and yet Salesforce.com was able to deliver another outstanding year with record revenues, operating income and cash flow, our filed computing model was tested, and we passed, we believe, with flying colors. So fourth quarter revenue rose 22% from a year ago to roughly $354 million, strong e-business along with good, in-quarter linearity and lower attrition rates helped to drive this result.Our business continues to show strength across the board, with Europe and Asia slightly outpacing growth in the Americas. As a result, international revenues reached 31% of our total revenue. That's the highest level in our history. Let me briefly review revenue performance by region. In the Americas, Q4 revenue growth was 17% year-over-year, with roughly $244 million of revenue in the Americas this quarter. We are fast approaching an annual revenue run rate of more than $1 billion in that region alone. In Europe, fourth quarter revenue rose 33% from a year ago to $64 million, while a weaker dollar added 13 percentage points to this growth rate. Constant-currency growth was still a very solid 20%. And finally, Asia continues to be really strong. The baked deal activity we've been discussing in Japan throughout the past year contributed to Q4 revenue in Asia of $46 million. That's an increase of 42% from the year-ago quarter. In constant-currency terms, growth was 40%. Our Asian business alone now has an annual revenue run rate of almost $200 million. In total, foreign currency boosted our Q4 revenue growth rate by two percentage points.Turning next to gross margin, we set a new high watermark in the fourth quarter at almost 81%. Our mix of business continues to shift toward higher-margin Subscription business and away from professional services, which represented just 7.5% of revenue in Q4, that's down from 8.1% a year ago. For the full year, GAAP gross margin was 80.2%, that's an improvement of roughly 70 basis points from a year ago. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter, as a percentage of revenue, were roughly 74%, essentially flat from a year ago. For the full year, OpEx declined from roughly 74% of revenue to roughly 71%, reflecting the impact of our relatively-slow hiring during the year. Hiring in the fourth quarter was essentially the same as in Q3, with approximately 160 net new hires. After adding roughly 90 people in the first half of last year, we added more than 300 in the second half across all areas of the business. We exited the year with just under 4,000 employees.Given the huge, long-term opportunity we see for cloud computing, the improving IT spending environment and our strong execution, we plan to invest aggressively in fiscal 2011, with particular emphasis on sales hiring. This will have ramifications for our operating margin growth and operating cash flow, which I will discuss in due course. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 7.2%, it was down from Q3 but it's up 260 basis points from a year ago. Similar to last year, this sequential decline was in part of consequence of our Dreamforce event and also seasonally-high Q4 sales incentives payments. For the full year, our GAAP operating margin of 8.8% was up roughly 290 basis points from last year. This was the third year in a row that we've been able to grow operating margin by roughly 300 basis points. At the same time, as we are leveraging our operating model, revenues grow with a CAGR of 38% over the same three-year period from just under $500 million to more than $1.3 billion. Growth continues to be our number one priority, but we are also committed to continued margin expansion. Stock-based compensation amounted to approximately 7% of revenue for both Q4 and the full year. Our GAAP tax rate of 35% in Q4 was a bit lower than we expected entering the quarter. This was the result of a number of factors, including additional R&D, tax credits associated with the exercise of stock options. The net effects for the lower Q4 rate was to reduce our full year FY '10 GAAP tax rate to approximately 40%. Marc has already covered our EPS performance, I'll now move onto cash.Q4 operating cash flow was approximately $92 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year. Capital spending was a bit lower in Q4 than in past quarters at roughly $7 million, that's primarily due to a decline in leasehold improvement spending. And for the full fiscal year, operating cash flow has increased 18% to approximately $271 million and included approximately $19 million of increased tax payments as we transition to being a cash tax payer. This equated to just over $2.10 per share of operating cash flow. Capital spending decreased 12% for the full year to approximately $54 million. And then free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx, was approximately $217 million. That's an increase of 29%, and that's equated to almost $1.70 per share of free cash flow. We ended the year with total cash and marketable securities in excess of $1.7 billion, excluding the proceeds from our January debt offering, our net cash is now in excess of $1.25 billion or nearly $10 a share.Moving to the balance sheet. Similar to previous years, accounts receivable increased significantly in Q4, as we invoiced a large proportion of our renewals as well as a lot of new business. And ended the year just under $321 million with a DSO of 82 days, which is a two-day improvement over last year's number of 84 days. Deferred revenue finished the year at $704 million. In spite of a strengthening dollar, the fourth quarter sequential increase of almost $160 million was our biggest ever and deferred revenue is up 19% from a year ago. Off balance sheet back flow, or business that is contracted but not yet invoiced, finished the year at more than $1 billion. The combined total of this backlog and the on-balance sheet deferred revenue now totals more than $1.7 billion. On the new business front, we had a stronger growth quarter in two years for several reasons. First, Add-on and Upgrade business improved both sequentially and year-over-year. Add-on/upgrade represented more than half of all new business orders during the quarter. Second, our Service Comp business had yet another record quarter and continues to gain traction in the marketplace, together with our Custom Cloud business, as Marc mentioned, our non-Sales Cloud business has represented more than 30% of total new business in the fourth quarter. And then finally, although our average deal size was down slightly versus a year ago, we closed a lot more transactions in the quarter than we did a year ago.Turning to attrition, our dollar-attrition rate remains in the high teens. But we were encouraged to see the rate decline slightly for the second quarter in a row. Next, I'd like to discuss two important items that will affect next fiscal '11. First, as you know, we closed a $575-million convertible debt issuance in January. The notes, which were issued at par, are due in 2015. Interest is payable at a coupon rate of 0.75% annually, and the initial conversion rate is at a 25% premium, which equates to a stock price of approximately $85 per share. In connection with the issuance of the debt, the company entered into a convertible note hedge transaction that covered a number of shares of our common stock that are underlying the notes. Hedge transactions are designed but not guaranteed to reduce or eliminate the potential dilution arising upon conversion. At the same time, the company also entered into a transaction with a hedge count product involving the sale of warrants. The strike price of the warrant transactions is just under $120 per share, effectively raising the conversion price from $85 to this new level. The net proceeds from all of these transactions were approximately $500 million. In accounting for the debt in our fourth quarter results, the $575 million par value of the notes was allocated on our balance sheet to two places, liabilities and equity. The portion allocated to liabilities was based on an imputed market sort of non-convertible debt interest rate of approximately 5.9%. And the portion allocated to equity represents the value of the conversion feature today. So this allocation created a debt discount of approximately $125 million. And that is the difference you'll see between the $575 million par value and the $450 million liability on our balance sheet, and that debt discount of approximately $125 million is being amortized to interest expense over the five-year term of the notes. Our GAAP operating results will reflect the 5.9% imputed market interest rate to debt, which includes the coupon rate of 0.75%. And that brings me to the second item, which David mentioned in his opening remarks. Beginning in Q1, we will report our operating results in both GAAP and non-GAAP format. We decided to provide this additional disclosure for two primary reasons: First, we believe the supplemental information will prove useful to investors in which to consider the impact of certain non-cash items on the company's offering performance; and second, the great majority of our industry peers report non-GAAP operating results. And we believe this additional disclosure will enable a better comparison of our relative performance.Consequently, we plan to provide non-GAAP operating results beginning when we report first quarter results, and they will exclude the effects of the following items: Stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and the amortization of the convertible debt discount, which I just discussed, and that's also referred to often as non-cash interest expense. We will of course also exclude the tax consequences of these three items. And reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures provided in this call to their GAAP counterparts are available in the earnings release, which we issued earlier this afternoon.So before I discuss specific guidance for fiscal 2011, I do want to provide some context. Fiscal 2010 was the year of two halfs: In the first half, we responded to an uncertain IT spending environment by slowing our rate of investment, which we believe is quite the prudent thing to do; and the second half, the combination of improving IT spending plans together with better execution on our part so our attrition decline in new business return to a strong growth trajectory. Given these improving trends, we will continue to invest for growth in FY '11, particularly in sales. These investments will have an effect on our operating margin expansion and cash flow growth in the near term. We believe this trade-off is essential for us to extend our leadership position and is in the best long-term interest of our customers and our shareholders. The other significant practice affecting our fiscal 2011 guidance are interest income expense, foreign exchange rates and the non-controlling interest charge, sometimes referred to as minority interest. I'm just going to go through each of those one by one. First, as I mentioned a few moments ago, GAAP accounting rules require that we expense interest for our convertible debt liability at a market rate of approximately 5.9% instead of the 0.75% coupon rate. The resulting interest expense of approximately $27 million or roughly $0.12 of EPS will be a GAAP-interest expense in FY '11 and the next four years after that. Second, while we have more cash to invest, we believe our portfolio will yield approximately $6 million or roughly $0.03 of EPS less interest income in fiscal '11, as interest rates have generally contracted and a number of our high-yielding, longer-term investments have matured. Third, the dollar has strengthened by about 9% since we had our last conference call, which has a significant impact on our revenue and operating income. And then finally, because our Japanese subsidiary has been so successful in fiscal '10, its profitability in fiscal '11 will drive approximately a $9 million after-tax, non-controlling interest charge. And that's certainly higher than we thought it would be last year.Let me now offer our specific outlook starting with full fiscal year 2011. Given our strong fourth quarter finish, we're very pleased to be able to raise our full fiscal year 2011 revenue guidance to a range of 16% to 17% growth over our 2010 result, in spite of the stronger dollar. Given the aggressive investment I mentioned earlier, we're planning for operating margin expansion of roughly 125 to 150 basis points, and Marc and I certainly talked about that on our last call. The fact that we thought, certainly, margin expansion this year would be a little less than previous year. We think GAAP EPS for the full year will be in the range of $0.58 to $0.60 at this point. Non-GAAP EPS, we believe, it will be in the range of $1.25 to $1.27. The details for reconciling our GAAP and non-GAAP EPS estimates can be found in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon. Given our investment profile in FY '11, we expect operating cash flow to grow at a slightly lower rate than revenue. Turning to Q1, we are initiating the following guidance: Revenue is expected to be in the range of $365 million to $367 million; GAAP EPS, we expect in the range of $0.12 to $0.13; and non-GAAP EPS, we expect to be approximately $0.29 to $0.30. One final point on Q1. As we have discussed in the past, our recurring revenue business model, combined with a seasonally strong fourth quarter each year, leads to a spike in accounts receivable and deferred revenue at each year end. Similar to past experience, we expect Q1 deferred revenue to decline from Q4 and probably buy more in dollar terms than it did a year ago. We also expect strong Q1 cash flow to be partially offset by higher investment levels in Q1, the net effect being an operating cash result that is slightly up year-over-year.So to close, Q4 was an amazing finish to fiscal 2010. We're executing well, and we enter FY '11 with incredibly strong product offerings. There's never been a better time to be in cloud computing, and we believe no company's better positioned for growth in this market than Salesforce.com.  I look forward to describing our progress when we release our Q1 results in May. With that, let me turn the call back to the operator so we can take your questions."

So I'm very excited about that opportunity. And then we want to couple that with the distribution expansion. And we want to hire as many salespeople as we can to get out and reach customers all over the world, small, medium and large-sized customers in the U.S., in Asia and Europe. Still relative against our main competitors in the enterprise Oracle, ASP and Microsoft, our sales force is extremely small. And when we get in there, we're more likely to win because their technology is outdated. So we're trying to expand distribution, while at the same time, being mindful that our investors want us to have operating margin expense. And certainly this year, we delivered operating margin expansion. As Graham said, we're going for another 125 to 150 basis points of operating margin while also continuing to grow the top line. And we're very focused on that $2 billion revenue number. We're really going, gee, when are we going to get into that zone? It's only a year or two ago we're talking about a billion internally. All of our planning is around getting to that $2 billion number as fast as possible, and that's all about distribution."

Roughly, they had about four plus million users in production, and they said that more than half of that was in customer support. And it looks like Siebel's business peaked in the early 2000 time frame. I'm just curious what kind of legacy replacement cycle are you seeing for the heavy-duty, big iron, a big volume Siebel implementations? And more generally, maybe just broader legacy customer support systems and how big of an option do you think this could be for fiscal '11? And also, while you're at it, how should we think about the core sales force automation market, is it anywhere close to maturity or are you in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth innings of Salesforce automation?"

And the reason why is, is that Siebel was mostly a customer service and call center company. They didn't really have a successful SFA [Sales Force Automation] business, and they certainly didn't have a platform business. They had an ERM business or Employee-Relationship Management business, which mostly failed and the UAM [Unified Activity Management] business, which mostly failed. We haven't entered any new businesses that have failed, because we have one integrated offering. Our sales service and platform are all integrated services, as well as the collaboration. They all kind of are meshed together and make a synergistically make that a better technology overall. I think you'll find that when I do my demonstration tomorrow at the Goldman Sachs Conference in the morning and the Pacific Crest Keynote at lunch tomorrow on Thursday. You'll be seeing me demonstrate some new technologies that emphasize the enhanced competitiveness of both the sales technology, the Sales Cloud, the customer service call center, customer portal technology, the Service Cloud, when it's enhanced with Chatter and how those services are deeply integrated. We still see strong growth obviously by, you can see by these numbers in Salesforce automation, in customer service and support and also the platform. And we're all also entering the collaboration cloud. I've said this before and I still believe it, that this is mostly a distribution-constrained organization. And that we have the market opportunity and the products and the technology. And we need to expand our distribution rapidly to take advantage of the kind of very weak and poor execution by our competitors. And especially, when you look at companies like SAP, who kind of tried to hold the cloud computing industry back, they provide all this kind of fear, uncertainty and doubt, lack of vision. I mean its one of the key reasons I think that they've had such a big shake up there. I mean they've really become the anti-cloud in so many ways. So that's why I think customers are hungry for new technology, new solutions, lower cost, easier to use. Of course they want social, they want mobile, they want real time. And that, I think, is a huge refresh cycle on sales service, on all applications and especially collaboration. Especially when you look at Chatter against these really legacy products, like SharePoint and Lotus Notes. I mean Lotus Notes was conceived before Mark Zuckerberg was. I mean, come on."

When you look at the global data centers, a marketplace and how companies run and execute their products, we have almost 75,000 companies using Salesforce.com now. I asked Craig Mundee at the World Economic forum, I was sitting next to him. I said, if Salesforce.com did not exist, how many servers would have had in SQL servers and application servers and software and hardware data centers would have to bid bought and installed? How much energy would have to be consumed as a direct comparison to what we're doing. And he said, well yes, probably more than 100,000 servers would have had to be bought and consumed that all the energy and all the waste that goes with that. I mean, we have only a couple of thousands servers in our whole company and their PCs, and those are shared by those 75,000 customers. I mean, that's an incredible economy of scale. Then you take our software, which is the kind of the integration of the Sales Service platform and collaboration. That's kind of one piece of software. It gets integrated into that, into those couple of thousand PCs. And then we get just tremendous economies of scale and efficiency. And then you add onto that some of this great new technology. We've had tremendous success with Dell's new Nehalem technology. We had tried it in several of our servers over the weekend, and we saw massive, massive capability that we did not see before through a hardware change. It just was awesome, what is happening on the hardware side. It really emphasizes what a scam traditional enterprise software and hardware is. And also what a huge hog it is on kind of a world that is constrained by energy, having to install more of these servers and data centers. This is a time we need to break out. So I just think that when you look at the Service Cloud, we have a sales force who understands how to sell it. We have the data centers in place. We have the software ready to go. We just need the enlightenment from the customers that -- I'll give you an example, we have a customer that we recently sold and they are our U.K. customer, and they have two data centers for 500 call center agents. They have 500 servers in two data centers backed up doing DR [ph] against each other on the TEMS, running technology that they bought in 1995. That's right. So you look at that, and you go, this is just an opportunity for great efficiency, great enhancement. And the way our company is set up, we can deliver economies of scale because we essentially have one offering. And yes, we have different names for that offering, and they can morph and they change for each customer. But the Service Cloud 3, we're really ready to go. I guess I just tipped off the announcement for April 8. Well, anyway you got the idea that we're moving this product forward very, very rapidly."

Only if we saw some technology that could really make one of those clouds that were in better, more differentiated, grow faster, expand our distribution, would we start to look at something. At the same time, we're going to be very, very, very conservative in doing that because everything is working so well here. That's why what you've seen us do is a lot of very, very small deals. Our most recent one was with this company called GroupSwim, which was this kind of intelligence on -- it's a future version of Chatter that's coming farther down the road. That'll be smarter, about how you get your feeds and become really intelligent. We're to using Chatter now internally at Salesforce, and it's amazing. I think, fundamentally changing our work. If you're with a Salesforce.com employee, have them show you what it looks like in production. It's really spectacular. I'll be showing it off tomorrow at the two conferences that I'll be speaking at. So when we go to look at M&A, look, we're really going to mostly just focus on the strategy that we have, and it's working. Because that seems like our best opportunity.

And that's because I think this year, we feel we're back in high-growth mode. We've got huge opportunity, and we want to be at a higher salespeople.

Our fourth quarter caps off the biggest year in Salesforce.com’s history and I am delighted to be able to share with you today our outstanding results. While most software companies are still trying to forget the past year, our fiscal 2010 was perhaps our most memorable and exciting year ever and some of the highlights from our full year included $1.3 billion in revenue, the first enterprise cloud computing company ever to reach this scale; revenue growth of more than 20%, the fastest growth of any comparably sized software company in the world.</TAG>
While most of the software companies went backwards last year, Salesforce.com went forward in a dramatic way, and more than a quarter of a billion dollars in operating cash flow and a balance sheet with more than $1.7 billion in cash and equivalents and more than 72,000 customers globally including an amazing 17,000 net new customers joining our ranks in the fiscal year, this represents a 31% year-over-year increase in our customer base, more than 2 million subscribers including more than 500,000 net additions during the year, an increase of roughly 35% year-over-year. And we closed the year by hosting the biggest cloud computing event ever Dreamforce 2009 in December. It was an simply an amazing year.</TAG>
We closed the year by delivering the biggest financial quarter in our history. Fourth quarter revenue rose 22% to $354 million. At this level, we have broken through yet another huge milestone, the $1.4 billion annual revenue run rate. Fourth quarter growth of 22% was our best performance in more than a year. GAAP EPS of $0.16 increased from $0.11 a year ago; that’s an increase of more than 40% and more EPS in a single quarter than we achieved in all of fiscal year 2008.
Cash from operations increased 21% to $92 million and finally, deferred revenue broke through that $700 million threshold for the first time ever to finish at $704 million, an increase of 19%. That was our best growth performance of the year.</TAG>
By virtually every financial measure, our fourth quarter was amazing. Equally important, we saw continued improvement in our business for the second quarter in a row. That’s why we are stepping it up and hiring heavily into next year. After a year of reduced investment levels, the time has now ripe to invest in our continued growth and leadership of the cloud computing market. Graham will have more to say about our outlook in a moment.
Our amazing fourth quarter numbers were powered by another quarter of fantastic wins against our competitors. We had another huge quarter and a huge series of wins against Oracle including the Huntington National Bank, GE, Pfizer, KCI, Autodesk, BT and Aramark and we won impressive business against Microsoft during the quarter at many companies including Univision, Aspen Pharmaceutical, Cross National Bank, Cuna, Ingenix and SageCom, and finally we beat SAP at Schneider Electric, SAS, Noble Biocare Services AG, Kimberly-Clark, Bridgestone Golf and Wolters Kluwer.
These customers are coming to us because they want the most innovative products and services and in the enterprise today. Not just the best products in the cloud but the best products available period and they are coming in in ever increasing numbers. In the fourth quarter alone we added roughly 4,600 net new customers to bring our full year customer community to roughly 72,500, an increase of 31% in our customers.
In fact for the full year, we added more than 17,000 net new customers; that’s more customer additions than we recorded in our first six full years of being in business. Wow, that’s amazing. All three of our primary services Sales Cloud 2, Service Cloud 2, and Custom Cloud 2 reported record quarters in the fourth quarter. The multi-product success is key to our growth strategy. Five years ago our growth was entirely driven by our flagship namesake Sales Force Automation Sales Cloud Service. But today we have three pillars of growth with the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud and the Custom Cloud powered by our Force.com platform.
We believe the growth opportunity for each of these businesses is massive over the next decade and the Gartner Group agrees. Gartner estimates the CRM market including sales and service to be roughly $16 billion and the custom application of open market at more than $50 billion. And our launch of Chatter, the collaboration cloud which is expected later this year further expands our market opportunity by creating a fourth leg of growth. Essentially every business of every size in every industry with access to the internet through any device is now a prospect for our sales force. Our growth opportunity has never been more exciting at Salesforce.com and in cloud computing.
As evidence of our multi-product success, we delivered our most diverse quarter of new business ever with more than 30% of our new business coming from non Sales Force Automation services compared to 25% a year ago. That’s a pretty amazing achievement when you consider that our core Sales Force Automation, Sales Cloud business continues to grow at a strong double-digit clip. In our flagship Sales Cloud 2, we knocked some wins this quarter including Nippon Express in Japan, G-Energy, Avaya, Cisco, Amex, Manpower and First Tennessee Bank National Association as well as Beckman Coulter. And just a year after its launch, the Service Cloud is on fire and this killer app is clearly our next lever of growth.
New business volume for the Service Cloud more than doubled from the year ago quarter, as did the volume of Service Cloud transactions. Customers need the next generation of customer service and support, customer portals and call center solutions and Salesforce.com is ready to deliver this with Service Cloud 2.</TAG>
Customers realize that the call center of the ‘90s won’t work in the age of social computing and it is abundantly clear that our competitors in this space just can’t keep up. Traditional customer service vendors still regard the web itself as foreign territory and the Service Cloud 2 features the world’s first real time knowledge base in the cloud built on our multi-tenant platform Force.com. The world’s first integration with social networks like Facebook and Twitter, the world’s first most customizable service applications available and the world’s best most efficient agent console in the cloud as a service all running on top of Force.com, the world’s most trusted, reliable, secure and transparent cloud computing platform today.</TAG>
This is what makes Service Cloud 2 the spectacular success for the quarter and why we believe that as we enter fiscal year ‘11, we are entering the year of the Service Cloud. That adds up to an unbeatable value proposition for the Service Cloud, the technology vision for tomorrow’s contact centers and customer service organizations backed by the scale and efficiency that only cloud computing and Salesforce.com can offer.
Our huge list of Service Cloud wins in the fourth quarter include the Huntington National Bank, Dun & Bradstreet, Bausch & Lomb, Wyndham Hotel Group, Wells Fargo Bank, FBL Financial, Allianz and Chronopost. Look, while companies are poised to build for the future they are not going to double down on the software mistakes of the past using old technology like Microsoft .NET. That’s why the Force.com Custom Cloud is showing such fantastic results. Developing custom apps on Force.com is five times faster and half the cost of traditional programs like .NET and Java, according to a recent study completed by IDC and available on our website.
The value proposition was behind several key Custom Cloud wins for the fourth quarter including Fast Retailing Company of Japan, Pfizer, Sepracor, the Japan Research Institute, Avon, McGraw-Hill and Fairchild Semis, [Worzella], Genentech and Honda all now are Force.com customers building the next generation of applications of cloud computing, their custom apps, their private cloud apps on Force.com and we are just getting started. During the quarter we also announced the key addition to our platform with the addition of Force.com Visual Process Manager, which allows corporate IT to focus on innovation not infrastructure with point-and-click, very easy to use, process design instead of low level coding.
Some of our key platform milestones in the fourth quarter included more than 19 million customizations now made by our customers, they were holding in our multitenant database. That’s up more than 40% from a year ago; nearly a 150,000 custom applications, up from roughly a 100,000 last year, all on Force.com; more than 275 million lines of Force.com code, up tenfold year-over-year. That’s amazing considering we are one of the very first multitenant virtual machines for hosting our customers’ code. We have also added more than a 100,000 developers to our growing global developer community, a community that boasts more than 230,000 members.
Our core transactions, the actual transactions that our customers are completing whether it’s the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the Custom Cloud and soon with Chatter, well, those total transactions grew to 19 billion for the quarter; that’s up to more than 46% versus a year ago. You know what? That growth in usage of our platform underscores a key important point. We have built a service that customers just don’t subscribe to, they use. With transactions growing even faster than subscriptions, it’s clear that more customers are finding more ways of integrating us into their core operations on a daily basis. Our Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Custom Clouds have been propelled by the widespread recognition that cloud computing is easy to use, has lower cost and produces fast results than traditional enterprise software.
The reality is that’s the very premise that we started Salesforce.com on. It was just about 11 years ago when we asked ourselves the question why is all enterprise software not as easy to use as Amazon.com. No software to buy, no hardware to buy, nothing to install or upgrade or maintain. When companies like Microsoft now 10 years later, which have the most to lose from the declined software finally embrace cloud computing, you know there is no doubt in customer mind about where the future is headed, it’s headed towards cloud computing.
But you know what, the game is evolving again and we believe the stakes are even higher this time much, much higher. Back in 1999 we asked that simple question about Amazon.com, but today the question has changed. The question is why is all enterprise software not like Facebook. On Facebook you don’t waste time searching for the right data going from app to app, the data finds you in real time. That’s what customer is getting, not from outdated collaboration applications like Microsoft Sharepoint and Lotus Notes.</TAG>
Sharepoint is owned by a lot of businesses, used by far fewer, and enjoyed practically by none. When was the last time everyone said they really loved using Microsoft Sharepoint or Lotus Notes? The reality is customers want to attract their coworkers who matter to them, the most critical conversations, the apps they depend on, the concept they create and share, all using the new mobile devices that they are carrying around in their hand. They want to collaborate without the cost, complexity and flexibility and overall enterprise dead weight of enterprise software, hardware and data centers.</TAG>
Look, that’s the idea behind Salesforce Chatter, our first enterprise wide application and I am excited, of course, that the next generation of enterprise collaboration has begun. Last week we announced a private [meet] of a 100 customers who are the first to get their hands on this game changing technology. Reaction has been incredible. In fact, we encourage you to search Twitter for the hash tag Salesforce to get a sense of it. We believe that enterprises are more ready to cut their losses on sales collaboration apps like Lotus Notes and Microsoft SharePoint and join the conversation using cloud computing and Salesforce Chatter.
Take a look at www.salesforce.com/chatter or go to YouTube and see the demonstrations of Salesforce Chatter, just type Salesforce Chatter in the YouTube search box and you will see a demonstration of this exciting technology right now. So please join us as we take Chatter on the road in the coming months. We will be in New York City for a major event on April 8.</TAG>
With that, let me hand the call over to Graham to discuss our amazing fourth quarter financial results.

Our fourth quarter was a great finish to a fiscal year that started with some uncertainty but that ended with superb execution in terms of new business, revenue and cash flow. The last 12 to 18 months tested many companies’ business models and yet Salesforce.com was able to deliver another outstanding year with record revenues, operating income and cash flow. Our cloud computing was tested and we passed we believe with flying colors.
So fourth quarter revenue rose 22% from a year ago to roughly $354 million; strong new business along with good in-quarter linearity and lower attrition rates helped to drive this result.
Our business continues to show strength across the board with Europe and Asia slightly outpacing growth than the Americas. As a result, international revenues reached 31% of our total revenue; that’s the highest level in our history.</TAG>
Let me briefly review revenue performance by region. In the Americas Q4 revenue growth was 17% year-over-year with roughly $244 million of revenue. In the Americas this quarter we are fast approaching an annual revenue run rate of more than $1 billion in that region alone. In Europe, fourth quarter revenue rose 33% from a year ago to $64 million while a weaker dollar added 13 percentage points to this growth rate, constant currency growth was still a very solid 20%.</TAG>
Finally, Asia continues to be really strong. The big deal activity we have been discussing in Japan throughout the past year contributed to Q4 revenue in Asia of $46 million; that’s an increase of 42% from the year ago quarter. In constant currency terms growth was 40%. Our Asian business alone now has an annual revenue run rate of almost $200 million. In total foreign currency boosted our Q4 revenue growth rate by 2 percentage points.</TAG>
Turning next to gross margin. We set a new high watermark in the fourth quarter at almost 81%. Our mix of business continues to shift toward higher margin subscription business and away from professional services, which represented just 7.5% of revenue in Q4; that’s down from 8.1% a year ago. For the full year, GAAP gross margin was 80.2%; that’s an improvement of roughly 70 basis points from a year ago.</TAG>
Operating expenses in the fourth quarter as percentage of revenue were roughly 74%, essentially flat from a year ago. For the full year, OpEx declined from roughly 74% of revenue to roughly 71%, reflecting the impact of our relatively slow hiring during the year.</TAG>
Hiring in the fourth quarter was essentially the same as in Q3 with approximately a 160 net new hired. After adding roughly 90 people in the first half of last year, we added more than 300 in the second half across all areas of the business. We exit the year with just under 4,000 employees. Given the huge long-term opportunity we see for cloud computing, the improving IT spending environment, and our strong execution, we plan to invest aggressively in fiscal 2011 with particular emphasis on sales and hiring. This will have ramifications for our operating margin growth and operating cash flow, which I will discuss in due course.</TAG>
GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 7.2%; that was down from Q3 but it’s up 260 basis points from a year ago. Similar to last year that sequential decline was in part a consequence of our Dreamforce event and also seasonally high Q4 sales incentive payments. For the full year, our GAAP operating margin of 8.8% was up roughly 290 basis points from last year. This was the third year in a row that we have been able to grow operating margin by roughly 300 basis points.</TAG>
At the same time as we are leveraging our operating model, revenue has grown with a CAGR of 38% over the same three year period from just under $500 million to more than $1.3 billion. Growth continues to be our number one priority but we are also committed to continued margin expansion. Stock-based compensation amounted to approximately 7% of revenue for both Q4 and the full year.
Our GAAP tax rate of 35% in Q4 was a bit lower than we expected entering the quarter. This was the result of a number of factors including additional R&D tax credits associated with the exercise of stock options. The net affect of the lower Q4 rate was to reduce our full year FY ‘10 GAAP tax rate to approximately 40%.</TAG>
As Marc has already covered our EPS performance, I will now move on to cash.</TAG>
Q4 operating cash flow was approximately $92 million; that’s an increase of 21% year-over-year. Capital spending was a bit lower in Q4 than in past quarters at roughly $7 million; that’s primarily due to a decline in leasehold improvement spending. For the full fiscal year, operating cash flow increased 18% to approximately $271 million and included approximately $19 million of increased tax payments as we transitioned to being a cash taxpayer. This equated to just over $2.10 per share of operating cash flow.
Capital spending decreased 12% for the full-year to approximately $54 million and then free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx, was approximately $217 million; that’s an increase of 29% and that’s equated to almost $1.70 per share of free cash flow. We ended the year with total cash and marketable securities in excess of $1.7 billion. Excluding the proceeds from our January debt offering, our net cash is now in excess of $1.25 billion or nearly $10 per share.</TAG>
Moving to the balance sheet. Similar to previous year, accounts receivable increased significantly in Q4 as we invoiced a large proportion of our renewals as well as a lot of new business and ended the year just under $321 million with a DSO of 82 days, which is a two-day improvement over the last year’s number of 84 days.
Deferred revenue finished the year at $704 million and despite of a strengthening dollar, the fourth quarter sequential increase of almost a $160 million was our biggest ever, and deferred revenue was up 19% from a year ago. Off balance sheet backlog or business that is contracted but not yet invoiced finished the year at more than $1 billion. The combined total of this backlog and the on-balance sheet deferred revenue now totals more than $1.7 billion.</TAG>
On the new business front, we had our strongest growth quarter in two years for several reasons; first, add-on and upgrade business improved both sequentially and year-over-year. Add-on upgrade represented more than a half of all new business orders during the quarter; second, a service comp business had yet another record quarter and continued to gain traction in the marketplace together with our Custom Cloud business, as Marc mentioned, our non Sales Cloud businesses represented more than 30% of total new business in the fourth quarter. And then finally although our average deal size was down slightly versus a year ago, we closed a lot more transactions in the quarter than we did a year ago.
Turning to attrition, our dollar attrition rate remained in the high teens but we were encouraged to see the rate decline slightly for the second quarter in a row.</TAG>
Next I would like to discuss two important items that will affect next fiscal year, fiscal ‘11. First, as you know, we closed a $575 million convertible debt issuance in January. The notes, which were issued at par, are due in 2015. Interest is payable at a coupon rate of 0.75% annually and the initial conversion rate is at a 25% premium, which equates to a stock price of approximately $85 per share.
In connection with the issuance of the debt, the company entered into a convertible note hedge transaction that covers the number of shares of our common stock that are underlying the notes. Hedge transactions are designed but not guaranteed to reduce or eliminate the potential dilution arising upon conversion. At the same time the company also entered into a transaction with the hedge counterparties involved in the sale of warrants. The strike price of the warrant transactions is just under $120 per share, effectively raising the conversion price from $85 to this new level. The net proceeds from all of these transactions were approximately $500 million.
In accounting for the debt in our fourth quarter results, the $575 million par value of the notes was allocated on our balance sheet to two places, liabilities and equity. The portion allocated to liabilities was based on an imputed market sort of non-convertible debt interest rate of approximately 5.9% and the portion allocated to equity represents the value of the conversion feature of the day.
So this allocation created a debt discount of approximately $125 million and that is the difference you will see between the $575 million par value and the $450 million liability on our balance sheet. And that debt discount of approximately $125 million is being amortized to interest expense over the five-year term of the notes.</TAG>
Our GAAP operating results will reflect the 5.9% imputed market interest rate for debt which includes the coupon rate of 0.75%. And that brings me to the second item, which David mentioned in his opening remarks beginning in Q1, we will report our operating results in both GAAP and non-GAAP format. We decided to provide this additional disclosure for two primary reasons. First, we believe the supplemental information will prove useful to investors who wish to consider the impact of certain non-cash items on the company’s operating performance and second, the great majority of our industry peers report non-GAAP operating results and we believe this additional disclosure will enable a better comparison of our relative performance.
Consequently, we plan to provide non-GAAP operating results beginning when we report first quarter results and they will exclude the effects of the following items: stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and the amortization of the convertible debt discount, which I just discussed and that’s also referred to often as non-cash interest expense. We will, of course, also exclude the tax consequences of these three items. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures provided in this call to the GAAP counterparts are available in the earnings release, which we issued earlier this afternoon.</TAG>
So before I discuss specific guidance for fiscal 2011, I do want to provide some context.
Fiscal 2010 was a year of two halves; in the first half we responded to an uncertain IT spending environment by slowing our rate of investment, which we believe was quite a prudent thing to do; in the second half, the combination of improving IT spending patterns (inaudible) better execution on our part for attrition decline in new business return to a strong growth trajectory. Given these improving trends, we will continue to invest for growth in FY ‘11 particularly in sales. These investments will have an effect on our operating margin expansion and cash flow growth in the near-term. We believe this trade off is essential for us to extend our leadership position and is in the best long-term interests of our customers and our shareholders.</TAG>
The other significant factors affecting our fiscal 2011 guidance, interest income and expense, foreign exchange rates and the non-controlling interest charge, sometimes referred to as minority interests. I am just going to go through each of those one by one.</TAG>
First, as I mentioned a few moments ago, GAAP accounting rules require that we expense interests for our convertible debt liability at a market rate of approximately 5.9% instead of the 0.75% coupon rate. The resulting interest expense of approximately $27 million or roughly $0.12 of the EPS will be a GAAP interest expense in FY ‘11 and the next four years after that.</TAG>
Second, while we have more cash to invest, we believe our portfolio will yield approximately $6 million or roughly $0.03 of EPS, less interest income in fiscal ‘11 as interest rates have generally contracted in a number of our high yielding longer term investments have matured.</TAG>
Third, the dollar has strengthened by about 9% since we had our last conference call, which has a significant impact on our revenue and operating income. And then finally because our Japanese subsidiary has been so successful in fiscal ‘10, its profitability in fiscal 11 will drive approximately a $9 million off the tax non-controlling interest charge. That’s certainly higher than we thought it would be last year.
Let me now offer our specific outlook starting with full fiscal year 2011. Given our strong fourth quarter finish, we are very pleased to be able to raise our full fiscal year 2011 revenue guidance to a range of 16% to 17% growth over our 2010 result in spite of the stronger dollar. Given the aggressive investment I mentioned earlier, we are planning for operating margin expansion of roughly a 125 to 150 basis points and Marc and I certainly talked about that on our last call; the fact that we talked certainly margin expansion this year would be a little less than previous year.
We think GAAP EPS for the full year will be in the range of $0.58 to $0.60 at this point. Non-GAAP EPS, we believe it will be in the range of $1.25 to $1.27. The details for reconciling on GAAP and non-GAAP EPS estimates can be found in our earnings press release issued earlier this afternoon. Given our investment profile in FY ‘11, we expect operating cash flow to grow at a slightly lower rate than revenue.</TAG>
Turning to Q1, we are initiating the following guidance. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $365 million to $367 million; GAAP EPS, we expect in the range of $0.12 to $0.13; and non-GAAP EPS, we expect to be in approximately $0.29 to $0.30. Just to remind you details of our GAAP, I am sure we said that.</TAG>
I will move on. One final point on Q1. As we have discussed in the past, our recurring revenue business model combined with a seasonally strong fourth quarter each year leads to a spike in accounts receivable and deferred revenue each year end. Similar to past experience, we expect Q1 deferred revenue to decline from Q4 and probably by more in dollar terms than it did a year ago.
We also expect strong Q1 cash flow to be partially offset by higher investment levels in Q1, the net effect being an operating cash result that is slightly up year-over-year.</TAG>
So to close, Q4 was an amazing finish to fiscal 2010. We are executing well and we enter FY ‘11 with incredibly strong product offerings. There has never been a better time to be in cloud computing and we believe no company is better positioned for growth in this market than Salesforce.com. I look forward to describing our progress when we release our Q1 results in May.
With that, let me turn the call back to the operator so we can take your questions.

It’s led by a spectacular executive inside the company and that we have more to announce on April 8 in New York around the Service Cloud and I will invite you to that presentation now, Heather.

I don’t know if you saw on YouTube last week we put a kind of a preview of what’s coming in April 8 with the next version of Service Cloud integrated with Chatter, but that’s up on YouTube and I think that when you see that you realize we are really on our way to a huge breakthrough in terms of what we can do for customers, in terms of productivity.</TAG>
So I am very excited about that opportunity and then we want to couple that with the distribution expansion and we want to hire as many sales people as we can to get out and reach customers all over the world small, medium and large sized customers in the U.S., in Asia, and Europe, still relative against our main competitors that in the enterprise, Oracle, SAP and Microsoft. Our sales force is extremely small and when we get in there we are more likely to win because their technology is outdated.</TAG>
So we are trying to expand distribution while at the same time being mindful that our investors want us to have operating margin expansion. Certainly this year we delivered operating margin expansion. As Graham said, we are going for another 125 to 150 basis points of operating margin while also continuing to grow the top line and we are very focused on that $2 billion revenue number. We are really going, “Gee, you know, when are we going to get into that zone?” It’s only a year or two ago we were talking about a billion internally. All of our planning is around getting to that $2 billion number as fast as possible and that’s all about distribution.

I think if you remember we have talked in the past about a lot of our business and field sales in the enterprise happening in the fourth quarter and so we tend to get a natural little boost in add-on upgrade in the fourth quarter. So I wouldn’t characterize it as unusual for the fourth quarter but it was very heartening to see it return to that level whereas if you remember earlier in the year there was no - certainly that number was down pretty significantly.
So I think all those things that Marc talked about with the Service Cloud, we are seeing a lot of follow-on business there in existing accounts that’s definitely helping. I think that’s probably as much as we want to say in terms detail around that. On billings growth or the billings growth number that you guys calculate, we don’t provide guidance around that and I have given you obviously revenue estimates for Q1 and I have given you what at least directional belief is in terms of deferred revenue for Q1 and I think obviously you can do the math from there.

In terms of a ship that went through a difficult storm, we came out the other side with no damage. 
So I am extremely optimistic about that because if anything was going to injure us, it’s kind of what we would have just gone through and because we didn’t see that we feel good.

They didn’t really have a successful SSA business and they certainly didn’t have a platform business. They had an ERM business, employee relationship management business, which mostly failed and the UAM business, which mostly failed. 
We haven’t entered any new businesses that have failed because we have one integrated offering, our sales, service, and platform are all integrated services as well as the collaboration; they all are kind of are meshed together and synergistically make a better technology overall. I think you will find that when I do my demonstration tomorrow at the Goldman Sachs Conference in the morning and the Pacific Crest keynote at lunch tomorrow on Thursday.
You will be seeing me demonstrate some new technologies that emphasize the enhanced competitiveness of both the sales technology, the Sales Cloud, the customer service call center, customer portal technology, the Service Cloud, when it’s enhanced with Chatter and how those services are deeply integrated. 
We still see strong growth obviously you can see by these numbers in Sales Force Automation, in customer service and support and also the platform and we are also entering the collaboration cloud. I have said this before and I still believe it that this is mostly a distribution constrained organization and that we have the market opportunity and the product and the technology and we need to expand our distribution rapidly to take advantage of the kind of very week and poor execution by our competitors, especially when you look at companies like SAP who kind of try to hold the cloud computing industry back. They give - provide all this kind of fear, uncertainty about lack of vision. I mean it’s one of the key reasons I think that they have such a big shake up there. I mean they have really become the anti-cloud in so many ways. 
So that’s why I think customers are hungry for new technology, new solutions, lower cost, easier to use. Of course, they want social, they want mobile, they want real time. And that I think is a huge refresh cycle on sales, service, on all applications and especially collaboration, especially when you look at Chatter against these really legacy products like Sharepoint and Lotus Notes; I mean Lotus Notes was conceived before Mark Zuckerberg was, I mean, come on. 
I was just going to mention Kash, that don’t forget if you look at the 4 million subscribers with Siebel, they didn’t have a significant SMB presence. So a lot of about 2 million subscribers that we have are in that market that Siebel never got to. So we definitely view this being a huge long-term opportunity ahead of us, Kash.

When you look at the global data centers, marketplace and how companies run and execute their products, we have almost 75,000 companies using Salesforce.com now. I asked Craig Mundie at the World Economic Forum, I was sitting next to him. I said, “You know, if Salesforce.com did not exist, how many servers would have had in SQL servers and application servers and software and hardware and data centers would have to been bought and installed, how much energy would have had to be consumed as a direct comparison to what we are doing?” And he said, “Well, yes, probably more than a 100,000 servers would have had to be bought and consumed and all the energy and all the waste that goes with that.” 
I mean we have only a couple thousand servers in our whole company, they are PCs and those are shared by those 75,000 customers, I mean that’s an incredible economy of scale. 
When you take our software, which is the kind of the integration of the sales service platform and collaboration, it’s kind of one piece of software. It gets integrated into those couple thousand PCs and then we get just tremendous economies of scale and efficiency and then you add on to that some of this great new technology. We have had tremendous success with the with Dell’s new Nehalem technology. We had tried it in several of our servers over the weekend and we saw massive capability that we did not see before and through a hardware change, that just was awesome what is happening on the hardware side.
It really emphasizes what a scam traditional enterprise software and hardware is and also what a huge hog it is on kind of world that is constrained by energy, having to install more of these servers and data centers. This is the time we need to break out. So I just think that when you look at the Service Cloud, we have a sales force to understand how to sell it, we have the data centers in place, we have the software ready to go. We just need the enlightenment from the customers that, I will give you an example. 
We have a customer that we recently sold and they are U.K. customer, they have two data centers. For 500 call center agents, they had 500 servers in two data centers backed up doing DR against each on the (inaudible), running technology that they bought in 1995, that’s right.
So you look at that and you go, this is just an opportunity for a great efficiency, great enhancement and the way our company is set up, we can deliver economies to scale because we essentially have one offering. And yes, we have different names for that offering and it can more often it can change for each customer but the Service Cloud 3 we are really ready to go. 
I guess I just tipped off the announcement for April 8, well, anyway you get the idea that we are moving this product forward very, very rapidly.

And we are going to continue to focus on our fundamental core, I would call it organic growth, I mean this is a company that is just growing organically only if we saw some technology that could really make one of those clouds that were in better, more differentiated, grow faster, expand our distribution, when we start to look at something. At the same time, we are going to be very, very conservative in doing that because everything is working so well here. 
That’s why what you have seen us do is a lot of very, very small deals. Our most recent one was with this company called Group Swim, which was this kind of intelligence on - it’s a future version of Chatter that’s coming farther down the road. That will be smarter about how you get your feeds and become really intelligent. 
We are already using Chatter now internally at Salesforce and it’s amazing. I mean it’s I think fundamentally changing our work. If you are with the Salesforce.com employee, have them show you what it looks like in production. It’s really spectacular. I will be showing it off tomorrow at the two conferences that I will be speaking at.
So when we go to look at M&A, look, we are really going to mostly just focus on the strategy that we have and that’s working because that seems like our best opportunity. We want to be opportunistic but the reality is at the same time, we don’t want to feel rushed to do anything but boy, it’s great to have $1.7 billion in cash, so that if there ever was a situation we could act if we had to.

Graham, question on the margin guidance for fiscal 2011. (Inaudible) of the other SaaS firms that had more muted margin guidance have cited the fact that the recent bookings surge in the last couple of quarters creates natural accounting driven margin pressure going forward as you need to expense a number of costs and obviously defer revenue recognition. I’m curious, does Salesforce.com have to absorb that and is that baked into your operating margin guidance? Thanks.

But I don’t think - I mean that’s only part of the equation. I think what I said earlier about the margin expansion that we have done three years, we have successfully come close and demonstrated 300 basis points a year. I think this year we signaled early that we would probably not be expecting to quite be at that rate. 
That’s because I think this year we feel we’re back in high growth mode, we have got huge opportunity and we want to be able to hire sales people and you know there is obviously a delay between you a hire sales person takes a while to be productive, then they get bookings, then they finally that turns into revenues. So there is sort of lag in the expense versus the revenue.
And then, because of Chatter and all these new products we are coming out with, we just got a lot of opportunity I think to really build market presence. So I think that we want to be able to have the flexibility to invest in all those things this year.

If we had our way, we would just double, triple, quadruple distribution because we see that kind of opportunity out there.

If you look at the numbers over the last several years, they are really spectacular while heading towards this $2 billion number.

We're excited to be hosting today's call this morning from our offices on the 39th floor of Roppongi Tower here in Tokyo. Japanese have been pioneers in cloud computing and leaders in many key areas in cloud computing, including 3G and social networking, as well as e-commerce. And our Japanese business unit continues to turn in amazing results quarter-after-quarter. Currently, Japan is our second largest market outside of the United States.
I spent the better part of May here in Japan talking to customers, speaking at Ministry events and even have the opportunity to meet with the Minister of Technology. And I also, yesterday, met with the Prime Minister of Japan, and fundamentally, to discuss one thing, that cloud computing is a tremendous accelerator for the economics and businesses of Japan. And I believe this is even more strong than ever before after spending this extended period here in Tokyo.
Our first quarter was a terrific kick off to 2011 on virtually every front. Our business is gaining momentum globally. On the customer front, a record 4,800 net new customers contributed towards our fastest business growth in more than two years. On the technology front, we're positioned to create much higher levels of customer success with the coming additions of incredible new technology, including: Salesforce Chatter, our enterprise collaboration service; Salesforce Jigsaw, the leader in crowdsourced data services, the emergence of the data cloud; and VMforce, the world's first Java cloud. So in these three critical new areas, the collaboration cloud, the data cloud and the Java cloud, Salesforce.com is really defining the very next level of our growth and technology capability for our customers.
And finally on the financial front, we delivered another spectacular quarter. Let me begin with some of the financial highlights for the quarter. Revenue increased by 24% from a year ago to $377 million. Well, that was our best growth performance in five quarters. And even more incredibly, we're delivering this growth as we pushed through the $1.5 billion annual revenue run rate threshold, that is really amazing, and starts to focus us very acutely and clearly on that elusive and very important $2 billion annual revenue milestone.
While our GAAP EPS of $0.13 was down a bit from last year due primarily to the imputed interest on our convertible note, our non-GAAP EPS rose to $0.30 from $0.28 to a year ago. We're committed to growing profit, even as we increase our investments in top line growth. But by far, most exciting financial achievement in the quarter was our record cash generation. Until now, we've never eclipsed the $100 million threshold for operating cash flow. However, not only did we break through that threshold in the first quarter, we absolutely obliterated that milestone. 
Cash from operations totaled more than $140 million in the quarter, an increase of more than 40% from a year ago, and this translates into more than $1 per share of operating cash flow in a single quarter, roughly the same we earned in the entire first half of our last fiscal year ago. Nothing speaks more to the operating strength and quality of our business than our continued strong cash generation.
Our financial success was powered by another quarter of incredible customer success. In fact, we delivered our biggest new business growth quarter since our amazing fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, and our 4,800 net customer additions was an all-time high for the company. Simply put, demand for Salesforce.com services has never been better worldwide. 
And as we continue to achieve this success by beating the biggest, most important software companies in the world, I guess to Oracle, this quarter, we won significant new or add-on business at Informatica, Sony Ericsson, Symantec, MasterCard, GE Australia, Motorola. Here in Japan, we've beat them at Canon and Fujitsu, two of the most important companies in the country, Pitney Bowes, ASA and Waste Management. And against an unnamed patent troll, we won business at Abbott Labs, Mercury Insurance, Ingram Micro, Austin Ventures and Salient Surgical. And finally, while SAP struggles to redefine itself, we won business against them at Häagen-Dazs, Carestream and NVIDIA. 
In total, across all of our businesses, we've added roughly 18,000 net new customers over the past year to bring our global community to more than 77,000 customers using Salesforce.com and our platform. That's an increase of more than 30% in just 12 months. It's really incredible growth. This massive community represents a huge growth opportunity for us over the next decade. 
In the near term, by adding additional services that create broader customer success, we plan to drive new and greater account penetration, and we're going to talk about that with our strategy to go enterprise wide with Salesforce Chatter. Longer term, we hope to benefit from the obvious network effects that we are creating between a huge ecosystem of cloud customers, a cloud platform and developers, all running on this Force.com environment.
Also important, our growth continues to diversify. While our flagship Sales Cloud continues to drive the majority of new business, roughly 1/3 of new business in the first quarter came from Service and Platform Clouds. And of our top five largest transactions this quarter, three were Sales Cloud deals, one was Service Cloud deal and one was a Platform Cloud deal.
Our Service Cloud business, in particular, is showing tremendous momentum in the marketplace. Gartner recently named our Service Cloud a leader in its Magic Quadrant for customer service contact centers. And new business for our Service Cloud grew at triple-digit rates for the second quarter in a row. Just awesome for this new product.
During the first quarter, we won exciting new Service Cloud transactions at global leaders like USAA. Here in Japan at the Ministry of Land Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Iron Mountain, Motorola, U.S. Census Bureau, Abbott Labs, Procter & Gamble and McKesson. And these customers are just a few of the roughly 9,000 customers now using our Service Cloud today.
Our Platform business also delivered outstanding growth in the quarter, including our largest transaction just down the street here at Japan's Ministry of the Environment. This opportunity expands on the eco-point program, now a very famous in Japan that we've discussed in prior quarters, and joins a long list of platform wins at both new and existing customers, including Avon, NVIDIA, the California State Automobile Association and the premier organization in Japan, Tokio Marine.
I'm also thrilled to announce that both Computer Associates and BMC have gone live with their native Force.com cloud applications built at 100% natively on the Force.com platform. And Pitney Bowes recently agreed to build their next generation of insurance solutions for policy coding and underwriting natively on the Force.com platform.
And we're not just growing customers and partners with the platform, transaction volume grew more than 40% year-over-year in the first quarter to nearly $20 billion. That translates into more than 2,500 transactions every second of every day in the quarter. It's an incredible number. Nothing speaks more to the value of our customers than them actually using the product with the speed and reliability and capability that we're known for.
Availability and performance were once again outstanding at 99.9% in 300 milliseconds respectively. And our developer community now stands at more than 250,000 developers globally, an increase of more than 100,000 since last year.
Look, we feel more than ever and especially in today's global environment, and as we make on-site checks like we're doing like here in the one in Japan, that the time to invest in this company is now. All of our success this quarter demonstrates the massive shift we see globally in cloud computing. Businesses of every type are increasingly looking to the cloud to solve their challenges and they're starting to look at the cloud in a whole new way. 
The first phase of cloud computing was about leveraging technologies that were low cost, fast and easy-to-use. But as we're here in Japan and throughout some of our other presentations, recently in the United States and in Europe, the next phase of cloud computing, or we call Cloud 2, represents the next generation. One that is more social, more mobile, more real-time and delivers a completely new and dynamic experience to the user. The market opportunity for cloud computing is enormous, and the time for us to invest in capturing this market has never been better.
We have the clear market leadership, we have the brand leadership and we have key positions in every global market in the world. We are completely focused on growing customer and financial momentum and a favorable competitive position against the biggest legacy software companies in the world. All of whom seem to be more focused on consolidation than innovation. That's why we're ramping up our investments to ensure that we continue to lead the most important market in enterprise technology today. We're aggressively adding sales capacity, hiring sales people, account executives, systems engineers and managers and investing in innovation that trades greater levels of customer success in our five key clouds, our Sales Cloud, our Service Cloud, our Collaboration Cloud, our Data Cloud and our Platform. Three exciting new technologies that all embrace the power of Cloud 2 and have our customers buzzing are Salesforce Chatter, Salesforce Jigsaw and our new alliance with VMware, VMforce. 
First on Chatter. Look, the response to Chatter has been nothing short of amazing. Few times in my career have I seen really the emergence of a real killer app. I certainly saw it with Oracle with the Oracle Database, I certainly saw it with SalesForce.com with our core SFA [sales force automation]. But now, I believe that I'm personally working on the largest and most important application in my career, and I've never been more excited. And no matter what market I bring it to, whether it's the United States, whether it's Europe or even here in Japan, amazingly, the demonstrations that I make create an almost visceral reaction with a customer that they want the technology immediately. And what's amazing about it is, it's not just some point solution or business line solution, it's Salesforce.com's first enterprise-wide solution. And we routinely hear now that the customer wants 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,000 users of Salesforce Chatter, and we're very excited about getting this product into production. 
After starting with 100 customers, our beta program has quickly grew to 500. And today, I'm thrilled to say that more than 1,000 customers are now using the beta version of Salesforce Chatter. Not only are they collaborating with fellow employees, but they're using the service to collaborate around data, documents and apps. It's all in real-time. And it's very familiar to them. It's exactly the same experience that they get whether they're on the United States on Facebook or in Japan, Twitter's really on fire here, and it's the same experience as Twitter for them.
This common experience of a social network applied to compelling critical data deeply integrated them to their business, pulling out their sales data, their account data, their product data, their content, and presenting it to them in this user-friendly way is a huge breakthrough. It's all in realtime and it's on any Internet-connected device, including BlackBerrys and iPhones, and what we've been demonstrating here in Japan, the iPad.
Chatter is really important for three key reasons. First, Chatter is, as I said, our first enterprise-wide application. Every employee in every department at every business of every size can absolutely benefit from this technology. And that's a huge opportunity for growth, and it also becomes a Trojan horse for future enterprise-wide usage of the Force.com platform. 
Second, because Chatter is built on Force.com, every application built on our platform will inherit the benefits of next-generation collaboration. Not just Sales and Service, but every custom app and every custom object will be Chatterized immediately, in realtime, with no coding, and that's the incredible power of multitenancy. 
And finally, Chatter immediately makes our Sales and Service Clouds even more compelling and more differentiated than our competition than ever before. On April 8, in New York, we demonstrated to more than 1,000 attendees how Chatter will improve customer service by better connecting call center agents, technology experts and information within their companies. We had a spectacular reaction from these customers. And better customer experience and one that is less costly is something they all want and view as a killer combination. 
I am excited to announce that all 77,000 customers will have Chatter, be live and be production with Chatter when it becomes available on June 22. We will be holding an event in San Jose on June 22, which will also be our Developer Conference. And I'd like to invite all of you to come and see the next generation of innovation in action. You're going to be seeing with Salesforce Chatter what really is, I believe, the next major wave of cloud computing.
Earlier this month, we also closed our acquisition of Jigsaw, the leader in crowdsource business contact data. Jigsaw was a great acquisition for us for several reasons. First, Jigsaw's data services strengthen and differentiate our core business, enabling us to deliver a new level of CRM [customer relationship management] success. Put simply, better data turns killer apps into killer solutions. And for existing customers, we believe Jigsaw will translate into higher levels of customer satisfaction, stickiness and much lower attrition.
Second, Jigsaw creates a new growth opportunity for Salesforce.com in the $3 billion business-to-business data services industry. By delivering a fully integrated application and data solution, much in the way that Apple has with iTunes and the iPod, we believe we'll be well positioned to capture a growing piece of this market.
And third, by deeply integrating data into our core services, we're laying the foundation for a rich data ecosystem, one that will build the easily appear into our other applications like Chatter or the Sales Cloud or the Service Cloud. You can imagine changes to your contact information, a phone number, maybe a news story or a stock indication automatically appearing in the Chatter feed all through the Salesforce Jigsaw. We believe that this, too, will create new opportunities for customer and revenue growth in the future creating the concept of the data cloud. And Jigsaw makes our core stronger and positions us for growth in the future, and it's tightly integrated with everything we do at Salesforce. You can check it out today at www.jigsaw.com.
And finally, together with VMware, we closed our first quarter by announcing a major alliance to jointly deliver, sell and support a new Java cloud called VMforce. With VMforce, more than 6 million enterprise Java developers globally, including 2 million using the Spring network, will have an open path to cloud computing. And Force.com developers, who traditionally have been using the Apex technology, will have the opportunity to use Java.  In addition, CIOs are going to love that the Force.com platform is trusted and open. And users are going to love the result in applications, which are going to be social, mobile and collaborative and easy-to-use. By building Java apps on Force.com, developers will immediately benefit from. 
Force.com's database is a service, which delivers proven reliability, scalability and flexibility in the most transparent and trusted enterprise cloud today, where VMware strong Spring environment becomes a client to this service. And Force.com Chatter services that enable collaboration features to be fully integrated into their Java applications, and the Force.com developer program providing access to pre-built business services like search, identity and security, workflow reporting and analytics, are robust web services integration API [Application Programming Interface] in the ability to mobilize any application to virtually any mobile device.  And best of all, all these capabilities will be available immediately in realtime without the need for any custom coding. Again, that's the power of cloud computing.
We're thrilled to be working with VMware on such game-changing technology and we're looking forward to having the services available for developer preview later this year. We've never been more excited than having a Java cloud, and we couldn't have a better partner than our good friends in VMware.
To close, our first quarter was a spectacular way to kick off our fiscal year 2011, including financial momentum, customer momentum and innovation momentum that we believe is setting the stage for greater customer success in the future. We're investing heavily in our sales capacity, in our growth capacity, in our distribution capacity, and innovation to ensure that our continued leadership in the most exciting and important market in enterprise business technology today. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Graham to discuss our amazing first quarter results in more detail."
122917,105275434,62487,"Salesforce.com, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May-20-2010",2010-05-20,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Q1 was an excellent quarter by almost every measure. We saw a very strong new business. Attrition continued on a downward path, and we had a great start to the year from an operating cash flow perspective.Let me get into the detail. Revenu",1765,"Thanks, Marc. Q1 was an excellent quarter by almost every measure. We saw a very strong new business. Attrition continued on a downward path, and we had a great start to the year from an operating cash flow perspective.
Let me get into the detail. Revenue of $377 million rose 24% year-over-year and was well above our outlook, primarily the result of strong new business, and to a lesser extent, the continuing reduction in the rate of attrition.
From a geographic mix perspective, our International business continues to expand as a percentage of our revenue. Europe posted revenue of almost $67 million, that's represented growth of 30% in dollars and approximately 25% in local currency versus the year-ago quarter.
Driven by continued strength in Japan, revenue in Asia rose 55% in dollars and 50% in local currency year-over-year. We also crossed an exciting threshold in Asia this quarter with revenue of just over $50 million. That's an annual revenue run rate that now exceeds $200 million.
And finally, revenue in the Americas rose by 18% from Q1 of last year. Overall, our company growth rate of 24% benefited from a roughly one point currency tailwind from last year.
Our first quarter revenue benefited from another downtick in our dollar attrition rate, which is the third sequential quarter of slight reduction. We think the economy is helping, but we're also doing a lot of things internally to try and minimize this number.
And now on to rest of the income statement. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 82% increased one point from year-ago quarter. The gross margin on our Subscription and Support business improved by around half a point as we achieved greater scale and drove efficiency by deploying new service in storage, and our gross margin also benefited from a mix shift away from professional services to Subscription and Support.
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased to 66% of revenue, that's up two points from last year. This increase is a result of us investing for growth this year versus being a much more cautious mode in Q1 a year ago. Primary expense driver is of course headcount. We added 137 heads to finish the quarter, which is over 4,100 employees. This compares with just 40 heads we added in Q1 last year. We expect to hire more heads in Q2 than we did in the first quarter and to continue hiring aggressively for the remainder of the year.
With the acquisition of Jigsaw, which will add approximately $14 million to GAAP revenue and approximately $38 million to non-GAAP expenses for the remainder of fiscal 2011, we now estimate that our non-GAAP operating margin will be approximately flat with last year. I'll have more detailed commentary on the Jigsaw acquisition later in my remarks.
As our business and profitability scale internationally, our tax rate continues to decline. In Q1, our non-GAAP tax rate fell two points from a year ago to 37%. Turning to cash flow, as Marc noted, our Q1 operating cash flow was a company record of $143 million, that's an increase of approximately 46% from last year. Of note, the quarter result did benefit from a one-time $12 million tax refund related to our fiscal 2010 tax year.
As I mentioned earlier, we do plan to ramp hiring aggressively, as well as invest in Jigsaw during the remainder of fiscal 2011. But after such a strong start to the year, we now expect operating cash flow for the year will likely grow at roughly the same pace as our projected revenue growth.
Capital spending for the quarter was approximately $12 million, primarily for the leasehold improvements and capitalized software. Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $131 million or just under $1 per share for the first quarter. This was an increase of 54% from last year when we delivered roughly $85 million or $0.67 per share of free cash flow.
The strong cash generation fortified our already strong balance sheet. Cash and equivalents ended the quarter at approximately $1.9 billion. That's up roughly $175 million from Q4. Net cash, excluding net proceeds of approximately $500 million from our convertible debt offering ended the quarter at $1.4 billion, that's up more than 40% from Q1 of last year. As an aside, remember that the convertible debt shows up on our balance sheet as $450 million because it includes the debt discount. This cash balance gives us great flexibility to make strategic investments to extend our leadership as we did this quarter with the acquisition of Jigsaw.
As you know, Q1 is seasonally our strongest collections quarter. This year, accounts receivable balance fell by almost $140 million from Q4 to finish the quarter at roughly $180 million. Our receivables aging and collections continue to be excellent. We ended the quarter with a DSO of 44 days. That's flat with Q1 last year.
Deferred revenue finished the quarter at $665 million, down roughly $40 million from Q4, but up $115 million or 21% from Q1 last year, well above our expectations. As I'll discuss more when I get to our outlook, the current dollar-euro exchange rate will likely create a significant headwind for us to the remainder of fiscal 2011. In Q1, our deferred revenue balance was reduced by roughly $10 million when compared with the fourth quarter balance as a result of currency effects. On a year-over-year basis, FX had a minimal impact on deferred revenue growth.
Before I get to our specific outlook, let me discuss three items that will impact our results for the remainder of the year. The Jigsaw acquisition, the dollar-euro exchange rate and two small technology acquisitions, on which we're currently working. First, Jigsaw, as you all know, business combination accounting rules require that we write down the majority of Jigsaw's deferred revenue to its fair value. The actual amount that we estimate will be written off is approximately $7 million. And as a result, we project Jigsaw-related revenue for the remainder of fiscal 2011 to be approximately $14 million on a GAAP basis. On the earnings front, as we disclosed on April 21, we expect Jigsaw to be dilutive to our fiscal 2011 earnings to non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.11 and the GAAP EPS by roughly $0.20.
Turning next to FX. When we gave guidance for Q1 and fiscal year 2011 on our February 24 conference call, the dollar-euro conversion rate was about $1.35. By quarter's end, that rate had declined to $1.33. Today it stands at around, somewhere around $1.24, that's close to a 9% devaluation. And as I indicated a moment ago, this rate change is already showing up in our sequential deferred revenue movement. 
Looking ahead, revenue for the remainder of the year will likely also be affected assuming rates don't move materially from today. We now estimate that the change in the dollar euro FX rate will reduce Q2 revenue by approximately $7 million when compared with Q1. An impact to Q2 through Q4 will be to reduce revenue by roughly $20 million when compared with our assumptions back in February. Although the euro depreciation hurts our profitability, we've been able to offset the impact by raising our revenue guidance based on a stronger outlook for the new business in fiscal 2011. 
Finally, we're very close to closing two small transactions to add key technologies to our platform. These acquisitions will bring a small amount of revenue with them, but overall, they will reduce our reported non-GAAP EPS by roughly $0.02 for the remainder of the year and our GAAP EPS by roughly $0.03. We will continue to opportunistically pursue these types of transactions as we believe they are very important to extending the value of our services and our leadership in the market.
With that context, let me now offer some details around our non-GAAP outlook. For the full fiscal year, despite a very significant currency headwind I mentioned earlier, our strong Q1 performance and pipeline give us confidence to raise our revenue expectation for the full year to approximately $1.54 billion to $1.555 billion.
We are adjusting our non-GAAP EPS outlook today by approximately $0.13 to reflect the impact of Jigsaw and a two small asset acquisitions I mentioned a moment ago. Including those items and holding our core business expectations constant, we now expect non-GAAP EPS for the full year in the range of approximately $1.13 to $1.15. This estimate excludes the effects of stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and amortization of the debt discount on our convertible debt and of course the related tax effects of these three items.
Also as you model our EPS results for the year, it's important to remember that our Dreamforce event, which we estimate will have approximately a $0.05 impact overall, as well as seasonally high commission cost, will cause our fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS to be at roughly the same level as Q2.
It's also important to understand that after such a strong first quarter, we will definitely be making decisions that support our growth objectives, as Marc's recently just discussed, such as hiring in sales, technical operations and development, as well as continuing to look at acquisitions.
Turning now to the second quarter. As I indicated, the weakening of the euro is expected to create a $7 million headwind to Q2 revenue. We expect our revenue for the second quarter to be in the range of $381 million to $383 million. And I'd like to remind you that last year, we actually had a $4 million sequential tailwind due to the euro strengthening as we move from Q1 to Q2. 
Our non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter will be impacted by the same items that impacted the full year, and that totals specifically $0.03 relating to Jigsaw and the two technology-asset acquisitions. In that context, we now expect non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter to be approximately $0.26 to $0.27. This estimate also excludes the effects of stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and the amortization of the debt discount on our convertible debt. All of the details of our non-GAAP outlook, as well as our GAAP outlook and a full reconciliation between the two, can be found in our press release issued earlier today.
To conclude, Q1 was an excellent quarter. We delivered outstanding financial results, executed well in making investments we think are necessary to ensure our continued cloud industry leadership. We look forward to providing an update on our progress in August. And with that, let me open up the call to your questions."

But the real star of the quarter was that Service Cloud. And that Service Cloud has seen triple digit growth, it's a hot market, it's a market that has not been refreshed by the traditional enterprise technology vendors. We don't have -- we view it very much as a green field opportunity. A lot of those customers who are using products like Siebel 7.8, they have to make a tremendous decision to upgrade to Siebel 8, which is a huge new mega piece of software and architecture customization, everything is new. And so it's been giving us a great opportunity, and that's why we've seen some fantastic customers move to our Service Cloud like companies like VMware that I mentioned or like Thomson Reuters and many others. And we have a really solid pipeline for this product. So I always will go with the bird in the hand. Now that said, we have a really awesome pipeline already for enterprise-wide deals for Chatter. And how those actually work out when the customer gets it in agreement, well, I would rather have sign quite a few of those before I make a prediction on that. So I will say certainly for the short term, we've got some really hot existing products like the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud and the Platform. I will tell you that Chatter makes the Service Cloud even better. In my own personal use of Chatter everyday, the way I have it architected, I am able to follow a customer case of the same way that I can follow an employee in the company and I'm able to follow that case. And as the case changes and the company, as things happen, as transactions happen with the case, maybe service entitlements are reached or it's escalated to different managers, I'm all notified through my Chatter feed. And that kind of real-time access to customer service information and that kind of visibility from Chatter into the Service Cloud makes the Service Cloud even better. So you're going to see a major new version of the Service Cloud released on June 22. So it's kind of a win-win there, but in terms of pure revenue, I'm going to go with Service Cloud."

First, I just want to mention in regards to currency, all of us, of course, remember the tremendous changes in the euro that happened a couple of years ago, and that created a type of, I would say, almost kind of a post-traumatic euro disorder with us. So we, obviously, have a lot more experience in foreign exchange as, I think, everyone on the call does. And we are, I think, taking appropriate measures because we have seen some unprecedented things with the euro in the last couple of weeks again, and there were some very strong articles yesterday in the Wall Street Journal on the euro. And I think that Graham's comments regarding foreign exchange and how it could potentially impact our revenue are extremely appropriate. And of course we want the best. We want the euro to go back up to $1.40 or whatever it is. And we wish the euro well, but we also are just realistic based on the current situation. And specifically to your question about Chatter, what I've been seeing is a couple of few things. First, in demonstrating to customers who are coming into our customer visit centers around the world or where we're going out, when we're demonstrating kind of like what I mentioned to Heather with the Service Cloud or even the Sales Cloud or even in custom applications, it's a huge wow. And for those point solutions and for those business line solutions, we've got a huge new competitive differentiator, and it's integration with mobility and just the visionary aspect of the product, and also that it's working and that so many customers have it, and that they're going to have it when they buy the product, and that this is not some big future, that has been pretty awesome. Number two, I've personally had quite a few situations now where I'm in with either a CIO or a CEO demonstrating Chatter to them, initially just telling them how their sales users are going to do better. There was a case where a company here in Japan, I won't give you the name, but they've got about 20,000 employees. And it's a very well-known company, and they've got, I don't know, maybe they've got a couple of thousand users on Salesforce.com for their sales force. And when we were in with their CEO presenting to him and a few key members of his management team, he stood up and he said, ""I've been on Twitter, I've been using Twitter everyday to kind of get my message out to the market and, in effect, what the government is thinking about us and what our customers are thinking about us. This is like a private-enterprise Twitter, but it's integrated with my core data. I want this in the hands of every one of my employees."" Now I don't know what that initially means in terms of revenue and deployment because we're not there yet. And I think that by the time we get to the next call, we'll have more data. Certainly, as we kind of head towards the end of the fiscal year, we're going to have some transactions under our belt. So we can only hypothesize that it's not just making our core technology better and more differentiated, but it's definitely giving us the possibility of this enterprise-wide app. And we have seen that in a number of customers, and I am extremely optimistic about that. When we turn on Salesforce Chatter, all 77,000 customers just get it. It becomes the new user interface. And then built into the product in the next release is the ability to kind of just automatically spawn from any user's account another user on the network and bring them into their Chatter feed. And we think that the viral nature of that has just tremendous potential within the existing enterprise. And then we're looking at doing things outside of the enterprise, but this is kind of a more of a future thing. By the time we get to Dreamforce, we hope to be able to kind of clearly articulate to you the future direction of the product, but also I think we'll be able to have customers onstage who have actually deployed it enterprise-wide. There have been customers on beta already who have had a real conversations with us, and we have upgraded them to be enterprise-wide. They're reporting it to become a dramatic change in how they communicate and collaborate with their employees and their core business information. And additionally, they report that there is some significant, usually double-digit drop on email usage, that this becomes kind of a preferred communication system for them. So this is very -- we're very optimistic, but we're also cautious because until we get those real numbers like we are it's kind of like a year ago with the Service Cloud. A year ago with the Service Cloud, we had just announced it in New York, and we are very excited about it. But there's no way I could know today that we've got triple-digit growth and we've got the makings of a multi-hundred million dollar -- billion-dollar product line, basically. So we don't have that level of detail quite yet. With the Service Cloud, we do. Obviously, with the Sales Cloud, we have a billion-dollar product. The Service Cloud looks like they have another billion-dollar product with a platform. That's also the emergence. That's also has very strong growth. And that's a product that we want to grow to a billion dollars. But Chatter has got the right stuff I would say."

You can read that in the newspaper. And we do have enhanced technology spending. You hear that from every technology CEO. And we know that cloud computing is the fastest-growing part of the technology industry. You can see that when you aggregate all the cloud computing companies together. And we're number one in cloud computing. You can see that from our revenue where we have just passed the $1.5 billion annual revenue run rate, and now we're aggressively targeting the $2 billion number. So our position is because we believe that there are certain parts of cloud computing that are extremely attractive, now different companies focus on different parts of cloud computing. And some focus on infrastructure. Some focus on the development platform. Some focus on apps, and some focus renaming their existing data-center products' cloud. And I would say that for us, of course, we're very focused in those five core areas that we see the real action in, which is the customer-facing apps like sales and service. We see a lot of action, obviously, in the development platform and the way our customers customize as well as having core ISVs building on our platform like BMC and Computer Associates. With the platform, we're very, obviously, excited about the opportunity for collaboration as a service because honestly, the customers certainly here in Japan are just fed up with IBM and Lotus Notes and can't believe the state of that technology, and Microsoft SharePoint kind of is a bit of a grandmother's attic with it. Everything gets kind of jammed in there, but it's kind of hard to find, and it's not really -- information is not being pushed to you, and it's not that type of Facebook or Twitter-like architecture. And then we see this great opportunity in building a public data cloud. We managed already about 1 billion contacts for our customers, and we're asking them if they want to participate in our public beta cloud, and then they have the opportunity to cleanse their data more aggressively. This can be a key part of cloud computing because of the crowd-sourcing model. And these are kind of our five areas that we're really excited about. So we've got the pedal to the metal, and the way we have to do that is we have to generally think one year out or two years out -- but really, one-year out. So the investments and things that you are seeing us make now, we're really thinking about fiscal year '12, and we really think about the level of distribution capacity we want to have online for next year based on the fundamental direction of the market. Today, we already have a lot of distribution capacity. We have that globally. We're able to operate with fluidity of a global stage, but we want to have more capacity because honestly, in my opinion, this is a distribution-constrained organization. When you look at our lead flows, when you look at the product capabilities, when you look at the size of the markets that we can address, we are fundamentally distribution constrained, and I believe the best thing for the shareholders is to expand distribution, and this is the majority of the investment. And then some slight additional investment is, obviously, were acquired our way into the data cloud. That was not an organic development because we felt it could be a separate platform, and they have the right technology and model at jigsaw.com. And then we have a couple of tuck-in acquisitions, which is not unusual for us. We have a history of tuck-ins. But we found a couple of really cool companies that we think will make our sales service and collaboration clouds better and more competitive. And I think that, that's kind of a -- I would say there's a run rate over the past few years with those tuck-ins. But when you take those tuck-ins and then you combine them with Jigsaw, then it's a little bit more acquisition activity this year than in previous years. And I'll let Graham actually speak to the numbers, but that's generally how we look at the problem right now."

We sort of target certainly to get them to breakeven in a quarter-by-quarter period. Clearly, we've just acquired Jigsaw, so we're very excited about that. We're investing heavily to expand their distribution capacity. But I would think a good yardstick is going to be four to eight quarters out, we're looking to get that business to breakeven. And certainly, if you look at the tuck-ins, there's an impact this year. But clearly next year, as Marc said, we should build that into our run rate of development spend. And I think certainly, this had an impact our gains. We've had to take that into account this year. But I think look to cash low, if you like, as a true north of our operating performance, that we feel we're incrementally more optimistic this quarter about cash flow. We've said we think cash flow is going to grow at the same rate as revenue. Last quarter, we said we thought slightly less than revenue. So I think that's the second set of numbers to look at and make sure that, clearly, we're operating the business well."

That's a lot of customer, and they're very diverse portfolio of customers; geographies, language, industries, markets and so forth and so on. And all of these customers are going to have this just flipped on basically, and all they need to do to have it running is they need to have a modern browser, which is they need to have IE8. They need to have Chrome. They need to have Firefox or Safari. And not all of them do. By the way, there's a huge percentage of the industry that's still, for example, on IE6. So some customers will have to upgrade. Now that said, we have a lot of really positive data points on this product. But when you're in this kind of early days, it's hard to exactly put your finger on the materiality to the business. Number one, it's great marketing. It's unbelievable marketing. All of my demonstrations if you've been watching them on YouTube or whatever here in Japan. I've done over eight major presentations here in Japan over the past two weeks, and I'm going to be doing a major presentation on Tuesday in Singapore at the Cloudforce to feature this technology. And customers are definitely stunned and they want it. It kind of takes the competition issue off the table unusually fast because it's clear as day that this is not what competitors have. Competitors still kind of have the old sales force automation, contact account opportunity, forecast reports or the old customer service products, the cases, the solutions, the knowledge management, the analytics; or the old platform, the database, the app server, the forms, the tools and the reports. And we have that, too, of course, as a service, multi-tenant shared. But then when you layer on this social model and then deliver that user interface that makes everything look like what they're spending their time on, which is Facebook and Twitter, well, then that's the big game changer. And it's very motivating, I think, that customers get quite emotional about the product, which is very exciting and, certainly, the leaders of the organizations do. And we had a great experience here, but we have a lot of banks here in Japan who use our product. And there's one very large banking group that's quite decentralized, and they did something unusual. They brought all their CIOs in to meet with us, and I don't think they have actually ever done that before as an organization, and they just wanted to get an update on using the Sales technology. And we're all sitting in the room and, of course, I do the whole presentation on Cloud 2. And I'm sure you've seen -- it's my most recent stump speech. And then I do my whole demo, but it's run by one of our SE here in Japan. We're using Japanese -- we're using the new Sony Ericsson phone with Google Android on it as a demonstration device. I've got an iPad. We've got a BlackBerry with [ph] DOCOMO on it. We've got an iPhone running Softbank. And at the end of it, we thought we're just looking for more orders on sales force automation, right, from these CIOs. We want to be the sales solution for the banks, of course. And the result is not bad, which is they come up to me and say, ""Oh no, I want to be your first enterprise-wide on Chatter in Japan. And when exactly? I want it now."" And I love that. And we just need to figure out getting it to them. We have it. The code is essentially production at this point. And on one of our pods, we can actually turn on more customers at will. I think that we feel very good about the technology quality. We feel very good about where it is as a version 1. It's an unusually good version 1. And our version 2 and 3 and 4, which will also be coming out within the next six months is also awesome. And I will -- between now and the end of the year, I think we're going to see a lot of customers. I think by the time we get to Dreamforce, we will see a lot of customers on Chatter. And I just can't tell you if we're going to have four, five CIOs onstage at Dreamforce or CEOs saying, ""I want enterprise-wide with Chatter and here is why, and here is what it's done for me."" All I can tell you is my personal experience that it's completely transformed Salesforce.com. Certainly, it's broken me out of my bubble as a CEO, I have visibility in my organization, I never had. Deep into my sales information, deep into my customer service inquiries, deep into my products, deep into my competitors, and I'm outside of the CEO bubble. And every CEO gets trapped in it because only you have your direct reports. You get out and you make a few customer calls. You meet some employees. You're doing a lot of email, and that's your bubble, and I'm out of it. And I think other CEOs see when we're doing the demo that it can do that for them and that's going to let someone like me make better decisions like the decision we've made to grow because we see the opportunities, so it's like grow, grow it higher and let's go. And in certain markets -- like one of the reasons that I'm here is I saw an inordinate amount of activity in Japan and I'm like, ""Wow, maybe we should be making a disproportionate investment in Japan because it's so awesome here. So I think that we've got a great thing on our hands, but I wish I could say, kind of getting back to Heather Bellini's question, tell me about the revenue. What's more important? Is it Service Cloud or Chatter? Right now, it's all about Sales Cloud and Service Cloud because those are multi-billion dollar markets, ready to go. Yes, collaboration is also a multi-billion dollar market ready to go, but we'll not going to know until we get it out there. So come June 22, to San Jose, to the convention center, talk to the customers, also talk to the ISVs who are building on Chatter. All of our ISVs are rebuilding their apps on Chatter, and customers who have built native force.com apps are having unusual experiences. We held a user group meeting here in Japan, a customer stood up, he is a very senior and very well-respected engineer at NTT, which is the big telecommunications company here, and said, ""I just have to say something about Chatter."" And I said, ""what is it?"" He goes, ""I don't understand this, my business is tweeting me. My applications are tweeting me."" And this is changing how I think about applications. And I'm excited, but now I need to see the rubber hit the road, and we hope we'll have some very specific transaction discussions for you in the coming quarters."

It's basically a no-impact situation. It's not something that, I think, anyone needs to make anything of. I think it probably has more ramifications for other cloud vendors than it, honestly, does for us because we're strong. And a lot of other cloud CEOs have been contacting me, and my heart goes out to them and because I feel like that's the real impact is that if you go through it, you can see where this is going.

We've closed a lot of big deals this quarter. I can tell you we're going to close a lot of big deals this year. I've seen the pipeline. I recently had a meeting at a major venture capital firm on Sand Hill road with about 30 of the largest CIOs in the world, and their message to us is your technology is great, and we're having a great experience. We've been testing it for the last two or three or four years, and we want to buy more of it. And that's generally an indication of better quality and larger deals coming, and we're excited about that. But we see a lot of those deals right now. We see more coming. But we see more business across the board because there's a fundamental shift happening to cloud computing that's benefiting a whole series of new companies and not benefiting old companies. And we are going to really, I think, continue to see the benefits of that because in my opinion, I'm biased, no one is better positioned for the future of the enterprise cloud than us. We've got the best products and technology. We've got the best sales organization. We've got the best brand and reputation with customers. And I would also just say we're working hard to move into that kind of elusive top 10 independent software company rankings, which is kind of gets into that $2 billion annual revenue run rate level. I mean that's just an exciting thing for Salesforce.com to move into the multi-billion dollar area. And I think now that we've passed $1.5 billion, it gives us a lot of confidence that the next step for us is right there, the brass ring is right there for us to take."

On average, we're in about 15% to 20% of our employees in one of our customers. So that tends to be the sales organization in total. Obviously, our percentage is much higher at Salesforce or more than twice that. But the average company is about 20% for sales. And that's how they look at distribution, and we're generally in there for that. Maybe we have some service users too. Maybe they've built some custom apps. But there aren't too many examples where every user has a license already. Dell is one where we have an ELA. We have a few other ELAs. But the vast majority of our 77,000 customers is kind of that 20% level on average. That's my gut. Maybe it's kind of hard for me to exactly know because we don't run that report. But I would say just at a gut level and that our opportunity is to go from that, let's say at 77,000 companies and let's say, so couple the 3 million users to -- we want to get over. I guess I should say our goal or our dream or our vision is that within the next year is to move that to over 10 million users on Salesforce's services, and that Chatter is our directional vehicle to do that. And we think that, that's the right strategy. It's the right technology, and I think that's the possibility. I'm not giving you that as kind of a forward-looking guidance thing that we're going to 10 million users. But in theory, that's the potential.

I spent the better part of May here in Japan talking to customers, speaking at Ministry events and even have the opportunity to meet with the Minister of Technology. And I also, yesterday, met with the Prime Minister of Japan, and fundamentally, to discuss one thing, that cloud computing is a tremendous accelerator for the economics and businesses of Japan. And I believe this is even more strong than ever before after spending this extended period here in Tokyo.
Our first quarter was a terrific kick off to 2011 on virtually every front. Our business is gaining momentum globally. On the customer front, a record 4,800 net new customers contributed towards our fastest business growth in more than two years. On the technology front, we're positioned to create much higher levels of customer success with the coming additions of incredible new technology, including: Salesforce Chatter, our enterprise collaboration service; Salesforce Jigsaw, the leader in crowdsourced data services, the emergence of the data cloud; and VMforce, the world's first Java cloud. So in these three critical new areas, the collaboration cloud, the data cloud and the Java cloud, Salesforce.com is really defining the very next level of our growth and technology capability for our customers.
And finally on the financial front, we delivered another spectacular quarter. Let me begin with some of the financial highlights for the quarter. Revenue increased by 24% from a year ago to $377 million. Well, that was our best growth performance in five quarters. And even more incredibly, we're delivering this growth as we pushed through the $1.5 billion annual revenue run rate threshold, that is really amazing, and starts to focus us very acutely and clearly on that elusive and very important $2 billion annual revenue milestone.
While our GAAP EPS of $0.13 was down a bit from last year due primarily to the imputed interest on our convertible note, our non-GAAP EPS rose to $0.30 from $0.28 to a year ago. We're committed to growing profit, even as we increase our investments in top line growth. But by far, most exciting financial achievement in the quarter was our record cash generation. Until now, we've never eclipsed the $100 million threshold for operating cash flow. However, not only did we break through that threshold in the first quarter, we absolutely obliterated that milestone. 
Cash from operations totaled more than $140 million in the quarter, an increase of more than 40% from a year ago, and this translates into more than $1 per share of operating cash flow in a single quarter, roughly the same we earned in the entire first half of our last fiscal year ago. Nothing speaks more to the operating strength and quality of our business than our continued strong cash generation.
Our financial success was powered by another quarter of incredible customer success. In fact, we delivered our biggest new business growth quarter since our amazing fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, and our 4,800 net customer additions was an all-time high for the company. Simply put, demand for Salesforce.com services has never been better worldwide. 
And as we continue to achieve this success by beating the biggest, most important software companies in the world, I guess to Oracle, this quarter, we won significant new or add-on business at Informatica, Sony Ericsson, Symantec, MasterCard, GE Australia, Motorola. Here in Japan, we've beat them at Canon and Fujitsu, two of the most important companies in the country, Pitney Bowes, ASA and Waste Management. And against an unnamed patent troll, we won business at Abbott Labs, Mercury Insurance, Ingram Micro, Austin Ventures and Salient Surgical. And finally, while SAP struggles to redefine itself, we won business against them at Häagen-Dazs, Carestream and NVIDIA. 
In total, across all of our businesses, we've added roughly 18,000 net new customers over the past year to bring our global community to more than 77,000 customers using Salesforce.com and our platform. That's an increase of more than 30% in just 12 months. It's really incredible growth. This massive community represents a huge growth opportunity for us over the next decade. 
In the near term, by adding additional services that create broader customer success, we plan to drive new and greater account penetration, and we're going to talk about that with our strategy to go enterprise wide with Salesforce Chatter. Longer term, we hope to benefit from the obvious network effects that we are creating between a huge ecosystem of cloud customers, a cloud platform and developers, all running on this Force.com environment.
Also important, our growth continues to diversify. While our flagship Sales Cloud continues to drive the majority of new business, roughly 1/3 of new business in the first quarter came from Service and Platform Clouds. And of our top five largest transactions this quarter, three were Sales Cloud deals, one was Service Cloud deal and one was a Platform Cloud deal.
Our Service Cloud business, in particular, is showing tremendous momentum in the marketplace. Gartner recently named our Service Cloud a leader in its Magic Quadrant for customer service contact centers. And new business for our Service Cloud grew at triple-digit rates for the second quarter in a row. Just awesome for this new product.
During the first quarter, we won exciting new Service Cloud transactions at global leaders like USAA. Here in Japan at the Ministry of Land Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Iron Mountain, Motorola, U.S. Census Bureau, Abbott Labs, Procter & Gamble and McKesson. And these customers are just a few of the roughly 9,000 customers now using our Service Cloud today.
Our Platform business also delivered outstanding growth in the quarter, including our largest transaction just down the street here at Japan's Ministry of the Environment. This opportunity expands on the eco-point program, now a very famous in Japan that we've discussed in prior quarters, and joins a long list of platform wins at both new and existing customers, including Avon, NVIDIA, the California State Automobile Association and the premier organization in Japan, Tokio Marine.
I'm also thrilled to announce that both Computer Associates and BMC have gone live with their native Force.com cloud applications built at 100% natively on the Force.com platform. And Pitney Bowes recently agreed to build their next generation of insurance solutions for policy coding and underwriting natively on the Force.com platform.
And we're not just growing customers and partners with the platform, transaction volume grew more than 40% year-over-year in the first quarter to nearly $20 billion. That translates into more than 2,500 transactions every second of every day in the quarter. It's an incredible number. Nothing speaks more to the value of our customers than them actually using the product with the speed and reliability and capability that we're known for.
Availability and performance were once again outstanding at 99.9% in 300 milliseconds respectively. And our developer community now stands at more than 250,000 developers globally, an increase of more than 100,000 since last year.
Look, we feel more than ever and especially in today's global environment, and as we make on-site checks like we're doing like here in the one in Japan, that the time to invest in this company is now. All of our success this quarter demonstrates the massive shift we see globally in cloud computing. Businesses of every type are increasingly looking to the cloud to solve their challenges and they're starting to look at the cloud in a whole new way. 
The first phase of cloud computing was about leveraging technologies that were low cost, fast and easy-to-use. But as we're here in Japan and throughout some of our other presentations, recently in the United States and in Europe, the next phase of cloud computing, or we call Cloud 2, represents the next generation. One that is more social, more mobile, more real-time and delivers a completely new and dynamic experience to the user. The market opportunity for cloud computing is enormous, and the time for us to invest in capturing this market has never been better.
We have the clear market leadership, we have the brand leadership and we have key positions in every global market in the world. We are completely focused on growing customer and financial momentum and a favorable competitive position against the biggest legacy software companies in the world. All of whom seem to be more focused on consolidation than innovation. That's why we're ramping up our investments to ensure that we continue to lead the most important market in enterprise technology today. We're aggressively adding sales capacity, hiring sales people, account executives, systems engineers and managers and investing in innovation that trades greater levels of customer success in our five key clouds, our Sales Cloud, our Service Cloud, our Collaboration Cloud, our Data Cloud and our Platform. Three exciting new technologies that all embrace the power of Cloud 2 and have our customers buzzing are Salesforce Chatter, Salesforce Jigsaw and our new alliance with VMware, VMforce. 
First on Chatter. Look, the response to Chatter has been nothing short of amazing. Few times in my career have I seen really the emergence of a real killer app. I certainly saw it with Oracle with the Oracle Database, I certainly saw it with SalesForce.com with our core SFA [sales force automation]. But now, I believe that I'm personally working on the largest and most important application in my career, and I've never been more excited. And no matter what market I bring it to, whether it's the United States, whether it's Europe or even here in Japan, amazingly, the demonstrations that I make create an almost visceral reaction with a customer that they want the technology immediately. And what's amazing about it is, it's not just some point solution or business line solution, it's Salesforce.com's first enterprise-wide solution. And we routinely hear now that the customer wants 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,000 users of Salesforce Chatter, and we're very excited about getting this product into production. 
After starting with 100 customers, our beta program has quickly grew to 500. And today, I'm thrilled to say that more than 1,000 customers are now using the beta version of Salesforce Chatter. Not only are they collaborating with fellow employees, but they're using the service to collaborate around data, documents and apps. It's all in real-time. And it's very familiar to them. It's exactly the same experience that they get whether they're on the United States on Facebook or in Japan, Twitter's really on fire here, and it's the same experience as Twitter for them.
This common experience of a social network applied to compelling critical data deeply integrated them to their business, pulling out their sales data, their account data, their product data, their content, and presenting it to them in this user-friendly way is a huge breakthrough. It's all in realtime and it's on any Internet-connected device, including BlackBerrys and iPhones, and what we've been demonstrating here in Japan, the iPad.
Chatter is really important for three key reasons. First, Chatter is, as I said, our first enterprise-wide application. Every employee in every department at every business of every size can absolutely benefit from this technology. And that's a huge opportunity for growth, and it also becomes a Trojan horse for future enterprise-wide usage of the Force.com platform. 
Second, because Chatter is built on Force.com, every application built on our platform will inherit the benefits of next-generation collaboration. Not just Sales and Service, but every custom app and every custom object will be Chatterized immediately, in realtime, with no coding, and that's the incredible power of multitenancy. 
And finally, Chatter immediately makes our Sales and Service Clouds even more compelling and more differentiated than our competition than ever before. On April 8, in New York, we demonstrated to more than 1,000 attendees how Chatter will improve customer service by better connecting call center agents, technology experts and information within their companies. We had a spectacular reaction from these customers. And better customer experience and one that is less costly is something they all want and view as a killer combination. 
I am excited to announce that all 77,000 customers will have Chatter, be live and be production with Chatter when it becomes available on June 22. We will be holding an event in San Jose on June 22, which will also be our Developer Conference. And I'd like to invite all of you to come and see the next generation of innovation in action. You're going to be seeing with Salesforce Chatter what really is, I believe, the next major wave of cloud computing.
Earlier this month, we also closed our acquisition of Jigsaw, the leader in crowdsource business contact data. Jigsaw was a great acquisition for us for several reasons. First, Jigsaw's data services strengthen and differentiate our core business, enabling us to deliver a new level of CRM [customer relationship management] success. Put simply, better data turns killer apps into killer solutions. And for existing customers, we believe Jigsaw will translate into higher levels of customer satisfaction, stickiness and much lower attrition.
Second, Jigsaw creates a new growth opportunity for Salesforce.com in the $3 billion business-to-business data services industry. By delivering a fully integrated application and data solution, much in the way that Apple has with iTunes and the iPod, we believe we'll be well positioned to capture a growing piece of this market.
And third, by deeply integrating data into our core services, we're laying the foundation for a rich data ecosystem, one that will build the easily appear into our other applications like Chatter or the Sales Cloud or the Service Cloud. You can imagine changes to your contact information, a phone number, maybe a news story or a stock indication automatically appearing in the Chatter feed all through the Salesforce Jigsaw. We believe that this, too, will create new opportunities for customer and revenue growth in the future creating the concept of the data cloud. And Jigsaw makes our core stronger and positions us for growth in the future, and it's tightly integrated with everything we do at Salesforce. You can check it out today at www.jigsaw.com.
And finally, together with VMware, we closed our first quarter by announcing a major alliance to jointly deliver, sell and support a new Java cloud called VMforce. With VMforce, more than 6 million enterprise Java developers globally, including 2 million using the Spring network, will have an open path to cloud computing. And Force.com developers, who traditionally have been using the Apex technology, will have the opportunity to use Java.  In addition, CIOs are going to love that the Force.com platform is trusted and open. And users are going to love the result in applications, which are going to be social, mobile and collaborative and easy-to-use. By building Java apps on Force.com, developers will immediately benefit from. 
Force.com's database is a service, which delivers proven reliability, scalability and flexibility in the most transparent and trusted enterprise cloud today, where VMware strong Spring environment becomes a client to this service. And Force.com Chatter services that enable collaboration features to be fully integrated into their Java applications, and the Force.com developer program providing access to pre-built business services like search, identity and security, workflow reporting and analytics, are robust web services integration API [Application Programming Interface] in the ability to mobilize any application to virtually any mobile device.  And best of all, all these capabilities will be available immediately in realtime without the need for any custom coding. Again, that's the power of cloud computing.
We're thrilled to be working with VMware on such game-changing technology and we're looking forward to having the services available for developer preview later this year. We've never been more excited than having a Java cloud, and we couldn't have a better partner than our good friends in VMware.
To close, our first quarter was a spectacular way to kick off our fiscal year 2011, including financial momentum, customer momentum and innovation momentum that we believe is setting the stage for greater customer success in the future. We're investing heavily in our sales capacity, in our growth capacity, in our distribution capacity, and innovation to ensure that our continued leadership in the most exciting and important market in enterprise business technology today. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Graham to discuss our amazing first quarter results in more detail."
122917,105275434,62569,"Salesforce.com, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May-20-2010",2010-05-20,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Q1 was an excellent quarter by almost every measure. We saw a very strong new business. Attrition continued on a downward path, and we had a great start to the year from an operating cash flow perspective.Let me get into the detail. Revenu",1766,"Thanks, Marc. Q1 was an excellent quarter by almost every measure. We saw a very strong new business. Attrition continued on a downward path, and we had a great start to the year from an operating cash flow perspective.
Let me get into the detail. Revenue of $377 million rose 24% year-over-year and was well above our outlook, primarily the result of strong new business, and to a lesser extent, the continuing reduction in the rate of attrition.
From a geographic mix perspective, our International business continues to expand as a percentage of our revenue. Europe posted revenue of almost $67 million, that's represented growth of 30% in dollars and approximately 25% in local currency versus the year-ago quarter.
Driven by continued strength in Japan, revenue in Asia rose 55% in dollars and 50% in local currency year-over-year. We also crossed an exciting threshold in Asia this quarter with revenue of just over $50 million. That's an annual revenue run rate that now exceeds $200 million.
And finally, revenue in the Americas rose by 18% from Q1 of last year. Overall, our company growth rate of 24% benefited from a roughly one point currency tailwind from last year.
Our first quarter revenue benefited from another downtick in our dollar attrition rate, which is the third sequential quarter of slight reduction. We think the economy is helping, but we're also doing a lot of things internally to try and minimize this number.
And now on to rest of the income statement. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 82% increased one point from year-ago quarter. The gross margin on our Subscription and Support business improved by around half a point as we achieved greater scale and drove efficiency by deploying new service in storage, and our gross margin also benefited from a mix shift away from professional services to Subscription and Support.
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased to 66% of revenue, that's up two points from last year. This increase is a result of us investing for growth this year versus being a much more cautious mode in Q1 a year ago. Primary expense driver is of course headcount. We added 137 heads to finish the quarter, which is over 4,100 employees. This compares with just 40 heads we added in Q1 last year. We expect to hire more heads in Q2 than we did in the first quarter and to continue hiring aggressively for the remainder of the year.
With the acquisition of Jigsaw, which will add approximately $14 million to GAAP revenue and approximately $38 million to non-GAAP expenses for the remainder of fiscal 2011, we now estimate that our non-GAAP operating margin will be approximately flat with last year. I'll have more detailed commentary on the Jigsaw acquisition later in my remarks.
As our business and profitability scale internationally, our tax rate continues to decline. In Q1, our non-GAAP tax rate fell two points from a year ago to 37%. Turning to cash flow, as Marc noted, our Q1 operating cash flow was a company record of $143 million, that's an increase of approximately 46% from last year. Of note, the quarter result did benefit from a one-time $12 million tax refund related to our fiscal 2010 tax year.
As I mentioned earlier, we do plan to ramp hiring aggressively, as well as invest in Jigsaw during the remainder of fiscal 2011. But after such a strong start to the year, we now expect operating cash flow for the year will likely grow at roughly the same pace as our projected revenue growth.
Capital spending for the quarter was approximately $12 million, primarily for leasehold improvements and capitalized software. Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $131 million or just under $1 per share for the first quarter. This was an increase of 54% from last year when we delivered roughly $85 million or $0.67 per share of free cash flow.
The strong cash generation fortified our already strong balance sheet. Cash and equivalents ended the quarter at approximately $1.9 billion. That's up roughly $175 million from Q4. Net cash excluding net proceeds of approximately $500 million from our convertible debt offering ended the quarter at $1.4 billion, that's up more than 40% from Q1 of last year. As an aside, remember that the convertible debt shows up on our balance sheet as $450 million because it includes the debt discount. This cash balance gives us great flexibility to make strategic investments to extend our leadership as we did this quarter with the acquisition of Jigsaw.
As you know, Q1 is seasonally our strongest collections quarter. This year, accounts receivable balance fell by almost $140 million from Q4 to finish the quarter at roughly $180 million. Our receivables aging and collections continue to be excellent. We ended the quarter with a DSO of 44 days. That's flat with Q1 last year.
Deferred revenue finished the quarter at $665 million, down roughly $40 million from Q4, but up $115 million or 21% from Q1 last year, well above our expectation. As I'll discuss more when I get to our outlook, the current dollar-euro exchange rate will likely create a significant headwind for us to the remainder of fiscal 2011. In Q1, our deferred revenue balance was reduced by roughly $10 million when compared with the fourth quarter balance as a result of currency effects. On a year-over-year basis, FX had a minimal impact on deferred revenue growth.
Before I get to our specific outlook, let me discuss three items that will impact our results for the remainder of the year. The Jigsaw acquisition, the dollar-euro exchange rate and two small technology acquisitions, on which we're currently working. First, Jigsaw, as you all know, business combination accounting rules require that we write down the majority of Jigsaw's deferred revenue to its fair value. The actual amount that we estimate will be written off is approximately $7 million. And as a result, we project Jigsaw-related revenue for the remainder of fiscal 2011 to be approximately $14 million on a GAAP basis. On the earnings front, as we disclosed on April 21, we expect Jigsaw to be dilutive to our fiscal 2011 earnings to non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.11 and the GAAP EPS by roughly $0.20.
Turning next to FX. When we gave guidance for Q1 and fiscal year 2011 on our February 24 conference call, the dollar-euro conversion rate was about $1.35. By quarter's end, that rate had declined to $1.33. Today it stands at around, somewhere around $1.24, that's close to a 9% devaluation. And as I indicated a moment ago, this rate change is already showing up in our sequential deferred revenue movement. 
Looking ahead, revenue for the remainder of the year will likely also be affected. Assuming rates don't move materially from today, we now estimate that the change in the dollar-euro FX rate will reduce Q2 revenue by approximately $7 million when compared with Q1. The impact to Q2 through Q4 will be to reduce revenue by roughly $20 million when compared with our assumptions back in February. Although the euro depreciation hurts our profitability, we've been able to offset the impact by raising our revenue guidance based on a stronger outlook for the new business in fiscal 2011. 
Finally, we're very close to closing two small transactions to add key technologies to our platform. These acquisitions will bring a small amount of revenue with them, but overall, they will reduce our reported non-GAAP EPS by roughly $0.02 for the remainder of the year and our GAAP EPS by roughly $0.03. We will continue to opportunistically pursue these types of transactions as we believe they are very important to extending the value of our services and our leadership in the market.
So with that context, let me now offer some details around our non-GAAP outlook. For the full fiscal year, despite a very significant currency headwind I mentioned earlier, our strong Q1 performance and pipeline give us confidence to raise our revenue expectation for the full year to approximately $1.54 billion to $1.555 billion.
We are adjusting our non-GAAP EPS outlook today by approximately $0.13 to reflect the impact of Jigsaw and the two small asset acquisitions I mentioned a moment ago. Including those items and holding our core business expectations constant, we now expect non-GAAP EPS for the full year in the range of approximately $1.13 to $1.15. This estimate excludes the effects of stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and amortization of the debt discount on our convertible debt and of course the related tax effects of these three items.
Also, as you model our EPS results for the year, it's important to remember that our Dreamforce event, which we estimate will have approximately a $0.05 impact overall, as well as seasonally high commission cost, will cause our fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS to be at roughly the same level as Q2.
It's also important to understand that after such a strong first quarter, we will definitely be making decisions that support our growth objective, as Marc's recently just discussed, such as hiring in sales, technical operations and development, as well as continuing to look at acquisitions.
Turning now to the second quarter. As I indicated, the weakening of the euro is expected to create a $7 million headwind to Q2 revenue. We expect our revenue for the second quarter to be in the range of $381 million to $383 million. And I'd like to remind you that last year, we actually had a $4 million sequential tailwind due to the euro strengthening as we move from Q1 to Q2. 
Our non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter will be impacted by the same items that impacted the full year, and that totals specifically $0.03 relating to Jigsaw and the two technology asset acquisitions. In that context, we now expect non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter to be approximately $0.26 to $0.27. This estimate also excludes the effects of stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and the amortization of the debt discount on our convertible debt. All of the details of our non-GAAP outlook, as well as our GAAP outlook and a full reconciliation between the two, can be found in our press release issued earlier today.
To conclude, Q1 was an excellent quarter. We delivered outstanding financial results, executed well in making the investments we think are necessary to ensure our continued cloud industry leadership. We look forward to providing an update on our progress in August. And with that, let me open up the call to your questions."

But the real star of the quarter was that Service Cloud. And that Service Cloud has seen triple-digit growth. It's a hot market, it's a market that has not been refreshed by the traditional enterprise technology vendors. We view it very much as a green field opportunity. A lot of those customers who are using products like Siebel 7.8, they have to make a tremendous decision to upgrade to Siebel 8, which is a huge new mega piece of software and architecture customization, everything is new. And so it's been giving us a great opportunity, and that's why we're seeing some fantastic customers move to our Service Cloud like companies like VMware that I mentioned or like Thomson Reuters and many others. And we have a really solid pipeline for this product. So I always will go with the bird in the hand. Now that said, we have a really awesome pipeline already for enterprise-wide deals for Chatter. And how those actually work out when the customer gets it in agreement, well, I would rather have sign quite a few of those before I make a prediction on that. So I will say certainly for the short term, we've got some really hot existing products like the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud and the Platform. I will tell you that Chatter makes the Service Cloud even better. In my own personal use of Chatter everyday, the way I have it architected, I am able to follow a customer case of the same way that I can follow an employee in the company and I'm able to follow that case. And as the case changes and the company, as things happen, as transactions happen with the case, maybe service entitlements are reached or it's escalated to different managers, I'm all notified through my Chatter feed. And that kind of real-time access to customer service information and that kind of visibility from Chatter into the Service Cloud makes the Service Cloud even better. So you're going to see a major new version of the Service Cloud released on June 22. So it's kind of a win-win there, but in terms of pure revenue, I'm going to go with Service Cloud."

First, I just want to mention in regards to currency, all of us, of course, remember the tremendous changes in the euro that happened a couple of years ago, and that created a type of, I would say, almost kind of a post-traumatic euro disorder with us. So we, obviously, have a lot more experience in foreign exchange as, I think, everyone on the call does. And we are, I think, taking appropriate measures because we have seen some unprecedented things with the euro in the last couple of weeks again, and there were some very strong articles yesterday in the Wall Street Journal on the euro. And I think that Graham's comments regarding foreign exchange and how it could potentially impact our revenue are extremely appropriate. And of course we want the best. We want the euro to go back up to $1.40 or whatever it is. And we wish the euro well, but we also are just realistic based on the current situation. And specifically to your question about Chatter, what I've been seeing is a couple of few things. First, in demonstrating to customers who are coming into our customer visit centers around the world or where we're going out, when we're demonstrating kind of like what I mentioned to Heather with the Service Cloud or even the Sales Cloud or even in custom applications, it's a huge wow. And for those point solutions and for those business line solutions, we've got a huge new competitive differentiator, and it's integration with mobility and just the visionary aspect of the product, and also that it's working and that so many customers have it, and that they're going to have it when they buy the product, and that this is not some big future, that has been pretty awesome. Number two, I've personally had quite a few situations now where I'm in with either a CIO or a CEO demonstrating Chatter to them, initially just telling them how their sales users are going to do better. There was a case where a company here in Japan, I won't give you the name, but they've got about 20,000 employees. And it's a very well-known company, and they've got, I don't know, maybe they've got a couple of thousand users on Salesforce.com for their sales force. And when we were in with their CEO presenting to him and a few key members of his management team, he stood up and he said, ""I've been on Twitter, I've been using Twitter everyday to kind of get my message out to the market and, in effect, what the government is thinking about us and what our customers are thinking about us. This is like a private-enterprise Twitter, but it's integrated with my core data. I want this in the hands of every one of my employees."" Now I don't know what that initially means in terms of revenue and deployment because we're not there yet. And I think that by the time we get to the next call, we'll have more data. Certainly, as we kind of head towards the end of the fiscal year, we're going to have some transactions under our belt. So we can only hypothesize that it's not just making our core technology better and more differentiated, but it's definitely giving us the possibility of this enterprise-wide app. And we have seen that in a number of customers, and I am extremely optimistic about that. When we turn on Salesforce Chatter, all 77,000 customers just get it. It becomes the new user interface. And then built into the product in the next release is the ability to kind of just automatically spawn from any user's account another user on the network and bring them into their Chatter feed. And we think that the viral nature of that has just tremendous potential within the existing enterprise. And then we're looking at doing things outside of the enterprise, but this is kind of a more of a future thing. By the time we get to Dreamforce, we hope to be able to kind of clearly articulate to you the future direction of the product, but also I think we'll be able to have customers onstage who have actually deployed it enterprise-wide. There have been customers on beta already who have had a real conversations with us, and we have upgraded them to be enterprise-wide. They're reporting it to become a dramatic change in how they communicate and collaborate with their employees and their core business information. And additionally, they report that there is some significant, usually double-digit drop on email usage, that this becomes kind of a preferred communication system for them. So this is very -- we're very optimistic, but we're also cautious because until we get those real numbers like we are it's kind of like a year ago with the Service Cloud. A year ago with the Service Cloud, we had just announced it in New York, and we are very excited about it. But there's no way I could know today that we've got triple-digit growth and we've got the makings of a multi-hundred million dollar -- billion-dollar product line, basically. So we don't have that level of detail quite yet. With the Service Cloud, we do. Obviously, with the Sales Cloud, we have a billion-dollar product. The Service Cloud looks like they have another billion-dollar product with a platform. That's also the emergence. That's also has very strong growth. And that's a product that we want to grow to a billion dollars. But Chatter has got the right stuff I would say."

We do have a global recovery underway. I think that everyone knows that. You can read that in the newspaper. And we do have enhanced technology spending. You hear that",725,"Well, let me take the philosophy, and then I will give the concrete numbers to Graham. We do have a global recovery underway. I think that everyone knows that. You can read that in the newspaper. And we do have enhanced technology spending. You hear that from every technology CEO. And we know that cloud computing is the fastest-growing part of the technology industry. You can see that when you aggregate all the cloud computing companies together. And we're number one in cloud computing. You can see that from our revenue where we have just passed the $1.5 billion annual revenue run rate, and now we're aggressively targeting the $2 billion number. So our position is because we believe that there are certain parts of cloud computing that are extremely attractive, now different companies focus on different parts of cloud computing. And some focus on infrastructure. Some focus on the development platform. Some focus on apps, and some focus renaming their existing data-center products' cloud. And I would say that for us, of course, we're very focused in those five core areas that we see the real action in, which is the customer-facing apps like sales and service. We see a lot of action, obviously, in the development platform and the way our customers customize as well as having core ISVs building on our platform like BMC and Computer Associates. With the platform, we're very, obviously, excited about the opportunity for collaboration as a service because honestly, the customers certainly here in Japan are just fed up with IBM and Lotus Notes and can't believe the state of that technology, and Microsoft SharePoint kind of is a bit of a grandmother's attic with it. Everything gets kind of jammed in there, but it's kind of hard to find, and it's not really -- information is not being pushed to you, and it's not that type of Facebook or Twitter-like architecture. And then we see this great opportunity in building a public data cloud. We managed already about 1 billion contacts for our customers, and we're asking them if they want to participate in our public beta cloud, and then they have the opportunity to cleanse their data more aggressively. This can be a key part of cloud computing because of the crowd-sourcing model. And these are kind of our five areas that we're really excited about. So we've got the pedal to the metal, and the way we have to do that is we have to generally think one year out or two years out -- but really, one-year out. So the investments and things that you are seeing us make now, we're really thinking about fiscal year '12, and we really think about the level of distribution capacity we want to have online for next year based on the fundamental direction of the market. Today, we already have a lot of distribution capacity. We have that globally. We're able to operate with fluidity of a global stage, but we want to have more capacity because honestly, in my opinion, this is a distribution-constrained organization. When you look at our lead flows, when you look at the product capabilities, when you look at the size of the markets that we can address, we are fundamentally distribution constrained, and I believe the best thing for the shareholders is to expand distribution, and this is the majority of the investment. And then some slight additional investment is, obviously, were acquired our way into the data cloud. That was not an organic development because we felt it could be a separate platform, and they have the right technology and model at jigsaw.com. And then we have a couple of tuck-in acquisitions, which is not unusual for us. We have a history of tuck-ins. But we found a couple of really cool companies that we think will make our sales service and collaboration clouds better and more competitive. And I think that, that's kind of a -- I would say there's a run rate over the past few years with those tuck-ins. But when you take those tuck-ins and then you combine them with Jigsaw, then it's a little bit more acquisition activity this year than in previous years. And I'll let Graham actually speak to the numbers, but that's generally how we look at the problem right now."

We're investing heavily to expand their distribution capacity. But I would think a good yardstick is going to be four to eight quarters out, we're looking to get that business to breakeven. And certainly, if you look at the tuck-ins, there's an impact this year. But clearly next year, as Marc said, we should build that into our run rate of development spend. And I think certainly, this had an impact our gains. We've had to take that into account this year. But I think look to cash low, if you like, as a true north of our operating performance, that we feel we're incrementally more optimistic this quarter about cash flow. We've said we think cash flow is going to grow at the same rate as revenue. Last quarter, we said we thought slightly less than revenue. So I think that's the second set of numbers to look at and make sure that, clearly, we're operating the business well."

That's a lot of customer, and they're very diverse portfolio of customers; geographies, language, industries, markets and so forth and so on. And all of these customers are going to have this just flipped on basically, and all they need to do to have it running is they need to have a modern browser, which is they need to have IE8. They need to have Chrome. They need to have Firefox or Safari. And not all of them do. By the way, there's a huge percentage of the industry that's still, for example, on IE6. So some customers will have to upgrade. Now that said, we have a lot of really positive data points on this product. But when you're in this kind of early days, it's hard to exactly put your finger on the materiality to the business. Number one, it's great marketing. It's unbelievable marketing. All of my demonstrations if you've been watching them on YouTube or whatever here in Japan. I've done over eight major presentations here in Japan over the past two weeks, and I'm going to be doing a major presentation on Tuesday in Singapore at the Cloudforce to feature this technology. And customers are definitely stunned and they want it. It kind of takes the competition issue off the table unusually fast because it's clear as day that this is not what competitors have. Competitors still kind of have the old sales force automation, contact account opportunity, forecast reports or the old customer service products, the cases, the solutions, the knowledge management, the analytics; or the old platform, the database, the app server, the forms, the tools and the reports. And we have that, too, of course, as a service, multi-tenant shared. But then when you layer on this social model and then deliver that user interface that makes everything look like what they're spending their time on, which is Facebook and Twitter, well, then that's the big game changer. And it's very motivating, I think, that the customers get quite emotional about the product, which is very exciting and, certainly, the leaders of the organizations do. And we had a great experience here, but we have a lot of banks here in Japan who use our product. And there's one very large banking group that's quite decentralized, and they did something unusual. They brought all their CIOs in to meet with us, and I don't think they have actually ever done that before as an organization, and they were just wanting to get an update on using the Sales technology. And we're all sitting in the room and, of course, I do the whole presentation on Cloud 2. And I'm sure you've seen -- it's my most recent stump speech. And then I do my whole demo, but it's run by one of our SE here in Japan. We're using Japanese -- we're using the new Sony Ericsson phone with Google Android on it as a demonstration device. I've got an iPad. We've got a BlackBerry with DOCOMO on it. We've got an iPhone running SoftBank. And at the end of it, we thought we're just looking for more orders on sales force automation, right, from these CIOs. We want to be the sales solution for the banks, of course. And the result is not bad, which is they come up to me and say, ""Oh no, I want to be your first enterprise-wide on Chatter in Japan. And when exactly? I want it now."" And I love that. And we just need to figure out getting it to them. We have it. The code is essentially in production at this point. And on one of our pods, we can actually turn on more customers at will. I think that we feel very good about the technology quality. We feel very good about where it is as a version 1. It's an unusually good version 1. And our version 2 and 3 and 4, which will also be coming out within the next six months is also awesome. Between now and the end of the year, I think we're going to see a lot of customers. I think by the time we get to Dreamforce, we will see a lot of customers on Chatter. And I just can't tell you if we're going to have four, five CIOs onstage at Dreamforce or CEOs saying, ""I want enterprise-wide with Chatter and here is why, and here is what it's done for me."" All I can tell you is my personal experience that it's completely transformed Salesforce.com. Certainly, it's broken me out of my bubble as a CEO, I have visibility in my organization I never had. Deep into my sales information, deep into my customer service inquiries, deep into my products, deep into my competitors, and I'm outside of the CEO bubble. And every CEO gets trapped in it because only you have your direct reports. You get out and you make a few customer calls. You meet some employees. You're doing a lot of email, and that's your bubble, and I'm out of it. And I think other CEOs see when we're doing the demo that it can do that for them and that's going to let someone like me make better decisions like the decision we've made to grow because we see the opportunities, so it's like grow, grow it higher and let's go. And in certain markets -- like one of the reasons that I'm here is I saw an inordinate amount of activity in Japan and I'm like, ""Wow, maybe we should be making a disproportionate investment in Japan because it's so awesome here. So I think that we've got a great thing on our hands, but I wish I could say, kind of getting back to Heather Bellini's question, tell me about the revenue. What's more important? Is it Service Cloud or Chatter? Right now, it's all about Sales Cloud and Service Cloud because those are multi-billion dollar markets, ready to go. Yes, collaboration is also a multi-billion dollar market ready to go, but we'll not going to know until we get it out there. So come June 22, to San Jose, to the convention center, talk to the customers, also talk to the ISVs who are building on Chatter. All of our ISVs are rebuilding their apps on Chatter, and customers who have built native Force.com apps are having unusual experiences. We held a user group meeting here in Japan, a customer stood up, he is a very senior and very well-respected engineer at NTT, which is the big telecommunications company here, and said, ""I just have to say something about Chatter."" And I said, ""What is it?"" He goes, ""I don't understand this, my business is tweeting me. My applications are tweeting me."" And this is changing how I think about applications. And I'm excited, but now I need to see the rubber hit the road, and we hope we'll have some very specific transaction discussions for you in the coming quarters."

I recently had a meeting at a major venture capital firm on Sand Hill Road with about 30 of the largest CIOs in the world, and their message to us is your technology is great, and we're having a great experience. We've been testing it for the last two or three or four years, and we want to buy more of it.

On average, we're in about 15% to 20% of our employees in one of our customers. So that tends to be the sales organization in total. Obviously, our percentage is much higher at Salesforce or more than twice that. But the average company is about 20% for sales. And that's how they look at distribution, and we're generally in there for that. Maybe we have some service users too. Maybe they've built some custom apps. But there aren't too many examples where every user has a license already. Dell is one where we have an ELA. We have a few other ELAs. But the vast majority of our 77,000 customers is kind of that 20% level on average. That's my gut. Maybe it's kind of hard for me to exactly know because we don't run that report. But I would say just at a gut level and that our opportunity is to go from that, let's say at 77,000 companies and let's say, so couple the 3 million users to -- we want to get over. I guess I should say our goal or our dream or our vision is that within the next year is to move that to over 10 million users on Salesforce's services, and that Chatter is our directional vehicle to do that. And we think that, that's the right strategy. It's the right technology, and I think that's the possibility. I'm not giving you that as kind of a forward-looking guidance thing that we're going to 10 million users. But in theory, that's the potential. We think that, that's the big potential, the big kahuna."

[Japanese] And greetings everybody from Tokyo, Japan. We're excited to be hosting today's call this morning from our offices on the 39th floor of Roppongi Tower here in Tokyo.

We're excited to be hosting today's call this morning from our offices on the 39th floor of Roppongi Tower here in Tokyo. Japanese have been pioneers in cloud computing and leaders in many key areas in cloud computing, including 3G and social networking, as well as e-commerce. And our Japanese business unit continues to turn in amazing results quarter-after-quarter. Currently, Japan is our second largest market outside of the United States.
 I spent the better part of May here in Japan talking to customers, speaking at Ministry events and even have the opportunity to meet with the Minister of Technology. And I also, yesterday, met with the Prime Minister of Japan, and fundamentally, to discuss one thing, that cloud computing is a tremendous accelerator for the economics and businesses of Japan. And I believe this is even more strong than ever before after spending this extended period here in Tokyo.
 Our first quarter was a terrific kick off to 2011 on virtually every front. Our business is gaining momentum globally. On the customer front, a record 4,800 net new customers contributed towards our fastest business growth in more than two years. On the technology front, we're positioned to create much higher levels of customer success with the coming additions of incredible new technology, including: Salesforce Chatter, our enterprise collaboration service; Salesforce Jigsaw, the leader in crowdsourced data services, the emergence of the data cloud; and VMforce, the world's first Java cloud. So in these three critical new areas, the collaboration cloud, the data cloud and the Java cloud, Salesforce.com is really defining the very next level of our growth and technology capability for our customers.
 And finally on the financial front, we delivered another spectacular quarter. Let me begin with some of the financial highlights for the quarter. Revenue increased by 24% from a year ago to $377 million. Well, that was our best growth performance in five quarters. And even more incredibly, we're delivering this growth as we pushed through the $1.5 billion annual revenue run rate threshold, that is really amazing, and starts to focus us very acutely and clearly on that elusive and very important $2 billion annual revenue milestone.
 While our GAAP EPS of $0.13 was down a bit from last year due primarily to the imputed interest on our convertible note, our non-GAAP EPS rose to $0.30 from $0.28 to a year ago. We're committed to growing profit, even as we increase our investments in top line growth. But by far, most exciting financial achievement in the quarter was our record cash generation. Until now, we've never eclipsed the $100 million threshold for operating cash flow. However, not only did we break through that threshold in the first quarter, we absolutely obliterated that milestone.
 Cash from operations totaled more than $140 million in the quarter, an increase of more than 40% from a year ago, and this translates into more than $1 per share of operating cash flow in a single quarter, roughly the same we earned in the entire first half of our last fiscal year ago. Nothing speaks more to the operating strength and quality of our business than our continued strong cash generation.
 Our financial success was powered by another quarter of incredible customer success. In fact, we delivered our biggest new business growth quarter since our amazing fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, and our 4,800 net customer additions was an all-time high for the company. Simply put, demand for Salesforce.com services has never been better worldwide.
 And as we continue to achieve this success by beating the biggest, most important software companies in the world, I guess to Oracle, this quarter, we won significant new or add-on business at Informatica, Sony Ericsson, Symantec, MasterCard, GE Australia, Motorola. Here in Japan, we've beat them at Canon and Fujitsu, two of the most important companies in the country, Pitney Bowes, ASA and Waste Management. And against an unnamed patent troll, we won business at Abbott Labs, Mercury Insurance, Ingram Micro, Austin Ventures and Salient Surgical. And finally, while SAP struggles to redefine itself, we won business against them at Häagen-Dazs, Carestream and NVIDIA.
 In total, across all of our businesses, we've added roughly 18,000 net new customers over the past year to bring our global community to more than 77,000 customers using Salesforce.com and our platform. That's an increase of more than 30% in just 12 months. It's really incredible growth. This massive community represents a huge growth opportunity for us over the next decade.
 In the near term, by adding additional services that create broader customer success, we plan to drive new and greater account penetration, and we're going to talk about that with our strategy to go enterprise wide with Salesforce Chatter. Longer term, we hope to benefit from the obvious network effects that we are creating between a huge ecosystem of cloud customers, a cloud platform and developers, all running on this Force.com environment.
 Also important, our growth continues to diversify. While our flagship Sales Cloud continues to drive the majority of new business, roughly 1/3 of new business in the first quarter came from Service and Platform Clouds. And of our top five largest transactions this quarter, three were Sales Cloud deals, one was Service Cloud deal and one was a Platform Cloud deal.
 Our Service Cloud business, in particular, is showing tremendous momentum in the marketplace. Gartner recently named our Service Cloud a leader in its Magic Quadrant for customer service contact centers. And new business for our Service Cloud grew at triple-digit rates for the second quarter in a row. Just awesome for this new product.
 During the first quarter, we won exciting new Service Cloud transactions at global leaders like USAA. Here in Japan at the Ministry of Land Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Iron Mountain, Motorola, U.S. Census Bureau, Abbott Labs, Procter & Gamble and McKesson. And these customers are just a few of the roughly 9,000 customers now using our Service Cloud today.
 Our Platform business also delivered outstanding growth in the quarter, including our largest transaction just down the street here at Japan's Ministry of the Environment. This opportunity expands on the eco-point program, now a very famous in Japan that we've discussed in prior quarters, and joins a long list of platform wins at both new and existing customers, including Avon, NVIDIA, the California State Automobile Association and the premier organization in Japan, Tokio Marine.
 I'm also thrilled to announce that both Computer Associates and BMC have gone live with their native Force.com cloud applications built at 100% natively on the Force.com platform. And Pitney Bowes recently agreed to build their next generation of insurance solutions for policy coding and underwriting natively on the Force.com platform.
 And we're not just growing customers and partners with the platform, transaction volume grew more than 40% year-over-year in the first quarter to nearly $20 billion. That translates into more than 2,500 transactions every second of every day in the quarter. It's an incredible number. Nothing speaks more to the value of our customers than them actually using the product with the speed and reliability and capability that we're known for.
 Availability and performance were once again outstanding at 99.9% in 300 milliseconds respectively. And our developer community now stands at more than 250,000 developers globally, an increase of more than 100,000 since last year.
 Look, we feel more than ever and especially in today's global environment, and as we make on-site checks like we're doing like here in the one in Japan, that the time to invest in this company is now. All of our success this quarter demonstrates the massive shift we see globally in cloud computing. Businesses of every type are increasingly looking to the cloud to solve their challenges and they're starting to look at the cloud in a whole new way.
 The first phase of cloud computing was about leveraging technologies that were low cost, fast and easy-to-use. But as we're here in Japan and throughout some of our other presentations, recently in the United States and in Europe, the next phase of cloud computing, or we call Cloud 2, represents the next generation. One that is more social, more mobile, more real-time and delivers a completely new and dynamic experience to the user. The market opportunity for cloud computing is enormous, and the time for us to invest in capturing this market has never been better.
 We have the clear market leadership, we have the brand leadership and we have key positions in every global market in the world. We are completely focused on growing customer and financial momentum and a favorable competitive position against the biggest legacy software companies in the world. All of whom seem to be more focused on consolidation than innovation. That's why we're ramping up our investments to ensure that we continue to lead the most important market in enterprise technology today. We're aggressively adding sales capacity, hiring sales people, account executives, systems engineers and managers and investing in innovation that trades greater levels of customer success in our five key clouds, our Sales Cloud, our Service Cloud, our Collaboration Cloud, our Data Cloud and our Platform. Three exciting new technologies that all embrace the power of Cloud 2 and have our customers buzzing are Salesforce Chatter, Salesforce Jigsaw and our new alliance with VMware, VMforce.
 First on Chatter. Look, the response to Chatter has been nothing short of amazing. Few times in my career have I seen really the emergence of a real killer app. I certainly saw it with Oracle with the Oracle Database, I certainly saw it with SalesForce.com with our core SFA [sales force automation]. But now, I believe that I'm personally working on the largest and most important application in my career, and I've never been more excited. And no matter what market I bring it to, whether it's the United States, whether it's Europe or even here in Japan, amazingly, the demonstrations that I make create an almost visceral reaction with a customer that they want the technology immediately. And what's amazing about it is, it's not just some point solution or business line solution, it's Salesforce.com's first enterprise-wide solution. And we routinely hear now that the customer wants 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,000 users of Salesforce Chatter, and we're very excited about getting this product into production.
 After starting with 100 customers, our beta program has quickly grew to 500. And today, I'm thrilled to say that more than 1,000 customers are now using the beta version of Salesforce Chatter. Not only are they collaborating with fellow employees, but they're using the service to collaborate around data, documents and apps. It's all in real-time. And it's very familiar to them. It's exactly the same experience that they get whether they're on the United States on Facebook or in Japan, Twitter's really on fire here, and it's the same experience as Twitter for them.
 This common experience of a social network applied to compelling critical data deeply integrated them to their business, pulling out their sales data, their account data, their product data, their content, and presenting it to them in this user-friendly way is a huge breakthrough. It's all in realtime and it's on any Internet-connected device, including BlackBerrys and iPhones, and what we've been demonstrating here in Japan, the iPad.
 Chatter is really important for three key reasons. First, Chatter is, as I said, our first enterprise-wide application. Every employee in every department at every business of every size can absolutely benefit from this technology. And that's a huge opportunity for growth, and it also becomes a Trojan horse for future enterprise-wide usage of the Force.com platform.
 Second, because Chatter is built on Force.com, every application built on our platform will inherit the benefits of next-generation collaboration. Not just Sales and Service, but every custom app and every custom object will be Chatterized immediately, in realtime, with no coding, and that's the incredible power of multitenancy.
 And finally, Chatter immediately makes our Sales and Service Clouds even more compelling and more differentiated than our competition than ever before. On April 8, in New York, we demonstrated to more than 1,000 attendees how Chatter will improve customer service by better connecting call center agents, technology experts and information within their companies. We had a spectacular reaction from these customers. And better customer experience and one that is less costly is something they all want and view as a killer combination.
 I am excited to announce that all 77,000 customers will have Chatter, be live and be production with Chatter when it becomes available on June 22. We will be holding an event in San Jose on June 22, which will also be our Developer Conference. And I'd like to invite all of you to come and see the next generation of innovation in action. You're going to be seeing with Salesforce Chatter what really is, I believe, the next major wave of cloud computing.
 Earlier this month, we also closed our acquisition of Jigsaw, the leader in crowdsource business contact data. Jigsaw was a great acquisition for us for several reasons. First, Jigsaw's data services strengthen and differentiate our core business, enabling us to deliver a new level of CRM [customer relationship management] success. Put simply, better data turns killer apps into killer solutions. And for existing customers, we believe Jigsaw will translate into higher levels of customer satisfaction, stickiness and much lower attrition.
 Second, Jigsaw creates a new growth opportunity for Salesforce.com in the $3 billion business-to-business data services industry. By delivering a fully integrated application and data solution, much in the way that Apple has with iTunes and the iPod, we believe we'll be well positioned to capture a growing piece of this market.
 And third, by deeply integrating data into our core services, we're laying the foundation for a rich data ecosystem, one that will build the easily appear into our other applications like Chatter or the Sales Cloud or the Service Cloud. You can imagine changes to your contact information, a phone number, maybe a news story or a stock indication automatically appearing in the Chatter feed all through the Salesforce Jigsaw. We believe that this, too, will create new opportunities for customer and revenue growth in the future creating the concept of the data cloud. And Jigsaw makes our core stronger and positions us for growth in the future, and it's tightly integrated with everything we do at Salesforce. You can check it out today at www.jigsaw.com.
 And finally, together with VMware, we closed our first quarter by announcing a major alliance to jointly deliver, sell and support a new Java cloud called VMforce. With VMforce, more than 6 million enterprise Java developers globally, including 2 million using the Spring network, will have an open path to cloud computing. And Force.com developers, who traditionally have been using the Apex technology, will have the opportunity to use Java.  In addition, CIOs are going to love that the Force.com platform is trusted and open. And users are going to love the result in applications, which are going to be social, mobile and collaborative and easy-to-use. By building Java apps on Force.com, developers will immediately benefit from.
 Force.com's database is a service, which delivers proven reliability, scalability and flexibility in the most transparent and trusted enterprise cloud today, where VMware strong Spring environment becomes a client to this service. And Force.com Chatter services that enable collaboration features to be fully integrated into their Java applications, and the Force.com developer program providing access to pre-built business services like search, identity and security, workflow reporting and analytics, are robust web services integration API [Application Programming Interface] in the ability to mobilize any application to virtually any mobile device.  And best of all, all these capabilities will be available immediately in realtime without the need for any custom coding. Again, that's the power of cloud computing.
 We're thrilled to be working with VMware on such game-changing technology and we're looking forward to having the services available for developer preview later this year. We've never been more excited than having a Java cloud, and we couldn't have a better partner than our good friends in VMware.
 To close, our first quarter was a spectacular way to kick off our fiscal year 2011, including financial momentum, customer momentum and innovation momentum that we believe is setting the stage for greater customer success in the future. We're investing heavily in our sales capacity, in our growth capacity, in our distribution capacity, and innovation to ensure that our continued leadership in the most exciting and important market in enterprise business technology today.
 And with that, let me turn it over to Graham to discuss our amazing first quarter results in more detail.
"
122917,105275434,63208,"Salesforce.com, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May-20-2010",2010-05-20,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives"," Thanks, Marc. Q1 was an excellent quarter by almost every measure. We saw a very strong new business. Attrition continued on a downward path, and we had a great start to the year from an operating cash flow perspective. Let me get into the detail. Reve",1765," Thanks, Marc. Q1 was an excellent quarter by almost every measure. We saw a very strong new business. Attrition continued on a downward path, and we had a great start to the year from an operating cash flow perspective.
 Let me get into the detail. Revenue of $377 million rose 24% year-over-year and was well above our outlook, primarily the result of strong new business, and to a lesser extent, the continuing reduction in the rate of attrition.
 From a geographic mix perspective, our International business continues to expand as a percentage of our revenue. Europe posted revenue of almost $67 million, that's represented growth of 30% in dollars and approximately 25% in local currency versus the year-ago quarter.
 Driven by continued strength in Japan, revenue in Asia rose 55% in dollars and 50% in local currency year-over-year. We also crossed an exciting threshold in Asia this quarter with revenue of just over $50 million. That's an annual revenue run rate that now exceeds $200 million.
 And finally, revenue in the Americas rose by 18% from Q1 of last year. Overall, our company growth rate of 24% benefited from a roughly one point currency tailwind from last year.
 Our first quarter revenue benefited from another downtick in our dollar attrition rate, which is the third sequential quarter of slight reduction. We think the economy is helping, but we're also doing a lot of things internally to try and minimize this number.
 And now on to rest of the income statement. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 82% increased one point from year-ago quarter. The gross margin on our Subscription and Support business improved by around half a point as we achieved greater scale and drove efficiency by deploying new service in storage, and our gross margin also benefited from a mix shift away from professional services to Subscription and Support.
 Non-GAAP operating expenses increased to 66% of revenue, that's up two points from last year. This increase is a result of us investing for growth this year versus being a much more cautious mode in Q1 a year ago. Primary expense driver is of course headcount. We added 137 heads to finish the quarter, which is over 4,100 employees. This compares with just 40 heads we added in Q1 last year. We expect to hire more heads in Q2 than we did in the first quarter and to continue hiring aggressively for the remainder of the year.
 With the acquisition of Jigsaw, which will add approximately $14 million to GAAP revenue and approximately $38 million to non-GAAP expenses for the remainder of fiscal 2011, we now estimate that our non-GAAP operating margin will be approximately flat with last year. I'll have more detailed commentary on the Jigsaw acquisition later in my remarks.
 As our business and profitability scale internationally, our tax rate continues to decline. In Q1, our non-GAAP tax rate fell two points from a year ago to 37%. Turning to cash flow, as Marc noted, our Q1 operating cash flow was a company record of $143 million, that's an increase of approximately 46% from last year. Of note, the quarter result did benefit from a one-time $12 million tax refund related to our fiscal 2010 tax year.
 As I mentioned earlier, we do plan to ramp hiring aggressively, as well as invest in Jigsaw during the remainder of fiscal 2011. But after such a strong start to the year, we now expect operating cash flow for the year will likely grow at roughly the same pace as our projected revenue growth.
 Capital spending for the quarter was approximately $12 million, primarily for the leasehold improvements and capitalized software. Free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx, was $131 million or just under $1 per share for the first quarter. This was an increase of 54% from last year when we delivered roughly $85 million or $0.67 per share of free cash flow.
 The strong cash generation fortified our already strong balance sheet. Cash and equivalents ended the quarter at approximately $1.9 billion. That's up roughly $175 million from Q4. Net cash, excluding net proceeds of approximately $500 million from our convertible debt offering ended the quarter at $1.4 billion, that's up more than 40% from Q1 of last year. As an aside, remember that the convertible debt shows up on our balance sheet as $450 million because it includes the debt discount. This cash balance gives us great flexibility to make strategic investments to extend our leadership as we did this quarter with the acquisition of Jigsaw.
 As you know, Q1 is seasonally our strongest collections quarter. This year, accounts receivable balance fell by almost $140 million from Q4 to finish the quarter at roughly $180 million. Our receivables aging and collections continue to be excellent. We ended the quarter with a DSO of 44 days. That's flat with Q1 last year.
 Deferred revenue finished the quarter at $665 million, down roughly $40 million from Q4, but up $115 million or 21% from Q1 last year, well above our expectations. As I'll discuss more when I get to our outlook, the current dollar-euro exchange rate will likely create a significant headwind for us to the remainder of fiscal 2011. In Q1, our deferred revenue balance was reduced by roughly $10 million when compared with the fourth quarter balance as a result of currency effects. On a year-over-year basis, FX had a minimal impact on deferred revenue growth.
 Before I get to our specific outlook, let me discuss three items that will impact our results for the remainder of the year. The Jigsaw acquisition, the dollar-euro exchange rate and two small technology acquisitions, on which we're currently working. First, Jigsaw, as you all know, business combination accounting rules require that we write down the majority of Jigsaw's deferred revenue to its fair value. The actual amount that we estimate will be written off is approximately $7 million. And as a result, we project Jigsaw-related revenue for the remainder of fiscal 2011 to be approximately $14 million on a GAAP basis. On the earnings front, as we disclosed on April 21, we expect Jigsaw to be dilutive to our fiscal 2011 earnings to non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.11 and the GAAP EPS by roughly $0.20.
 Turning next to FX. When we gave guidance for Q1 and fiscal year 2011 on our February 24 conference call, the dollar-euro conversion rate was about $1.35. By quarter's end, that rate had declined to $1.33. Today it stands at around, somewhere around $1.24, that's close to a 9% devaluation. And as I indicated a moment ago, this rate change is already showing up in our sequential deferred revenue movement.
 Looking ahead, revenue for the remainder of the year will likely also be affected assuming rates don't move materially from today. We now estimate that the change in the dollar euro FX rate will reduce Q2 revenue by approximately $7 million when compared with Q1. An impact to Q2 through Q4 will be to reduce revenue by roughly $20 million when compared with our assumptions back in February. Although the euro depreciation hurts our profitability, we've been able to offset the impact by raising our revenue guidance based on a stronger outlook for the new business in fiscal 2011.
 Finally, we're very close to closing two small transactions to add key technologies to our platform. These acquisitions will bring a small amount of revenue with them, but overall, they will reduce our reported non-GAAP EPS by roughly $0.02 for the remainder of the year and our GAAP EPS by roughly $0.03. We will continue to opportunistically pursue these types of transactions as we believe they are very important to extending the value of our services and our leadership in the market.
 With that context, let me now offer some details around our non-GAAP outlook. For the full fiscal year, despite a very significant currency headwind I mentioned earlier, our strong Q1 performance and pipeline give us confidence to raise our revenue expectation for the full year to approximately $1.54 billion to $1.555 billion.
 We are adjusting our non-GAAP EPS outlook today by approximately $0.13 to reflect the impact of Jigsaw and a two small asset acquisitions I mentioned a moment ago. Including those items and holding our core business expectations constant, we now expect non-GAAP EPS for the full year in the range of approximately $1.13 to $1.15. This estimate excludes the effects of stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and amortization of the debt discount on our convertible debt and of course the related tax effects of these three items.
 Also as you model our EPS results for the year, it's important to remember that our Dreamforce event, which we estimate will have approximately a $0.05 impact overall, as well as seasonally high commission cost, will cause our fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS to be at roughly the same level as Q2.
 It's also important to understand that after such a strong first quarter, we will definitely be making decisions that support our growth objectives, as Marc's recently just discussed, such as hiring in sales, technical operations and development, as well as continuing to look at acquisitions.
 Turning now to the second quarter. As I indicated, the weakening of the euro is expected to create a $7 million headwind to Q2 revenue. We expect our revenue for the second quarter to be in the range of $381 million to $383 million. And I'd like to remind you that last year, we actually had a $4 million sequential tailwind due to the euro strengthening as we move from Q1 to Q2.
 Our non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter will be impacted by the same items that impacted the full year, and that totals specifically $0.03 relating to Jigsaw and the two technology-asset acquisitions. In that context, we now expect non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter to be approximately $0.26 to $0.27. This estimate also excludes the effects of stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and the amortization of the debt discount on our convertible debt. All of the details of our non-GAAP outlook, as well as our GAAP outlook and a full reconciliation between the two, can be found in our press release issued earlier today.
 To conclude, Q1 was an excellent quarter. We delivered outstanding financial results, executed well in making investments we think are necessary to ensure our continued cloud industry leadership. We look forward to providing an update on our progress in August. And with that, let me open up the call to your questions.

But the real star of the quarter was that Service Cloud. And that Service Cloud has seen triple digit growth, it's a hot market, it's a market that has not been refreshed by the traditional enterprise technology vendors. We don't have -- we view it very much as a green field opportunity. A lot of those customers who are using products like Siebel 7.8, they have to make a tremendous decision to upgrade to Siebel 8, which is a huge new mega piece of software and architecture customization, everything is new. And so it's been giving us a great opportunity, and that's why we've seen some fantastic customers move to our Service Cloud like companies like VMware that I mentioned or like Thomson Reuters and many others. And we have a really solid pipeline for this product. So I always will go with the bird in the hand. Now that said, we have a really awesome pipeline already for enterprise-wide deals for Chatter. And how those actually work out when the customer gets it in agreement, well, I would rather have sign quite a few of those before I make a prediction on that. So I will say certainly for the short term, we've got some really hot existing products like the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud and the Platform. I will tell you that Chatter makes the Service Cloud even better. In my own personal use of Chatter everyday, the way I have it architected, I am able to follow a customer case of the same way that I can follow an employee in the company and I'm able to follow that case. And as the case changes and the company, as things happen, as transactions happen with the case, maybe service entitlements are reached or it's escalated to different managers, I'm all notified through my Chatter feed. And that kind of real-time access to customer service information and that kind of visibility from Chatter into the Service Cloud makes the Service Cloud even better. So you're going to see a major new version of the Service Cloud released on June 22. So it's kind of a win-win there, but in terms of pure revenue, I'm going to go with Service Cloud.

First, I just want to mention in regards to currency, all of us, of course, remember the tremendous changes in the euro that happened a couple of years ago, and that created a type of, I would say, almost kind of a post-traumatic euro disorder with us. So we, obviously, have a lot more experience in foreign exchange as, I think, everyone on the call does. And we are, I think, taking appropriate measures because we have seen some unprecedented things with the euro in the last couple of weeks again, and there were some very strong articles yesterday in the Wall Street Journal on the euro. And I think that Graham's comments regarding foreign exchange and how it could potentially impact our revenue are extremely appropriate. And of course we want the best. We want the euro to go back up to $1.40 or whatever it is. And we wish the euro well, but we also are just realistic based on the current situation. And specifically to your question about Chatter, what I've been seeing is a couple of few things. First, in demonstrating to customers who are coming into our customer visit centers around the world or where we're going out, when we're demonstrating kind of like what I mentioned to Heather with the Service Cloud or even the Sales Cloud or even in custom applications, it's a huge wow. And for those point solutions and for those business line solutions, we've got a huge new competitive differentiator, and it's integration with mobility and just the visionary aspect of the product, and also that it's working and that so many customers have it, and that they're going to have it when they buy the product, and that this is not some big future, that has been pretty awesome. Number two, I've personally had quite a few situations now where I'm in with either a CIO or a CEO demonstrating Chatter to them, initially just telling them how their sales users are going to do better. There was a case where a company here in Japan, I won't give you the name, but they've got about 20,000 employees. And it's a very well-known company, and they've got, I don't know, maybe they've got a couple of thousand users on Salesforce.com for their sales force. And when we were in with their CEO presenting to him and a few key members of his management team, he stood up and he said, ""I've been on Twitter, I've been using Twitter everyday to kind of get my message out to the market and, in effect, what the government is thinking about us and what our customers are thinking about us. This is like a private-enterprise Twitter, but it's integrated with my core data. I want this in the hands of every one of my employees."" Now I don't know what that initially means in terms of revenue and deployment because we're not there yet. And I think that by the time we get to the next call, we'll have more data. Certainly, as we kind of head towards the end of the fiscal year, we're going to have some transactions under our belt. So we can only hypothesize that it's not just making our core technology better and more differentiated, but it's definitely giving us the possibility of this enterprise-wide app. And we have seen that in a number of customers, and I am extremely optimistic about that. When we turn on Salesforce Chatter, all 77,000 customers just get it. It becomes the new user interface. And then built into the product in the next release is the ability to kind of just automatically spawn from any user's account another user on the network and bring them into their Chatter feed. And we think that the viral nature of that has just tremendous potential within the existing enterprise. And then we're looking at doing things outside of the enterprise, but this is kind of a more of a future thing. By the time we get to Dreamforce, we hope to be able to kind of clearly articulate to you the future direction of the product, but also I think we'll be able to have customers onstage who have actually deployed it enterprise-wide. There have been customers on beta already who have had a real conversations with us, and we have upgraded them to be enterprise-wide. They're reporting it to become a dramatic change in how they communicate and collaborate with their employees and their core business information. And additionally, they report that there is some significant, usually double-digit drop on email usage, that this becomes kind of a preferred communication system for them. So this is very -- we're very optimistic, but we're also cautious because until we get those real numbers like we are it's kind of like a year ago with the Service Cloud. A year ago with the Service Cloud, we had just announced it in New York, and we are very excited about it. But there's no way I could know today that we've got triple-digit growth and we've got the makings of a multi-hundred million dollar -- billion-dollar product line, basically. So we don't have that level of detail quite yet. With the Service Cloud, we do. Obviously, with the Sales Cloud, we have a billion-dollar product. The Service Cloud looks like they have another billion-dollar product with a platform. That's also the emergence. That's also has very strong growth. And that's a product that we want to grow to a billion dollars. But Chatter has got the right stuff I would say.

You can read that in the newspaper. And we do have enhanced technology spending. You hear that from every technology CEO. And we know that cloud computing is the fastest-growing part of the technology industry. You can see that when you aggregate all the cloud computing companies together. And we're number one in cloud computing. You can see that from our revenue where we have just passed the $1.5 billion annual revenue run rate, and now we're aggressively targeting the $2 billion number. So our position is because we believe that there are certain parts of cloud computing that are extremely attractive, now different companies focus on different parts of cloud computing. And some focus on infrastructure. Some focus on the development platform. Some focus on apps, and some focus renaming their existing data-center products' cloud. And I would say that for us, of course, we're very focused in those five core areas that we see the real action in, which is the customer-facing apps like sales and service. We see a lot of action, obviously, in the development platform and the way our customers customize as well as having core ISVs building on our platform like BMC and Computer Associates. With the platform, we're very, obviously, excited about the opportunity for collaboration as a service because honestly, the customers certainly here in Japan are just fed up with IBM and Lotus Notes and can't believe the state of that technology, and Microsoft SharePoint kind of is a bit of a grandmother's attic with it. Everything gets kind of jammed in there, but it's kind of hard to find, and it's not really -- information is not being pushed to you, and it's not that type of Facebook or Twitter-like architecture. And then we see this great opportunity in building a public data cloud. We managed already about 1 billion contacts for our customers, and we're asking them if they want to participate in our public beta cloud, and then they have the opportunity to cleanse their data more aggressively. This can be a key part of cloud computing because of the crowd-sourcing model. And these are kind of our five areas that we're really excited about. So we've got the pedal to the metal, and the way we have to do that is we have to generally think one year out or two years out -- but really, one-year out. So the investments and things that you are seeing us make now, we're really thinking about fiscal year '12, and we really think about the level of distribution capacity we want to have online for next year based on the fundamental direction of the market. Today, we already have a lot of distribution capacity. We have that globally. We're able to operate with fluidity of a global stage, but we want to have more capacity because honestly, in my opinion, this is a distribution-constrained organization. When you look at our lead flows, when you look at the product capabilities, when you look at the size of the markets that we can address, we are fundamentally distribution constrained, and I believe the best thing for the shareholders is to expand distribution, and this is the majority of the investment. And then some slight additional investment is, obviously, were acquired our way into the data cloud. That was not an organic development because we felt it could be a separate platform, and they have the right technology and model at jigsaw.com. And then we have a couple of tuck-in acquisitions, which is not unusual for us. We have a history of tuck-ins. But we found a couple of really cool companies that we think will make our sales service and collaboration clouds better and more competitive. And I think that, that's kind of a -- I would say there's a run rate over the past few years with those tuck-ins. But when you take those tuck-ins and then you combine them with Jigsaw, then it's a little bit more acquisition activity this year than in previous years. And I'll let Graham actually speak to the numbers, but that's generally how we look at the problem right now.

That's a lot of customer, and they're very diverse portfolio of customers; geographies, language, industries, markets and so forth and so on. And all of these customers are going to have this just flipped on basically, and all they need to do to have it running is they need to have a modern browser, which is they need to have IE8. They need to have Chrome. They need to have Firefox or Safari. And not all of them do. By the way, there's a huge percentage of the industry that's still, for example, on IE6. So some customers will have to upgrade. Now that said, we have a lot of really positive data points on this product. But when you're in this kind of early days, it's hard to exactly put your finger on the materiality to the business. Number one, it's great marketing. It's unbelievable marketing. All of my demonstrations if you've been watching them on YouTube or whatever here in Japan. I've done over eight major presentations here in Japan over the past two weeks, and I'm going to be doing a major presentation on Tuesday in Singapore at the Cloudforce to feature this technology. And customers are definitely stunned and they want it. It kind of takes the competition issue off the table unusually fast because it's clear as day that this is not what competitors have. Competitors still kind of have the old sales force automation, contact account opportunity, forecast reports or the old customer service products, the cases, the solutions, the knowledge management, the analytics; or the old platform, the database, the app server, the forms, the tools and the reports. And we have that, too, of course, as a service, multi-tenant shared. But then when you layer on this social model and then deliver that user interface that makes everything look like what they're spending their time on, which is Facebook and Twitter, well, then that's the big game changer. And it's very motivating, I think, that customers get quite emotional about the product, which is very exciting and, certainly, the leaders of the organizations do. And we had a great experience here, but we have a lot of banks here in Japan who use our product. And there's one very large banking group that's quite decentralized, and they did something unusual. They brought all their CIOs in to meet with us, and I don't think they have actually ever done that before as an organization, and they just wanted to get an update on using the Sales technology. And we're all sitting in the room and, of course, I do the whole presentation on Cloud 2. And I'm sure you've seen -- it's my most recent stump speech. And then I do my whole demo, but it's run by one of our SE here in Japan. We're using Japanese -- we're using the new Sony Ericsson phone with Google Android on it as a demonstration device. I've got an iPad. We've got a BlackBerry with [ph] DOCOMO on it. We've got an iPhone running Softbank. And at the end of it, we thought we're just looking for more orders on sales force automation, right, from these CIOs. We want to be the sales solution for the banks, of course. And the result is not bad, which is they come up to me and say, ""Oh no, I want to be your first enterprise-wide on Chatter in Japan. And when exactly? I want it now."" And I love that. And we just need to figure out getting it to them. We have it. The code is essentially production at this point. And on one of our pods, we can actually turn on more customers at will. I think that we feel very good about the technology quality. We feel very good about where it is as a version 1. It's an unusually good version 1. And our version 2 and 3 and 4, which will also be coming out within the next six months is also awesome. And I will -- between now and the end of the year, I think we're going to see a lot of customers. I think by the time we get to Dreamforce, we will see a lot of customers on Chatter. And I just can't tell you if we're going to have four, five CIOs onstage at Dreamforce or CEOs saying, ""I want enterprise-wide with Chatter and here is why, and here is what it's done for me."" All I can tell you is my personal experience that it's completely transformed Salesforce.com. Certainly, it's broken me out of my bubble as a CEO, I have visibility in my organization, I never had. Deep into my sales information, deep into my customer service inquiries, deep into my products, deep into my competitors, and I'm outside of the CEO bubble. And every CEO gets trapped in it because only you have your direct reports. You get out and you make a few customer calls. You meet some employees. You're doing a lot of email, and that's your bubble, and I'm out of it. And I think other CEOs see when we're doing the demo that it can do that for them and that's going to let someone like me make better decisions like the decision we've made to grow because we see the opportunities, so it's like grow, grow it higher and let's go. And in certain markets -- like one of the reasons that I'm here is I saw an inordinate amount of activity in Japan and I'm like, ""Wow, maybe we should be making a disproportionate investment in Japan because it's so awesome here. So I think that we've got a great thing on our hands, but I wish I could say, kind of getting back to Heather Bellini's question, tell me about the revenue. What's more important? Is it Service Cloud or Chatter? Right now, it's all about Sales Cloud and Service Cloud because those are multi-billion dollar markets, ready to go. Yes, collaboration is also a multi-billion dollar market ready to go, but we'll not going to know until we get it out there. So come June 22, to San Jose, to the convention center, talk to the customers, also talk to the ISVs who are building on Chatter. All of our ISVs are rebuilding their apps on Chatter, and customers who have built native force.com apps are having unusual experiences. We held a user group meeting here in Japan, a customer stood up, he is a very senior and very well-respected engineer at NTT, which is the big telecommunications company here, and said, ""I just have to say something about Chatter."" And I said, ""what is it?"" He goes, ""I don't understand this, my business is tweeting me. My applications are tweeting me."" And this is changing how I think about applications. And I'm excited, but now I need to see the rubber hit the road, and we hope we'll have some very specific transaction discussions for you in the coming quarters.

It's just not significant at that level. I should just say right off the bat, we can't comment on pending litigation, of course. Laura, the reality is that these patent trolls are unfortunately just part of doing business in technology these days. They're basically the alley thugs. Every thriving economy has alley thugs, and we do, too, and that's fine. Personally, I'm just disappointed to see this from a former leader of our industry, but it's imminently resolvable, and it's not material to our day-to-day business. It's basically a no-impact situation. It's not something that, I think, anyone needs to make anything of. I think it probably has more ramifications for other cloud vendors than it, honestly, does for us because we're strong. And a lot of other cloud CEOs have been contacting me, and my heart goes out to them and because I feel like that's the real impact is that if you go through it, you can see where this is going. And there's obviously a next step here, and it's not about us, it's about others. So that's my unfortunate commentary on the state of our industry. It's just what's going on in our industry.

And our business has never been -- and we've done this on purpose, it never swung one direction or the other based on any one particular transaction or customer. So we've closed a lot of big deals. We've closed a lot of big deals this quarter. I can tell you we're going to close a lot of big deals this year. I've seen the pipeline. I recently had a meeting at a major venture capital firm on Sand Hill road with about 30 of the largest CIOs in the world, and their message to us is your technology is great, and we're having a great experience. We've been testing it for the last two or three or four years, and we want to buy more of it. And that's generally an indication of better quality and larger deals coming, and we're excited about that. But we see a lot of those deals right now. We see more coming. But we see more business across the board because there's a fundamental shift happening to cloud computing that's benefiting a whole series of new companies and not benefiting old companies. And we are going to really, I think, continue to see the benefits of that because in my opinion, I'm biased, no one is better positioned for the future of the enterprise cloud than us. We've got the best products and technology. We've got the best sales organization. We've got the best brand and reputation with customers. And I would also just say we're working hard to move into that kind of elusive top 10 independent software company rankings, which is kind of gets into that $2 billion annual revenue run rate level. I mean that's just an exciting thing for Salesforce.com to move into the multi-billion dollar area. And I think now that we've passed $1.5 billion, it gives us a lot of confidence that the next step for us is right there, the brass ring is right there for us to take.

On average, we're in about 15% to 20% of our employees in one of our customers. So that tends to be the sales organization in total. Obviously, our percentage is much higher at Salesforce or more than twice that. But the average company is about 20% for sales. And that's how they look at distribution, and we're generally in there for that. Maybe we have some service users too. Maybe they've built some custom apps. But there aren't too many examples where every user has a license already. Dell is one where we have an ELA. We have a few other ELAs. But the vast majority of our 77,000 customers is kind of that 20% level on average. That's my gut. Maybe it's kind of hard for me to exactly know because we don't run that report. But I would say just at a gut level and that our opportunity is to go from that, let's say at 77,000 companies and let's say, so couple the 3 million users to -- we want to get over. I guess I should say our goal or our dream or our vision is that within the next year is to move that to over 10 million users on Salesforce's services, and that Chatter is our directional vehicle to do that. And we think that, that's the right strategy. It's the right technology, and I think that's the possibility. I'm not giving you that as kind of a forward-looking guidance thing that we're going to 10 million users. But in theory, that's the potential.

I'm delighted today to share the results of our second quarter. An improving demand environment together with the continued shift to enterprise cloud computing allowed us to post another great financial quarter.
Second quarter revenue of $394 million rose 25% year-over-year. Even with an annual revenue run rate approaching $1.6 billion, our revenue growth has accelerated. At 25%, second quarter revenue rose at its fastest rate in six quarters and it represents the third quarter in a row in which our growth rate has now increased.
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.29 was well above our outlook entering the quarter. GAAP EPS was $0.11. We also delivered roughly $76 million in operating cash flow, an increase of more than 66% from a year ago. Over the past 12 months, our business has generated more than $340 million of operating cash, and we exit the quarter with roughly $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
And finally, I'm pleased today to announce that we're raising the high end of our full year, fiscal year '11 revenue guidance to $1.6 billion. This is a huge new milestone for salesforce.com.
While our second quarter financial performance speaks for itself, the big news this quarter was the release of Chatter in June. Just as Amazon did a decade ago, Facebook and Twitter are now showing us the future of the Internet, this time in the area of collaboration. According to Nielsen, use of social networking apps was up 43% as a percentage of time spent on the Web between June 2009 and June 2010. Leveraging the social features popularized by the consumer Web like profiles, status updates, real-time feeds and mobile apps, Salesforce Chatter helps companies increase employee productivity by empowering employees with a new level of collaboration.
Customer response to Salesforce Chatter has been nothing short of amazing. Within a week of the release, more than 10,000 customers had turned on Salesforce Chatter. Today, less than two months later, that number has now grown to nearly 20,000 customers, or roughly one quarter of our total customer base. We believe this is the most successful new software release ever. 
Not only does Chatter make our sales and service cloud apps better, but when our customers talk about it, they're using words like amazing, exciting, fun, revolutionary, not words typically used to describe enterprise software, and that's why we believe Salesforce Chatter is the next killer app from salesforce.com.
While we launched the product just eight weeks ago, we're already seeing some incredible traction across our customer base. Some of our largest customers are deploying Chatter to very large user communities. Among them, Dell, Sprint, Tyco, Avis, Budget, Misys, McAfee, PerkinElmer and Dow Jones. Not only are some of our largest customers deploying Chatter at scale, but we're seeing a growing number of customers expand their deployments beyond sales and customer service departments by purchasing additional subscriptions for other departmental employees, and some of those expanding customers including Hitachi and Softbank, Reed Exhibitions, Mitsubishi, Nokia and Abbott Medical.
Chatter's an important part of our growth strategy for two primary reasons. First, customers that have deployed Chatter have higher login and usage rates, indicating that they're seeing increased value in our products. Not only does Chatter further differentiate our already award-winning apps, but we believe the higher levels of customer success translate into greater customer retention.
Longer-term, Chatter represents our first enterprise-wide app, extending our value beyond our core sales and customer service base. That's why we're so excited to see this early momentum around Salesforce Chatter. This significantly increases our addressable market in cloud computing, one of the fastest growing segments in technology today.
The customer excitement around Chatter helped drive another amazing quarter for salesforce.com in Q2, and during the quarter we added roughly 4,600 net new customers organically, and roughly 500 unique customers through the addition of Jigsaw. Together, these 5,100 net new customers bring our total customer community to approximately 82,400, an increase of more than 19,000 from Q2 a year ago. 
And we saw strength in all of our primary cloud businesses, as well as in our three major geographies. In fact, one of our three largest transactions this quarter, one was in The Sales Cloud, one was in The Service Cloud and one was Force.com. And those three deals were also spread across the globe, with one coming in, in each of the three regions of the world. That's the kind of distribution of our portfolio that we like at salesforce.com. And our success at companies of all sizes also continues to be a central part of our growth story. That's why CRM Magazine just named salesforce.com apps the best enterprise CRM suite, the best midmarket CRM suite and the best small business CRM suite. It was a clean sweep for the second year in a row, and this year for good measure they named our flagship Sales Cloud service Best Sales Force Automation.
And while our Sales Cloud still represents roughly 2/3 of our new business, the mix of non-Sales Cloud business continues to grow, finishing Q2 at its highest level ever. The emergence of multiple growth levers is an important part of our overall revenue growth in recent quarters and why we remain so optimistic about our revenue growth going forward.
Now let me quickly review our success in each of our three core businesses. In the Sales Cloud, new business signings were strong in the second quarter. Large Sales Cloud transactions included Kimberly-Clark, Sears, Amdocs, American Family Life, 3M, American Express, Commercial Metals, Tyco and others. I'm also pleased to report that our integration of Jigsaw into the Sales Cloud is on track, with a community of more than 22 million contacts at 4 million companies, and more than 1 million contributors, Jigsaw immediately makes our Sales Cloud offering more attractive to new customers, and more sticky with existing ones by providing customer data right inside their apps. That's an exciting new shift to CRM.
Our Service Cloud business was also very strong in the second quarter, growing faster than our other Cloud businesses. With fewer than 10,000 of our existing 82,000 customers using The Service Cloud today, we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface of a major future opportunity. Service Cloud highlights this quarter included transactions at Schneider, Zimmer, GENBAND, PTC, Paychex, Google and Honeywell.
And finally, our Force.com business had another very strong quarter. Headlining our Force.com platform success was a great win in Japan at Japan Post, Aliko [ph] (20:23), and Daiwa. And outside of Japan, Force.com also delivered another solid quarter of new business, including transactions at Nokia, RehabCare, Watson Pharmaceuticals, Cigna and IG [ph] (20:36) Group.
And the future looks bright for the Force.com. And as I mentioned ago, Chatter has the potential to take us enterprise-wide, and the positive implication is to our platform opportunity as well. A larger and more diverse community of users makes the Force.com platform more attractive to both CIOs, our core customers and ISVs [ph] (21:05), as the best place to build their next-generation enterprise cloud apps, natively, right on our Force.com platform.
And our recently announced partnerships with VMware is also being enthusiastically received by our customers and the industry. With VMforce, developers will essentially be able to run their job apps on the Force.com platform natively, rather then running it on a traditional database and software stack in their own data centers, not only will VMforce allow customers to leverage their existing Java development skills and reduce the perceived risk of platform lock-in, but every job app built on the Force.com platform will immediately inherit its incredible benefits of a multi-tenant platform.
A developer preview of VMforce is expected later this year. While VMforce and Chatter position us for future platform business growth, the Force.com platform infrastructure is already delivering some pretty impressive results today. I know a lot of you are monitoring it minute by minute at trust.salesforce.com. Well, let's take a look. During the second quarter, Force.com delivered 21 billion transactions, incredible, an increase of 44% year-over-year. Remarkably, we're delivering this scale using fewer than 3,000 production servers, including backups and disaster recovery, a level of efficiency that could only be delivered by a true multi-tenant cloud computing company, and what we believe is one of the lowest CO2 per transaction ratings in the industry today.  And don't forget, we're doing it all with sub-300 millisecond response, 99.98% planned availability and best-in-class security and transparency.
In addition to our tremendous transaction volume, our customers have now created more than 23 million database customizations, an increase of roughly 40% year-over-year. And finally, in addition to customizing our sales and service apps, customers are increasingly using the Force.com platform to build their own apps. To date, our developer community of more than 280,000 developers, has created more than 600 million lines of Force.com code, up more than 7x from a year ago, and more than 1.6 million custom Visualforce pages, up more than 5x from a year ago, and more than 170,000 custom apps, up roughly 50,000 from a year ago. We believe there's no better cloud platform to build and run cloud apps than Force.com.
According to IDC, the cloud market is estimated to grow by more than 40 billion by 2014. That's why leadership and growth remain our absolute top priorities. Given higher demand for our services and the continued shift to cloud computing, we believe the time to invest, growth [ph] (23:58) and leadership is now. That's why we're accelerating some of our growth investments in the second half.
First and most importantly, we're stepping up our hiring, particularly in key sales and engineering functions. Continued innovation and expanded sales capacity are essential to maintaining our cloud leadership and to fueling growth.
Next, we're proceeding with the buildout of three new data centers. In the U.S., we expect to bring new data centers online in the Midwest and East Coast this year. And then we plan to open up our Japan, Tokyo Data Center next year. And finally, we're expanding the number and scale of our customer events, as there's no better way to demonstrate the power of cloud computing than to show it live.
In September, we'll be hosting Cloudforce events in London, Denver and Toronto and then in October, Cloudforce events will include Tokyo, Rotterdam and Munich. And I'll be personally delivering the keynotes in London on September 7, and in Tokyo on October 5, and I hope to see you there.
Then we'll close the year with our biggest customer event ever, Dreamforce 2010 right here in San Francisco, from December 6 through December 9. In addition to our biggest product announcements of the year which will be happening at Dreamforce, Dreamforce 2010 highlights will include a keynote by President Bill Clinton and entertainment by legend Stevie Wonder. Dreamforce is not to be missed so mark your calendars now. You can find additional details about Dreamforce at www.dreamforce.com.
With that, let me turn the call over to Graham to provide more detail on our excellent second quarter financial performance, as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. Graham?"
122917,111414736,75599,"Salesforce.com, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug-19-2010",2010-08-19,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. By almost every financial measure, our second quarter was outstanding. Revenue rose 25% year-over-year to just over $394 million. This strong performance was well above our outlook, primarily as a result of three factors. First, as Marc disc",1753,"Thanks, Marc. By almost every financial measure, our second quarter was outstanding. Revenue rose 25% year-over-year to just over $394 million. This strong performance was well above our outlook, primarily as a result of three factors. First, as Marc discussed, we're seeing strong demand for all of our products and especially for The Service Cloud. Second, our dollar attrition rate continued to decline in Q2. While the percentage rate remains in the high teens, this was the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement. We're working hard on the areas within our control that we hope can positively influence customer retention and keep this metric on a downward path. And finally, the FX environment is more favorable today than when we offered guidance at the end of the first quarter.
Our second quarter revenue results included approximately $5 million of currency headwind versus a year ago. Adjusting for FX rates, constant currency growth would've been a point higher at 26%.
Looking at the regions, our Americas business rose 22% to just under $275 million. Revenue in Europe faced a significant currency headwind versus a year ago, as the dollar strengthened almost $0.15 against the euro. As a result, revenue of approximately $66 million was up 17% in dollars, but up 30% in local currency. 
The stronger yen created an opposite effect in Asia, and that region continued to deliver very strong results. Revenue in Asia rose 59% in dollars and 53% in local currency to finish the quarter at approximately $54 million.
Given the current economic environment, we expect FX volatility to continue to have an effect on our financial results both positive and negative for the foreseeable future. As a general perspective, we saw good performance across all geographies, with Europe in particular posting a very strong new business quarter.
Second quarter non-GAAP gross margin improved about 30 basis points from the year-ago quarter and remained at about 82%, due primarily to a change in business mix. Our subscription and support gross margin was essentially flat year-on-year, a good result given the huge transactional growth Marc discussed earlier. Professional services gross margins were negative this quarter and declined sequentially; while we aim to manage that business to at least breakeven gross margins, our more important objective is customer success.
Given the project-based nature of consulting and the revenue effects of EITF 00-21, I expect gross margins for our professional services business to be lumpy for the remainder of the year. Next year, we plan to implement EITF 08-01, but it's still too early to know exactly how that will impact our results.
On the pricing front, we continued to see no material changes when we compare average price per seat across additions, geographies or customer segments. We've done a great job of innovating and creating customer success with new services like Chatter, which we think enables us to focus on selling value.
Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 67%, up about 150 basis points from last year. Our fastest growing expense category is R&D, which now stands at roughly 11% of revenue. Given the importance of continued technology leadership and sales in Service Clouds, as well as working on new products like Jigsaw, Chatter and VMforce, we think this increased level of investment is very appropriate. Sales and marketing expenses were 43% of revenue, that's flat with last year, and finally, G&A was a little higher than last year, at 14% of revenue.
Our overall full-time employee count rose by approximately 340 people in Q2 to finish at just under 4,450 people worldwide. Remember, this increase includes approximately 150 people from the acquisition of Jigsaw. We plan to accelerate organic hiring in the second half of the year to support our long-term growth objectives, which will obviously have an impact on second half expense levels.
Non-GAAP operating margin in the second quarter was approximately 16% versus roughly 17% a year ago. The decrease was primarily the result of the Jigsaw acquisition.
It's also worth noting that our final valuation of the purchased intangibles related to the Jigsaw acquisition was considerably less than our original estimation back in April. As a result, the related amortization in fiscal 2011 was approximately $7 million less than the amount we included in the FY '11 GAAP EPS guidance we provided with our first quarter results. This change will have the effect of reducing the GAAP dilution from Jigsaw by roughly $0.03 per share for FY '11, a $0.01 of which came through in our Q2 results with a further $0.01 benefit expected in each of Q3 and Q4.
As Marc mentioned, both Jigsaw's business performance and its integration are going very well and we expect Jigsaw's business to be close to breakeven on a non-GAAP basis by the end of next year.
We remain committed to delivering operating margin expansion each year in our core business, but clearly, the effect of acquisitions can have a short-term effect on that goal as Jigsaw has done this year.
Our Q2 GAAP tax rate for the quarter rose to 44% as a result of certain acquisition and investment-related nondeductible expenses and a decrease in pretax GAAP income. Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 39%. For the full year, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 41% and our non-GAAP rate to be about 38%.
Second quarter operating cash flow was outstanding at approximately $76 million. That's an increase of 66% year-over-year. Over the past 12 months, we've generated more than $346 million of operating cash. That's an increase of 46% over the previous 12 months. CapEx in the quarter was approximately $28 million. The increase this quarter is primarily the result of leasehold improvements in the office-based and equipment purchases related to the buildout of the data centers Marc mentioned.
Our first half CapEx is up 23% year-over-year. That's slightly less than our revenue growth rate. Second quarter free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow, less CapEx, was approximately $48 million. That's an increase of 77% from last year.
Year-to-date, our free cash flow has increased 61%. Please remember that because our invoicing is seasonal, our quarterly cash flow profile is also seasonal, and it's typically stronger in the first quarter and fourth quarter. Although Q3 cash flow is projected to be sequentially lower than Q2, but higher than Q3 a year ago, we now believe our operating cash flow for the full fiscal year will grow to rates slightly higher than our revenue growth rate.
Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on the balance sheet finished the quarter at approximately $1.9 billion. This was down about $50 million from Q1, primarily due to acquisition-related disbursements of $150 million, offset by stock option exercises and operating cash flow. Receivables continue to be well-managed. Our DSO of 53 days rose slightly from 49 days a year ago, but our collections and aging remain strong and our DSO is well within our historical range.
Deferred revenue rose $18 million sequentially and $134 million year-over-year to finish the quarter at $683 million. That's 24% year-over-year growth, and reflected both strong new business signings as well as improving renewal rates. Our Q2 deferred revenue balance included a roughly $3 million sequential currency benefit, primarily the result of a stronger yen.
As we've discussed on prior calls, Q2 and Q3 re seasonally lower invoicing quarters and that has the obvious effect of dampening deferred revenue. I remind you that last year our deferred revenue balance declined $4 million sequentially from Q2 to Q3, despite a roughly $6 million currency benefit. In that context, we expect our third quarter deferred revenue balance to be roughly flat with Q2, excluding any significant currency effects.
Let me close with our outlook. As in Q1, our earnings guidance comments today will only be in non-GAAP terms. The details for both our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance and related reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release issued today, as well as on our website. 
Let me begin with our full-year guidance. Given our strong new business performance in the second quarter, the continued shift to cloud computing, declining attrition rates and more favorable currency rates for the euro and the yen, we're very pleased to be able to raise our revenue guidance for fiscal year 2011 to a range of $1.595 billion to $1.6 billion.
As we indicated in our commentary, we believe that growth and leadership are the best ways to create long-term shareholder value. In that context, where we plan to invest much of the revenues [indiscernible] (35:05) growth. I'm also pleased to be able to raise our full fiscal year 2011 non-GAAP EPS projection to between $1.15 and $1.17. As in past quarters, this excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and amortization of the debt discount on our convertible debt.
For the third quarter, we are projecting revenue in the range of $408 million to $410 million, and non-GAAP EPS excluding the same items I just mentioned in our full-year outlook is now projected in the range of 30% to 31%.
Our Q3 EPS guidance implies more profit in Q3 and less in Q4 than many of you have modeled. The reasons are pretty straightforward. First, we'll be hosting our biggest Dreamforce event ever in December, as Marc just mentioned. Because this event is so critical to our customers' success and to fueling our growth, we're determined to make this year our most amazing event ever. We expect that the net cost of this event alone will be roughly $0.05 of EPS in the fourth quarter.
And second, Q4 is typically our largest quarter for new business and also when our sales force hits their commission accelerators. Since we don't capitalize commissions that are paid to sales consultants or sales management, sales expenses can rise steeply in the fourth quarter. As you model Q3 and Q4, please factor in these two expected seasonal business impacts.
To close, we were very pleased with our second quarter results. Revenue grew 25%, our global community of customers grew more than 30% and the number of transactions executed on our service grew more than 40%. These results position us well for future growth and we're investing in the necessary hiring and infrastructure to address the large and growing cloud computing market opportunity. We look forward to updating you on our progress when we announce our third quarter results in November.

As I mentioned in my script, we have about 3,000 servers, and that includes 1,500 that are just standing by in case there's a disaster. And you have to kind of ask yourself, if salesforce.com did not exist for the 82,000 customers that we have and the couple hundred thousand apps that they're running on our servers, how many servers would they need? And you could quickly determine that we are operating at a level of efficiency that's probably a few percentage points of what they would've had to buy. And that's why I think cloud computing is so exciting to customers because -- certainly for our customers -- it's a CapEx-free environment. They're not buying hardware. They're not buying the kind of traditional capital expenditures necessary in taking on the risk to deliver automation into their companies. And I think that, that's a big juxtaposition against kind of my bullishness. And I love John Chambers, I think he's probably one of the really greatest CEOs in our industry. But his company is all about CapEx. I mean at the end of the day, Cisco is very different than Salesforce because Cisco is all about routers and hubs and switches and phones and set-top boxes and telepresence devices. And all of those things are made out of plastic and they've got wires and they've got to ship them and build them and factories, and -- we don't have any factories. We've got our software engineers, and we've got a few thousand PCs that we're deploying that software onto and then it's able to be consumed over the Internet the way customers consume Facebook, or Twitter, they're able to consume enterprise software. And that's a very different model, and it's a model that gives customers success, a much higher level of success than they've ever seen in enterprise software before. And I think the reason why, is for all the reasons that I said: it's no upgrades, it's no updates and I think, best of all, when you look at a release like we had this quarter of Chatter, almost a quarter of our customers are now on Chatter. You look at any other enterprise software company who puts out a major new functionality, release a new product, a quarter of their customers don't uptake the product. You usually wait to hear about that over a period of years. So I don't think it's fair to contrast us against the Cisco environment. We have to really look at, cloud computing is where the action is in our industry. And companies that are delivering true cloud computing, which are very, very high levels of efficiency, very, very low levels of cost, through the multi-tenant architectures that we have pioneered, I think you're going to continue to see strong growth, which is why we're delivering such a huge increase of our guidance in today's call."

I mean right here at Salesforce, I can tell you that our own use of salesforce.com is up dramatically throughout our whole company. And in addition to that, all the apps that we use, usage is way up. And something else that's really amazing about Chatter. You have all these employees using the product. And for someone like myself, I am a CEO of a company, and we'll soon have 5,000 employees at Salesforce. It's hard to know what everyone is doing, what's going on, and who's really great, who's adding value, but Chatter makes it all very visible. It becomes a meritocracy. We really see the employees who are making a difference. And when you go enterprise-wide, you get that value in an incredible way. And that's why I'm definitely so bullish about social networking, I'm so bullish on cloud. I'm so bullish on mobile. And one of our very largest customers, I've been talking to their CEO about it, and he's been using the product very extensively himself, and I expect them to do a major enterprise-wide deployment of the product. And the reason why is because neither one of us has ever seen a tool that's given us this transparency into the organization, and that's what we've needed. E-mail does not give you transparency. When you're in Outlook, you don't really know what's going on in the company, you're just seeing these kind of e-mail messages flying by. But with Chatter, you do, you're able to really see what's happening and you can make better decisions. With the CEO that I mentioned, he had a major deal that was working on in a telecommunications company that he didn't know about, and he was able to see it with Chatter going through all the posts and seeing all of his employees, what they're doing, watching their collaboration, going through all the slides. And then all of a sudden, he saw that they were having a hard time working with the manufacturing department of his company, and so he called the manufacturing department and said, ""You need to help these guys who are selling to this telecom company,"" and he said that was the greatest thing for him that he could relieve the organizational friction using Chatter. So that's what we need to run better companies today and to be more effective, to be more efficient, to be more successful. And when you couple it with the world-class sales automation technology we have, customer service automation technology, or building any app, you get a whole new level of capabilities. So I'm very excited about it, and I think we're going to see a lot of enterprise-wide transactions with Chatter."

I think we had really strong, surprisingly strong growth in Sales Cloud this quarter. We were kind of shocked actually, but a lot of it enabled by Chatter, a lot of it enabled by, as you mentioned, Jigsaw. And with such a strong differentiation and a strong technology, I'm sure you saw CRM magazine gave it Best SFA, and then we got the Small, Medium and Enterprise CleanSweep CRM Award, and then PC Magazine gave it I think four and a half stars in Editor's Choice. So very strong product. But also coming up I have to say and growing of course faster, is Service Cloud, and we're really excited about Service Cloud. This is the year of The Service Cloud at salesforce.com. We're doing a lot of very large Service Cloud transactions. The Service Cloud technology has never looked better. We have really built some spectacular capabilities as you know in knowledge management, integrating with public social networks and then again, the integration of Chatter, as well as a lot of other new capabilities with the new version of Service Cloud, it's just a great offering. And then we have the platform, which is also growing and had a great quarter. And we're seeing a lot of ISV interest, customers building -- you heard the numbers in the amount of lines of code being written on the platform, the Visualforce pages being written on the platform. And then you've got Chatter. So those are our four clouds: sales, service, collaboration and platform. And then we have the emergence of Jigsaw. And Jigsaw is super-exciting for our company because it's all about data and getting data into these very high-value apps to make them even more valuable, cleaning up our customers' data, just giving them access to the data they need to make decisions, being able to really transform the apps into instant value. And I don't know if you've been to Jigsaw.com lately but if you haven't, you really should check it out. It's just awesome, and it's why we bought the company, and we're really doing our deep integration work. And by the time we get to Dreamforce, I think you'll see some really great and exciting announcements in terms of where we're going with Jigsaw. So those are our five directions right now but at the end of the day, it is a unified offering that's all built on one platform, it's integrated and customers can consume these services as they need them. So it's been very, very good. I'll have Graham put some of the numbers around that for you."

I mean if you look at our business, we have very, very stable kind of ratios in terms of the segments, enterprise, midmarket and small business, and geographic strength this quarter.

And while Chatter is beginning to be its own revenue line, unfortunately for Chatter, the other revenue lines are so big and growing so fast, it's going to probably take it a little while to be able to catch up because you've got some hot products. And I guess I would put my money again like I did last quarter and say, I'm a big believer this year in Service Cloud. We call this the year of The Service Cloud. Sales Cloud had a great quarter, a lot of growth, but Service Cloud's growth numbers are just awesome. And I am very excited about The Service Cloud, and I think that Chatter has made it better, more competitive, more exciting, the demos are more exciting. If you haven't seen the demos that we've done at Cloudforce of The Service Cloud, they're all on YouTube, and I'm sure you'd agree that Chatter makes everything better.

I mean the way we built the product is we built the platform and then on that platform, we build a number of apps, and then we gave customers an ISV-ability for them to build their own apps. So that when you get at one of our apps, you can rip it apart because it's built with the platform, and put it back together exactly for your business, and your business process, your work flow, your user interface, your website, on and on and on, but it's all coming out of one consistent platform. We don't have multiple versions, we don't have multiple products, it's really one integrated product. When we kind of call it, Sales Cloud,  Service Cloud, Chatter, that's mostly to help our customers understand what we can do for them. The technical answer is, it's actually all fairly integrated as one service. And then as a customer, you can consume these different services including the customization services and integration services and scalability, and reliability, security of the platform. So yes, I would agree with you that the numbers would be higher if you were to somehow break it apart. But you really can't because – and if you read that PC Magazine review of The Sales Cloud, what that reviewer loved was the platform is so deeply integrated into The Sales Cloud, it is The Sales Cloud. It's a CRM platform, is another way to think about it in that case. And are we a CRM platform company instead of a CRM applications company? Yes, I think so. But there's also a lot of other apps that are non-CRM apps that are on the platform as well. You see a lot of those on the AppExchange when you visit our customers, you see a lot of those as well. And so are we a platform company? Absolutely. Are we a Cloud platform, an apps company? Absolutely. Our long term vision for our company is that we're really the leaders in this cloud platform and cloud apps and in cloud data, and that's very much the direction that we continue to move."

And we are in negotiation with a lot of our customers in expanding with Chatter. We also have free Chatter licenses as well, because we really think that we want this to be our Trojan horse for enterprise-wide use.

Well, I will just assume that it is. So in The Service Cloud, where we really see the growth is, you've got a lot of customers out there on old products, including looking at really old technology like Siebel, that they are being forced into upgrade situations which are massive IT projects. And companies do not have the money, they don't have the IT budgets or [indiscernible] (59:46) people. They don't have the people because they're not hiring to do these new deployments of Siebel upgrades: upgrade your call center, upgrade your contact center, upgrade your customer portal. That's just not going to happen. So they're being forced into making a decision, which is, what do they do next? And the easy decision is, go with salesforce.com's Service Cloud, because we can move you from your Siebel call center or contact center into a cloud computing modern approach. And as I said before, you're not going to have to buy any plastic to do it. So that's a big shift I think for customers, and they want it. We've already seen that in Sales Cloud for a decade, of course. But now in the last couple years, really the catalyst was our InStranet acquisition and the leader of this whole effort for us, our Executive Vice President, Alexander Dionne, who runs this initiative for us, has just done a brilliant job, and we're very, very, very excited about where we are. And I'm sure you also know, The Service Cloud was just ranked by Gartner Group as one of the leaders in the Magic Quadrant, and we just introduced the product. So it's an exciting product and an exciting opportunity. And I do believe it will be our very fastest growing and most material product for the year."

They're really at the beginning of this. And they're learning, I think, from us, from their users, but this is a brand new market. Now that said, I really believe that there's three things that will dominate enterprise software for the next decade, and that will be that enterprise software will increasingly move into the cloud and become multi-tenant-shared services. Enterprise software will become increasingly social like Chatter. And what I mean by that specifically is, kind of the key things that you see in things like Facebook, and Twitter, like the profiles, like feeds, like status updates, that will become an integrated part of all apps, that all enterprise apps are going to look exactly like Facebook. I'm really convinced of that. I believe that it's a great new model and metaphor for all apps, that all apps will move in that direction, okay. We're the first, but I assure you that everyone will move there. And three, enterprise applications will increasingly become mobile, that they'll move on to your BlackBerry and your iPhone and your iPad and your Android device and your tablet du jour, et cetera. And those three trends can guide us over the next decade into what we call Cloud 2. We were really in Cloud 1. When I started salesforce.com, I asked myself the question, why is all enterprise software not like Amazon.com because the model that Amazon.com pioneered was so awesome with the tab-based interface and you could basically pull the information easily out of the system, and you use clicking with your mouse and you're using it over the Internet. But now all I do is ask myself the question, why isn't all enterprise software like Facebook? And that's a very different model where information is being pushed at you, and where the users have personalities in the system through these profiles. And that things are happening in real-time and it's mobile. And you're touching your computer, you're not using your mouse as much. So that's a whole different model, and that's where I think things are really going. And so when I talk to CIOs, they kind of redact all that to say, ""Well this is the consumerization of IT."" And they all say, ""But we're also really focused on virtualization."" And I think they're really focused on virtualization because it's a cost reduction metaphor. But virtualization is not cloud computing and virtualization is just more efficient servers but it's not order of magnitude efficiency like we're seeing with salesforce.com and our cloud computing peers. And that's the excitement and that's the power of cloud computing. And as we move now from Cloud 1 and into Cloud 2, and while you see in these audiences that we demonstrate this technology to the kind of the fever that they get when they see how easy it becomes when you make it like Facebook, I think that we're probably the first to do it, but I assure you, we will not be the last in the way that we won't be the last to deliver cloud or mobile. That it's these three things moving forward and we want to be the largest and most important player in this industry but we won't be the only ones."

So we've got a long way to go to fill in that distribution capacity, and that's why growth is so important because we're not getting to all those customers. There are still a lot of people out there ignorantly behind enterprise software when they shouldn't be, only because they don't know and we can't bring them the good news and the enlightenment that the world has changed and that they can have a better thing. That's why there's still a lot of plastic being sold and shipped. Because the reality is, we're still a relatively small part of this total enterprise software industry. So we have to grow and of course this has been our mantra for more than a decade, more than 11 years, coming up on 12 years. We've got to grow because we need to let the customers know, the millions of potential customers out there, that they don't need to buy software anymore, that you can consume it directly over the Internet. And we only have 80,000 customers. I was recently with one of my customers, Michael Dell at Dell, and he was telling me he's got 10 million customers. I'm like, how are we going to get to 10 million customers? We've got to grow to get out there. He's got the benefit of being in business for multiple decades. We were only in the business for one decade. So that's why we're trying to grow as fast as we can to fulfill demand, and as you can see by the numbers, the demand is there and salesforce.com just needs to continue to execute."

But we see an increased level of usage and interest in it like never before. And to circle back to Chatter, I think Chatter really changes the game for us on mobile. Because if you use Facebook on a mobile device like the iPhone, you know how compelling it is to be able to basically be able to easily scroll through your status updates and changes. Well, our customers are doing that with their iPhones. I mean I'm doing it with my iPhone, and I see what's changing in my business, what my employees are thinking, deals that are closing, deals that are getting renewed, customers that are coming to my website, business processes that are happening, and that is very, very powerful in a mobile environment. Before Chatter, the mobile environment was mostly about kind of search, go find a contact, I was mostly pulling the information, looking for things. Now with mobile, and push, it's very exciting because I can quickly in like a matter of seconds, get a complete refresh on what's happening on the business. And I think our customers see that opportunity as well. I mean, I know we have one very large customer, an important customer, who is in consumer optical goods, and they have deployed Salesforce on iPhones, and it is incredible. And now they're starting to do it on iPads and you know what? That's the future for that customer. Now, I don't know if it's for all customers, but I think that as their users shift to these new platforms, these new mobile platforms like phones and tablets, I see that's where all the apps will eventually end up."

I am delighted today to share results of our second quarter. In an improving demand environment, together with the continued shift to enterprise cloud computing allowed us to post another great financial quarter.
Second quarter revenue of $394 million rose 25% year-over-year. Even with an annual revenue run rate approaching $1.6 billion, our revenue growth is accelerating. At 25%, second quarter revenue rose at its fastest rate in six quarters and it represents the third quarter in a row in which growth rate has now increased.
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.29 was well above our outlook entering the quarter. GAAP EPS was $0.11.
We also delivered roughly $76 million in operating cash flow, an increase of more than 66% from a year ago. Over the past 12 months, our business has generated more than $340 million of operating cash and we exited the quarter with roughly $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
Finally, I am pleased today to announce that we are raising the high end of our full year fiscal year ‘11 revenue guidance to $1.6 billion. This is a huge new milestone for Salesforce.com.
While our second quarter financial performance speaks for itself, the big news this quarter was the release of Chatter in June.
Just as Amazon did a decade ago, Facebook and Twitter are now showing us the future of the Internet, this time in the area of collaboration. According to Nielsen, use of social networking apps was up 43% as a percentage of time spent on the web between June 2009 and June 2010.
Leveraging the social features popularized by the consumer web like profiles, status updates, real time feeds and mobile apps, Salesforce Chatter helps companies increase employee productivity by empowering employees with the new level of collaboration.
Customer response to Salesforce Chatter has been nothing short of amazing. Within a week of the release, more than 10,000 customers had turned on Salesforce Chatter. Today, less than two months later that number has now grown to nearly 20,000 customers or roughly one quarter of our total customer base. We believe this is the most successful new software released ever.
Not only does Chatter make our Sales and Service Cloud apps better, but when our customers talk about it, they are using words like amazing, exciting, fun, revolutionary, not words typically used to describe enterprise software and that’s why we believe Salesforce Chatter is the next killer app from Salesforce.com.
While we launched the product just eight weeks ago, we are already seeing some incredible traction across our customer base. Some of our largest customers are deploying Chatter to very large user communities; among them, Dell, Sprint, Tyco, Avis Budget, Misys, McAfee, Perkin Elmer and Dow Jones.
Not only are some of our largest customers deploying Chatter at scale, but we are seeing a growing number of customers expand their deployments beyond sales and customer service department by purchasing additional subscriptions for other departmental employees, and some of those expanding customers including Hitachi and SoftBank, Reed Exhibitions, Mitsubishi, Nokia and Abbott Medical.
Chatter is an important part of our growth strategy for two primary reasons. First, customers that have deployed Chatter have higher login and usage rates indicating that they are seeing increased value in our products.
Not only this Chatter further differentiate are already award winning apps, but we believe the higher levels of customer success translate in a greater customer retention. Longer-term, Chatter represents our first enterprise wide app., extending our value beyond our core sales and customer service base.
That’s why we are so excited to see this early momentum around Salesforce Chatter. This significantly increases our addressable market in Cloud computing one of the fastest growing segments in technology today.
The customer excitement around Chatter helped drive another amazing quarter for Salesforce.com in Q2. And during the quarter we added roughly 4,600 net new customers organically and roughly 500 unique customers through the addition of Jigsaw.
Together, these 5,100 net new customers bring our total customer community to approximately 82,400, an increase of more than 19,000 from Q2 a year ago. We saw strength in all of our primary cloud businesses, as well as in our three major geographies.
In fact, one of our three largest transactions this quarter one was in the Sales Cloud, one was in the Service Cloud, and one was Force.com. Those three deals were also spread across the globe with one coming in, in each of the three regions of the world. That’s the kind of distribution of our portfolio that we like at Salesforce.com.
Our success with companies of all sizes also continues to be a central part of our growth story, that’s why CRM Magazine just named Salesforce.com apps the Best Enterprise CRM Suite, the Best Mid-Market CRM Suite, and the Best Small Business CRM Suite. It was a clean sweep for the second year in a row. This year for good measure they named our flagship Sales Cloud, Service Best Salesforce Automation.
While our Sales Cloud still represents roughly two-thirds of our new business, the mix of non-Sales Cloud business continues to grow, finishing Q2 at its highest level ever. The emergence of multiple growth levers is an important part of our overall revenue growth in recent quarters, and why we remain so optimistic about our revenue growth going forward.
Now, let me quickly review our success in each of our three core businesses. In the Sales Cloud new business signings were strong in the second quarter. Large Sales Cloud transactions included Kimberly-Clark, Sears, Amdocs, American Family Life, 3M, American Express, Commercial Metals, Tyco and others.
I’m also pleased to report that our integration of Jigsaw into the Sales Cloud is on track. With the community of more than 22 million contacts at four million companies and more than one million contributors Jigsaw immediately makes our Sales Cloud offering more attractive to new customers and more sticky with existing ones by providing customer data right inside their apps, that’s an exciting new shift to CRM.
Our Service Cloud business was also very strong in the second quarter growing faster than our other cloud businesses, with fewer than 10,000 of our existing 82,000 customers using the Service Cloud a day we believe we’re just beginning to scratch the surface of a major future opportunity. Service Cloud highlights this quarter included transactions at Schneider, Zimmer, GENBAND, PTC, Paychex, Google and Honeywell.
Finally, our Force.com business had another very strong quarter. Headlining our Force.com platform success was a great wins in Japan at Japan Post, Alico and Daiwa; and outside of Japan Force.com also delivered another solid quarter of new business, including transactions of Nokia, RehabCare, Watson Pharmaceuticals, CIGNA and IG Group. The future looks bright for the Force.com.
As I mentioned ago, Chatter has the potential to take us enterprise wide and the positive implications to our platform opportunity as well. A larger and more diverse community of users makes the Force.com platform more attractive to both CIOs, our core customers and ISDs as the best place to build their next generation enterprise cloud apps, natively right on our Force.com platform. Our recently announced partnership with VMware is also being enthusiastically received by our customers and the industry.
With VMforce, developers will essentially be able run their job apps on the Force.com platform natively, rather than running them on a traditional database and software stack in their own datacenters, not only will VMforce allow customers to leverage their existing job development skills and reduce the perceived risk of platform walk-in, but every job app built on the Force.com platform will immediately inherit its incredible benefit to the multi-tenant platform. A developer preview of VMforce is expected later this year.
While VMforce and Chatter position us for future platform business growth, the Force.com platform infrastructure is already delivering some pretty impressive results today. I know a lot of you are monitoring it minute-by-minute at trust.salesforce.com. Well, let’s take a look.
During the second quarter, Force.com delivered 21 billion transactions, incredible, an increase of 44% year-over-year. Remarkably, we’re delivering this scale using fewer than 3,000 production servers, including back-ups and disaster recovery; a level of efficiency that could only be delivered by a true multi-tenant cloud computing company and what we believe is one of the lowest CO2 per transaction ratings in the industry today. Don’t forget, we’re doing it all with some 300 millisecond response, 99.98% planned availability and best-in-class security and transparency.
In addition, to our tremendous transaction volume, our customers have now created more than 23 million database customizations, an increase of roughly 40% year-over-year.
Finally, in addition to customizing our sales and service apps, customers are increasingly using the Force.com platform to build their own apps. To-date, our developer community of more than 280,000 developers has created more than 600 million lines of Force.com code, up more than 7X from a year ago and more than 1.6 million custom visualforce pages, up more than 5X from a year ago, and more than 170,000 custom apps up roughly 50,000 from a year ago. We believe there is no better Cloud platform to build and run cloud apps than Force.com.
According to IDC the cloud market is estimated to grow by more than $40 billion by 2014, that’s why leadership and growth remain our absolute top priorities. Given higher demand for our services and the continued shift to cloud computing, we believe the time to invest growth and leadership is now, that’s why we’re accelerating some of our growth investments in the second half.
First and most importantly, we’re stepping up our hiring, particularly in key sales and engineering functions. Continued innovation and expanded sales capacity are essential to maintaining our cloud leadership and to fuelling growth.
Next, we’re proceeding with the build out of three new data centers. In the US, we expect to bring new data centers online in the Mid West and East Coast this year, and then we plan to open up our Japan, Tokyo data center next year. And finally, we’re expanding the number and scale of our customer events as there is no better way to demonstrate the power of cloud computing than to show it live.
In September, we’ll be hosting Cloudforce events in London, Denver and Toronto. Then in October, Cloudforce events will include Tokyo, Rotterdam and Munich. I’ll be personally delivering the keynotes in London on September 7 and in Tokyo on October 5 and I hope to see you there. Then we’ll close the year with our biggest customer event ever, Dreamforce 2010 right here in San Francisco from December 6 through December 9.
In addition to our biggest product announcements of the year, which will be happening at the Dreamforce, Dreamforce 2010 highlights will include a keynote by President Bill Clinton and entertainment by legends Stevie Wonder. Dreamforce is not to be missed, so mark your calendars now. You can find additional details about Dreamforce at www.dreamforce.com.
With that, let me turn the call over to Graham to provide more detail on our excellent second quarter financial performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. Graham?

By almost every financial measure our second quarter was outstanding. Revenue rose 25% year-over-year to just over $394 million. This strong performance was well above our outlook, primarily as a result of three factors.
First, as Marc discussed, we are seeing strong demand for all of our products and especially for the Service Cloud.
Second, our dollar attrition rate continued to decline in Q2. While the percentage rate remains in high teens, this was the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement. We’re working hard on the areas within our control that we hope can positively influence customer retention and keep this metric on a downward pause.
Finally, the FX environment is more favorable today than when we offered guidance at the end of the first quarter.
Our second quarter revenue results included approximately $5 million of currency headwind versus a year ago. Adjusting for FX rates, constant currency growth would have been a point higher at 26%.
Looking at the regions, our Americas business rose 22% to just under $275 million.
Revenue in Europe faced a significant currency headwind versus a year ago as the dollar strengthened almost $0.15 against the euro. As a result, revenue of approximately $66 million was up 17% in dollars, but up 30% in local currency.
The stronger yen created an opposite effect in Asia and that region continued to deliver very strong results. Revenue in Asia rose 59% in dollars and 53% in local currency to finish the quarter at approximately $54 million.
Given the current economic environment, we expect FX volatility to continue to have an effect on our financial results, both positive and negative, for the perceivable future. As a general perspective, we saw good performance across all geographies with Europe, in particular, posting a very strong new business quarter.
Second quarter non-GAAP gross margin improved about 30 basis points from the year ago quarter and remained at about 82%, due primarily to a change in business mix.
Our subscription and support gross margin was essentially flat year-on-year, a good result given the huge transactional growth Marc discussed earlier.
Professional services gross margins were negative this quarter and declined sequentially. While we aim to manage that business to at least breakeven gross margins, our more important objective is customer success.
Given the project-based nature of consulting and the revenue effects of EITF 00-21, I expect gross margins for our professional services business to be lumpy for the remainder of the year.
Next year, we plan to implement EITF 08-01, but it’s still too early to know exactly how that will impact our results.
On the pricing front, we continue to see no material changes when we compare average price per seat across additions, geographies or customers segments. We’ve done a great job of innovating and creating customer success with new services like Chatter, which we think enables us to focus on selling value.
Non-GAAP operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, was 67%, up about 150 basis points from last year. Our fastest growing expense category is R&D, which now stands at roughly 11% of revenue.
Given the importance of continued technology leadership in Sales and Service Clouds as well as working on new products like Jigsaw, Chatter and VMforce, we think this increased level of investment is very appropriate.
Sales and marketing expenses were 43% of revenue, that’s flat with last year and finally G&A was a little higher than last year, 14% of revenue.
Our overall full time employee count rose by approximately 340 people in Q2 to finish it just under 4,450 people worldwide. Remember this increase includes approximately 150 people from the acquisition of Jigsaw.
We plan to accelerate organic hiring in the second half of the year to support our long-term growth objectives, which will obviously have an impact on second half expense levels.
Non-GAAP operating margin in the second quarter was approximately 16% versus roughly 17% a year ago. The decrease was primarily the result of the Jigsaw acquisition.
It’s also worth noting that our final valuation of the purchased intangibles related to the Jigsaw acquisition was considerably less than our original estimation back in April.
As a result the related amortization in fiscal 2011 is approximately $7 million less than the amount we included in the FY ‘11 GAAP EPS guidance we provided with our first quarter results.
This change will have the effects of reducing the GAAP dilution from Jigsaw by roughly $0.03 per share for FY ‘11, a $0.01 which came through in our Q2 results with a further $0.01 benefit expected in each of Q3 and Q4.
As Marc mentioned both, Jigsaw’s business performance and its integration, are going pretty well and we expect Jigsaw’s business to be close to breakeven on a non-GAAP basis by the end of next year.
We remain committed to delivering operating margin expansion each year in our core business, but clearly the effect of acquisitions can have a short-term effect on that goal, as Jigsaw has done this year.
Our Q2 GAAP tax rate for the quarter rose to 44% as a result of certain acquisition and investment-related non-deductible expenses and a decrease in pre-tax GAAP income. Our Q2 non-GAAP tax-rate was 39%. For the full year, we expect our GAAP tax-rate to be approximately 41% and our non-GAAP rate to be about 38%.
Second quarter operating cash flow was outstanding at approximately $76 million, that’s an increase of 66% year-over-year.
Over the past 12 months, we’ve generated more than $346 million of operating cash, that’s an increase of 46% over the previous 12 months. CapEx in the quarter was approximately $28 million, the increase this quarter is primarily the result of leasehold improvements in the office space and equipment purchases related to the build out of the data center as Marc mentioned.
Our first half CapEx is up 23% year-over-year, that’s slightly less than our revenue growth rate. Second quarter free cash flow which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx was approximately $48 million, that’s an increase of 77% from last year. Year-to-date, our free cash flow has increased 61%.
Please remember that because our invoicing is seasonal our quarterly cash flow pro forma is also seasonal, and is typically stronger in the first quarter and fourth quarter. Although, Q3 cash flow is projected to be sequentially lower than Q2 but higher than Q3 a year ago, we now believe our operating cash flow for the full fiscal year will grow to rate slightly higher than our revenue growth rate.
Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on the balance sheet finished the quarter at approximately $1.9 billion. This was down about $50 million from Q1, primarily due to acquisition related disbursements of $150 million, offset by stock option exercises and operating cash flow.
Receivables continue to be well managed. Our DSO of 53 days rose slightly from 49 days a year ago, but our collections in aging remains strong and our DSO is well in our historical range.
Deferred revenue rose $18 million sequentially and $134 million year-over-year to finish the quarter at $683 million. That’s 24% year-over-year growth and reflected both strong new business signings as well as improving renewals rates. Our Q2 deferred revenue balance included a roughly $3 million sequential currency benefit, primarily the result of the stronger yen.
As we have discussed on prior calls, Q2 and Q3 are seasonally lower invoicing quarters that have the obvious effect of dampening deferred revenue. I remind you that last year our deferred revenue balance declined $4 million sequentially from Q2 to Q3, despite a roughly $6 million currency benefit. In that context, we expect our third quarter deferred revenue balance to be roughly flat with Q2 excluding any significant currency effects.
Let me close with our outlook as in Q1. Our earnings guidance comments today will only be in non-GAAP terms. The details for both our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance and related reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release, issued today as well as on our Web site.
Let me begin with our full year guidance. Given our strong new business performance in the second quarter, the continued shift to cloud computing, declining attrition rates and more favorable currency rates for the euro and yen, we are very pleased to be able to raise our revenue guidance for fiscal year 2011 to a range of $1.595 billion to $1.6 billion.
As we indicated in our commentary, we believe the growth and leadership are the best way to create long-term shareholder value in that context where we plan to invest (inaudible) growth. I’m also pleased to be able to raise our full fiscal year 2011 non-GAAP EPS projection to between $1.15 and $1.17. As in past quarters, this excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and amortization of the debt discount on our convertible debt.
For the third quarter, we are projecting revenue in the range of $408 million to $410 million and non-GAAP EPS excluding the same items I just mentioned in our full year outlook is now projected in the range of $0.30 to $0.31.
Our Q3 EPS guidance implies more profit in Q3 and less in Q4 than many of you have modeled. The reasons are pretty straight forward. First, we’ll be hosting our biggest Dreamforce event ever in December as Marc just mentioned, because this event is so critical to our customer’s success into fueling our growth, we’re determined to make this year our most amazing event ever. We expect that the net cost of this event alone will be roughly $0.05 of EPS in the fourth quarter.
Second, Q4 is typically our largest quarter for new business and also when our sales force hits their commission accelerators, since we don’t capitalize commissions that are paid to sales consultants or sales management, sales expenses can rise steeply in the fourth quarter.
As you model Q3 and Q4, please factor in these two expected seasonal business impacts. To close, we were very pleased with our second quarter results. Revenue grew 25%, our global community of customers grew more than 30%, and the number of transactions executed on our services grew more than 40%.
These results position us well for future growth and we’re investing in the necessary hiring and infrastructure to address the large and growing cloud computing market opportunity. We look forward to updating you on our progress, when we announce our third quarter results in November.
Let’s go ahead and open the call up for questions. Operator?

I mentioned in my script, we have about 3,000 servers and that includes 1,500 that are just standing by in case there is a disaster.
You have to kind of ask yourself, if Salesforce.com did not exist for the 82,000 customers that we have and the couple of 100,000 apps that they are running in on our servers, how many servers would they need? You can quickly determine that we are operating at a level of efficiency that’s probably a few percentage points of what they would have had to buy.
That’s why, I think, cloud computing is so exciting to customers because certainly for our customers it’s a CapEx free environment, they are not buying hardware, they are not buying the kind of traditional capital expenditures necessary and taking on the risk to deliver automation into their companies. I think that’s a big juxtaposition against kind of my bullishness, and I love John Chambers I think he is probably one of the really greatest CEOs in our industry, but here company is all about CapEx.
At the end of the day Cisco is very different than Salesforce because Cisco is all about routers and hubs and switches and phones and set top boxes and telepresence devices, and they’re all made out of plastic and they’ve got wires and they’ve got to ship them and build them in factories. We don’t have any factory. We’ve got our software engineers and we’ve got a few thousand PCs that we’re deploying those, deploying that software onto and then it’s able to be consumed up over the Internet, the way customers consume Facebook or Twitter, they are able to consume enterprise software. That’s a very different model, and it’s a model that gives customer success, a much higher level of success than they’ve ever seen in enterprise software before.
I think the reason why is for all the reasons that I said, it’s no upgrades, it’s no updates, and I think best of all, when you look at a release like we have this quarter of Chatter. Almost a quarter of our customers are now on Chatter. You look at any other enterprise software company who puts out a major new functionality release a new product, a quarter of their customers don’t uptake the product, usually wait to hear about that over period of years. So, I don’t think it’s fair to contrast us against the Cisco environment.
We have to really look at cloud computing is where the action is in our industry and companies that are delivering true cloud computing, which are very, very high levels of efficiency, very, very low levels of costs through the multi-tenant architectures that we have pioneered, I think you’re going continue to see strong growth, which is why we are delivering such a huge increase of our guidance in today’s call.
Next question please.

I mean right here at Salesforce, I can tell you that our own use of Salesforce.com is up dramatically throughout our whole company and in addition to that, all the apps that we use, usage is way up and something else is really amazing about Chatter. You have all these employees using the product and for someone like myself, I am the CEO of a company and we’ll soon have 5000 employees at Salesforce. It’s hard to know what everyone is doing, what’s going on and who is really great, who is adding value, but Chatter makes it all very visible. It becomes a meritocracy.
We really see the employees who are making a difference and when it goes enterprise-wide, you get that value in an incredible way and that’s why I’m definitely so bullish about social networking, I’m so bullish on cloud, I’m so bullish on mobile.
One of our very largest customers, I’ve been talking to their CEO about it and he has been using the product very extensively himself, and I expect them to do a major enterprise-wide deployment of the product and the reason why is because neither one of us has ever seen a tool that’s given us this transparency into organization and that’s what we’ve needed. Email does not give you transparency.
When you’re in Outlook, you don’t really know what’s going on in the company or to seeing these, kind of, email messages flying by, but with Chatter you do. You’re able to really see what’s happening and you can make better decisions.
With the CEO that I mentioned, he had a major deal that was working on in a telecommunications’ company that he didn’t know about and he was able to see it with Chatter going through all the posts and seeing all of his employees, what they are doing, watching their collaboration, going through all the slides, and then all of a sudden he saw that they were having a hard time working with the manufacturing department of his company, and so he called the manufacturing department and said you need to help these guys who are working solely with this telecom company and he said that was the greatest thing for him that he could relieve the organizational friction using Chatter.
So that’s all we need to run better companies today and to be more effective, to be more efficient, to be more successful, and when you couple it with a world-class sales automation technology, we have customer service automation technology or building any app, you get a whole new level of capability. So I’m very excited about it and I think we’re going to see a lot of enterprise wide transactions with Chatter.

I think we had surprisingly strong growth in Sales Cloud this quarter; we were kind of shocked actually. But a lot of it enabled by Chatter, a lot of it enabled by as you mentioned Jigsaw.
With such a strong differentiation and a strong technology, I’m sure you saw CRM Magazine gave us best SFA and then we got the small, medium and enterprise clean sweep at CRM award, and then PC Magazine gave it, I think, four and a half stars in Editors choice. So, a very strong product.
But also coming up, I have to say and growing, of course, faster is Service Cloud and we are really excited about the Service Cloud. This is the year of the Service Cloud at Salesforce.com. We’re doing a lot of very large Service Cloud transactions. The Service Cloud technology has never looked better.
We have really built some spectacular capabilities as you know in knowledge management, integrating with public social networks and then again the integration of Chatter, as well as a lot of other new capabilities with the new version of Service Cloud, it’s just a great offering.
Then we have the platform, which is also growing in that a great quarter and we’re seeing a lot of your ISV interest customers building, you heard the numbers in the lines of code being written on the platform. The visualforce page is being written on the platform, and then you’ve got Chatter.
So, those are our four clouds; sales, service, collaboration and platform and then we have the emergence of Jigsaw. Jigsaw is super exciting for our company because it’s all about data, and getting data into these very high value apps to make them even more valuable.
Cleaning up our customers’ data, just giving them access to the data they need to make decisions, being able to really transform the apps into instant volume. I don’t know if you’ve been to jigsaw.com lately, but if you haven’t, you really should check it out, it’s just awesome, that’s why we bought the company and we are really doing our deep integration work.
By the time we get the Dreamforce, I think you’ll see some really great and exciting announcements in terms of where we are going with Jigsaw. So, those are our five directions right now, but at the end of the day it is a unified offering, it’s all built on one platform, it’s integrated and customers can consume these services as they need them. So, it’s been very, very good. I’ll have Graham put some of the numbers around that for you.

As Mark mentioned, Sales Cloud surprisingly strong, and that certainly helped lift off our guidance range for the year.
In terms of Jigsaw, deferred revenue as you might expect because of acquisition accounting, we wrote off 75% to 80% of the deal when we acquired the company. There is a few million dollars in that deferred revenue balance at the end of Q2 that relates obviously to a combination of what was left from the acquisition, plus the new business that they signed during the quarter.

I would say, yes. That’s how we built the product. The way we built the product is we built a platform and then on that platform we built a number of apps, and then we gave customers and ISV the ability for them to build their own apps.
So that when you get one of our apps you can rip it apart, because it’s built with the platform and put it back together exactly for your business, and your business process, your work flow, your user interface, your Web site, on and on and on; but it’s all coming out of one consistent platform. We don’t have multiple versions. We don’t have multiple products. It’s really one integrated product. When we kind of call it Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Chatter, that’s mostly to help our customers understand what we can do for them.
The technical answer is, it’s actually all fairly integrated as one service, and then as a customer, you can consume these different services including the customization services and integration services and scalability and reliability, security of the platform.
So, yes, I would agree with you that the numbers would be higher if you were to somehow break it apart, but you really can’t because and if you read that PC Magazine review of the Sales Cloud, what that reviewer loved was the platform is so deeply integrated into the Sales Cloud, it is the Sales Cloud. It’s a CRM platform; there is another way to think about it in that case.
Are we a CRM platform company instead of a CRM applications company? Yes, I think so. But, there is also a lot of other apps that are non-CRM apps that are on the platform as well. You see a lot of those on the app exchange when you visit our customers you see a lot of those as well.
So, are we a platform company? Absolutely. Are we a cloud platform an apps company? Absolutely. Our long-term vision for our company is that we are really the leaders in this cloud platform, in cloud apps and in cloud data and that’s very much the direction that we continue to move.

So we believe a lot of the price premiums that we get in the market are based on that competitive differentiation and others. So the rate there is extremely important.
Second, we have a Chatter product that you can buy Chatter and many customers did even though it’s been only available for a few weeks as a standalone SKU and we are in negotiation with a lot of our customers in expanding with Chatter. We also have free Chatter licenses as well because we really think that we want this to be our Trojan horse for enterprise-wide use.
So we have many horses going down the track in terms of monetization of Chatter, but I believe that while that’s going to be very exciting and like I was saying before, I think that the real monetization wins are going to be an increased revenues on the Sales and Service Clouds.

They don’t have the IT budgets or at least people. They don’t have the people because they’re not hiring to do these new deployments of Siebel upgrades, upgrade your call center, upgrade your contact center, upgrade your customer portal. That’s just not going to happen.
So they are being forced into making a decision which is what do they do next, and the easy decision is go with the Salesforce.com Service Cloud, because we can move you from your Siebel call center or contact center into a cloud computing modern approach and as I said before, you’re not going to have to buy any plastic to do it. So that’s a big shift I think for customers and they want it.
We’ve already seen that in Sales Cloud for a decade, of course, but now in the last couple of years really the catalyst was our InStranet acquisition and the leader of this whole effort for us our Executive Vice President, Alexandre Dayon who runs this initiative for us has just done a brilliant job, and we’re very, very, very excited about where we are. I’m sure you also know the Service Cloud was just ranked by Gartner Group as one of the leaders in the Magic Quadrant, and we just introduced the product.

This is a brand new",573,"Well, I think we are in pretty early days, to be able to kind of make. I mean, most CIOs don’t even know what social networking is yet. They are really at the beginning of this. They are learning, I think, from us, from their users. This is a brand new market. Now, that said, I really believe that there is three things that will dominate enterprise software for the next decade and that will be that enterprise software will increasingly move into the Cloud and become multi-tenant shared services, enterprise software will become increasingly social like Chatter.
And what I mean by that specifically is kind of the key things that you see in things like Facebook and Twitter like the profiles, like feeds, like status update. That will become an integrated part of all apps. That all enterprise apps are going to look exactly like Facebook. I am really convinced of that. I believe that it’s a great new model and metaphor for all apps. That all apps will move in that direction.
We are the first, but I assure you that everyone will move there, and three enterprise applications will increasingly become mobile, that they’ll move on to your Blackberry and your iPhone and your iPad and your Android device and your Tablet du jour etc., Those three trends can guide us over the next decade into what we call Cloud 2; we were really in Cloud 1.
When I started the Salesforce.com, I asked myself the question why is all enterprise software not like Amazon.com, because the model that Amazon.com pioneered was so awesome with the tab-based interface and you could basically pull the information easily out of a system and you’re just clicking with your mouse and you are using it over the Internet, but now all I do is ask myself the question why is not enterprise software like Facebook and that’s a very different model where information is being pushed at you and where the users have personalities on the systems through these profiles, and that things are happening in real time. It’s mobile and you’re touching your computer, you are not using your mouse as much.
So that’s a whole different model and that’s where I think things are really going and so, when I talked to CIOs they kind of redact all that to say well this is the consumerization of IT and they all say - we’re also really focused on virtualization. I think they’re really focused on virtualization because it’s a cost reduction metaphor but virtualization is not cloud computing and virtualization is just more efficient servers, but it’s the magnitude efficiency like we’re seeing with Salesforce.com and our cloud computing peers. That’s the excitement and that’s the power of cloud computing.
As we move now from Cloud One and into Cloud Two and while you see in these audiences that we demonstrate this technology to the, kind of, the fever that they get when they see how easy it becomes when you make it like Facebook. I think that we’re probably the first to do it, but I assure you, we will not be the last in a way that we won’t be the last to deliver cloud or mobile. That is these three things moving forward and we wanted to be the largest and most important player in this industry, but we won’t be the only ones.

We’re not trying to build out a professional services organization here at Salesforce. As you know we have a very tight relatively small group of Ninja-type architects, who help those guys do implementations, the Bluewolfs, the Aperios the Accentures, Deloittes, they are doing the implementations, but in terms of creating the demand and fulfilling the demand and signing the contracts with the customers, we’re primarily a direct distribution organization.
If you look at Salesforce.com’s distribution organization, which you approximate by the amount the money that we spend as approximately if you call it 50% of our employees, you just have to say, Oracle and SAP - they are still in order of magnitude larger than us in distribution capacity. So we’ve got a long way to go to fill in that distribution capacity and that’s why growth is so important because we are not getting to all those customers.
There is still a lot of people out there ignorantly behind enterprise software when they shouldn’t be only because they don’t know and we can’t bring them the good news and the enlightenment that the world has changed and that they can have a better thing. That’s why there is still a lot of plastic being sold and shipped, because the reality is we’re still a relatively small part of this total enterprise software industry.
So we have to grow and, of course, this has been our mantra. For more than a decade, more than 11 years coming up on 12 years, we’ve got to grow because we need to let the customers know, millions of potential customers out there that they don’t need to buy software anymore; that you can consumer it directly over the Internet. We only have 80,000 customers.
I was recently with one of my customers, Michael Dell at Dell and he was telling me he’s got 10 million customers. I am like how are we going to get to 10 million customers? We’ve got to grow to get out there. He has got the benefit of being in business for multiple decades. We’re only in the business for one decade. So that’s why we are trying to grow as fast as we can to fulfill demand, and as you can see by the numbers, the demand is there and Salesforce.com just needs to continue to execute.
All right. We have time for one more question.

To circle back on to Chatter, I think Chatter really changed the game for us on mobile because if you use Facebook on a mobile device like the iPhone, you know how compelling it is to be able to basically easily scroll through your status updates and changes well. Our customers are doing that with their iPhones, I mean I doing that with my iPhone, and I see what’s changing in my business.
What my employees are thinking, deals that are closing, deals that are getting renewed, customers that are coming to my Web site, business processes that are happening and that is very, very powerful in the mobile environment. Before Chatter, the mobile environment was mostly about kind of search, go find a contact. I was mostly pulling the information looking for things.
Now with mobile and push, it’s a very exciting, because I can quickly, in like a matter of seconds, get a complete refresh on what’s happening on the business and I think our customers see that opportunity as well. I mean I know we have won very large customer, an important customer who is in consumer optical goods and they have deployed Salesforce on iPhones and it is incredible and now they are starting to do it on iPads and that’s the future for that customer. Now I don’t know if it’s for all customers, but I think that as their user shift to these new platforms, these new mobile platforms like phones and tablets, I see that’s where all the apps will eventually end up.

I'm delighted today to share the results of our second quarter.

I'm delighted today to share the results of our second quarter. An improving demand environment together with the continued shift to enterprise cloud computing allowed us to post another great financial quarter.
Second quarter revenue of $394 million rose 25% year-over-year. Even with an annual revenue run rate approaching $1.6 billion, our revenue growth has accelerated. At 25%, second quarter revenue rose at its fastest rate in six quarters and it represents the third quarter in a row in which our growth rate has now increased.
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.29 was well above our outlook entering the quarter. GAAP EPS was $0.11. We also delivered roughly $76 million in operating cash flow, an increase of more than 66% from a year ago. Over the past 12 months, our business has generated more than $340 million of operating cash, and we exit the quarter with roughly $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
And finally, I'm pleased today to announce that we're raising the high end of our full year, fiscal year '11 revenue guidance to $1.6 billion. This is a huge new milestone for salesforce.com.
While our second quarter financial performance speaks for itself, the big news this quarter was the release of Chatter in June. Just as Amazon did a decade ago, Facebook and Twitter are now showing us the future of the Internet, this time in the area of collaboration. According to Nielsen, use of social networking apps was up 43% as a percentage of time spent on the Web between June 2009 and June 2010. Leveraging the social features popularized by the consumer Web like profiles, status updates, real-time feeds and mobile apps, Salesforce Chatter helps companies increase employee productivity by empowering employees with a new level of collaboration.
Customer response to Salesforce Chatter has been nothing short of amazing. Within a week of the release, more than 10,000 customers had turned on Salesforce Chatter. Today, less than two months later, that number has now grown to nearly 20,000 customers, or roughly one quarter of our total customer base. We believe this is the most successful new software release ever. 
Not only does Chatter make our sales and service cloud apps better, but when our customers talk about it, they're using words like amazing, exciting, fun, revolutionary, not words typically used to describe enterprise software, and that's why we believe Salesforce Chatter is the next killer app from salesforce.com.
While we launched the product just eight weeks ago, we're already seeing some incredible traction across our customer base. Some of our largest customers are deploying Chatter to very large user communities. Among them, Dell, Sprint, Tyco, Avis, Budget, Misys, McAfee, PerkinElmer and Dow Jones. Not only are some of our largest customers deploying Chatter at scale, but we're seeing a growing number of customers expand their deployments beyond sales and customer service departments by purchasing additional subscriptions for other departmental employees, and some of those expanding customers including Hitachi and Softbank, Reed Exhibitions, Mitsubishi, Nokia and Abbott Medical.
Chatter's an important part of our growth strategy for two primary reasons. First, customers that have deployed Chatter have higher login and usage rates, indicating that they're seeing increased value in our products. Not only does Chatter further differentiate our already award-winning apps, but we believe the higher levels of customer success translate into greater customer retention.
Longer-term, Chatter represents our first enterprise-wide app, extending our value beyond our core sales and customer service base. That's why we're so excited to see this early momentum around Salesforce Chatter. This significantly increases our addressable market in cloud computing, one of the fastest growing segments in technology today.
The customer excitement around Chatter helped drive another amazing quarter for salesforce.com in Q2, and during the quarter we added roughly 4,600 net new customers organically, and roughly 500 unique customers through the addition of Jigsaw. Together, these 5,100 net new customers bring our total customer community to approximately 82,400, an increase of more than 19,000 from Q2 a year ago. 
And we saw strength in all of our primary cloud businesses, as well as in our three major geographies. In fact, one of our three largest transactions this quarter, one was in The Sales Cloud, one was in The Service Cloud and one was Force.com. And those three deals were also spread across the globe, with one coming in, in each of the three regions of the world. That's the kind of distribution of our portfolio that we like at salesforce.com. And our success at companies of all sizes also continues to be a central part of our growth story. That's why CRM Magazine just named salesforce.com apps the best enterprise CRM suite, the best midmarket CRM suite and the best small business CRM suite. It was a clean sweep for the second year in a row, and this year for good measure they named our flagship Sales Cloud service Best Sales Force Automation.
And while our Sales Cloud still represents roughly 2/3 of our new business, the mix of non-Sales Cloud business continues to grow, finishing Q2 at its highest level ever. The emergence of multiple growth levers is an important part of our overall revenue growth in recent quarters and why we remain so optimistic about our revenue growth going forward.
Now let me quickly review our success in each of our three core businesses. In the Sales Cloud, new business signings were strong in the second quarter. Large Sales Cloud transactions included Kimberly-Clark, Sears, Amdocs, American Family Life, 3M, American Express, Commercial Metals, Tyco and others. I'm also pleased to report that our integration of Jigsaw into the Sales Cloud is on track. With a community of more than 22 million contacts at 4 million companies, and more than 1 million contributors, Jigsaw immediately makes our Sales Cloud offering more attractive to new customers, and more sticky with existing ones by providing customer data right inside their apps. That's an exciting new shift to CRM.
Our Service Cloud business was also very strong in the second quarter, growing faster than our other Cloud businesses. With fewer than 10,000 of our existing 82,000 customers using The Service Cloud a day, we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface of a major future opportunity. Service Cloud highlights this quarter included transactions at Schneider, Zimmer, GENBAND, PTC, Paychex, Google and Honeywell.
And finally, our Force.com business had another very strong quarter. Headlining our Force.com platform success was a great win in Japan at Japan Post, ALICO and Daiwa. And outside of Japan, Force.com also delivered another solid quarter of new business, including transactions at Nokia, RehabCare, Watson Pharmaceuticals, Cigna and IG Group.
And the future looks bright for the Force.com. And as I mentioned ago, Chatter has the potential to take us enterprise-wide, and the positive implications to our platform opportunity as well. A larger and more diverse community of users makes the Force.com platform more attractive to both CIOs, our core customers and ISVs, as the best place to build their next-generation enterprise cloud apps, natively, right on our Force.com platform.
And our recently announced partnerships with VMware is also being enthusiastically received by our customers and the industry. With VMforce, developers will essentially be able to run their job apps on the Force.com platform natively. Rather than running it on a traditional database and software stack in their own data centers, not only will VMforce allow customers to leverage their existing Java development skills and reduce the perceived risk of platform lock-in, but every job app built on the Force.com platform will immediately inherit its incredible benefits of a multi-tenant platform.
A developer preview of VMforce is expected later this year. While VMforce and Chatter position us for future platform business growth, the Force.com platform infrastructure is already delivering some pretty impressive results today. I know a lot of you are monitoring it minute by minute at trust.salesforce.com. Well, let's take a look. During the second quarter, Force.com delivered 21 billion transactions, incredible, an increase of 44% year-over-year. Remarkably, we're delivering this scale using fewer than 3,000 production servers, including backups and disaster recovery, a level of efficiency that could only be delivered by a true multi-tenant cloud computing company and what we believe is one of the lowest CO2 per transaction ratings in the industry today.  And don't forget, we're doing it all with sub-300 millisecond response, 99.98% planned availability and best-in-class security and transparency.
In addition to our tremendous transaction volume, our customers have now created more than 23 million database customizations, an increase of roughly 40% year-over-year. And finally, in addition to customizing our sales and service apps, customers are increasingly using the Force.com platform to build their own apps. To date, our developer community of more than 280,000 developers, has created more than 600 million lines of Force.com code, up more than 7x from a year ago, and more than 1.6 million custom Visualforce pages, up more than 5x from a year ago, and more than 170,000 custom apps, up roughly 50,000 from a year ago. We believe there's no better cloud platform to build and run cloud apps than Force.com.
According to IDC, the cloud market is estimated to grow by more than 40 billion by 2014. That's why leadership and growth remain our absolute top priorities. Given higher demand for our services and the continued shift to cloud computing, we believe the time to invest, growth [ph] (23:58) and leadership is now. That's why we're accelerating some of our growth investments in the second half.
First and most importantly, we're stepping up our hiring, particularly in key sales and engineering functions. Continued innovation and expanded sales capacity are essential to maintaining our cloud leadership and to fueling growth.
Next, we're proceeding with the buildout of three new data centers. In the U.S., we expect to bring new data centers online in the Midwest and East Coast this year. And then we plan to open up our Japan, Tokyo Data Center next year. And finally, we're expanding the number and scale of our customer events, as there's no better way to demonstrate the power of cloud computing than to show it live.
In September, we'll be hosting Cloudforce events in London, Denver and Toronto and then in October, Cloudforce events will include Tokyo, Rotterdam and Munich. And I'll be personally delivering the keynotes in London on September 7, and in Tokyo on October 5, and I hope to see you there.
Then we'll close the year with our biggest customer event ever, Dreamforce 2010 right here in San Francisco, from December 6 through December 9. In addition to our biggest product announcements of the year which will be happening at Dreamforce, Dreamforce 2010 highlights will include a keynote by President Bill Clinton and entertainment by legend Stevie Wonder. Dreamforce is not to be missed so mark your calendars now. You can find additional details about Dreamforce at www.dreamforce.com.
With that, let me turn the call over to Graham to provide more detail on our excellent second quarter financial performance, as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. Graham?"

By almost every financial measure, our second quarter was outstanding. Revenue rose 25% year-over-year to just over $394 million. This strong performance was well above our outlook, primarily as a result of three factors. First, as Marc disc",1753,"Thanks, Marc. By almost every financial measure, our second quarter was outstanding. Revenue rose 25% year-over-year to just over $394 million. This strong performance was well above our outlook, primarily as a result of three factors. First, as Marc discussed, we're seeing strong demand for all of our products and especially for The Service Cloud. Second, our dollar attrition rate continued to decline in Q2. While the percentage rate remains in the high teens, this was the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement. We're working hard on the areas within our control that we hope can positively influence customer retention and keep this metric on a downward path. And finally, the FX environment is more favorable today than when we offered guidance at the end of the first quarter.
Our second quarter revenue results included approximately $5 million of currency headwind versus a year ago. Adjusting for FX rates, constant currency growth would've been a point higher at 26%.
Looking at the regions, our Americas business rose 22% to just under $275 million. Revenue in Europe faced a significant currency headwind versus a year ago, as the dollar strengthened almost $0.15 against the euro. As a result, revenue of approximately $66 million was up 17% in dollars, but up 30% in local currency. 
The stronger yen created an opposite effect in Asia, and that region continued to deliver very strong results. Revenue in Asia rose 59% in dollars and 53% in local currency to finish the quarter at approximately $54 million.
Given the current economic environment, we expect FX volatility to continue to have an effect on our financial results both positive and negative for the foreseeable future. As a general perspective, we saw good performance across all geographies, with Europe in particular posting a very strong new business quarter.
Second quarter non-GAAP gross margin improved about 30 basis points from the year-ago quarter and remained at about 82%, due primarily to a change in business mix. Our subscription and support gross margin was essentially flat year-on-year, a good result given the huge transactional growth Marc discussed earlier. Professional services gross margins were negative this quarter and declined sequentially; while we aim to manage that business to at least breakeven gross margins, our more important objective is customer success.
Given the project-based nature of consulting and the revenue effects of EITF 00-21, I expect gross margins for our professional services business to be lumpy for the remainder of the year. Next year, we plan to implement EITF 08-01, but it's still too early to know exactly how that will impact our results.
On the pricing front, we continued to see no material changes when we compare average price per seat across additions, geographies or customer segments. We've done a great job of innovating and creating customer success with new services like Chatter, which we think enables us to focus on selling value.
Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 67%, up about 150 basis points from last year. Our fastest growing expense category is R&D, which now stands at roughly 11% of revenue. Given the importance of continued technology leadership and sales in Service Clouds, as well as working on new products like Jigsaw, Chatter and VMforce, we think this increased level of investment is very appropriate. Sales and marketing expenses were 43% of revenue, that's flat with last year, and finally, G&A was a little higher than last year, at 14% of revenue.
Our overall full-time employee count rose by approximately 340 people in Q2 to finish at just under 4,450 people worldwide. Remember, this increase includes approximately 150 people from the acquisition of Jigsaw. We plan to accelerate organic hiring in the second half of the year to support our long-term growth objectives, which will obviously have an impact on second half expense levels.
Non-GAAP operating margin in the second quarter was approximately 16% versus roughly 17% a year ago. The decrease was primarily the result of the Jigsaw acquisition.
It's also worth noting that our final valuation of the purchased intangibles related to the Jigsaw acquisition was considerably less than our original estimation back in April. As a result, the related amortization in fiscal 2011 was approximately $7 million less than the amount we included in the FY '11 GAAP EPS guidance we provided with our first quarter results. This change will have the effect of reducing the GAAP dilution from Jigsaw by roughly $0.03 per share for FY '11, a $0.01 of which came through in our Q2 results with a further $0.01 benefit expected in each of Q3 and Q4.
As Marc mentioned, both Jigsaw's business performance and its integration are going very well and we expect Jigsaw's business to be close to breakeven on a non-GAAP basis by the end of next year.
We remain committed to delivering operating margin expansion each year in our core business, but clearly, the effect of acquisitions can have a short-term effect on that goal as Jigsaw has done this year.
Our Q2 GAAP tax rate for the quarter rose to 44% as a result of certain acquisition and investment-related nondeductible expenses and a decrease in pretax GAAP income. Our Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 39%. For the full year, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 41% and our non-GAAP rate to be about 38%.
Second quarter operating cash flow was outstanding at approximately $76 million. That's an increase of 66% year-over-year. Over the past 12 months, we've generated more than $346 million of operating cash. That's an increase of 46% over the previous 12 months. CapEx in the quarter was approximately $28 million. The increase this quarter is primarily the result of leasehold improvements in the office-based and equipment purchases related to the buildout of the data centers Marc mentioned.
Our first half CapEx is up 23% year-over-year. That's slightly less than our revenue growth rate. Second quarter free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow, less CapEx, was approximately $48 million. That's an increase of 77% from last year.
Year-to-date, our free cash flow has increased 61%. Please remember that because our invoicing is seasonal, our quarterly cash flow profile is also seasonal, and it's typically stronger in the first quarter and fourth quarter. Although Q3 cash flow is projected to be sequentially lower than Q2, but higher than Q3 a year ago, we now believe our operating cash flow for the full fiscal year will grow to rates slightly higher than our revenue growth rate.
Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on the balance sheet finished the quarter at approximately $1.9 billion. This was down about $50 million from Q1, primarily due to acquisition-related disbursements of $150 million, offset by stock option exercises and operating cash flow. Receivables continue to be well-managed. Our DSO of 53 days rose slightly from 49 days a year ago, but our collections and aging remain strong and our DSO is well within our historical range.
Deferred revenue rose $18 million sequentially and $134 million year-over-year to finish the quarter at $683 million. That's 24% year-over-year growth, and reflected both strong new business signings as well as improving renewal rates. Our Q2 deferred revenue balance included a roughly $3 million sequential currency benefit, primarily the result of a stronger yen.
As we've discussed on prior calls, Q2 and Q3 re seasonally lower invoicing quarters and that has the obvious effect of dampening deferred revenue. I remind you that last year our deferred revenue balance declined $4 million sequentially from Q2 to Q3, despite a roughly $6 million currency benefit. In that context, we expect our third quarter deferred revenue balance to be roughly flat with Q2, excluding any significant currency effects.
Let me close with our outlook. As in Q1, our earnings guidance comments today will only be in non-GAAP terms. The details for both our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance and related reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release issued today, as well as on our website. 
Let me begin with our full-year guidance. Given our strong new business performance in the second quarter, the continued shift to cloud computing, declining attrition rates and more favorable currency rates for the euro and the yen, we're very pleased to be able to raise our revenue guidance for fiscal year 2011 to a range of $1.595 billion to $1.6 billion.
As we indicated in our commentary, we believe that growth and leadership are the best ways to create long-term shareholder value. In that context, where we plan to invest much of the revenues [indiscernible] (35:05) growth. I'm also pleased to be able to raise our full fiscal year 2011 non-GAAP EPS projection to between $1.15 and $1.17. As in past quarters, this excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles and amortization of the debt discount on our convertible debt.
For the third quarter, we are projecting revenue in the range of $408 million to $410 million, and non-GAAP EPS excluding the same items I just mentioned in our full-year outlook is now projected in the range of 30% to 31%.
Our Q3 EPS guidance implies more profit in Q3 and less in Q4 than many of you have modeled. The reasons are pretty straightforward. First, we'll be hosting our biggest Dreamforce event ever in December, as Marc just mentioned. Because this event is so critical to our customers' success and to fueling our growth, we're determined to make this year our most amazing event ever. We expect that the net cost of this event alone will be roughly $0.05 of EPS in the fourth quarter.
And second, Q4 is typically our largest quarter for new business and also when our sales force hits their commission accelerators. Since we don't capitalize commissions that are paid to sales consultants or sales management, sales expenses can rise steeply in the fourth quarter. As you model Q3 and Q4, please factor in these two expected seasonal business impacts.
To close, we were very pleased with our second quarter results. Revenue grew 25%, our global community of customers grew more than 30% and the number of transactions executed on our service grew more than 40%. These results position us well for future growth and we're investing in the necessary hiring and infrastructure to address the large and growing cloud computing market opportunity. We look forward to updating you on our progress when we announce our third quarter results in November.
Let's go ahead and open the call up for questions. Operator?"

As I mentioned in my script, we have about 3,000 servers, and that includes 1,500 that are",510,"Well, Kash, I am very bullish on cloud computing, and real cloud computing, which is the kind of very efficient model that salesforce.com has been able to deliver. As I mentioned in my script, we have about 3,000 servers, and that includes 1,500 that are just standing by in case there's a disaster. And you have to kind of ask yourself, if salesforce.com did not exist for the 82,000 customers that we have and the couple hundred thousand apps that they're running on our servers, how many servers would they need? And you could quickly determine that we are operating at a level of efficiency that's probably a few percentage points of what they would've had to buy. And that's why I think cloud computing is so exciting to customers because -- certainly for our customers -- it's a CapEx-free environment. They're not buying hardware. They're not buying the kind of traditional capital expenditures necessary in taking on the risk to deliver automation into their companies. And I think that, that's a big juxtaposition against kind of my bullishness. And I love John Chambers, I think he's probably one of the really greatest CEOs in our industry. But his company is all about CapEx. I mean at the end of the day, Cisco is very different than Salesforce because Cisco is all about routers and hubs and switches and phones and set-top boxes and telepresence devices. And all of those things are made out of plastic and they've got wires and they've got to ship them and build them and factories, and -- we don't have any factories. We've got our software engineers, and we've got a few thousand PCs that we're deploying that software onto and then it's able to be consumed over the Internet the way customers consume Facebook, or Twitter, they're able to consume enterprise software. And that's a very different model, and it's a model that gives customers success, a much higher level of success than they've ever seen in enterprise software before. And I think the reason why, is for all the reasons that I said: it's no upgrades, it's no updates and I think, best of all, when you look at a release like we had this quarter of Chatter, almost a quarter of our customers are now on Chatter. You look at any other enterprise software company who puts out a major new functionality, release a new product, a quarter of their customers don't uptake the product. You usually wait to hear about that over a period of years. So I don't think it's fair to contrast us against the Cisco environment. We have to really look at, cloud computing is where the action is in our industry. And companies that are delivering true cloud computing, which are very, very high levels of efficiency, very, very low levels of cost, through the multi-tenant architectures that we have pioneered, I think you're going to continue to see strong growth, which is why we're delivering such a huge increase of our guidance in today's call."

I mean right here at Salesforce, I can tell you that our own use of salesforce.com is up dramatically throughout our whole company. And in addition to that, all the apps that we use, usage is way up. And something else that's really amazing about Chatter. You have all these employees using the product. And for someone like myself, I am a CEO of a company, and we'll soon have 5,000 employees at Salesforce. It's hard to know what everyone is doing, what's going on, and who's really great, who's adding value, but Chatter makes it all very visible. It becomes a meritocracy. We really see the employees who are making a difference. And when it goes enterprise-wide, you get that value in an incredible way. And that's why I'm definitely so bullish about social networking, I'm so bullish on cloud. I'm so bullish on mobile. And one of our very largest customers, I've been talking to their CEO about it, and he's been using the product very extensively himself, and I expect them to do a major enterprise-wide deployment of the product. And the reason why is because neither one of us has ever seen a tool that's given us this transparency into the organization, and that's what we've needed. E-mail does not give you transparency. When you're in Outlook, you don't really know what's going on in the company; you're just seeing these kind of e-mail messages flying by. But with Chatter, you do, you're able to really see what's happening and you can make better decisions. With the CEO that I mentioned, he had a major deal that was working on in a telecommunications company that he didn't know about, and he was able to see it with Chatter going through all the posts and seeing all of his employees, what they're doing, watching their collaboration, going through all the slides. And then all of a sudden, he saw that they were having a hard time working with the manufacturing department of his company, and so he called the manufacturing department and said, ""You need to help these guys who are selling to this telecom company,"" and he said that was the greatest thing for him that he could relieve the organizational friction using Chatter. So that's what we need to run better companies today and to be more effective, to be more efficient, to be more successful. And when you couple it with the world-class sales automation technology we have, customer service automation technology, or building any app, you get a whole new level of capabilities. So I'm very excited about it, and I think we're going to see a lot of enterprise-wide transactions with Chatter."

I think we had really strong, surprisingly strong growth in Sales Cloud this quarter. We were kind of shocked actually, but a lot of it enabled by Chatter, a lot of it enabled by, as you mentioned, Jigsaw. And with such a strong differentiation and a strong technology, I'm sure you saw CRM magazine gave it Best SFA, and then we got the Small, Medium and Enterprise clean sweep at CRM Award, and then PC Magazine gave it I think 4 ½ stars in Editor's Choice. So very strong product. But also coming up I have to say and growing of course faster, is Service Cloud, and we're really excited about Service Cloud. This is the year of The Service Cloud at salesforce.com. We're doing a lot of very large Service Cloud transactions. The Service Cloud technology has never looked better. We have really built some spectacular capabilities as you know in knowledge management, integrating with public social networks and then again, the integration of Chatter, as well as a lot of other new capabilities with the new version of Service Cloud, it's just a great offering. And then we have the platform, which is also growing and had a great quarter. And we're seeing a lot of ISV interest, customers building -- you heard the numbers in the amount of lines of code being written on the platform, the Visualforce pages being written on the platform. And then you've got Chatter. So those are our four clouds: sales, service, collaboration and platform. And then we have the emergence of Jigsaw. And Jigsaw is super-exciting for our company because it's all about data and getting data into these very high-value apps to make them even more valuable, cleaning up our customers' data, just giving them access to the data they need to make decisions, being able to really transform the apps into instant value. And I don't know if you've been to Jigsaw.com lately but if you haven't, you really should check it out. It's just awesome, and it's why we bought the company, and we're really doing our deep integration work. And by the time we get to Dreamforce, I think you'll see some really great and exciting announcements in terms of where we're going with Jigsaw. So those are our five directions right now but at the end of the day, it is a unified offering that's all built on one platform, it's integrated and customers can consume these services as they need them. So it's been very, very good. I'll have Graham put some of the numbers around that for you."

We don't have multiple versions, we don't have multiple products, it's really one integrated product. When we kind of call it, Sales Cloud,  Service Cloud, Chatter, that's mostly to help our customers understand what we can do for them. The technical answer is, it's actually all fairly integrated as one service. And then as a customer, you can consume these different services including the customization services and integration services and scalability, and reliability, security of the platform. So yes, I would agree with you that the numbers would be higher if you were to somehow break it apart. But you really can't because – and if you read that PC Magazine review of The Sales Cloud, what that reviewer loved was the platform is so deeply integrated into The Sales Cloud, it is The Sales Cloud. It's a CRM platform, is another way to think about it in that case. And are we a CRM platform company instead of a CRM applications company? Yes, I think so.

We've already seen that in Sales Cloud for a decade, of course. But now in the last couple years, really the catalyst was our InStranet acquisition and the leader of this whole effort for us, our Executive Vice President, Alexander Dionne, who runs this initiative for us, has just done a brilliant job, and we're very, very, very excited about where we are. And I'm sure you also know, The Service Cloud was just ranked by Gartner Group as one of the leaders in the Magic Quadrant, and we just introduced the product. So it's an exciting product and an exciting opportunity. And I do believe it will be our very fastest growing and most material product for the year."

In terms of the commentary on attrition, we just said basically that there was a further downtick, the fourth consecutive quarter of reduction in our attrition rates, still in the high teens but definitely heading in the right direction, we think. Obviously, we're working on that. No doubt, we're getting some help from the economy as well. But we're pleased with that trend.

They're really at the beginning of this. And they're learning, I think, from us, from their users, but this is a brand new market. Now that said, I really believe that there's three things that will dominate enterprise software for the next decade, and that will be that enterprise software will increasingly move into the cloud and become multi-tenant-shared services. Enterprise software will become increasingly social like Chatter. And what I mean by that specifically is, kind of the key things that you see in things like Facebook and Twitter, like the profiles, like feeds, like status updates, that, that will become an integrated part of all apps, that all enterprise apps are going to look exactly like Facebook. I'm really convinced of that. I believe that it's a great new model and metaphor for all apps, that all apps will move in that direction, okay. We're the first, but I assure you that everyone will move there. And three, enterprise applications will increasingly become mobile, that they'll move on to your BlackBerry and your iPhone and your iPad and your Android device and your tablet du jour, et cetera. And those three trends can guide us over the next decade into what we call Cloud 2. We were really in Cloud 1. When I started salesforce.com, I asked myself the question, why is all enterprise software not like Amazon.com because the model that Amazon.com pioneered was so awesome with the tab-based interface and you could basically pull the information easily out of the system, and you use clicking with your mouse and you're using it over the Internet. But now all I do is ask myself the question, why isn't all enterprise software like Facebook? And that's a very different model where information is being pushed at you, and where the users have personalities in the system through these profiles. And that things are happening in real-time and it's mobile. And you're touching your computer, you're not using your mouse as much. So that's a whole different model, and that's where I think things are really going. And so when I talk to CIOs, they kind of redact all that to say, ""Well this is the consumerization of IT."" And they all say, ""But we're also really focused on virtualization."" And I think they're really focused on virtualization because it's a cost reduction metaphor. But virtualization is not cloud computing and virtualization is just more efficient servers but it's not order of magnitude efficiency like we're seeing with salesforce.com and our cloud computing peers. And that's the excitement and that's the power of cloud computing. And as we move now from Cloud 1 and into Cloud 2, and while you see in these audiences that we demonstrate this technology to the kind of the fever that they get when they see how easy it becomes when you make it like Facebook, I think that we're probably the first to do it, but I assure you, we will not be the last in the way that we won't be the last to deliver cloud or mobile. That it's these three things moving forward and we want to be the largest and most important player in this industry but we won't be the only ones."

We're not trying to build out a professional services organization here at Salesforce. As you know, we have a very tight, relatively small group of kind of Ninja-type architects who help those guys do implementations, the Bluewolfs, the Appirios, the Accentures, the Deloittes. They're doing the implementations but in terms of creating the demand and fulfilling the demand and signing the contract with the customers, we're primarily a direct distribution organization. And if you look at salesforce.com's distribution organization, which you can approximate by the amount of money that we spend as approximately, you could call it 50% of our employees, you just have to say, Oracle and SAP, they're still an order of magnitude larger than us in distribution capacity. So we've got a long way to go to fill in that distribution capacity, and that's why growth is so important because we're not getting to all those customers. There are still a lot of people out there ignorantly behind enterprise software when they shouldn't be, only because they don't know and we can't bring them the good news and the enlightenment that the world has changed and that they can have a better thing. That's why there's still a lot of plastic being sold and shipped. Because the reality is, we're still a relatively small part of this total enterprise software industry. So we have to grow and of course this has been our mantra for more than a decade, more than 11 years, coming up on 12 years. We've got to grow because we need to let the customers know, the millions of potential customers out there, that they don't need to buy software anymore, that you can consume it directly over the Internet. And we only have 80,000 customers. I was recently with one of my customers, Michael Dell at Dell, and he was telling me he's got 10 million customers. I'm like, how are we going to get to 10 million customers? We've got to grow to get out there. He's got the benefit of being in business for multiple decades. We were only in the business for one decade. So that's why we're trying to grow as fast as we can to fulfill demand, and as you can see by the numbers, the demand is there and salesforce.com just needs to continue to execute."

But we see an increased level of usage and interest in it like never before. And to circle back to Chatter, I think Chatter really changes the game for us on mobile. Because if you use Facebook on a mobile device like the iPhone, you know how compelling it is to be able to basically be able to easily scroll through your status updates and changes. Well, our customers are doing that with their iPhones. I mean I'm doing it with my iPhone, and I see what's changing in my business, what my employees are thinking, deals that are closing, deals that are getting renewed, customers that are coming to my website, business processes that are happening, and that is very, very powerful in a mobile environment. Before Chatter, the mobile environment was mostly about kind of search, go find a contact, I was mostly pulling the information, looking for things. Now with mobile, and push, it's very exciting because I can quickly in like a matter of seconds, get a complete refresh on what's happening on the business. And I think our customers see that opportunity as well. I mean, I know we have one very large customer, an important customer, who is in consumer optical goods, and they have deployed Salesforce on iPhones, and it is incredible. And now they're starting to do it on iPads and you know what? That's the future for that customer. Now, I don't know if it's for all customers, but I think that as their users shift to these new platforms, these new mobile platforms like phones and tablets, I see that's where all the apps will eventually end up."

Here are the highlights from the third quarter. First, the Giants win the World Series, amazing. In other news, salesforce.com revenue for the third quarter rose to $429 million, an increase of roughly 30% from a year ago. This was our best growth performance in seven quarters and our annual revenue run rate is now more than $1.7 billion.
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.32 rose from $0.28 a year ago; we've seen our EPS guidance even as we increased our investment scenarios that are key for future growth.
Third quarter operating cash flow was approximately $74 million, an increase of more than a 100% from year ago, year-to-date we've generated almost $300 million in operating cash flow that's up more than 60% from the same period last year, our cash generation continues to be outstanding.
Finally while we have our important fourth quarter ahead of us as we close out fiscal year '11 I'm thrilled to announce the preliminary revenue estimate for fiscal year '12 of $1.97 billion to $2.0 billion. The high end of that range would make salesforce.com the first could computing company ever to achieve $2 billion in annual revenue and puts us in an elite group of our software companies to break through the $2 billion revenue threshold.
As evidence of our incredible growth after taking a decade to record our first $1 billion year in fiscal year 2009, we now expect to double in size to $2 billion in just three years later in fiscal year '12.
Customer momentum continues to be strong, during the third quarter we added approximately 4,800 net new customers taking our global customer community to more than 87,200 with more than 19,000 net new customers over the past year we've grown our customer base by more than 28%.
The market opportunity for cloud computing is enormous and growing and the shift to Cloud 2 the next generation of cloud computing that is social, mobile and real time is undeniable.
Now we'd like to walk through the performance of each of our five product lines or as we call them the five Clouds, now as many of you now we made Chatter generally available to all of our customers in June and today less than five months since its debut we now report that 60,000 that's 60,000 of our more than 87,000 paying customers have deployed Salesforce Chatter.
That means that it is the largest enterprise social network in place today and it means that we've more than tripled the number of deployment since we first reported on Chatter adoption only one quarter ago we've just never seen companies adopt any technology this widely, this fast and we think we're getting going.
New Chatter deployments in the third quarter included Amazon.com, Bausch & Lomb, Bank of America, Deloitte, Harris, Kelly Services, Motorola, Nikon, Siemens and Vodafone and customers tell us Chatter has made them more productive. In the survey we commissioned customers reported that Chatter has directly resulted in a 10% boost in productivity and cut email traffic by 13% on average.
As companies see how Chatter improves communication and collaboration many are expanding their deployments in the new departments and functions across their enterprises. As we have noted Chatter represents a huge opportunity for Salesforce to expand outside of its current subscriber base and in new departments.
This quarter customers including Nokia, Panasonic, Sony, have all purchased additional Salesforce subscriptions for Chatter and I'm pleased to announce that Dell has now made Chatter available to more than 90,000 employees around the world making it the largest customer of Salesforce Chatter that is amazing. Over 90,000 employees now are live at Dell on Salesforce Chatter.
Chatter is also helping salesforce.com reach entirely new customers. Companies that were previously not Salesforce customers including Yahoo, bought subscription to use Chatter as a standalone collaboration platform and customers using Chatter tell us they are thrilled with the productivity gains and the open communication it brings to their organizations.
It's safe to say that Chatter has become a major differentiator for our sales and service applications in our Force.com platform. It only makes us stickier, improving retention, improving adoption, and it helps us expand our presence with existing customers and win deals against our competitors, and that's why we believe Chatter is the next killer app from salesforce.com.
Nothing speaks more to the shifts in our industry than when a large industry leading company replaces its legacy software in favor of the cloud. In this quarter, I am delighted to announce that the storage leader NetApp unplugged their failed Oracle deployment and became a customer of our Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Force.com platforms.
The NetApp win highlight an outstanding quarter for our flagship Sales Cloud which delivered its biggest third quarter of new business ever. During the quarter, we added new Sales Cloud business or expanded existing deployments at a long list of customers including FedEx, Ryder, FUJIFILM Medical, Level 3 Communications, Ingram, Groupon, British Columbia Lottery and Vodafone, and because every business, regardless of size or industry wants to optimize sales and improve customer relationships. We believe the growth opportunity for the Sales Cloud remains large and our Sales Cloud customers are now enjoying the benefits of more accurate contact information with the Data Cloud.
Based on the acquisition of Jigsaw, integration of Jigsaw is progressing well and new deals this quarter included Sharp, Amazon, Caplin and Ariba. For our customers, better data means greater productivity, higher sales and higher levels of customer satisfaction. For salesforce.com, the Data Cloud provides greater differentiation for our core sales and service clouds, lower attrition and a huge opportunity as we look to cross sell to our large global community of roughly 87, 000 customers. We welcome them all to salesforce.com's new Jigsaw product line.
While we expect Jigsaw to become a future driver of growth, the Service Cloud is already delivering this significant growth today. By fully integrating our Sales and Service Cloud solutions, companies now have access to single integrated view of their customers, and with Chatter, they are able to resolve customers issues faster and more effectively than ever before.
These benefits help power another huge business quarter for the Service Cloud which once again was our fastest growing business in the third quarter. Major wins or deployment expansions of the Service Cloud included Univision, RSA, Merrill Lynch, Mosaic, Paychex and the U.S. Government Department of Commerce.
Strong cross selling into our installed based along with sales to new customers has helped us to grow our total Service Cloud community to now approximately 13, 000 customers globally. But with a total customer community of more than 87,000, were just scratching the service of what's possible with salesforce.com's Service Cloud.
Custom application development on our Force.com platform continues to be another massive opportunity for salesforce.com. Honestly, we think application development deployment remains our largest and most exciting opportunity as we continue to execute through the Force.com platform.
This quarter we closed the deal with a New York City Department of Education for the 100,000 Force.com licenses, that's 100, 000 Force.com licenses at the New York City Department of Education. Together with salesforce.com partner Acumen Solutions, the New York Education Department plans to build 8 apps that teachers and administrators will use to track their students performance.
Additional, force.com wins include ThinkTech, Nippon Kaiji Kyokai, Larson Software and Fast Retailing and we also continue to see terrific adoption of the platform by partners and developers. Our developer community has grown to more than 310,000 up more than $100,000 in the last year alone. This growing community of developers is putting the force.com platform to good use.
Creating nearly 25 million customizations an increase of 38% year-over-year, more than 960,000 custom database tables, up nearly 50% year-over-year, more than 185,000 custom apps, an increase of more than 50,000 year-over-year and just last week we celebrated another platform milestone, 1000 apps on our AppExchange, the traction, the excitement, the movement around force.com gives us a lot of faith and a lot of confidence and the power of Platform as a Service to come in the dominant way that application developers build applications in the future and we're making more investments in that area.
Of course, products are only great if people use them and that's why usage is such an important indicator of customer success and while trust, security, performance, reliability and availability are the top priorities. Our focus on building cloud services that customers love and use every day and adopt continues to yield some amazing results.
During the third quarter, the Force.com platform delivered roughly 25 billion transactions, it's 25 billion, an increase of more than 50% from a year ago, that amazing traction of our product and usage and capability, a 50% increase to 25 billion transactions. That's more than 3,000 transactions every second of every day during the quarter and we deliver these transactions with four lines availability and with an average transaction speed of less than 300 milliseconds, amazing. All this performance is transparent, you can see today in real time at trust.salesforce.com. I encourage you all to visit that site. It's the site that has given our customers the transparency that has resulted in the trust that they have with salesforce.com.
With 87,200 customers globally and vital app in Chatter that can take this enterprise wide. We are creating a great foundation for the future of our platform business together with a surging community of developer and ISVs, the long-term growth opportunity for the platform has never been brighter.
In my opinion, there has never been a better time to be in the cloud computing industry. According IDC the cloud market is expected to grow by a CAGR 25% through 2014 to roughly $40 billion and with our industry leading lineup of cloud services and five Clouds and our strong financial performance, the time to invest for growth and market leadership is absolutely now and that's exactly what we are doing.
First, people are biggest growth driver. Particularly in sales and engineering and in Q3 we accelerated hiring by adding more 300 net new employees and we continue to grow our workforce globally.
Second, we're continuing to build out our data center to support our accelerating transaction growth and international expansion plans and as I indicated in our last call, we expect to have two additional data centers operational in the United States by the end of this year, and then next year we will live with our new production data center in Tokyo, Japan.
Third, we continue to see the international market as large and mostly untapped growth opportunity. Rather than spreading our resources too broadly, we're focusing our efforts on the top software markets of the world. We believe very strongly in this focused strategy of the top software markets and we believe scale and focus will allow us to accelerate our growth in these important markets. That focus is why we acquired substantially so we do have good sustainability.
All of the non-controlling interest owned shares in our Japanese subsidiary during the quarter and for earlier this month we had made the decision to buy 14 acres of land here in San Francisco along with a long-term goal of developing a corporate campus. Having a world-class campus will enable us to better serve our customers, drive employee productivity by keeping our people together, and most importantly, we believe it's going to allows us to attract and retain the best employees in the world right here in San Francisco, California. We're still in the early planning stages of this project. We're going to announce more exciting details as they shortly become available. Finally, we're evangelizing the cloud business model, so you should expect more global events.
Speaking of events, today we're only 10 business days away, that's only 10 business days away from what has become the largest cloud computing event in the world, Dreamforce 2010, and it's an event like no other. First of all, we've already had more than 20,000 people registered and our internal estimates are that we'll have more than 25,000 in attendance at Dreamforce.
That will be spectacular and it will have the biggest selection of cloud computing products under one roof with more than 250 cloud vendors in the Expo, the largest gathering of cloud experts, leading more than 700 sessions. It is going to be the place to learn about the cloud, to experience the cloud and to meet the customers and partners that are putting it into place and creating the cloud computing industry.
On December 6, we have Cloudstock, which is our first worldwide developer conference that's linked to Dreamforce, and I expect all of you to come and see the power of the Platform as a Service and its momentum and the growth in our customers at Cloudstock. Then on December 7, I'll open with a keynote session at 9 a.m., where we will introduce new products and introduce you to customers who are making major deployments with salesforce.com's Cloud solution, and that night on December 7, we will have Stevie Wonder and will.i.am, the head of the Black Eyed Peas, entertain attendees at a special concert.
Then on December 8, we will have our platform keynote, where we plan to unveil the future of Platform as a Service. Then at 5 p.m., President Bill Clinton will join us for a keynote on stage. That evening, at 7 p.m., Colin Powell will open our benefit concert for the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital at the Masonic Hall, and then, Neil Young will play for all of us.
We look forward to seeing all of you in San Francisco for December 6, 7 and 8 to join us and meeting some of these great leaders of our world and of our industry and great entertainers, and we want to thank all of you for your continued support of salesforce.com.
Now, with that, let me turn the call over to Graham for the financial details of our outstanding third quarter.
"
122917,115505459,88770,"Salesforce.com, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2010",2010-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Our third quarter results as you've heard were outstanding across all key financial measures with our revenue, operating cash flow and attrition results all showing strength. Let me get into the detail; revenue of $429 million rose 30% year-",1509,"Thanks, Marc. Our third quarter results as you've heard were outstanding across all key financial measures with our revenue, operating cash flow and attrition results all showing strength. Let me get into the detail; revenue of $429 million rose 30% year-over-year, and year-to-date, our revenue of $1.2 billion is up more than 26%. Subscription and support revenue grew even faster, posting year-over-year growth of more than 31% for the quarter and 27% year-to-date.
In addition to the strong new business performance that Marc mentioned three other factors contributed to our revenue result this quarter. First, a continued modest reduction in our attrition rate, second, a solid pricing environment, and third, a weakening dollar.
Let me briefly touch on each of these factors. First our dollar attrition when compared to the year ago quarter is now back in the mid-teens percentage range. In fact the dollars we lost through attrition in Q3 were left in absolute terms than in the same quarter a year ago.
Q3 marked the fifth quarter in a row in which attrition has declined slightly. This trend is encouraging and has clearly been supported by an improving economic environment. Having said that we've been reluctant to anticipate improvements until they happen as a lot of different factors can affect the rate. As you are all aware the fourth quarter is by far our largest renewals quarter, so we'll obviously provide an update for you in February.
Mitigating attrition is important to our long-term growth and we continue to focus on customer life cycle and how we can best help our customers realize maximum value from their implementation of Salesforce. We believe this focus will have a beneficial long-term impact on retention.
Turning to pricing, when we compare the net price per seat for the professional enterprise on limited and unlimited service additions over the past eight quarters, we continue to see very little change. We believe that our investments in new technologies like Chatter and Jigsaw have helped us maintain our compiling value proposition.
Finally, the weakening of the dollar over the past three months helped make an already strong quarter even stronger. $7 million of our sequential quarterly revenue increase was a result of changing FX rates.
Conversely, our year-over-year revenue was actually reduced by $4 million due to a small currency headwind. Third quarter revenue growth from a year ago in constant currency was 31%.
In terms of the performance by region in the Americas revenue rose by 26% to approximately $293 million, in Europe revenue of just over $76 million was up 26% in dollars and up 38% in constant currency. In Asia revenue of $60 million rose 62% in dollars and 53% in constant currency.
In total our international business rose by 40% in dollars and 44% in constant currency. International revenue now represents 32% of total revenue. As Marc indicated our international growth strategy is to focus our resources in the top markets in the world the top software markets in the world and dominate in those markets. We continue to see very strong growth in service cloud and approximately one-third of our new business came from non-FFA products.
Turning to the income statement. Our third quarter non-GAAP gross margin of 82% was up slightly versus both last quarter and Q3 last year. As in past quarters the improvement in gross margin is primarily the results of a changing mix in our revenue line items.
Our subscription and support revenue is growing much faster than our low margin professional services revenue, as we continue to expand our ecosystem of consulting partners.
Non-GAAP operating expenses was 67% of revenue for the third quarter up slightly from 66% year ago and essentially flat sequentially. R&D expense was 10% of revenue and sales and marketing expense was 44%. The both are up slightly from the year ago quarter primarily as a result of our aggressive hiring in both those groups. G&A remained essentially unchanged at 13% of revenue from the year ago quarter.
The biggest driver expense growth in Q3 was accelerated hiring during the quarter we added just over 300 people, so finished the quarter with approximately 4,750 employees. This represents an increase of almost 950 employees or 25% from a year ago and that of course includes the 150 people we added through the acquisition of Jigsaw.
Given the importance of growing our distribution capacity and product development organization, we expect to hire more people in Q4 than we did in Q3. Non-GAAP operating margin of 15.4% was down slightly from last year due to the acquisition of Jigsaw.
Our new business performance has been particularly strong through the first three quarters of the year as a result many of our sales commission bonus and partner referral fee plans are trending well above 100% payoffs. Although, we do capitalize and then amortize most of our direct sales commissions, it's important to remember that the great majority of our total sales costs are expensed as incurred. As I mentioned a moment ago, we've also hired aggressively to continue our strong growth trajectory.
Our fourth quarter performance will affect our revenue exit rate at the end of the year and hence we'll inform our hiring investment decisions for fiscal 2012. We continue to believe the best way to create long-term shareholder value, is to extend our leadership and dominate our market through aggressively growing our business.
Moving onto cash flow, operating cash flow for the third quarter was approximately $74 million, that's an increase of roughly 108% from a year ago. Year-to-date, we've generated more than $293 million in operating cash flow, that's an increase of more than 64% from a year ago.
Capital spending for the quarter was $21 million. The primary drivers of CapEx are the build out of the two U.S. data centers that Marc mentioned and leasehold improvements generally to support our growing employee population.
The cash flow defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures was also strong at $53 million, that's an increase of roughly 112% from last year. Over the last four quarters, we've generated $317 million in free cash flow. Given our ratable revenue model and the fact that roughly two-thirds of invoiced dollars are for 12 month durations, we believe that cash flow is an important measure of our operating performance.
Looking to Q4, we expect our cash flow growth rate to be a few points slower than our revenue growth rate as we pay Dreamforce related expenses, fourth quarter ramp commissions and continue to hire aggressively.
Cash and cash equivalents overall including marketable securities finished the quarter at approximately $1.8 billion. Deferred revenue rose by approximately 27% year-over-year to finish the quarter at $695 million. We had a small headwind on deferred revenue of approximately $2 million on a year-over-year comparison basis. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of improving deferred revenue growth, reflecting strong new business, reduced attrition, and continued stability in invoicing durations.
On a sequential basis, deferred revenue rose by approximately $11 million in dollar terms but was flat in constant currency terms. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect deferred revenue to grow at just a slightly slower rate year-over-year than in Q3.
Let me close with our outlook. As we enter Q4, demand for our products continues to be strong. I've already mentioned Dreamforce, ramp commission and bonus plans and aggressive hiring were some of the reasons why operating income in the fourth quarter will be slightly lower than in Q3.
With that context, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of approximately $447 million to $449 million and project non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of approximately $0.27 to $0.28.
All of the underlying assumptions for this non-GAAP guidance as well as our GAAP guidance and a complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release.
Looking forward to fiscal 2012, as Marc indicated, we currently anticipate revenue to be in the range of $1.97 billion to $2 billion. It's important to note that we will be adopting the new revenue recognition standard EITF 08-01, which we estimate will increase next year's revenue by approximately $20 million. This extra amount is included in our guidance range.
Clearly, growth is still our number one priority, and so you should expect us to continue ramping our investments in distribution capacity, datacenters and product development to achieve our aggressive goals.
Before I close, I'd like to remind everyone that the key day at Dreamforce for analysts is Tuesday, December 7. In addition to Marc's opening keynote, analysts are invited to a VIP luncheon & CEO Q&A session, and then later that afternoon, David and I will be hosting another session to review our business model and some of the key metrics that drive our business. If you haven't already done so, you can register on our website or contact Investor Relations directly.
With that, let me thank you all for joining us today and I'd like to open up the call for questions.

It's obviously a long-term goal for the Company and we believe we have enough evidence at this point that we can get there. The business is so strong that we decided to acquire the stock from our Japanese partner SunBridge and to focus on having a wholly-owned subsidiary. That's been very important to us. We believe that will give us strategic strength. I can tell you that I was just there and our relationships with the most important companies in Japan have really never been stronger. Everyone is very excited that we're building a datacenter jointly with NTT. We've been advertising that in the Nikkei and been getting some great response and we really see the Japanese market as just a tremendous opportunity on the going forward basis. I think you've probably noticed a number of really powerful and important Japanese names in my script today. I've never been more excited about the Japanese cloud computing markets.

We're working on a free version of Chatter that will be a viral based product and we'll introduce that to our customers at Dreamforce, some of our customers already have that product and that's very exciting for us. We've been testing making Chatter more viral by giving our customers ability to send viral invites. One of the things for us is that our customers need to assign their email domain to service and then admin needs to turn on this kind of viral invite capability but that's very exciting for us and so this will be a new - exactly what you said stripped-down version of Chatter but it will operate within our existing customer network. So if you are a customer, you will be able to email and send viral invites to other customers and this I think will be just a tremendous accelerator for Chatter and we plan to turn that on for all customers shortly. Two, we will have a free independent service that's kind of a viral service that we'll mostly use as lead-gen and for getting customers to upsell called Chatter.com and we plan to launch that in the first quarter and that will be very exciting for us and for all of our customers and as we start to work on that Chatter.com concept, that'll have a lot of the looking flavor that you can see of the traditional enterprise social networking sites we're already a lot bigger than them as you know. The big differentiator we have of course remains this data integration. So that will be extremely exciting for us.

So the power for Chatter remains, number one, it's driving tremendous adoption, its making us much stickier, it's making us much more efficient inside of our customers and because of that we think it's strategic for us. It's not just the tactical product, it's strategic in that, it really is kind of a next wave of computing and that we've talked about the mobility and the social aspects and the real time aspects of computing the Chatter offers. It’s strategic for us because of how it impacts our customers’ usage of our product just goes way up and also it drives some of their other products down like email. So that's why we're investing in Chatter, you've seen us talking about $15 Chatter product which is kind of this enterprise expansion product that we've been using to kind of do these Chatter only deals. I just mentioned we'll work on Chatter free product which will be stripped-down even farther from there which will be virally oriented and then we'll have Chatter.com which will be this type of free service and the fundamental reason is that we really think that we found something that customers want and that makes us stronger in our existing customers just look at Dell. So with Dell, we of course had our, 30, 40, 50,000 users or whatever, it was in Dell, then the all the sales and marketing users but Michael Dell really got excited and in the Chatter and was using it himself and then said let's roll this thing out, and really within a couple of weeks, we were able to turn on now almost a 100,000 users of Chatter inside Dell and they've eliminated all the other enterprise social networking products that they were using inside Dell at the same time. They will all be direct now to Chatter and we are building a very large enterprise social network. The power of that really came from that there was several situations where they've just got tremendous business value from the service and we see that happening with a lot of our customers. It's going to continue to take a lot of evangelism; it's going to continue to take a lot of education. This is a relatively new product it's only been live for a couple of quarters and you are going to see a lot of exciting new features of Chatter when we get to Dreamforce. You're going to see things happening in the feed that you've just never seen happen in a feed with any other product before. It's pretty incredible.

Of course, you look at products like Lotus Notes and we've talked about this before, it's a product that was conceived before Mark Zuckerberg, the Founder of Facebook was, and the reality is that it's not a humorous joke, these customers have been running this technology for two and three decades and they are hiring these people out of school and they are coming into these, 'Productivity Applications,' that they have in their customers, in these customers and they are saying, 'I don't know how to use this, this is not how I work'. Where is my iPad? Where is my iPhone? Where is my BlackBerry? Where is my graphical user interfaces and they are like, well, this is graphical user interface, and it's like, this is Windows and it's just junk and that's what Lotus Notes is honestly? It was a great product at the time, but IBM has done a terrible job in terms of keeping it fresh. Just look at the terrible job IBM has done with their, fundamentally their software strategy. They've had to move to an acquisition strategy because they left these kinds of core franchises erode. They turned them into cash cows and now they are getting trampled by these next generation products. I think SharePoint is very much the same thing. It's kind of the grandmother's attic. These customers throw everything into it and then they can't find it and they don't know what's up there, and they don't know how to get it out, and it's a joke. It becomes their 'Internet' and employees are stippled. But when they get in these dynamic environments of these enterprise social networks they've found a great new model of doing business and the power of that, Laura, is that there are some great ones out there but none of them is as good as Chatter because we are integrated with data. So as transactions happen around your business, content gets refreshed, or sales transactions are close, the orders change, that the social network is updating you on the transactions and the fundamental things on the business that you are following, if you are following customer service enquiries, accounts, contacts, opportunities, building materials, marketing competitive analysis, groups, collaborations, as those things change, bam, you are getting that update, that's very powerful and Lotus Notes and SharePoint just don't do it. So you are going to see even more exciting things in that Dreamforce, so I'll see you there.

You'll see, it's going to happen, we're going to be talking about, I don't know, $500 million transactions a day pretty soon coming up on, how many database transactions we're completing for customers and I've mentioned that was between four and five-ninths of liability and at 300 milliseconds and we've done incredible things in the database and the release of Apex restored procedures and triggers and making the database so useful. Now the database has been very tightly integrated as you know with our user interface environment, what we call Force.com or Visualforce and the breakthrough we had is that the database is so powerful. What if we were to uncouple it that was really the breakthrough where we said now we can have VMforce because that we've uncoupled the database let's put Java on top of VMforce so that customers don't want to use RUI environment which is excellent, but they want to use Java, which is also excellent so they have freedom of choice. That's what VMforce is, it let the customers build in a Java IDU spring from VMware and run that Java code write on our database and now that we've been doing that we've been saying how do get all these languages running on top of our database. How do we get all of these mobile devices running on top of our database? As you see us head the Dreamforce you're going to see these additions that we've been talking about this year start to come to manifestation because we think the next generation of Platform as a Service is exactly that, it's the VMforce model, that's highly productive commodity language with very robust cloud based services from Salesforce that we're the only ones who really doing that in the world at this transaction levels. We think we're going to try to hyper drive our Force.com environment and VMforce, the Dreamforce. So you're going to see some of it at Cloud Talk on December 6 and then you're going really see it in our key note on December 7, and December 8 we're going to do an extensive review of how we're going to super charge that Platform as a Service because we really think the time is really right for that.

So, the power of Chatter is that once it gets in there then we can say, you can turn this on, you can turn that on, you can turn an opportunities, you can turn on content, you can turn on contacts, you can turn on cases, you can turn on knowledge management, you can turn on all these things in it, you can turn on the analytics and dashboards, and as you turn these things on, your feeds become more valuable to you and this is our strategy, Brent, which is to make those feeds indispensible. Now, I am using the new version of Chatter that we'll announce at Dreamforce, and I can tell you that I can't separate myself from it, it's so powerful. I have it on my BlackBerry. I have it on my iPad, my iPhone, and I have it on my - we've released a desktop app for it now that runs on PC and Macintosh built in Adobe Flash and AIR, and we have a native Android product under development, and the robustness of the feed, it's not just that the feed is full of follow human communication of one person talking to the other which was kind of the first generation like we have in Facebook. But just as Facebook has shown, when they added the photos sharing app that if you can get more and more data, and for us, it's all about business transactions and workflow that we can really transform a business and give them more transparency and help CEOs like Michael Dell, I mentioned, become more aligned with their organization, and this is our goal and he obviously had a great quarter today. I don't know if Salesforce Chatter had something to do with that. But our goal is to make our customers successful, keep them focused, motivated, help them keep their employees communicating, and there is no better tool to do that than Salesforce Chatter.

Here's the highlights from the third quarter. First, the Giants won the World Series, amazing. In other news, Salesforce.com revenue for the third quarter rose to $429 million, an increase of roughly 30% from a year ago. This was our best growth performance in seven quarters and our annual revenue run rate is now more than $1.7 billion. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.32 rose from $0.28 a year ago. We've seen our EPS guidance even as we increased our investment in areas that are key for future growth. Third quarter operating cash flow was approximately $74 million, an increase of more than 100% from a year ago. Year-to-date, we've generated almost $300 million in operating cash flow, that was up 60% from the same period last year. Our cash generation continues to be outstanding.
And finally, while we have our important fourth quarter ahead of us, as we close out fiscal year '11, I'm thrilled to announce the preliminary revenue estimate for fiscal year '12 of $1.97 billion to $2.0 billion. The high end of that range would make Salesforce.com the first cloud computing company ever to achieve $2 billion in annual revenue and puts us in an elite group of software companies to breakthrough the $2 billion revenue threshold. As evidence of our incredible growth, after taking a decade to record our first billion-dollar year in fiscal year 2009, we now expect to double in size to $2 billion in just three years later in fiscal year '12.
Customer momentum continues to be strong. During the third quarter, we added approximately 4,800 net new customers taking our global customer community to more than 87,200 with more than 19,000 net new customers over the past year. We've grown our customer base by more than 28%. The market opportunity for cloud computing is enormous and growing. And the shift to Cloud 2, the next-generation of cloud computing that is social, mobile and realtime is undeniable. And now, we'd like to walk you through the performance of each of our five product lines or as we call them, the five clouds. Now as many of you know, we've made Chatter generally available to all of our customers in June. And today, less than five months since its debut, we now report that over 60,000, that's 60,000 of our more than 87,000 paying customers have now deployed Salesforce Chatter. That means that it is the largest enterprise social network in place today and it means that we've more than tripled the number of deployments since we've first reported on Chatter adoption only one quarter ago. We've just never seen companies adopt any technology this widely, this vast, and we think we're just getting going.
New Chatter deployments in the third quarter included Amazon.com, Bausch & Lomb, Bank of America, Deloitte, Harris, Kelly Services, Motorola, Nikon, Siemens and Vodafone, and customers tell us Chatter has made them more productive. In a survey we commissioned, customers reported that Chatter has directly resulted in a 10% boost in productivity and cut e-mail traffic by 13% on average. And as companies see how Chatter improves communication and collaboration, many are expanding their deployments in the new departments and functions across their enterprises. And as we have noted, Chatter represents a huge opportunity for Salesforce to expand outside of its current subscriber base and into new departments. This quarter, customers including Nokia, Panasonic, Sony have all purchased additional Salesforce subscription for Chatter. And I'm pleased to announce that Dell has now made Chatter available to more than 90,000 employees around the world, making it the largest customer of Salesforce Chatter. That is amazing. 
Over 90,000 employees now are live at Dell on Salesforce Chatter. And Chatter is also helping Salesforce.com reach entirely new customers. Companies that were previously not Salesforce customers, including Yahoo!, FOX subscriptions use Chatter as a stand-alone collaboration platform and customers using Chatter tell us they're thrilled with the productivity gains and the open communication it brings to their organizations. It's safe to say that Chatter has become a major differentiator for our sales and service obligations and our Force.com platform, it only makes us stickier, improving retention, improving adoption and it helps us expand our presence with existing customers and win deals against our competitors. And that's why we believe Chatter is the next killer app from Salesforce.com. 
Nothing speaks more than the shifts in our industry than when in a large industry-leading company replaces its legacy software in favor of the cloud. In this quarter, I'm delighted to announce the storage leader, NetApp unplugged their failed Oracle deployment and became a customer of our Sales Cloud, Service Cloud and Force.com platforms. The NetApp win highlighted an outstanding quarter for flagship Sales Cloud, which delivered its biggest third quarter of new business ever.
During the quarter, we added new Sales Cloud business or expanded existing deployments at a long list of customers including FedEx, Ryder, Fujifilm Medical, Level 3 Communications, Ingram, Groupon, British Columbia Lottery and Vodafone. And because every business, regardless of size or industry wants to optimize sales and improve customer relationships, we believe the growth opportunity for the Sales Cloud remains large.
And our Sales Cloud customers are now enjoying the benefits of more accurate contact information with the Data Cloud. Based on the acquisition of Jigsaw, integration of Jigsaw is progressing well and new deals this quarter included Sharp, Amazon, Caplin and AREVA. For our customers, better data means greater productivity, higher sales and higher levels of customer satisfaction. For Salesforce.com, the Data Cloud provides greater differentiation for our core sales and service clouds, lower attrition and a huge opportunity as we look to cross sell to our large global community of roughly 87,000 customers. We welcome them all at Salesforce.com's new Jigsaw product line.
And while we expect Jigsaw to become a future driver of growth, the Service Cloud is already delivering this significant growth today by fully integrating our Sales and Service Clouds solutions, companies now have access to single integrated view of their customers. And with Chatter, they're able to resolve customer issues faster and more effectively than ever before. These benefits help power another huge business quarter for the Service Cloud, which once again, was our fastest growing business in the third quarter. Major wins or deployment expansions of the Service Cloud included Univision, RSA, Merrill Lynch, Mosaic, Paychex and the U.S. Government Department of Commerce. Strong cross selling into our installed base along with sales to new customers has helped us to grow our total Service Cloud community to now approximately 13,000 customers globally. But the total customer community of more than 87,000 were just scratching the surface of what's possible with Salesforce.com's Service Cloud. 
Custom application development on our Force.com platform continues to be another massive opportunity for Salesforce.com. Honestly, we think application development deployment remains our largest and most exciting opportunity that we continue to execute through Salesforce.com platforms.
This quarter, we've closed a deal with the New York City Department of Education for the 100,000 Force.com licenses, that's 100,000 Force.com licenses at the New York City Department of Education. Together with Salesforce.com partner, Acumen Solutions, the New York Education Department plans to build eight apps that teachers and administrators will use to track and boost student performance. 
Additional Force.com wins include Think Tech, NIPPON KAIGI KYOKAI, Larson Software and FAST RETAILING and we also continue to see terrific adoption of the platform by partners and developers. Our developer community has grown to more than 310,000, up more than 100,000 in the last year alone.
This growing community of developers is putting the Force.com platform to good use, creating nearly 25 million customizations, an increase of 38% year-over-year, more than 960,000 custom database tables, up nearly 50% year-over-year more than 185,000 custom apps, an increase of more than 50,000 year-over-year. And just last week, we celebrated another platform milestone, 1,000 apps on our AppExchange. The traction, the excitement, the movement around Force.com gives us a lot of faith and a lot of confidence in the power of platform of the service to come in the dominant way that application developers build applications in the future, and we're making more investments in that area. Of course, products are only great if people use them, and that's why usage is such an important indicator of customer success. And while trust, security, performance, reliability and availability are top priorities, our focus on building cloud service that customers love and use everyday and adopt continues to yield some amazing results.
During the third quarter, the Force.com platform delivered roughly 25 billion transactions, that's 25 billion, an increase of more than 50% from a year ago. That's amazing traction of a product and usage and capability, a 50% increase to 25 billion transactions. That's more than 3,000 transactions every second of every day during the quarter, and we delivered these transactions with four nines availability and with an average transaction speed of less than 300 milliseconds. Amazing. And all of these performance is transparent. You can see it today in realtime at trust.salesforce.com. I encourage you all to visit that site. It's the site that has given our customers the transparency that has resulted in the trust they have with Salesforce.com. 
With 87,200 customers globally, and a vital app in Chatter that can take us enterprise wide, we're creating a great foundation for the future of our platform business together with a surging community of developers and ISVs, the long-term growth opportunity for the platform has never been brighter.
In my opinion, there's never been a better time to be in the cloud computing industry. According to IDC, the cloud market is expected to grow by a CAGR of 25% through 2014 to roughly $40 billion. And with our industry-leading lineup of cloud services and our five clouds and our strong financial performance, the time to invest for growth and market leadership is absolutely now. And that's exactly what we're doing. First, people are our biggest growth driver. Particularly, in sales and engineering and in Q3, we accelerated hiring by adding more than 300 net new employees, and we continue to grow our workforce globally. 
Second, we're continuing to build out our data centers to expand support or accelerating transaction growth in international expansion plans. And as indicated in our last call, we expect to have two additional data centers operational in the United States by the end of this year and then next year, we will be live with our new production data center in Tokyo, Japan.
Third, we continue to see the international market as large and mostly untapped growth opportunity. Rather than spreading our resources too broadly, we're focusing our efforts on the top software markets of the world. We believe very strongly in this focus strategy of the top software markets. And we believe scale and focus will allow us to accelerate our growth in these important markets. That focus is why we acquired substantially, but we do have good sustainability. 
All of the non-controlling interests owned shares in our Japanese subsidiary during the quarter. And fourth, earlier this month, we have made the decision to buy 14 acres of land here in San Francisco, along with the long-term goal of developing a corporate campus. Having a world-class campus will enable us to better serve our customers, drive employee productivity by keeping our people together and most importantly, we believe it's going to allow us to attract and retain the best employees in the world right here in San Francisco, California.
And we're still in the early planning stages of this project. We're going to announce more exciting details as they shortly become available. And finally, we're evangelizing the cloud business model, so you should expect more global events. Speaking of events, today, we're only 10 business days away, that's only 10 business days away from what has become the largest cloud computing event in the world, Dreamforce 2010. And it's an event like no other. First of all, we've already had more than 20,000 people registered and our internal estimates are that we'll have more than 25,000 in attendance at Dreamforce. That will be spectacular and it will have the biggest selection of cloud computing products under one roof with more than 250 cloud vendors in the expo, the largest gathering of cloud experts, leading more than 700 sessions. It's going to be the place to learn about the cloud, to experience the cloud and to meet the customers and partners that are putting it into place and creating the cloud computing industry.
On December 6, we have Cloud Stock, which is our first worldwide developer conference that's linked to Dreamforce. And I expect all of you to come and see the power of the platform and the service and its momentum and the growth in our customers at Cloud Stock. Then on December 7, I'll open up the keynote session at 9:00 a.m., where we'll introduce new products and introduce you to customers who are making major deployments with Salesforce.com's Cloud Solutions. And that night on December 7, we'll have Stevie Wonder and Will.i.am, the head of the Black Eyed Peas entertain attendees at a special concert. Then on December 8, we'll have our platform keynote, where we plan to unveil the future of platform as a service. And then at 5:00 p.m., President Bill Clinton will join us for a keynote on stage. That evening, at 7:00 p.m., Colin Powell will open our benefit concert for the UCSF Bennoit Children's Hospital at the Masonic Hall. And then Neal Young will play for all of us. We look forward to seeing all of you in San Francisco for December 6, 7 and 8 to join us and meeting some of these great leaders of our world and of our industry and great entertainers. And we want to thank all of you for your continued support of Salesforce.com.
Now with that, let me turn the call over to Graham for the financial details of our outstanding third quarter."
122917,115505459,88791,"Salesforce.com, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2010",2010-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Our third quarter results, as you've heard were outstanding across all key financial measures, with our revenue, operating cash flow and attrition results all showing strength. Let me get into the detail.Revenue of $429 million rose 30% ye",1512,"Thanks, Marc. Our third quarter results, as you've heard were outstanding across all key financial measures, with our revenue, operating cash flow and attrition results all showing strength. Let me get into the detail.
Revenue of $429 million rose 30% year-over-year, and year-to-date, our revenue of $1.2 billion is up more than 26%. Subscription and support revenue grew even faster, posting year-over-year growth of more than 31% for the quarter and 27% year-to-date. 
In addition to the strong new business performance that Marc mentioned, three other factors contributed to our revenue result this quarter. First, a continued modest reduction in our attrition rate. Second, a solid pricing environment. And third, a weakening dollar. Let me briefly touch on each of these factors.
First, our dollar attrition, when compared to the year ago quarter, is now back in the mid-teens percentage range. In fact, the dollars we lost through attrition in Q3 were less in absolute terms than in the same quarter a year ago. Q3 marked the fifth quarter in a row in which attrition has declined slightly. This trend is encouraging as clearly been supported by an improving economic environment. Having said that, we've been reluctant to anticipate improvements until they happen, as a lot of different factors can affect the rate. As you're all aware, the fourth quarter is by far our largest renewals quarter. So we'll obviously provide an update for you in February. 
Mitigating attrition is important to our long-term growth when we continue to focus on customer life cycle and how we can best help our customers realize maximum value for the implementation of Salesforce. And we believe this focus will have a beneficial long-term impact on retention.
Turning to pricing. When we compare the net price proceed for the professional enterprise unlimited and unlimited service additions over the past eight quarters, we continue to see very little change. We believe that our investments in new technologies, like Chatter and Jigsaw, that helps us maintain our compelling value proposition. 
And then finally, the weakening of the dollar over the past three months helped make an already strong quarter even stronger. $7 million of our sequential quarterly revenue increase was a result of changing FX rates. Conversely, our year-over-year revenue was actually reduced by $4 million due to a small currency headwind. Third quarter revenue growth from a year ago in constant currency was 31%.
In terms of the performance by region, in the Americas, revenue rose by 26% to approximately $293 million. In Europe, revenue are just over $76 million, was up 26% in dollars and up 38% in constant currency. And in Asia, revenue of $60 million rose 62% in dollars and 53% in constant currency.
In total, our International business rose by 40% in dollars and 44% in constant currency. International revenue now represents 32% of total revenue. As Marc indicated, our international growth strategy is to focus our resources in the top markets in the world, the top software markets in the world and dominate in those markets. We continue to see very strong growth in Service Cloud and approximately 1/3 of our new business came from non-SFA products. 
Turning to the income statement. Our third quarter non-GAAP gross margin of 82% was up slightly versus both last quarter and Q3 last year.
As in past quarters, the improvement in gross margin is primarily the result of a changing mix in our revenue line items. Our subscription and support revenue is growing much faster than our low margin professional services revenue as we continue to expand our ecosystem of consulting partners. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses was 67% of revenue for the third quarter, up slightly from 66% a year ago and essentially flat sequentially. R&D expense was 10% of revenue and sales and marketing expense was 44%. They're both up slightly from the year ago quarter, primarily as a result of our aggressive hiring in both those groups. G&A remained essentially unchanged at 13% of revenue from the year ago quarter.
The biggest driver of expense growth in Q3 was accelerated hiring. During the quarter, we added just over 300 people to finish the quarter with approximately 4,750 employees. This represents an increase of almost 950 employees or 25% from a year ago, and that of course, includes the 150 people we added through the acquisition of Jigsaw. Given the importance of growing our distribution capacity and product development organization, we expect to hire more people in Q4 than we did in Q3.
Non-GAAP operating margin of 15.4% was down slightly from last year due to the acquisition of Jigsaw. Our new business performance has been particularly strong through the first three quarters of the year. As a result, many of our sales commission, bonus and partner referral fee plans are trending well above 100% pay outs. Although we do capitalized and amortized most of our direct sales commissions, it's important to remember that the great majority of our total sales costs are expensed as incurred. As I mentioned a moment ago, we've also hired aggressively to continue our strong growth trajectory.
Our fourth quarter performance will affect our revenue exit rate at the end of the year. And hence, we'll inform our hiring and investment decisions for fiscal 2012. We continue to believe the best way to create long-term shareholder value is to extend our leadership and dominate our markets through aggressively growing our business. 
Moving on to cash flow. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was approximately $74 million. That's an increase of roughly 108% from a year ago. Year-to-date, we've generated more than $293 million in operating cash flow, that's an increase of more than 64% from a year ago. Capital spending for the quarter was $21 million. The primary drivers of CapEx are the build out of the two U.S. data centers that Marc mentioned and leasehold improvements generally to support our growing employee population.
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures was also strong at $53 million, that's an increase of roughly 112% from last year. Over the last four quarters, we've generated $317 million in free cash flow. Given our ratable revenue model and the fact that roughly 2/3 of invoiced dollars are for 12-month durations, we believe the cash flow is an important measure of our operating performance. 
Looking to Q4, we expect our cash flow growth rate to be a few points slower than our revenue growth rate as we pay Dreamforce related expenses, fourth quarter ramp commissions and continue to hire aggressively. Cash and cash equivalents overall, including marketable securities, finished the quarter at approximately $1.8 billion. Deferred revenue rose by approximately 27%, year-over-year to finish the quarter at $695 million. We had a small headwind on deferred revenue of approximately $2 million on a year-over-year comparison basis. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of improving deferred revenue growth, reflecting strong new business, reduced attrition and continued stability and invoicing durations.
On a sequential basis, deferred revenue rose by approximately 11 million in dollar terms, but was flat in constant currency terms. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect deferred revenue to grow at just a slightly slower rate year-over-year than in Q3. 
Let me close with our outlook. As we enter Q4, demand for our products continues to be strong. I've already mentioned Dreamforce, ramp commission and bonus plans and aggressive hiring are some of the reasons why operating income in the fourth quarter will be slightly lower than in Q3. With that context, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of approximately $447 million to $449 million and project non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of approximately $0.27 to $0.28. All of the underlying assumptions for this non-GAAP guidance, as well as our GAAP guidance on a complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release. Looking forward to fiscal 2012, as Marc indicated, we currently anticipate revenue to be in the range of $1.97 billion to $2 billion. It's important to note that we'll be adopting the new revenue recognition standard, EITF 08-01, which we estimate will increase next year's revenue by approximately $20 million. This extra amount is included in our guidance range.
Clearly, growth is still our number one priority and so you should expect us to continue ramping our investments in distribution capacity, data centers and product development to achieve our aggressive goals. 
Before I close, I'd like to remind everyone that the key date at Dreamforce for analysts is Tuesday, December 7. In addition to Marc's opening keynote, analysts are invited to a VIP luncheon and CEO Q&A session and then later that afternoon, David and I will be hosting another session to review our business model and some of the key metrics that drive our business.

We're working on a free version of Chatter that will be in kind of a virally based product, and we'll introduce that to our customers at Dreamforce. Some of our customers already have that product and that's very exciting for us. We've been testing and kind of making Chatter more viral by giving our customers the ability to send viral invites. One of the things for us is that our customers need to assign their e-mail domain to the service and then the admin needs to turn on this kind of viral invite capability, but that's very exciting for us. And so this will be a new kind of exactly what you said, stripped-down version of Chatter, but it will operate within our existing customer networks. So if you're a customer, you'll be able to e-mail and send viral invites to other customers. And this, I think, will be just a tremendous accelerator for Chatter, and we plan to turn that on for all customers shortly. And two, we will have a kind of three independent service that's kind of a viral service that we'll mostly use as lead gen and for getting customers to upsell called Chatter.com, and we're planning to launch that in the first quarter and that will be very exciting for us and for all of our customers. And as we start to work on that Chatter.com concept, that will have a lot of the kind of look and flavor that you can see of the traditional enterprise, social networking sites. We're already a lot bigger than them, as you know. But the big differentiator we have, of course, remains is data integration. So that will be extremely exciting for us."

And the fundamental expansion deals that we're getting for Chatter against the huge revenue numbers of the Sales Cloud and Service Cloud and Custom Cloud just are basically very small against that. So the power for Chatter remains number one, it's driving tremendous adoption, it's making us much stickier. It's making us much more efficient inside of our customers. And because of that, we think it's strategic for us. It's not just a tactical product. It's strategic and that it really is kind of the next wave of computing and that we've talked about the mobility and the social aspects and the realtime aspects of computing the Chatter offers. But it's strategic for us because of how it impacts our customers usage of our product just goes way up. And also it drives some of their other products down like e-mail. So that's why we're investing in Chatter. You've seen us talk about the $15 Chatter product, which is kind of this enterprise expansion product that we've been using to kind of do these Chatter-only deals. I just mentioned we'll work on a Chatter free product, which will be stripped down even farther from there, which will be virally oriented and then we'll have Chatter.com, which will be this kind of free service. And the fundamental reason is that we really think that we found something that customers want and that makes us stronger in our existing customers. Just look at Dell. So with Dell, we of course, had our third year or fourth year 50,000 users or whatever it was in Dell than all the sales and marketing users. But Michael Dell really got excited and in the Chatter and was using it himself. And then said, ""Let's roll this thing out,"" and really within a couple weeks, we were able to turn on now almost 100,000 users of Chatter inside Dell, and they've eliminated all the other enterprise social networking products that they were using inside Dell at the same time. They'll all be direct now to Chatter, and we're building a very large enterprise social network. The power of that really came from there were several situations where they just got tremendous business value from the service, and we see that happening with a lot of our customers. It's going to continue to take a lot of evangelism. It's going to continue to take a lot of education. This is a relatively new product. It's only been live for a couple of quarters. And you're going to see a lot of exciting new features of Chatter when we get to Dreamforce. You're going to see things happening in the feed that you've just never seen happen in a feed with any other product before. It's pretty incredible."

And I appreciate the question because I do think this is probably one of the most exciting things we've already ever been associated with. And of course, you look at products like Lotus Notes, and we talked about it before. It's a product that was conceived up before Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook was. And the reality is that it's not a humorous joke. These customers have been running this technology for two or three decades, and they're hiring these people out of school and they're coming in to these ""productivity applications"" that they have in their customers and these customers in there saying ,""I don't know how to use this. This is not how I work."" ""Where's my iPad?"" ""Where's my iPhone?"" ""Where's my Blackberry?"" ""Where's my graphical user interfaces?"" And they're like well this is graphical user [indiscernible].  This is Windows. And it's just junk. And that was Lotus Notes is honestly. It was a great product, at the time but IBM has done a terrible job in terms of keeping it fresh. Just look at the terrible job IBM has done with their fundamentally their software strategy? They've had to move to an acquisition strategy because they let this kind of core franchises erode. They turn them into cash cows and now they're getting trampled by these next-generation products. And I think SharePoint is very much the same thing. It's kind of the grandmother's attic. These customers throw everything into it and then they can't find it. And they don't know what's up there and they don't know how to get it out. And it's a joke. It becomes their ""Internet"" and employees are stippled . But when get in these dynamic environments of these enterprise social networks, they have found a great new model of doing business. And the power of that, Laura, is that there are some great ones out there, but none of them is as good as Chatter because we're integrated with the data. So those transactions happen around your business. Content gets refreshed or sales transactions are closed, orders changed. The social network is updating you on the transactions and the fundamental things on the business that you're following, if you're following customer service inquiries, accounts, contacts, opportunities, building materials, marketing competitive analysis, groups, collaborations. As those things change, damn, you're getting that update. That's very powerful. And Lotus Notes and SharePoint just don't do it. So you're going to see even more exciting things in Dreamforce.

And now that we've been doing that, we think, ""Gee, how do we get all these languages running on top of our database?"" ""How do we get all of these mobile devices running on top of our database?"" And as you see as had the Dreamforce, you're going to see these visions that we've been talking about this year start to come to manifestation because we think the next generation of platform of service is exactly that. It's the VMforce model, this highly-productive commodity language with very robust cloud-based services from Salesforce that we're the only ones who are really doing that in the world with this transaction and transaction levels. And we think we're going to try to hyperdrive our Force.com environment and VMforce and Dreamforce. So you can see some of it at Cloud Stock on December 6 and then you're going to really see it in our keynote on December 7 and December 8. We're going to do an extensive review of how we're going to supercharge that platform as a service because we really think the time is really right for that."

And I'll tell you that in accounts like that, in accounts and others where we have not been the CRM standard that it really opens the door for us to become that. Because it's really opening the door to a lot of great new businesses for us. Because don't forget, Brent, the key to Chatter is that deeply integrated. As you know, with our sales and service clouds and our Force.com system. So the power of Chatter that once it gets in there, then we can say, ""Well you can turn this on."" ""You can turn that on."" ""You can turn on opportunities."" ""You can turn on content."" ""You can turn on context."" ""You can turn on cases."" ""You can turn on knowledge management."" You can turn on all these things and you can turn on the analytics and dashboards and as you turn these things on, your fees become more valuable to you. And this is our strategy, Brent, which is to make those fees indispensable. Now I'm using the new version of Chatter that will get announced with Dreamforce. And I can tell you that I can't separate myself from it. It's so powerful. I have it on my Blackberry, I have it on my iPad, my iPhone, I have it on my -- we've released a desktop app for it now that runs on PC and Macintosh that's built in Adobe Flash and Air, and we have a native Android product under development. And the robustness of the feed. It's not just that the feed is full of human communication that one person talking to other, which was kind of the first generation like we have in Facebook. But just as Facebook has shown when they added the photos sharing app, that if you can get more and more data, and for us, it's all about business transactions and workflow that we can really transform a business and give them more transparency and more help COs like Michael Dell, I mentioned become more in line with the organization. And this is our goal. And he obviously had a great quarter today, and I don't know if Salesforce Chatter had something to do with that. But our goal is to make our customers successful, keep them focused, motivated, help them keep their employees in communicating, and there's no better tool to do that than Salesforce Chatter."

Here's the highlights from the third quarter. First, the Giants won the World Series, amazing. In other news, Salesforce.com revenue for the third quarter rose to $429 million, an increase of roughly 30% from a year ago. This was our best growth performance in seven quarters and our annual revenue run rate is now more than $1.7 billion. 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.32 rose from $0.28 a year ago. We've seen our EPS guidance even as we increased our investment in areas that are key for future growth. Third quarter operating cash flow was approximately $74 million, an increase of more than 100% from a year ago. Year-to-date, we've generated almost $300 million in operating cash flow, that was up 60% from the same period last year. Our cash generation continues to be outstanding.
And finally, while we have our important fourth quarter ahead of us, as we close out fiscal year '11, I'm thrilled to announce the preliminary revenue estimate for fiscal year '12 of $1.97 billion to $2.0 billion. The high end of that range would make Salesforce.com the first cloud computing company ever to achieve $2 billion in annual revenue and puts us in an elite group of software companies to break through the $2 billion revenue threshold. As evidence of our incredible growth, after taking a decade to record our first billion-dollar year in fiscal year 2009, we now expect to double in size to $2 billion in just three years later in fiscal year '12.
Customer momentum continues to be strong. During the third quarter, we added approximately 4,800 net new customers taking our global customer community to more than 87,200 with more than 19,000 net new customers over the past year. We've grown our customer base by more than 28%. The market opportunity for cloud computing is enormous and growing. And the shift to Cloud 2, the next-generation of cloud computing that is social, mobile and real-time is undeniable. And now, we'd like to walk you through the performance of each of our five product lines or as we call them, the five clouds. Now as many of you know, we've made Chatter generally available to all of our customers in June. And today, less than five months since its debut, we now report that over 60,000, that's 60,000 of our more than 87,000 paying customers have now deployed Salesforce Chatter. That means that it is the largest enterprise social network in place today and it means that we've more than tripled the number of deployments since we've first reported on Chatter adoption only one quarter ago. We've just never seen companies adopt any technology this widely, this vast, and we think we're just getting going.
New Chatter deployments in the third quarter included Amazon.com, Bausch & Lomb, Bank of America, Deloitte, Harris, Kelly Services, Motorola, Nikon, Siemens and Vodafone, and customers tell us Chatter has made them more productive. In a survey we commissioned, customers reported that Chatter has directly resulted in a 10% boost in productivity and cut e-mail traffic by 13% on average. And as companies see how Chatter improves communication and collaboration, many are expanding their deployments in the new departments and functions across their enterprises. And as we have noted, Chatter represents a huge opportunity for Salesforce to expand outside of its current subscriber base and into new departments. This quarter, customers including Nokia, Panasonic, Sony have all purchased additional Salesforce subscription for Chatter. And I'm pleased to announce that Dell has now made Chatter available to more than 90,000 employees around the world, making it the largest customer of Salesforce Chatter. That is amazing. 
Over 90,000 employees now are live at Dell on Salesforce Chatter. And Chatter is also helping Salesforce.com reach entirely new customers. Companies that were previously not Salesforce customers, including Yahoo! FOX subscriptions use Chatter as a stand-alone collaboration platform and customers using Chatter tell us they're thrilled with the productivity gains and the open communication it brings to their organizations. It's safe to say that Chatter has become a major differentiator for our sales and service obligations and our Force.com platform, it only makes us stickier, improving retention, improving adoption and it helps us expand our presence with existing customers and win deals against our competitors. And that's why we believe Chatter is the next killer app from Salesforce.com. 
Nothing speaks more than the shifts in our industry than when in a large industry-leading company replaces its legacy software in favor of the cloud. In this quarter, I'm delighted to announce the storage leader, NetApp unplugged their failed Oracle deployment and became a customer of our Sales Cloud, Service Cloud and Force.com platforms. The NetApp win highlighted an outstanding quarter for flagship Sales Cloud, which delivered its biggest third quarter of new business ever.
During the quarter, we added new Sales Cloud business or expanded existing deployments at a long list of customers including FedEx, Ryder, Fujifilm Medical, Level 3 Communications, Ingram, Groupon, British Columbia Lottery and Vodafone. And because every business, regardless of size or industry wants to optimize sales and improve customer relationships, we believe the growth opportunity for the Sales Cloud remains large.
And our Sales Cloud customers are now enjoying the benefits of more accurate contact information with the Data Cloud. Based on the acquisition of Jigsaw, integration of Jigsaw is progressing well and new deals this quarter included Sharp, Amazon, Caplin and AREVA. For our customers, better data means greater productivity, higher sales and higher levels of customer satisfaction. For Salesforce.com, the Data Cloud provides greater differentiation for our core sales and service clouds, lower attrition and a huge opportunity as we look to cross sell to our large global community of roughly 87,000 customers. We welcome them all at Salesforce.com's new Jigsaw product line.
And while we expect Jigsaw to become a future driver of growth, the Service Cloud is already delivering this significant growth today by fully integrating our Sales and Service Clouds solutions, companies now have access to single integrated view of their customers. And with Chatter, they're able to resolve customer issues faster and more effectively than ever before. These benefits help power another huge business quarter for the Service Cloud, which once again, was our fastest growing business in the third quarter. Major wins or deployment expansions of the Service Cloud included Univision, RSA, Merrill Lynch, Mosaic, Paychex and the U.S. Government Department of Commerce. Strong cross selling into our installed base along with sales to new customers has helped us to grow our total Service Cloud community to now approximately 13,000 customers globally. But the total customer community of more than 87,000 were just scratching the surface of what's possible with Salesforce.com's Service Cloud. 
Custom application development on our Force.com platform continues to be another massive opportunity for Salesforce.com. Honestly, we think application development deployment remains our largest and most exciting opportunity that we continue to execute through Salesforce.com platforms.
This quarter, we've closed a deal with the New York City Department of Education for the 100,000 Force.com licenses, that's 100,000 Force.com licenses at the New York City Department of Education. Together with Salesforce.com partner, Acumen Solutions, the New York Education Department plans to build eight apps that teachers and administrators will use to track and boost student performance. 
Additional Force.com wins include Think Tech, NIPPON KAIGI KYOKAI, Larson Software and FAST RETAILING and we also continue to see terrific adoption of the platform by partners and developers. Our developer community has grown to more than 310,000, up more than 100,000 in the last year alone.
This growing community of developers is putting the Force.com platform to good use, creating nearly 25 million customizations, an increase of 38% year-over-year, more than 960,000 custom database tables, up nearly 50% year-over-year more than 185,000 custom apps, an increase of more than 50,000 year-over-year. And just last week, we celebrated another platform milestone, 1,000 apps on our AppExchange. The traction, the excitement, the movement around Force.com gives us a lot of faith and a lot of confidence in the power of platform of the service to come in the dominant way that application developers build applications in the future, and we're making more investments in that area. Of course, products are only great if people use them, and that's why usage is such an important indicator of customer success. And while trust, security, performance, reliability and availability are top priorities, our focus on building cloud service that customers love and use every day and adopt continues to yield some amazing results.
During the third quarter, the Force.com platform delivered roughly 25 billion transactions, that's 25 billion, an increase of more than 50% from a year ago. That's amazing traction of a product and usage and capability, a 50% increase to 25 billion transactions. That's more than 3,000 transactions every second of every day during the quarter, and we delivered these transactions with four nines availability and with an average transaction speed of less than 300 milliseconds. Amazing. And all of these performance is transparent. You can see it today in real-time at trust.salesforce.com. I encourage you all to visit that site. It's the site that has given our customers the transparency that has resulted in the trust they have with Salesforce.com. 
With 87,200 customers globally, and a vital app in Chatter that can take us enterprise wide, we're creating a great foundation for the future of our platform business together with a surging community of developers and ISVs, the long-term growth opportunity for the platform has never been brighter.
In my opinion, there's never been a better time to be in the cloud computing industry. According to IDC, the cloud market is expected to grow by a CAGR of 25% through 2014 to roughly $40 billion. And with our industry-leading lineup of cloud services and our five clouds and our strong financial performance, the time to invest for growth and market leadership is absolutely now. And that's exactly what we're doing. First, people are our biggest growth driver. Particularly, in sales and engineering and in Q3, we accelerated hiring by adding more than 300 net new employees, and we continue to grow our workforce globally. 
Second, we're continuing to build out our data centers to expand support or accelerating transaction growth in international expansion plans. And as indicated in our last call, we expect to have two additional data centers operational in the United States by the end of this year and then next year, we will be live with our new production data center in Tokyo, Japan.
Third, we continue to see the international market as large and mostly untapped growth opportunity. Rather than spreading our resources too broadly, we're focusing our efforts on the top software markets of the world. We believe very strongly in this focus strategy of the top software markets. And we believe scale and focus will allow us to accelerate our growth in these important markets. That focus is why we acquired substantially, but we do have good sustainability. 
All of the non-controlling interests owned shares in our Japanese subsidiary during the quarter. And fourth, earlier this month, we have made the decision to buy 14 acres of land here in San Francisco, along with the long-term goal of developing a corporate campus. Having a world-class campus will enable us to better serve our customers, drive employee productivity by keeping our people together and most importantly, we believe it's going to allow us to attract and retain the best employees in the world right here in San Francisco, California.
And we're still in the early planning stages of this project. We're going to announce more exciting details as they shortly become available. And finally, we're evangelizing the cloud business model, so you should expect more global events. Speaking of events, today, we're only 10 business days away, that's only 10 business days away from what has become the largest cloud computing event in the world, Dreamforce 2010. And it's an event like no other. First of all, we've already had more than 20,000 people registered and our internal estimates are that we'll have more than 25,000 in attendance at Dreamforce. That will be spectacular and it will have the biggest selection of cloud computing products under one roof with more than 250 cloud vendors in the expo, the largest gathering of cloud experts, leading more than 700 sessions. It's going to be the place to learn about the cloud, to experience the cloud and to meet the customers and partners that are putting it into place and creating the cloud computing industry.
On December 6, we have Cloud Stock, which is our first worldwide developer conference that's linked to Dreamforce. And I expect all of you to come and see the power of the platform and the service and its momentum and the growth in our customers at Cloud Stock. Then on December 7, I'll open up the keynote session at 9:00 a.m., where we'll introduce new products and introduce you to customers who are making major deployments with Salesforce.com's Cloud Solutions. And that night on December 7, we'll have Stevie Wonder and Will.i.am, the head of the Black Eyed Peas entertain attendees at a special concert. Then on December 8, we'll have our platform keynote, where we plan to unveil the future of platform as a service. And then at 5:00 p.m., President Bill Clinton will join us for a keynote on stage. That evening, at 7:00 p.m., Colin Powell will open our benefit concert for the UCSF Bennoit Children's Hospital at the Masonic Hall. And then Neal Young will play for all of us. We look forward to seeing all of you in San Francisco for December 6, 7 and 8 to join us and meeting some of these great leaders of our world and of our industry and great entertainers. And we want to thank all of you for your continued support of Salesforce.com.
Now with that, let me turn the call over to Graham for the financial details of our outstanding third quarter."
122917,115505459,88796,"Salesforce.com, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2010",2010-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Salesforce, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marc. Our third quarter results, as you've heard were outstanding across all key financial measures, with our revenue, operating cash flow and attrition results all showing strength. Let me get into the detail.Revenue of $429 million rose 30% ye",1512,"Thanks, Marc. Our third quarter results, as you've heard were outstanding across all key financial measures, with our revenue, operating cash flow and attrition results all showing strength. Let me get into the detail.
Revenue of $429 million rose 30% year-over-year, and year-to-date; our revenue of $1.2 billion is up more than 26%. Subscription and support revenue grew even faster, posting year-over-year growth of more than 31% for the quarter and 27% year-to-date. 
In addition to the strong new business performance that Marc mentioned, three other factors contributed to our revenue result this quarter. First, a continued modest reduction in our attrition rate. Second, a solid pricing environment. And third, a weakening dollar. Let me briefly touch on each of these factors.
First, our dollar attrition, when compared to the year ago quarter, is now back in the mid-teens percentage range. In fact, the dollars we lost through attrition in Q3 were less in absolute terms than in the same quarter a year ago. Q3 marked the fifth quarter in a row in which attrition has declined slightly. This trend is encouraging as clearly been supported by an improving economic environment. Having said that, we've been reluctant to anticipate improvements until they happen, as a lot of different factors can affect the rate. As you're all aware, the fourth quarter is by far our largest renewals quarter. So we'll obviously provide an update for you in February. 
Mitigating attrition is important to our long-term growth when we continue to focus on customer life cycle and how we can best help our customers realize maximum value for the implementation of Salesforce. And we believe this focus will have a beneficial long-term impact on retention.
Turning to pricing. When we compare the net price proceed for the professional enterprise unlimited and unlimited service additions over the past eight quarters, we continue to see very little change. We believe that our investments in new technologies, like Chatter and Jigsaw, that helps us maintain our compelling value proposition. 
And then finally, the weakening of the dollar over the past three months helped make an already strong quarter even stronger. $7 million of our sequential quarterly revenue increase was a result of changing FX rates. Conversely, our year-over-year revenue was actually reduced by $4 million due to a small currency headwind. Third quarter revenue growth from a year ago in constant currency was 31%.
In terms of the performance by region, in the Americas, revenue rose by 26% to approximately $293 million. In Europe, revenue are just over $76 million, was up 26% in dollars and up 38% in constant currency. And in Asia, revenue of $60 million rose 62% in dollars and 53% in constant currency.
In total, our International business rose by 40% in dollars and 44% in constant currency. International revenue now represents 32% of total revenue. As Marc indicated, our international growth strategy is to focus our resources in the top markets in the world, the top software markets in the world and dominate in those markets. We continue to see very strong growth in Service Cloud and approximately 1/3 of our new business came from non-SFA products. 
Turning to the income statement. Our third quarter non-GAAP gross margin of 82% was up slightly versus both last quarter and Q3 last year.
As in past quarters, the improvement in gross margin is primarily the result of a changing mix in our revenue line items. Our subscription and support revenue is growing much faster than our low margin professional services revenue as we continue to expand our ecosystem of consulting partners. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses was 67% of revenue for the third quarter, up slightly from 66% a year ago and essentially flat sequentially. R&D expense was 10% of revenue and sales and marketing expense was 44%. They're both up slightly from the year ago quarter, primarily as a result of our aggressive hiring in both those groups. G&A remained essentially unchanged at 13% of revenue from the year ago quarter.
The biggest driver of expense growth in Q3 was accelerated hiring. During the quarter, we added just over 300 people to finish the quarter with approximately 4,750 employees. This represents an increase of almost 950 employees or 25% from a year ago, and that of course, includes the 150 people we added through the acquisition of Jigsaw. Given the importance of growing our distribution capacity and product development organization, we expect to hire more people in Q4 than we did in Q3.
Non-GAAP operating margin of 15.4% was down slightly from last year due to the acquisition of Jigsaw. Our new business performance has been particularly strong through the first three quarters of the year. As a result, many of our sales commission, bonus and partner referral fee plans are trending well above 100% pay outs. Although we do capitalized and amortized most of our direct sales commissions, it's important to remember that the great majority of our total sales costs are expensed as incurred. As I mentioned a moment ago, we've also hired aggressively to continue our strong growth trajectory.
Our fourth quarter performance will affect our revenue exit rate at the end of the year. And hence, we'll inform our hiring and investment decisions for fiscal 2012. We continue to believe the best way to create long-term shareholder value is to extend our leadership and dominate our markets through aggressively growing our business. 
Moving on to cash flow. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was approximately $74 million. That's an increase of roughly 108% from a year ago. Year-to-date, we've generated more than $293 million in operating cash flow, that's an increase of more than 64% from a year ago. Capital spending for the quarter was $21 million. The primary drivers of CapEx are the build out of the two U.S. data centers that Marc mentioned and leasehold improvements generally to support our growing employee population.
Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures was also strong at $53 million, that's an increase of roughly 112% from last year. Over the last four quarters, we've generated $317 million in free cash flow. Given our ratable revenue model and the fact that roughly 2/3 of invoiced dollars are for 12-month durations, we believe the cash flow is an important measure of our operating performance. 
Looking to Q4, we expect our cash flow growth rate to be a few points slower than our revenue growth rate as we pay Dreamforce related expenses, fourth quarter ramp commissions and continue to hire aggressively. Cash and cash equivalents overall, including marketable securities, finished the quarter at approximately $1.8 billion. Deferred revenue rose by approximately 27%, year-over-year to finish the quarter at $695 million. We had a small headwind on deferred revenue of approximately $2 million on a year-over-year comparison basis. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of improving deferred revenue growth, reflecting strong new business, reduced attrition and continued stability and invoicing durations.
On a sequential basis, deferred revenue rose by approximately 11 million in dollar terms, but was flat in constant currency terms. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect deferred revenue to grow at just a slightly slower rate year-over-year than in Q3. 
Let me close with our outlook. As we enter Q4, demand for our products continues to be strong. I've already mentioned Dreamforce, ramp commission and bonus plans and aggressive hiring are some of the reasons why operating income in the fourth quarter will be slightly lower than in Q3. With that context, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of approximately $447 million to $449 million and project non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of approximately $0.27 to $0.28. All of the underlying assumptions for this non-GAAP guidance, as well as our GAAP guidance on a complete GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation can be found in our earnings press release. Looking forward to fiscal 2012, as Marc indicated, we currently anticipate revenue to be in the range of $1.97 billion to $2 billion. It's important to note that we'll be adopting the new revenue recognition standard, EITF 08-01, which we estimate will increase next year's revenue by approximately $20 million. This extra amount is included in our guidance range.
Clearly, growth is still our number one priority and so you should expect us to continue ramping our investments in distribution capacity, data centers and product development to achieve our aggressive goals. 
Before I close, I'd like to remind everyone that the key date at Dreamforce for analysts is Tuesday, December 7. In addition to Marc's opening keynote, analysts are invited to a VIP luncheon and CEO Q&A session and then later that afternoon, David and I will be hosting another session to review our business model and some of the key metrics that drive our business. If you haven't already done so, you can register on our website or contact Investor Relations directly. With that, let me thank you all for joining us today. And I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?"

We believe that will give us strategic strength. I can tell you that I was just there and our relationships with the most important companies in Japan have really never been stronger. Everyone is very excited that we're building a data center jointly with NTT. We've been advertising that in the Nikkei and been getting some great response.

We're working on a free version of Chatter that will be in kind of a virally based product, and we'll introduce that to our customers at Dreamforce. Some of our customers already have that product and that's very exciting for us. We've been testing and kind of making Chatter more viral by giving our customers the ability to send viral invites. One of the things for us is that our customers need to assign their e-mail domain to the service and then the admin needs to turn on this kind of viral invite capability, but that's very exciting for us. And so this will be a new kind of exactly what you said, stripped-down version of Chatter, but it will operate within our existing customer networks. So if you're a customer, you'll be able to e-mail and send viral invites to other customers. And this, I think, will be just a tremendous accelerator for Chatter, and we plan to turn that on for all customers shortly. And two, we will have a kind of three independent service that's kind of a viral service that we'll mostly use as lead gen and for getting customers to up sell called Chatter.com, and we're planning to launch that in the first quarter and that will be very exciting for us and for all of our customers. And as we start to work on that Chatter.com concept that will have a lot of the kind of look and flavor that you can see of the traditional enterprise, social networking sites. We're already a lot bigger than them, as you know. But the big differentiator we have, of course, remains is data integration. So that will be extremely exciting for us."

And the fundamental expansion deals that we're getting for Chatter against the huge revenue numbers of the Sales Cloud and Service Cloud and Custom Cloud just are basically very small against that. So the power for Chatter remains number one, it's driving tremendous adoption, it's making us much stickier. It's making us much more efficient inside of our customers. And because of that, we think it's strategic for us. It's not just a tactical product. It's strategic and that it really is kind of the next wave of computing and that we've talked about the mobility and the social aspects and the real-time aspects of computing the Chatter offers. But it's strategic for us because of how it impacts our customers’ usage of our product just goes way up. And also it drives some of their other products down like e-mail. So that's why we're investing in Chatter. You've seen us talk about the $15 Chatter product, which is kind of this enterprise expansion product that we've been using to kind of do these Chatter-only deals. I just mentioned we'll work on a Chatter free product, which will be stripped down even farther from there, which will be virally oriented and then we'll have Chatter.com, which will be this kind of free service. And the fundamental reason is that we really think that we found something that customers want and that makes us stronger in our existing customers. Just look at Dell. So with Dell, we of course, had our third year or fourth year 50,000 users or whatever it was in Dell than all the sales and marketing users. But Michael Dell really got excited and in the Chatter and was using it himself. And then said, ""Let's roll this thing out,"" and really within a couple weeks, we were able to turn on now almost 100,000 users of Chatter inside Dell, and they've eliminated all the other enterprise social networking products that they were using inside Dell at the same time. They'll all be direct now to Chatter, and we're building a very large enterprise social network. The power of that really came from there were several situations where they just got tremendous business value from the service, and we see that happening with a lot of our customers. It's going to continue to take a lot of evangelism. It's going to continue to take a lot of education. This is a relatively new product. It's only been live for a couple of quarters. And you're going to see a lot of exciting new features of Chatter when we get to Dreamforce. You're going to see things happening in the feed that you've just never seen happen in a feed with any other product before. It's pretty incredible."

And while we really didn't hire any sales people of consequence in fiscal year '10 because we're so worried about kind of the general state of the world, in fiscal year '11, we've had a lot of confidence and we've really ramped up in anticipation of fiscal year '12, which is why we feel good about giving you this guidance of $1.97 billion to $2 billion. As you know, Kash, that will make Salesforce.com the first enterprise cloud computing company to deliver $2 billion in revenue, which is our dream, our goal, our vision for fiscal year '12.

And since then, we of course, have put in a number of things that we call measures for customer for life, increased our processes and controls around that. But the number one thing that has happened that has reduced the attrition is the economy is not going off the cliff. So because of that, we feel that our attrition has been dropping and it's been dropping very consistently since fiscal year '10 completed. And now we're in fiscal year '11 in the third quarter, so we feel the number one driver around attrition has been the economy. Now yes we're definitely finding some great tools, contractual tools, technology tools and even human processes to help reduce attrition. And having customers rely to the critical part of our business, we're all about adoption and customer success, nothing is more important than the trusted customer success of every single one of our customers in Salesforce.com.

And I appreciate the question because I do think this is probably one of the most exciting things I've really ever been associated with. And of course, you look at products like Lotus Notes, and we talked about it before. It's a product that was conceived up before Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook was. And the reality is that it's not a humorous joke. These customers have been running this technology for two or three decades, and they're hiring these people out of school and they're coming in to these ""productivity applications"" that they have in their customers and these customers in there saying,""I don't know how to use this. This is not how I work."" ""Where's my iPad?"" ""Where's my iPhone?"" ""Where's my Blackberry?"" ""Where's my graphical user interfaces?"" And they're like well this is graphical user [indiscernible].  This is Windows. And it's just junk. And that was Lotus Notes is honestly. It was a great product, at the time but IBM has done a terrible job in terms of keeping it fresh. Just look at the terrible job IBM has done with their fundamentally their software strategy? They've had to move to an acquisition strategy because they let this kind of core franchises erode. They turn them into cash cows and now they're getting trampled by these next-generation products. And I think SharePoint is very much the same thing. It's kind of the grandmother's attic. These customers throw everything into it and then they can't find it. And they don't know what's up there and they don't know how to get it out. And it's a joke. It becomes their ""Internet"" and employees are stippled. But when get in these dynamic environments of these enterprise social networks, they have found a great new model of doing business. And the power of that, Laura, is that there are some great ones out there, but none of them is as good as Chatter because we're integrated with the data. So those transactions happen around your business. Content gets refreshed or sales transactions are closed, orders changed. The social network is updating you on the transactions and the fundamental things on the business that you're following, if you're following customer service inquiries, accounts, contacts, opportunities, building materials, marketing competitive analysis, groups, collaborations. As those things change, damn, you're getting that update. That's very powerful. And Lotus Notes and SharePoint just don't do it. So you're going to see even more exciting things than that in Dreamforce. So I'll see you there."

And I mentioned, that was between four and five nines of reliability and 300 milliseconds, and we've done incredible things in the database. And the release of Apex with stern procedures and triggers in making the database so useful. Now the database has been very tightly integrated, as you know, with our user interface environment or what we call Force.com or Visualforce. And the breakthrough we have is that database is so powerful. What if we have to uncouple it and that was really the breakthrough where we said now we can have the VMforce. Because now that we've uncoupled the database, let's put job on top of the VMforce so that customers who don't want to use RUI [Remote User Interface] environment, which is excellent, but they want to use Java, which is also excellent, that they have freedom of choice. And that's what VMforce is. To let customers build in a Java IDE like Spring from VMware and run that Java code right on our database. And now that we've been doing that, we think, ""Gee, how do we get all these languages running on top of our database?"" ""How do we get all of these mobile devices running on top of our database?"" And as you see is at the Dreamforce, you're going to see these visions that we've been talking about this year start to come to manifestation because we think the next generation of platform of service is exactly that. It's the VMforce model, this highly-productive commodity language with very robust cloud-based services from Salesforce that we're the only ones who are really doing that in the world with this transaction and transaction levels. And we think we're going to try to hyper drive our Force.com environment and VMforce and Dreamforce. So you can see some of it at Cloud Stock on December 6 and then you're going to really see it in our keynote on December 7 and December 8.

But just as Facebook has shown when they added the photos sharing app, that if you can get more and more data, and for us, it's all about business transactions and workflow that we can really transform a business and give them more transparency and more help COs like Michael Dell, I mentioned become more in line with the organization. And this is our goal. And he obviously had a great quarter today, and I don't know if Salesforce Chatter had something to do with that.
