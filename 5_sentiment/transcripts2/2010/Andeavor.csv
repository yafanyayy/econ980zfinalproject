Well, good morning, everyone and welcome to today's conference call to discuss our fourth quarter 2009 results. While management will not be referencing slides, we did filed a presentation deck earlier with the SEC and encourage you to have this available as we progress through this morning's call. These slides along with other financial results, including the press release and our supplemental quarterly data can be found on our website at tsocorp.com. After reviewing this information, please feel free to contact me with any questions about this material or otherwise following today's call. Please refer to the forward-looking statements in the earnings guide, which says statements made during this call that refer to management's expectations and/or future projections are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Act as there are many factors, which could cause results to differ from our expectations. Before Bruce's comments, I'd like to offer guidance for the first quarter of 2010. Looking at the throughput by region, in the Pacific Northwest, 115,000 to 125,000 barrels per day; in the Mid-Pacific, 60,000 to 70,000 barrels per day; in the Mid-Continent region, 90,000 to 100,000 barrels a day; and in the California region, 195,000 to 205,000 barrels a day which is roughly 30,000 barrels a day lower than our fourth quarter actuals due to maintenance at Golden Eagle on the cat cracker. OpEx guidance for the first quarter is as follows. In the Pacific Northwest, $4.85 per barrel; in the Mid-Pacific, $3.15 per barrel; in Mid-Continent region, $4.10 per barrel; and in California roughly $9 per barrel. Our depreciation for refining is estimated at $90 million. Additional first quarter guidance items include corporate expense of $45 million and interest expense before interest income of $38 million. I'll now turn the call over to Bruce."

We appreciate you starting the day with our management team. Obviously, we're here to answer questions about the results for the fourth quarter, answer questions about the year, and obviously, talk about the release that we sent out yesterday. But before we do the Q&A portion of our call, I want to make a few general comments both about the quarter and also about how we see the current market environment.I'm going to begin with a quick summary of some financial and some operational results. Scott said last night, we reported fourth quarter, we lost $179 million or $1.30 a share. Those results include a $43 million charge for the impairment of the goodwill associated with our purchase of the Anacortes refinery in 1998. So you if you exclude this non-cash, non-taxable item, we reported a $0.99 per share loss which is generally in line with the consensus expectation.While we're very, very disappointed about the results in the losses in the fourth quarter, we're not going to attempt today to put a positive spin on it. But the simple fact that the consensus was a negative says that the results weren't a surprise to you. Let me give you just a few facts. The West Coast benchmark margins averaged about $8 a barrel in the fourth quarter, or roughly half of what we saw in each of the first three quarters of the year. We can speculate about the reasons but they would certainly include seasonally lower demand and higher winter grade gasoline inventories. In this weak environment, we reported a refining operating loss of $213 million. The marketing segment, however, continues to perform well. In the fourth quarter, operating income across all product channels was $100 million. Of that amount, retail contributed $41 million and for the full year, retail made $83 million. In the face of weak demand, our marketing team has demonstrated an ability to move products into higher, net back channels of trade, an ability that we believe is a core strength to the company. We also believe that marketing's role will continue to be an important in a market where supply exceeds demand.In California, we've seen an oversupply of market condition for more than the past two years and as a consequence, cash stewardship has been a primary objective. Therefore, we were pleased that cash increased by $177 million and that's excluding the $216 million net change in debt, as we ended the year with $413 million of cash. We were able to accomplish this as a result of many successful programs. These programs include excellent capital management, expense reductions, exceeding the target for our non-capital improvement initiatives and managing our inventory down to lower demand levels.It's certainly a commitment to these basic tactics that we now consider everyday best practices for Tesoro. And they're going to continue to guide us in the future just as they have since the late 2007.Operationally, our plans ran at an average of 530,000 barrels per day, which is about 35,000 barrels per day lower than the third quarter throughput. Lower fourth quarter throughput isn't unusual because in Alaska, Salt Lake City and Anacortes, we normally reduce runs in the winter to match lower product demand. Another difference in the statistics that may catch your eye is the fact that our manufacturing expenses increased by approximately $10 million from the third quarter, which was primarily due to higher purchased energy cost. The only other really interesting operational fact is that we did accelerate the planned work on the cat cracker at Golden Eagle. This was originally scheduled for the first quarter of 2010, but with the miserable fourth quarter margin environment we decided to advance that work. As a result of this outage, and the Los Angeles corporate downtime, our production of lower valued product such as fuel oil increased roughly 6% compared to the third quarter. The operational monitor for these times is to be highly flexible and committed to making any adjustment to the operating plan that will better align it with market changes, the ones that are occurring everyday today. This is pretty easy in practice but obviously, it's much more difficult.We have a hard time predicting demand in a normal market, and when you look at the volatility that we've seen both in commodity prices and margins, predicting the future has become much more difficult. But to give you an idea on some of the flexibility that we've had in how this plays for us, last quarter, we said in our conference call that we didn't expect inventory levels to decline after the 4.4 million barrel draw of inventory that we had in the third quarter.But as we saw benchmark margins begin to decline, we adjusted our current purchases and we moved up the planned work on the Golden Eagle SEC unit, which ultimately cost us to reduce inventory by another 1.9 million barrels. Another example of being flexible was the success we had in capturing non-capital improvements or what we call our optimization program. As our release noted, we achieved a total of $370 million from these initiatives in 2009. And we'd earmarked more than $150 million of additional improvements for 2010.One final comment. Everyone in the industry is actively managing cash, cost and expenses and we're certainly not an exception to the rule. However, the most significant cash item that we've modified for the past several years has been the size of our capital expenditure program. Our entire team continues to scrutinize the scope and timing of our capital program. At our November analyst meeting, we estimated that our capital spending for the first quarter of 2010, would be in the neighborhood of $250 million and that the full year would be around $675 million. As I said a minute ago, our team continues to actively review all our alternatives and in today's earnings release, we said that in the first quarter we expect to spend over $100 million less than the previous estimate, which reduces our 2010 planned expenditures to about $600 million.Just a few other comments about 2010. There are many reasons to believe that we will continue to see margins similar to those in 2009 unless we have a substantial change in the current supply or demand picture. Accordingly, in this environment, we are focused on creating self-help through the practices and programs which I mentioned earlier.One self-help program is the three-year $300 million program that we referred to as our quick hit capital program. You may recall that this program is one that contains projects that are smaller in size, they're shorter in implementation time, and that they have very high returns. So I want to spend a minute explaining why we plan to proceed with this. In the past year, many of our investors and more than a few analysts have wanted to understand how we can make a difference and have expressed their concern that refining companies, including Tesoro, are bearish about the outlook for the industry. We'd like to say that the market's going to change quickly and certainly it might. But in order for margins to recover to the 2005 and 2007 levels, we would need a significant change in the supply-and-demand balance as I said a little earlier.On the positive side, the rationalization of supplies began, albeit at a slow pace and we believe that that's going to continue. New capacity is going to be slow in arriving. Demand will grow in certain markets, but the key certainly it's for us in the United States is going to be domestic growth and that depends on employment. But simply put, we expect the year to be very challenging.There are some positive signals and we all know how quickly the market can move if more production process. But to be conservative, we're planning for a margin environment that will fluctuate but remain relatively close to 2009 levels. Given that assumption, we believe it is important to execute the capital and non-capital self-help initiatives we have outlined, which are aimed at improving margin capture and at decreasing costs. As we stated in our Analyst Day presentation, improving our competitive position is important to our corporate strategy. To grow shareholder value in a flat margin environment, it is important to have both expense and non-capital initiatives, but everybody is doing that. Therefore, our plan is to create growth by investing in the quick hit program and with these investments in the first year, we project that it can be self-funding in the next year. And then ultimately, the program generates excess cash in 2013, the benefit of which can flow to our shareholders.Historically, January's margins are among the lowest that we see in the year. The first quarter started off where the fourth quarter ended, with an excess of clean product inventories and seasonally reduced demand. However, in past years, benchmark margins have also tended to improve in February and then they've continued to improve in March. The industry is making adjustments and we will continue to look at our operations. Nobody can predict what's going to happen to margins, however, we will say two things about the future. We're going to continue to manage the business by being flexible and tailing our operations to meet market changes. And secondly, we expect to deliver on the capital and non-capital initiatives that we've discussed. And with that, Christian, we're going to open it up so the management team can take questions."

Certainly, that started in January 1 of this year and I think, everyone that were aware of is blending to the 10% number in California. So on an energy adjusted basis, what you're looking at is an addition to the supply of about 28,000 barrels a day of gasoline. Whether we've seen that effect in the marketplace is a little hard to tell right now, you mentioned a lot of other things that are affecting the market. There are turnarounds going on. Seasonally, January is about 5% lower in demand anyway than December. And you also mentioned the rains that had to be a factor. Looking at the rain situation, I tried to gather some data from the last time they had heavy rains but that was in 2006. And that averaged only about 8 inches over a three to four-day period. This last go around in January is 20 inches. So we really don't have anything to fall back on. The last time we had heavy rains, as I mentioned, there really was no demand effect because it was pretty short-lived. It looks like it just temporarily caused people to stop driving. But I think this time, it was probably more pronounced with the flooding that we saw in both the major population centers of San Francisco and L.A. So I think there is an effect going on with that right now. As I say, what the effect will be of the additional ethanol addition, we don't know at this point in time. Probably, we'll not know until summertime when refineries are up and running at their maximum capacity. I think the other question you asked was on the specification changes going from winter grade to summer grade. February 15 in Southern California, L.A. and northern California is a month delayed at March 15. Did I cover most of your issues, Paul?"

Originally, we had planned to do a major turnaround in our Golden Eagle refinery. And ultimately, we elected to take a modified scope of work on that where we could take the cat record down in November or really, 1st of December of last year at Golden Eagle, and we're completing some regulatory work on there. But we're deferring a significant portion of the turnaround work to 2011, so that's a substantial portion of that change. We've also been able to re-optimize our overall program around some of the regulatory capital needs based on credits that we had already generated for benzene and gasoline. And around Knox credits we generated or Knox credits we've been able to acquire that have allowed us to reduce the scope of work or defer some of the capital spend. But overall, if you look back starting at the end of 2007, we've reduced about $1.3 billion of total capital out of the program that we had at that time. A fair piece of that, original piece of that around $500 million of that was income improvement capital. But we have put back into that $300 million of that for this quick hit program. And of that in 2010, we're still planning on approximately $70 million of quick hit income spend in our $600 million program for 2010. Our philosophy has been really about trying to scrub our work to optimize on the regulatory spend, get the most efficient spend that we can, find new and innovative ways of complying with revelatory needs. But always it's about safe, compliant and reliable operation. So this whole program still complies with all of that, but it has enabled us in some cases to defer some turnaround activity to fit with the inspection results that we have. So it's based on good, sound engineering and inspection information but it's been a good program overall. We've got a great team that's threw a lot of energy and effort into how do we optimize that program over multiple years without building a big capital requirement out there in the future years. So as we look forward to 2010 to 12, we think that we've got a good program, but it's not substantially increasing."

And I think that the Board's very comfortable with what we're doing and a lot of it is just better management all the way around of scope and timing. But I think that the quick hit program, to put it in a perspective, if you want to look at the bad margin environment that we've got even when you take, and which reduces EBITDA, obviously for the entire industry, this program becomes even more meaningful, added with a smaller EBITDA. So it's much more significant for our shareholders, and we believe that over the course of time here, that we've got to do everything we can to be able to augment our income in a little margin environment, which we believe will be substantial. And then if margin pick up, obviously, we'll take the benefit that goes across to the entire market. So that's a little perspective on our capital."

When you look at the first quarter and what's happened with the growth and inventories, we know that I don't know whether it's public knowledge, there are several other refineries on the West Coast that are going to turn around and they're going to be down. And the traditional philosophy is that you build inventories in advance of the turnaround because you're not going to be producing product. So why do that is market, I don't know. But there are people that are still thinking traditionally, and maybe there are larger companies that are thinking traditionally. And potentially, you could attribute some of the growth in inventories to the simple fact that people may be still subscribing to an older philosophy rather than being able to just purchase their product in the marketplace. So we think that there are many things that have happen in the first quarter, but our view is that we're willing to tolerate the risk of having just to run, to recirculate the refinery if we have to."

Everybody's view is that gee, somebody else will blink first. I think that you're absolutely right. It's sort of difficult to make what's a pretty significant decision relative to temporary idling or temporarily shutting down or permanently shutting down of facility. We're pretty active in looking at auto facilities and obviously, there are some that are still in markets that are performing extremely well. And there are some end markets that are not performing well at all. But when you look at it, you sort of have to look forward which is the hard part of the equation, and not get stuck on the fact of exactly where it is today. And look, when we focus on it, we're really focusing on what's going to be the net cash impact, and how much time do you have to make a decision. What the commitments are to the capital programs, and so we have a pretty active review program of looking at the factors and spent time discussing it among ourselves and with the board about what we think strategically, our timing issues relative to the point you raise, which is negative cash. I think that -- I wouldn't predict that we're going to act immediately on any one thing. But I would tell you that we're doing an awful lot of work relative to solving the issue, not just with closures, but looking at other things. And I think that, I know everybody's doing it, we've been so focused on cash that this isn't something that started just because margins got to the low point that we see today. It's been so ongoing that we've got alternatives that we're starting to, we've begun to implement. I don't know where it will take us. But all things are on the table, all the time. I think that it's -- I don't want to speculate on the positive side, but we see changes that are occurring. Politically, there are things happenings. I mean, we're going to spend a lot more time politically with other people in the industry. So I mean, some of the dynamics have to change one way or the other. And I don't know, I can't predict what that's going to be. But for us, we're going to be prudent about what we think we need to do for shareholders to preserve value. And we go back to one thing, right now. We still think that the right thing to do is try to figure out how to continue to fund this quick hit capital program and if we have to take other actions to do that. I mean, we've sliced our dividend, that's relatively small. But when you look at it net against the $50 million to $70 million that we're going to spend, it's a nice little match. And we think it's a better return for shareholders. We're in a growth mode, and so that's sort of where we are. Everything is on the table. We'll continue to make the best judgments that we can make about the future."

Today we've been able to, through the risk management program that Dan talked about, be able to move things around and where we feel like it was a minimum amount of risk as we did new inspections to be able to move things out. So it's been easier. Reassigning programs to be able to find a more effective way to do it is again, it's sort of like inventory, eventually you run out of those. So your options are to close a refinery, and that saves a bunch of capital. Your options are to stop spending program and take the consequences. But I have no doubt that there are ways that you can cut capital. But it's part of other [ph] decisions. I mean, inventory and everything is only going to take you so far."

And as you said, the miles driven for November were up to 2.1%. So California is looking like it's coming back. Now it's coming up from a very low base. And when you look out to the rest of PAD IV, you still have demand declines occurring in places like Arizona and Utah. So obviously, you can't isolate just California from the overall refining and supply situation in  PAD IV. As far as the reaction of the marketplace, certainly when you've got excess capacity and you're running your refineries in the low 80s, you got to have a big increase in demand, I think. You have to get utilization rates back up to the high 80s to the 90s, I would think, before you'd see an appreciable margin effect. So I'm not surprised that there hasn't really been any appreciable or noticeable margin effect by call it a 2% demand rise."

And I think that the political environment is so active today that we really have introduced that as an element that could potentially be a game changer, and I don't mean this in any other way. But I think just in Massachusetts, America's getting involved in the deficit, America's getting involved in jobs. And my only point about that is that I read an interesting article that came out of the United Steelworkers, talking about the potential for loss of jobs in looking at the imports that were flowing into the United States. It's pretty substantial, what's flowing into the United States, it's not falling into our market necessarily. But it is flowing into the United States. And there's -- the potential is import fees that could occur that would change the dynamics there. The other thing that's happening is that there is, certainly as we look at the budget deficits, and we look at what's happening relative to whether JV 32 [ph], whether it's ethanol. When I think about ethanol, all I see is a huge addition to the budget deficit from the subsidies that exist to product fuel [ph] and gasoline that's creating more supply problems. We're putting a dirtier fuel into the air. And at some point, it seems that, and we're seeing some activity around that.

I mean, the risk program, the risk management program we got today, if you go back and look in time, we inherited, or acquired refineries that all had schedules that were, I don't know how many years. They went out for 10 years, and what we're going to do and they overlaid each other. And as time goes on, what you do is you find it. Like last year is a great example of demand in [ph]. We've got a turnaround schedule last year. We went through it, they were at the point of looking at that. We did some risk inspection work and we determined that we could move that by whole year, which we did. Dan has moved one out this year out  to 2011. I mean, it continues -- obviously, the safety and reliability becomes imperative. But the key gets to be that as you look at it, in the old days you just did the turnarounds because it was the risk-based practice was to do it every three years on a certain unit or four years. I mean, I'm sort of in Dan's area here. But now, it's really changed. So that there is more rigger going into the process of trying to really determine what that is. So to give you a quantitative assessment, it is that dynamic ongoing to try to figure out what how we can safely move capital out. And that would be the same thing we'd be doing if the margin environment were good, because obviously, we'd rather employ capital in other ways. Dan, I don't know.

Well, good morning everyone and welcome to today's conference call to discuss our first quarter 2010 results. Joining me today are all the members of our executive committee, as well as other members of senior management.
While we will not be referencing slides during the call, we did file a deck earlier with the SEC and encourage you to have these available as we progress through this morning's call. These slides along with other financial results, including the press release and supplemental quarterly data can be found on our website at tsocorp.com. After reviewing this information, please feel free to contact me with any questions about this material or otherwise following today's call.
Please refer to the forward-looking statements in the earnings slides, which says that statements made during this call that refer to management expectations and or future predictions are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Act, as there are many factors which could cause results to differ from our expectations.
I will now provide second quarter 2010 guidance for modeling purposes. In these assumptions, we have assumed the Anacortes refinery is fully shut down as of the end of this month, and will remain so for the duration of the quarter. We have used this purely for assumption purposes, and currently have no estimated time for a restart.
We estimate throughput to be 75,000 to 85,000 barrels per day in the Pacific Northwest region, 70,000 to 80,000 barrels per day in the mid-Pacific, 85,000 to 95,000 barrels a day in Mid-continent as a result of the Mandan turnaround, and 240,000 to 250,000 barrels per day in the California region, which is higher than a quarter ago due to the Golden Eagle maintenance during February.
OpEx guidance for the second quarter is as follows, $6.50 per barrel in the Pacific Northwest region. The higher per barrel number is primarily a reflection of the lower throughput. $3 per barrel in the mid-Pacific, $4.20 per barrel in the Mid-Continent, and $6.85 per barrel in the California region, which is lower than last quarter primarily due to higher throughput.
Our depreciation for refining is estimated at $75 million. This amount is lower than our historical average, as we have extended the useful life of certain process units since their previous turnaround. Additional second quarter guidance items include corporate expense of $45 million and interest expense before interest income of $35 million.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce.

Before we discuss the press release, I want to express my deepest sympathy to all those individuals who have been affected by the tragic accident that occurred at A",1747,"Thank you Scott, and good morning to everyone, and thanks for joining us for today's call. Before we discuss the press release, I want to express my deepest sympathy to all those individuals who have been affected by the tragic accident that occurred at Anacortes. The entire Tesoro family is deeply saddened by the loss of seven co-workers, and we are genuinely concerned about their families and friends. And our thoughts and prayers are with all our employees and their loved ones.
No one is ever adequately prepared to manage a crisis like this one, but I'm extremely proud of the way the management team and the very broad group of employees have dealt with the myriad issues created by this unfortunate incident. Don Sorensen, the manager in Anacortes and his team have done an excellent job of compassionately meeting the needs of our employees, the affected families, and at the same time they have done an exemplary job of co-operating with and providing information and assistance to the various investigation teams. We will continue to make every effort to assist those who are trying to determine the cause of the incident, and to provide support and help to the affected parties.
It is a little difficult to shift gears after those comments, but on today's agenda I want to briefly review our first-quarter results, update you on our non-capital improvement initiatives, and provide some color on what we currently see in the West Coast market. As we reported yesterday, in the first quarter the company reported a net loss of $155 million, or $1.11 per share. These results include an after-tax impairment charge of $12 million associated with the deferral of a capital project at Los Angeles refinery, a $7 million tax charge related to the recent Congressional health care legislation, and $7 million in after-tax accruals for our employees incentive compensation program, which is a change from our previous accounting practice.
The compensation committee has decided to make a quarterly accrual of a targeted amount, and then make appropriate adjustments based on performance. This adjustment is included in the guidance numbers that Scott just provided.
The first quarter segment operating loss of $145 is attributable to a Tesoro Index, which was half of what we saw a year ago. The positives in the first quarter are that we captured 10% more of the available margin compared to the first quarter of last year, and even though first-quarter margins were much lower than we anticipated, we continue to manage our operations and capital program to conserve cash, just as we have done since late 2007.
Since excess capacity among US refiners is limited margin expansion, our entire organization is focused on financial and operational excellence. Our priorities are to maximize cash, optimize the system at these low margins, and to execute the noncapital initiate program. For years, we have been optimizing system feed stock selection by acquiring new and/or economically advantaged crudes relative to available alternatives. During the first quarter we ran two new crudes in our system, and in a period of single digit indices a meaningful discount in our feedstock cost helped us achieve the additional margin capture that I mentioned earlier.
We have made adjustments to the operating system as a result of the shutdown of Anacortes. I know you have many questions about the incident, but we really don't have any new information to provide. The cause is still unknown and due to the ongoing nature of the investigations at the refinery, I can only provide a few facts. Operationally, we announced our intention to halt crude runs, and as of yesterday afternoon all the refinery process units were safely shutdown.
Since the fire, Anacortes had been producing primarily unfinished product that couldn't be upgraded in Anacortes. So we have been moving that product to other plants within our system. We have diverted the crude cargoes that were scheduled to arrive at Anacortes to other refineries. In order to minimize potential product supply disruptions to the extent necessary, we have been supplying our transportation fuel customers with product from third parties.
To date, we have not made any significant adjustments to our capital program, nor do we know what the post financial impact might be. We believe we have adequate insurance coverage, including property and business interruption insurance. Our business interruption deductible is 60 days, and then a loss of $25 million, primarily related to the operating plan that existed prior to the incident, and the property deductible is $10 million.
I will repeat that in light of the investigations, which are still taking place we are not going to speculate about any matters associated with this event, and we will not take speculative questions about it.
From a capital spending perspective, the highly disciplined review process that we initiated several years ago continues to have very positive cash benefits. Today our capital spending is considerably lower than it was projected to be three months ago. Why, because the objective of this process is to identify the most efficient use of capital in all aspects of project management, including optimum design, scheduling and cost management without compromising our two fundamentals, safety and reliability.
The capital management process involves structured review at multiple key points in the development of each project to ensure all possible alternatives are considered, centers of safety, reliability and regulations are met, expenditures are timed to meet requirements, and the most effective cost materials and labor are used. The result is in many cases the early estimates of project costs are reduced, and our actual costs could be below productions.
As noted in the press release yesterday, our first-quarter capital spending of $99 million, which includes turnarounds came in below guidance as this review process resulted in lower turnaround spending at Golden Eagle and projects spending at Salt Lake City. When we reported our 2009 results in February, we revised our full-year 2010 capital program estimate down from $675 million to $600 million. Including our first-quarter progress and continued efforts this year, we now expect the 2010 capital program to be in the $500 million to $525 million range. The $75 million to $100 million decline is another example of the success of this process.
A specific example, we expected to spend almost $50 million for the remainder of the year on a number of projects in LA, but we found ways to reduce that spending. And then as I said at the start of today's call, we also took a $12 million impairment charge related to a multi-year deferral of a group of regulatory projects at LA that totaled around $350 million.
I also mentioned that effective cash management involves not only our capital review, but it also focuses on our operating plans to improve our capture rate. In the first quarter we realized $27 million from noncapital initiatives, despite the difficulties created by the extremely low margin environment in January and early February.
To highlight some of these benefits, the optimized our marine fleet by out chartering excess ship capacity to other parties. Additionally, in our marketing channels we made some changes that delivered benefits in both margins and cost, a trend that we expect will be sustainable going forward. And within our refining and optimization groups, we saw improvements in yield and inventory execution.
In many cases, capturing the full value of these noncapital initiatives requires teamwork within a department, as well as cross functional coordination. Turning to the second quarter, we started to see improvement in the differentials for California heavy crudes, which historically lagged foreign heavy crude differentials.
While the domestic differentials didn't materialize until late in the first quarter, we do expect to see the benefit during the second quarter. On the product side, I would say in broad terms, we are seeing demand and stability for light products. But clearly gasoline supply is above last year’s inventory level and also the five year range.
We believe, like many of you write about the industry, that unemployment right now is the largest factor in preventing return to growing gasoline demand. While the increase in unemployment in California has declined and it appears to be stable, we need to see a sharp decline in that statistic before we expect to see demand growth. Accordingly, I do not believe that we will change the corporate philosophy outlined in our last earnings call.
We will continue to manage and focus business execution around safety, reliability and cash conservation. To achieve this, we need to be diligent, flexible and sensitive to changes in the marketplace. We must deliver on system noncapital initiatives, which we still expect to be in line with our original guidance of $160 million to $170 million. And finally, even though we've reduced our 2010 capital program, we expect to spend approximately $60 million of income improvement in those quick hit [ph] projects we talked about. So we expect to spend $60 million this year. We expect these small high return projects located across our entire asset base to improve cash flow and generate real return for our shareholders, particularly since those returns are little more resilient to margins.
Before I open the call to questions, I want to thank everyone for their support, for their interest and for great analytical work that you have given to me during my almost 18 years of services here at Tesoro. In any corporation there are highs and there have certainly been some lows. But nevertheless, it is been a real privilege and honor to be in this position for so many years.
I want to thank my management team, and I want to acknowledge the excellent commitment that they have shown to our shareholders. I know Greg Goff, and the management team will continue to do an excellent job for our shareholders, and I'm very confident that you will enjoy working with and getting to know Greg.
Finally, just one last thing, in the not too distant future the other Greg, Greg Wright, is also going to join me in retirement. And I want to take this opportunity, since he won't be participating in future calls to thank him for his tireless support and wise counsel for so many years. I know that many of you have known Greg for a long time, and I wanted you to have the opportunity to say goodbye.
And Greg, would you like to say anything before we take questions.

Well, certainly the numbers we got yesterday for February were encouraging with (inaudible) gasoline showing a year-over-year increase of about 6.6%. January was at 3.2%.

Well, certainly the numbers we got yesterday for February were encouraging with (inaudible) gasoline showing a year-over-year increase of about 6.6%. January was at 3.2%. So it is moving in the right direction. The issue though is that was building on a very low 2008 numbers, where gasoline was down almost 11%. So the direction is good on gasoline demand, but it is building off of a very low base.
Certainly we are expecting to see what we normally see at this time of the year which is seasonality in gasoline demand. Typically second-quarter versus first-quarter demand goes up in the neighborhood of 50,000 to 60,000 barrels a day. I think it is fair to say that we are cautiously optimistic about demand, but as long as unemployment stays as high as it is and I think that is going to be with us for probably most of the rest of this year.
We wouldn't expect to see significant demand increases, but at least now we have the direction going right or maybe stable. I think that is kind of our view on gasoline demand going forward.
On your second question, CARB gasoline, we have got four months worth of data right now, but the interpretation of that data can vary. What the data says for four months out of this year for California refineries is that CARB gasoline yield which includes downstream ethanol blending is exactly equal to what it was last year. But overall gasoline yield is up about 3.5%. So right now it appears from the data the excess is actually showing up in conventional gasoline.
That is the data and now the interpretation can vary. Interpretations can be that it was caused by turnarounds that are forcing people to make more conventional than CARB. It can be that demand is only being met by CARB gasoline yield and excess is going into conventional. So the economics may be forcing people to make more conventional than CARB. So overall gasoline yield as I said is up. It is not up as much as you would expect from the conversion from 5.7% to 10%. It is only up, as I said about 3.5% versus about 4.5% you would expect from the ethanol yield.
So that data is still young, and we will look at it as we go forward. We may be able to get some better conclusions.

We had a project that was quite a large project for NOx control in Los Angeles. And it involved a number of pieces that were relatively overturn energy savings around cogeneration and boiler replacements. When we deconstructed that project in this environment with the lower energy costs, and more constrained capital we found a combination of commercial and more efficient investments to achieve the necessary NOx control.
So we got the NOx control done with the combination of perpetual NOx credits that we bought in the market at a good price, and a much reduced capital investment. At some point in the future, but I think outside our current planning horizon, we will still go back and look at those boiler and cogeneration projects. But I wouldn’t be concerned about them in the current planning horizon.
I think the key is really through this low margin cycle, where we think whether it is one or two or three years, we have done some things to permanently change what we are going to do to be able to generate free cash flow.

Just as we look at all statistics and as people look about coming out of the recession and the statistics still don't show that we're coming out of recession, I think that where we are positioned and I think that the continued focus on cash and being able to employ cash more effectively for shareholders is going to continue, and it's going to continue, it's going to start to show some real benefits here in the last half of the year. So once again thank you very much and I'd be on your end of the phone listening to the second quarter. Operator, that's it.

Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's conference call to discuss our first quarter 2010 results. Joining me today are all the members of our executive committee, as well as other member of senior management. While we will not be referencing slides during the call, we did file a deck earlier with the SEC, and I encourage you to have these available as we progress through this morning's call.
These slides, along with other financial results, including the press release and supplemental quarterly data, can be found on our website at tsocorp.com. After reviewing this information, please feel free to contact me for any questions about this material or otherwise, following today's call. Please refer to the forward-looking statements in the earnings slide, which says that statements made during this call that refer to management's expectations and/or future predictions, are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Act, as there are many factors which could cause results to differ from our expectations. I'll now provide second quarter 2010 guidance for modeling purposes.
In these assumptions, we had assumed the Anacortes refinery is fully shut down as of the end of this month, and will remain so for the duration of the quarter. We have used this purely for assumption purposes, and currently have no estimated time for a restart. We estimate throughput to be 75,000 to 85,000 barrels per day in the Pacific Northwest region; 70,000 to 80,000 barrels per day in the Mid-Pacific; 85,000 to 95,000 barrels a day in Mid-Continent, as a result of the Mandan turnaround; and 240,000  to 250,000 barrels per day in the California region, which is higher than a quarter ago, due to the Golden Eagle maintenance during February.
OpEx guidance for the second quarter is as follows: $6.50 per barrel in the Pacific Northwest region. The higher per barrel number is primarily a reflection of the lower throughput; $3 per barrel in the Mid-Pacific; $4.20 per barrel in the Mid-Continent; and $6.85 per barrel in the California region, which is lower than last quarter, primarily due to higher throughput.
Our depreciation for refining is estimated at $75 million. This amount is lower than our historical average, as we have extended the useful life of certain process units since our previous turnaround. Additional second quarter guidance items include corporate expense of $45 million, and interest expense before interest income of $35 million.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce."

Before we discuss the press release, I want to express my deepest sympathy to all those individuals, who have been affected by the tragic accident that occurred at Anacortes. The entire Tesoro family is deeply saddened by the loss of seven co-workers, and we're generally concerned about their families and friends. And our thoughts and prayers are with all our employees and their love ones.
No one's ever adequately prepared to manage a crisis like this one. But I'm extremely proud of the way the management team and a very broad group of employees have dealt with the myriad issues created by this unfortunate incident. Don Sorensen, the manager in Anacortes, and his team have done an excellent job of compassionately meeting the needs of our employees, the affected families. And at the same time, they've done an exemplary job of cooperating with and providing information and assistance to the various investigation teams. We will continue to make every effort to assist those who are trying to determine the cause of the incident, and to provide support and help to the affected parties.
It's a little difficult to shift gears after those comments. But on today's agenda, I want to briefly review our first quarter results, update you on our non-capital improvement initiatives and provide some color on what we currently see in the West Coast market.
As we reported yesterday, in the first quarter, the company reported a net loss of $155 million or $1.11 per share. These results include an after-tax impairment charge of $12 million associated with the deferral of a capital project at the Los Angeles refinery, a $7 million tax charge related to the recent Congressional healthcare legislation and $7 million in after-tax accruals for our employee incentive compensation program, which is a change from our previous accounting practice.
The compensation committee has decided to make a quarterly accrual of targeted amount, and then make appropriate adjustments based on performance. This adjustment is included in the guidance numbers that Scott just provided. 
The first quarter segment operating loss of $145 million is attributable to a Tesoro index, which was half of what we saw a year ago. The positives in the first quarter are that we captured 10% more of the available margin compared to the first quarter of last year. And even though first quarter margins were much lower than we anticipated, we continue to manage our operations and capital program to conserve cash, just as we've done since late 2007.
Since excess capacity among U.S. refineries has limited margin expansion, our entire organization is focused on financial and operational excellence. Our priorities are to maximize cash, optimize the system at these low margins, and to execute the non-capital initiative program.
For years, we have been optimizing system feedstock selection by acquiring new and/or economically advantaged crudes relative to available alternatives. During the first quarter, we ran two new crudes in our system in a period of single-digit indices, a meaningful discount in our feedstock cost helped us achieve the additional margin capture that I mentioned earlier.
We've made adjustments to the operating system as a result of the shutdown of Anacortes. I know you have many questions about the incident, but we really don't have any new information to provide. The cause is still unknown. And due to the ongoing nature of the investigations at the refinery, I can only provide a few facts. 
Operationally, we announced our intention to halt crude runs. And as of yesterday afternoon, all the refinery process units were safely shut down. Since the fire, Anacortes have been producing primarily unfinished product that couldn't be upgraded in Anacortes, so we've been moving that product to other plants within our system. We've diverted the crude cargoes that were scheduled to arrive at Anacortes to other refineries. In order to minimize potential product supply disruptions to the extent necessary, we have been supplying our transportation fuel customers with product from third parties.
To date, we have not made any significant adjustments to our capital program, nor do we know what the post financial impact might be. We believe we have adequate insurance coverage, including property and business interruption insurance. Our business interruption deductible is 60 days, and then a loss of $25 million, primarily related to the operating plan that existed prior to the incident. And the property deductible is $10 million. I will repeat that in light of the investigations, which is still taking place, we're not going to speculate about any matter associated with this event, and we will not take speculative questions about it.
From a capital spending perspective, the highly disciplined review process that we initiated several years ago, continues to have very positive cash benefits. Today, our capital spending is considerably lower than it was projected to be three months ago. Why? Because the objective of this process is to identify the most efficient use of capital in all aspects of project management, including optimum designs, scheduling cost management, without compromising our two fundamentals: safety and reliability. 
The capital management process involves structured reviews at multiple key points in the development of each project to ensure all possible alternatives are considered; standards of safety, reliability and regulations are met; the expenditures are timed to meet requirements; and the most effective cost materials and labor are used.
The result is that, in many case, that the early estimates of project cost are reduced, and our actual cost can be below projections. As noted in the press release yesterday, our first quarter capital spending of $99 million, which includes turnarounds, came in below guidance, as this review process resulted in a lower turnaround spending at Golden Eagle and project spending at Salt Lake City.
When we reported our 2009 results in February, we revised our full year 2010 capital program estimate down from $675 million to $600 million. Including our first quarter progress and continued efforts this year, we now expect the 2010 capital program to be in the $500 million to $525 million range.
The $75 million to $100 million decline is another example of the success of this process. A specific example, we expected to spend almost $50 million for the remainder of the year on a number of projects in L.A., but we found ways to reduce that spending. And then, as I said at the start of today's call, we also took a $12 million impairment charge related to a multi-year deferral of a group of regulatory projects at L.A. that totaled around $350 million.
Also mentioned that effective cash management involves not only our capital review, but it also focuses on our operating plans to improve our capture rate. In The first quarter, we realized $27 million from non-capital initiatives, despite the difficulties created by the extremely low margin environment in January and early February.
To highlight some of these benefits, we optimized our marine fleet by out-chartering excess ship capacity to other parties. Additionally, in our marketing channels, we made some changes that delivered benefits in both margins and costs, a trend that we expect will be sustainable going forward.
And within our refining and optimization groups, we saw improvements in yield and inventory execution. In many cases, capturing the full value of these non-capital initiatives requires teamwork within a department, as well as cross-functional coordination. 
Turning to the second quarter, we started to see improvement at the differentials for California heavy crudes, which historically lag foreign heavy crude differentials. While the domestic differentials didn't materialize until late in the first quarter, we do expect to see the benefit during the second quarter. On the product side, I would say, in broad terms, we are seeing demand stability for light products. But clearly, gasoline supply is above last year's inventory level, and also the five-year range.
We believe, like many of you who write about the industry, that unemployment right now is the largest factor in preventing a return to growing gasoline demand. While the increase in unemployment in California has declined, and it appears to be stable, we need to see a sharp decline in that statistic before we expect to see demand growth. Accordingly, I do not believe we will change the corporate philosophy I outlined in our last earnings call. We will continue to manage and focus business execution around safety, reliability and cash conservation. To achieve this, we need to be diligent, flexible and sensitive to changes in the marketplace.
We must deliver on system non-capital initiatives, which we still expect to be in line with our original guidance of $160 million to $170 million. And finally, even though we've reduced our 2010 capital program, we expect to spend approximately $60 million of income improvement, those quick hit projects we've talked about. So we expect to spend $60 million this year.
We expect these small high-return projects located across our entire asset base to improve cash flow and generate real return for our shareholders, particularly since those returns are a little more resilient to margins.
Before I open the call to questions, I want to thank everyone for their support, for their interest and for the great analytical work that you've given to me during my almost 18 years of service here at Tesoro. In any corporation, there are highs and there have certainly been some lows. But nevertheless, it's been a real privilege and honor to be in this position for so many years. I want to thank my management team, and I want to acknowledge the excellent commitment that they've shown to our shareholders. I know Greg Goff and the management team will continue to do an excellent job for our shareholders, and that I'm very confident that you'll enjoy working with and getting to know Greg. 
Finally, just one last thing, in a not too distant future, the other Greg, Greg Wright, is also going to join me in retirement. And I want to take this opportunity, since he won't be participating in future calls, to thank him for his tireless support and wise counsel for so many years. I know that many of you have known Greg for a long time, and I wanted you to have the opportunity to say goodbye. And Greg, would you like to say anything before we take questions?"

We've had five gasoline showing a year-over-year increase of about 6.6%. January was at 3.2%. So it's moving in the right direction. The issue though is that, that was building on a very low 2008 numbers, where gasoline was down almost 11%. So the direction is good on gasoline demand, but it's building off of a very low base. Certainly, we're expecting to see what we normally see at this time of the year, which is seasonality in gasoline demand. Typically, second quarter versus first quarter, demand goes up in the neighborhood of 50,000 to 60,000 barrels a day. I think it's fair to say that we're cautiously optimistic about demand. But as long as unemployment stays as high as it is, and I think that's going to be with us for probably most of the rest of this year, we would expect to see significant demand increases. But at least now, we have the direction going right or maybe stable. So I think that's kind of our view on gasoline demand going forward. On your second question, CARB gasoline, we've got four months worth of data right now, but the interpretation of that data can vary. What the data says for four months out of this year, for California refinery, is that CARB gasoline yield, which includes downstream ethanol blending is exactly equal to what it was last year. But overall gasoline yield is up about 3.5%. So right now, it appears from the data, the excess is actually showing up in conventional gasoline. That's the data, and now the interpretation can vary. Interpretations can be that it was caused by turnarounds that are forcing people to be make conventional than CARB. It can be that demand is only being met by CARB gasoline yield, and excess is into conventional. So the economics maybe forcing people to make more conventional in CARB. So overall, gasoline yield, as I said, is up. It's not as up as much as you would expect from the conversion from 5.7% to 10%. It's only up, as I said, about 3.5% versus about 4.5% you'd expect from the ethanol yield. So the data's still young, and we'll look at it, as we go forward, maybe able to get some better conclusions."

Joining me today are all the members of our executive committee, as well as other member of senior management. While we will not be referencing slides during the call, we did file a deck earlier with the SEC, and I encourage you to have these available as we progress through this morning's call.
These slides, along with other financial results, including the press release and supplemental quarterly data, can be found on our website at tsocorp.com. After reviewing this information, please feel free to contact me for any questions about this material or otherwise, following today's call. Please refer to the forward-looking statements in the earnings slide, which says that statements made during this call that refer to management's expectations and/or future predictions, are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Act, as there are many factors which could cause results to differ from our expectations. I'll now provide second quarter 2010 guidance for modeling purposes.
In these assumptions, we had assumed the Anacortes refinery is fully shut down as of the end of this month, and will remain so for the duration of the quarter. We have used this purely for assumption purposes, and currently have no estimated time for a restart. We estimate throughput to be 75,000 to 85,000 barrels per day in the Pacific Northwest region; 70,000 to 80,000 barrels per day in the Mid-Pacific; 85,000 to 95,000 barrels a day in Mid-Continent, as a result of the Mandan turnaround; and 240,000  to 250,000 barrels per day in the California region, which is higher than a quarter ago, due to the Golden Eagle maintenance during February.
OpEx guidance for the second quarter is as follows: $6.50 per barrel in the Pacific Northwest region. The higher per barrel number is primarily a reflection of the lower throughput; $3 per barrel in the Mid-Pacific; $4.20 per barrel in the Mid-Continent; and $6.85 per barrel in the California region, which is lower than last quarter, primarily due to higher throughput.
Our depreciation for refining is estimated at $75 million. This amount is lower than our historical average, as we have extended the useful life of certain process units since our previous turnaround. Additional second quarter guidance items include corporate expense of $45 million, and interest expense before interest income of $35 million.
I'll now turn the call over to Bruce."

Before we discuss the press release, I want to express my deepest sympathy to all those individuals, who have been affected by the tragic accident that occurred at Anacortes. The entire Tesoro family is deeply saddened by the loss of seven co-workers, and we're generally concerned about their families and friends. And our thoughts and prayers are with all our employees and their love ones.
No one's ever adequately prepared to manage a crisis like this one. But I'm extremely proud of the way the management team and a very broad group of employees have dealt with the myriad issues created by this unfortunate incident. Don Sorensen, the manager in Anacortes, and his team have done an excellent job of compassionately meeting the needs of our employees, the affected families. And at the same time, they've done an exemplary job of cooperating with and providing information and assistance to the various investigation teams. We will continue to make every effort to assist those who are trying to determine the cause of the incident, and to provide support and help to the affected parties.
It's a little difficult to shift gears after those comments. But on today's agenda, I want to briefly review our first quarter results, update you on our non-capital improvement initiatives and provide some color on what we currently see in the West Coast market.
As we reported yesterday, in the first quarter, the company reported a net loss of $155 million or $1.11 per share. These results include an after-tax impairment charge of $12 million associated with the deferral of a capital project at the Los Angeles refinery, a $7 million tax charge related to the recent congressional healthcare legislation and $7 million in after-tax accruals for our employee incentive compensation program, which is a change from our previous accounting practice.
The compensation committee has decided to make a quarterly accrual of a targeted amount, and then make appropriate adjustments based on performance. This adjustment is included in the guidance numbers that Scott just provided. 
The first quarter segment operating loss of $145 million is attributable to a Tesoro index, which was half of what we saw a year ago. The positives in the first quarter are that we captured 10% more of the available margin compared to the first quarter of last year. And even though first quarter margins were much lower than we anticipated, we continue to manage our operations and capital program to conserve cash, just as we've done since late 2007.
Since excess capacity among U.S. refineries has limited margin expansion, our entire organization is focused on financial and operational excellence. Our priorities are to maximize cash, optimize the system at these low margins, and to execute the non-capital initiative program.
For years, we have been optimizing system feedstock selection by acquiring new and/or economically advantaged crudes relative to available alternatives. During the first quarter, we ran two new crudes in our system in a period of single-digit indices, a meaningful discount in our feedstock cost helped us achieve the additional margin capture that I mentioned earlier.
We've made adjustments to the operating system as a result of the shutdown of Anacortes. I know you have many questions about the incident, but we really don't have any new information to provide. The cause is still unknown. And due to the ongoing nature of the investigations at the refinery, I can only provide a few facts. 
Operationally, we announced our intention to halt crude runs. And as of yesterday afternoon, all the refinery process units were safely shut down. Since the fire, Anacortes have been producing primarily unfinished product that couldn't be upgraded in Anacortes, so we've been moving that product to other plants within our system. We've diverted the crude cargoes that were scheduled to arrive at Anacortes to other refineries. In order to minimize potential product supply disruptions to the extent necessary, we have been supplying our transportation fuel customers with product from third parties.
To date, we have not made any significant adjustments to our capital program, nor do we know what the post financial impact might be. We believe we have adequate insurance coverage, including property and business interruption insurance. Our business interruption deductible is 60 days, and then a loss of $25 million, primarily related to the operating plan that existed prior to the incident. And the property deductible is $10 million. I will repeat that in light of the investigations, which is still taking place, we're not going to speculate about any matter associated with this event, and we will not take speculative questions about it.
From a capital spending perspective, the highly disciplined review process that we initiated several years ago continues to have very positive cash benefits. Today, our capital spending is considerably lower than it was projected to be three months ago. Why? Because the objective of this process is to identify the most efficient use of capital in all aspects of project management, including optimum designs, scheduling cost management, without compromising our two fundamentals: safety and reliability. 
The capital management process involves structured reviews at multiple key points in the development of each project to ensure all possible alternatives are considered; standards of safety, reliability and regulations are met; the expenditures are timed to meet requirements; and the most effective cost materials and labor are used.
The result is that, in many cases, the early estimates of project costs are reduced, and our actual cost can be below projections. As noted in the press release yesterday, our first quarter capital spending of $99 million, which includes turnarounds, came in below guidance, as this review process resulted in a lower turnaround spending at Golden Eagle and project spending at Salt Lake City.
When we reported our 2009 results in February, we revised our full year 2010 capital program estimate down from $675 million to $600 million. Including our first quarter progress and continued efforts this year, we now expect the 2010 capital program to be in the $500 million to $525 million range.
The $75 million to $100 million decline is another example of the success of this process. A specific example, we expected to spend almost $50 million for the remainder of the year on a number of projects in L.A., but we found ways to reduce that spending. And then, as I said at the start of today's call, we also took a $12 million impairment charge related to a multi-year deferral of a group of regulatory projects at L.A. that totaled around $350 million.
I Also mentioned that effective cash management involves not only our capital review, but it also focuses on our operating plans to improve our capture rate. In The first quarter, we realized $27 million from non-capital initiatives, despite the difficulties created by the extremely low margin environment in January and early February.
To highlight some of these benefits, we optimized our marine fleet by out-chartering excess ship capacity to other parties. Additionally, in our marketing channels, we made some changes that delivered benefits in both margins and costs, a trend that we expect will be sustainable going forward.
And within our refining and optimization groups, we saw improvements in yield and inventory execution. In many cases, capturing the full value of these non-capital initiatives requires teamwork within a department, as well as cross-functional coordination. 
Turning to the second quarter, we started to see improvement at the differentials for California heavy crudes, which historically lag foreign heavy crude differentials. While the domestic differentials didn't materialize until late in the first quarter, we do expect to see the benefit during the second quarter. On the product side, I would say, in broad terms, we are seeing demand stability for light products. But clearly, gasoline supply is above last year's inventory level, and also the five-year range.
We believe, like many of you who write about the industry, that unemployment right now is the largest factor in preventing a return to growing gasoline demand. While the increase in unemployment in California has declined, and it appears to be stable, we need to see a sharp decline in that statistic before we expect to see demand growth. Accordingly, I do not believe we will change the corporate philosophy I outlined in our last earnings call. We will continue to manage and focus business execution around safety, reliability and cash conservation. To achieve this, we need to be diligent, flexible and sensitive to changes in the marketplace.
We must deliver on system non-capital initiatives, which we still expect to be in line with our original guidance of $160 million to $170 million. And finally, even though we've reduced our 2010 capital program, we expect to spend approximately $60 million of income improvement, those quick hit projects we've talked about. So we expect to spend $60 million this year.
We expect these small high-return projects located across our entire asset base to improve cash flow and generate real return for our shareholders, particularly since those returns are a little more resilient to margins.
Before I open the call to questions, I want to thank everyone for their support, for their interest and for the great analytical work that you've given to me during my almost 18 years of service here at Tesoro. In any corporation, there are highs and there have certainly been some lows. But nevertheless, it's been a real privilege and honor to be in this position for so many years. I want to thank my management team, and I want to acknowledge the excellent commitment that they've shown to our shareholders. I know Greg Goff and the management team will continue to do an excellent job for our shareholders, and that I'm very confident that you'll enjoy working with and getting to know Greg. 
Finally, just one last thing, in a not too distant future, the other Greg, Greg Wright, is also going to join me in retirement. And I want to take this opportunity, since he won't be participating in future calls, to thank him for his tireless support and wise counsel for so many years. I know that many of you have known Greg for a long time, and I wanted you to have the opportunity to say goodbye. And Greg, would you like to say anything before we take questions?"

We've had five gasoline showing a year-over-year increase of about 6.6%. January was at 3.2%. So it's moving in the right direction. The issue though is that, that was building on a very low 2008 numbers, where gasoline was down almost 11%. So the direction is good on gasoline demand, but it's building off of a very low base. Certainly, we're expecting to see what we normally see at this time of the year, which is seasonality in gasoline demand. Typically, second quarter versus first quarter, demand goes up in the neighborhood of 50,000 to 60,000 barrels a day. I think it's fair to say that we're cautiously optimistic about demand. But as long as unemployment stays as high as it is, and I think that's going to be with us for probably most of the rest of this year, we would expect to see significant demand increases. But at least now, we have the direction going right or maybe stable. So I think that's kind of our view on gasoline demand going forward. On your second question, CARB gasoline, we've got four months worth of data right now, but the interpretation of that data can vary. What the data says for four months out of this year, for California refinery, is that CARB gasoline yield, which includes downstream ethanol blending is exactly equal to what it was last year. But overall gasoline yield is up about 3.5%. So right now, it appears from the data, the excess is actually showing up in conventional gasoline. That's the data, and now the interpretation can vary. Interpretations can be that it was caused by turnarounds that are forcing people to be make conventional than CARB. It can be that demand is only being met by CARB gasoline yield, and excess is into conventional. So the economics maybe forcing people to make more conventional in CARB. So overall, gasoline yield, as I said, is up. It's not as up as much as you would expect from the conversion from 5.7% to 10%. It's only up, as I said, about 3.5% versus about 4.5% you'd expect from the ethanol yield. So the data's still young, and we'll look at it, as we go forward, maybe able to get some better conclusions."

As everyone knows I joined Tesoro about three months ago.

As everyone knows I joined Tesoro about three months ago. The first three months have been challenging and exciting and we have embarked on a very focused and ambitious agenda to drive fundamental improvement in the business.
Later in the call today, I will talk a little bit about some of those key initiatives. And then during the fourth quarter of this year we will also provide a very compelling plan to deliver shareholder value during our analyst meeting.
Today, we are pleased to report second quarter earnings of $0.47 per share or $0.30 per diluted share for one time benefit of $0.17. These earnings were achieved with Anacortes refinery idled and then Mandan refinery down for a planned turnaround, as industry spreads improved significantly, during the quarter and our capture rate also improved. 
The Tesoro index in the quarter was nearly double what we saw in the first quarter, and it was up about 15% in the second quarter of last year. We saw positive signs of economic recovery during the quarter specifically on the West Coast port traffic and rail activity, which we believe supported higher distillate margin.
Gasoline spreads meanwhile continues to suffer from weak demand as unemployment in California remains high.
Capture rate throughout our system were up significantly in the quarter, driven by 3 or 4 key things. One strong commercial and wholesale margins, two improved crude differentials, three an ethanol discount to Gasoline, of about $0.55 per gallon, which improved the margin on ethanol blended gasoline. And finally as a result of the shutdown of the Anacortes refinery. We were still able to profitably meet our customer requirements in the Pacific Northwest.
Retail marketing margins were also strong during the quarter as spot price fell more rapidly than street prices. And of course our throughput rates during the quarter, were down significantly from last year second quarter as we tided the Anacortes refinery following the fire on the naphtha hydrotreater.
Additionally our Mandan refinery successfully completed its propane turnaround during the quarter it’s probably important to note about the Mandan refinery it’s on about a 6.5 year plus turn around cycle.
Anacortes remained ideal today, but we have begun work to repair the damaged units. That work is progressing well and on schedule, and we expect the plant should be operational as early as September. 
Meanwhile, we continue to work closely with the investigators regarding the incident. We have successfully moved unfinished product produced at Anacortes during April to our other refineries for further processing.
Additionally, we were able to devour water borne crew cargos heading to Anacortes to our California refinery and we continue to successfully supply our customers with products either sourced from out [control] refineries for our third party purchases. 
Regarding Anacortes, it is also important to note that we expect the financial impact of this incident to be limited to our insurance deductibles. And finally I can’t stress enough how thankful we are to our employees at the Anacortes facility, they have worked admirably to get us through this terrible tragedy.
Despite the improvement in margins and earnings during the quarter, we remain focused on our core objectives of driving operations excellence in capital discipline. And while we have seen some signs of economic improvement, high unemployment in California and excess refining capacity in US still way on margins and generally we continue to plan for our margin environment, similar to what we saw in 2009.
As such we remained focused on operating our assets safely and reliably optimizing the system and allowing local demand to be the primary driver of production and yield.
We remain focused on maximizing cash flows and delivering the expected results from our capital and non-capital initiative.
As we announced in our press release, our capital spending including turn arounds in the second quarter was about $140 million and our estimate for this year is now in the range $475 million $500 million. 
We also expect future capital spending to be lower than guidance previously given. We remain committed to investing in safety, reliability, environmental protection and to our quick hit capital program announced last call. However, we continue to look for and find ways to capture advantages and lower our overall capital spending. 
Examples of where we have been able to reduce our capital spending requirements, while still achieving objectives of the necessary work includes NOx reductions at our Los Angeles refinery and bending reductions across our whole refining system.
As we have mentioned on the first quarter call, we originally expected to comply with NOx reduction requirements through significant investments in a co-generation facility and boiler replacements.
We have since discovered that we will be able to meet our requirements through more efficient investments and the purchase of perpetual credits. This has significantly changed the scope of the multi-year projects that originally totaled about $350 million.
Similarly, we continue to assess our plans for bending compliance and reduced our expect spend by about $15 million and have found ways to push the spending out through 2013, which is about a year longer than we previously expected.
We will be completing our annual capital planning process in the fall and expect to revive our guidance for 2011 and beyond at that point.
From an income capital perspective, we continue to execute are (inaudible) capital program, we are on track to spend about $50 million to $60 million in 2010, and we expect to realize a total of $25 million in related EBITDA this year.
Also, we continue to make very good progress on our $165 million non-capital initiatives for this year, and having realized about half of that target improvements year to date. 
To further strengthen our competitive position, we announced yesterday, changes to our corporate over head and benefit plans that when fully implemented by the end of this year will have a significant impact on our expenses, cash flow and future liabilities.
These changes to our corporate overhead include a reduction in force and other overhead efficiency improvements that we expect will reduce total over head cost by $40 million to $50 million annually.
In addition, we concluded a study of our benefits programs during the quarter and made changes that we expect will reduce our on going benefit expenses by $80 million to $90 million annually. The changes are primarily to post retirement medical and life insurance benefits that bring us more in line with our piers and reduce the estimated post retirement benefit liabilities on our balance sheet.
The change to the post retirement life benefits allowed us to record a pre tax gain of $43 million net of severance accruals during the quarter. And because the savings are mostly related to accruals of future obligation, the cash [baiting] started out small. In the $5 million to $10 million range, but then they grow to an estimated $25 million annually in about 10 years. 
As significant is P&L and cash savings are, is the reduction in estimated post retirement benefit obligation on our balance sheet. In round numbers these changes will reduce both liabilities from a projected $900 million at the end of this year to just under $600 million, and where that liability was projected to grow to nearly to $1.2 billion by 2014, we are now projecting that liability to stay relatively constant and about $600 million, so at about 50% of the level that would have grown to.
Finally, let me update you on the status of our actions to improve the pricing for the fuel that we supply to Hawaii electric.
As we have mentioned last quarter the Tesoro and Hawaii electric public utility reached an agreement on a new pricing formula related to low sulfur fuel oil sales we are still awaiting approval from the Hawaiian Public Utility Commission. However, based on eco findings with the PUC, a [hearing] is expected sometime in the fourth quarter. At this point we prefer not to provide any financial guidance related to the new pricing formula until we have the final approval through the PUC.
Today, we believe we have the right assets in the right markets, and we see significant opportunity to strengthen out competitive position by improving our cost structure and driving improvements with our capital and non capital initiative we also continue to believe that structurally the West Coast is one of the most attractive markets and offers some advantages that we like.
Having said that, we have initiated a comprehensive strategic review of our business and as I talked about earlier we plan to discuss our strategic plans at the fall analyst day event. 
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Scott Spendlove our CFO for more detailed discussion of our quarterly results and to provide guidance for the third quarter, and then at the end I’ll comeback and provide some concluding comments, Scott.

These results include one time after tax benefits of $24 million or $0.17 per diluted share. There are three primary items that account for these adjustments. Greg already mentioned the $43 million net that is primarily related to our post retirement benefit changes. After tax these net benefits changes is a $26 million credit earnings. 
Also in the quarter, there were one time after tax charges of $7 million. Related to expense accruals and asset write offs at our Anacortes refinery. Finally, we took an after tax benefit of $5 million, related to a state tax settlement arising from exploration and production activities of Tesoro over 15 years ago. 
Adjusted for special items, that leaves us with net income of $43 million or $0.30 per diluted share. Segment operating income was $180 million for the quarter. $153 million net of the special items, up significantly from the $11 million, we reported for the quarter last year and driven by the margins gains, Greg described earlier. 
Our manufacturing cost in the second quarter, were $248 million in line with the first quarter of this year. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $191 million and $713 million of availability on the revolving credit facility. Once again we were under on our net facility during the quarter.
At the end of the quarter, our total debt to total capitalization ratio was 37%. Year-to-date, cash is down over $200 million as CapEx changes and working capital and interest payments, outpaced EBITDA and tax refunds.
As Greg mentioned earlier we spend a $140 million in capital expenditures during the quarter. This was up from the first quarter, primarily due to the full plant turnaround at our Mandan refinery. 
Looking forward to the remainder of 2010, the only material turnaround work we have is currently under way at our Hawaii refinery.
Turning to the quarter, we see gasoline demand on the West Coast remaining stagnant as California unemployment remains at its peak of around 12.5%, some 3% above the national average.
Supply changes, however are balancing low demand with crude around gasoline production and gasoline inventories all close to their five years lows in July. As a result so far in July the West Coast crack is up more than $3 per barrel over July of last year and the gasoline against difference for the Gulf Coast is close to its five year high for the month at over $0.25 per gallon.
I’ll close with providing guidance for the third quarter for your modeling purposes. In these assumption we have assumed the Anacortes refinery remains idle during the months of July and August, where the restart currently expected for September.
We estimate throughput in thousands of barrels per day to be 75 to 85, in the Pacific Northwest, 55 to 65 in the mid Pacific, 110 to 120 in the mid continent and 240 to 250 in the California region. OpEx guidance for the third quarter and dollars per barrel is as follows: $745 in the Pacific Northwest, $375 in the Mid Pacific, $330 in the Mid continent and 710 in the California region.
Our depreciation for refining is estimated at $95 million, an additional second quarter guidance items include corporate expense of $37 million, which includes the savings expected from recent changes to our corporate overhead structure and interest expense before interest income of $40 million.
With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Greg for closing comments. Greg.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call today. As everyone knows, I joined Tesoro about three months ago. The first three months had been challenging and exciting, and we have embarked on a very focused and ambitious agenda to drive fundamental improvement in the business. Later in the call today, I will talk a little bit about some of those key initiatives. And then during the fourth quarter of this year, we will also provide a very compelling plan to deliver shareholder value during our Analyst Meeting. 
Today, we are pleased to report second quarter earnings of $0.47 per share or $0.30 per diluted share for one-time benefits of $0.17. These earnings were achieved with the Anacortes refinery idled and the Mandan refinery down for plant turnaround as industry spreads improved significantly during the quarter, and our capture rates also improved. 
The Tesoro Index in the quarter was nearly double what we saw in the first quarter, and it was up about 15% from the second quarter of last year. We saw positive signs of economic recovery during the quarter, specifically on the West Coast port traffic and rail activity, which we believe supported higher diesel margins. Gasoline spreads, meanwhile, continue to suffer from weak demand as unemployment in California remains high.
Capture rates throughout our system were up significantly in the quarter, driven by three or four key things: one, strong commercial and wholesale margins; two, improved crude differentials; three, an ethanol discount to gasoline of about $0.55 per gallon, which improved the margin on ethanol-blended gasoline; and finally, as a result of the shutdown of the Anacortes refinery, we were still able to profitably meet our customer requirements in the Pacific Northwest.
Retail marketing margins were also strong during the quarter, as spot prices fell more rapidly than street prices. And of course, our throughput rates during the quarter were down significantly from last year's second quarter as we idled the Anacortes refinery following the fire on the naptha hydrotreater. Additionally, our Mandan refinery successfully completed its full-plant turnaround during the quarter. It's probably important to note about the Mandan refinery is it's on about a 6.5 year-plus turnaround cycle.
Anacortes remains idled today, but we have begun work to repair the damaged units. That work is progressing well and on schedule, and we expect the plant should be operational as early as September. Meanwhile, we continue to work closely with the investigators regarding the incident.
We have successfully moved unfinished products produced at Anacortes during April to our other refineries for further processing. Additionally, we were able to divert water-borne crude cargoes heading to Anacortes to our California refineries, and we continue to successfully supply our customers with products either sourced from our Tesoro refineries or third-party purchases. Regarding Anacortes, it is also important to note that we expect the financial impact of this incident to be limited to our insurance deductibles. 
And finally, I can't stress enough how thankful we are to our employees at the Anacortes facility. They worked admirably to get us through this terrible tragedy. 
Despite the improvement in margins and earnings during the quarter, we remain focused on our core objective of driving operations excellence and capital discipline. And while we have seen some signs of economic improvement, high unemployment in California and excess refining capacity in the U.S. still weigh on margins. And generally, we continue to plan for a margin environment similar to what we saw in 2009.
As such, we remain focused on operating our assets safely and reliably, optimizing the system and allowing local demand to be the primary driver of production and yield. We remain focused on maximizing cash flows and delivering the expected results from our capital and non-capital initiatives.
As we announced in our press release, our capital spending, including turnarounds in the second quarter, was about $140 million, and our estimate for this year is now in the range of $475 million to $500 million. We also expect future capital spending to be lower than guidance previously given. We remain committed to investing in safety, reliability, environmental protection and to our quick-hit capital program announced last fall. However, we continue to look for and find ways to capture advantages and lower our overall capital spending.
Examples of where we've been able to reduce our capital spending requirements while still achieving the objectives of the necessary work include NOx reductions at our Los Angeles refinery and benzene reductions across our whole refining system. As was mentioned on the first quarter call, we originally expected to comply with NOx reductions requirements through significant investments in a cogeneration facility and boiler replacements. We have since discovered that we will be able to meet our requirements through more efficient investments and the purchase of perpetual credits. This has significantly changed the scope of the multi-year projects that originally totaled about $315 million.
Similarly, we continue to assess our plans for benzene compliance and have reduced our expected spend by about $15 million and have found ways to push the spending out through 2013, which is about a year longer than we previously expected. We will be completing our annual capital planning process in the fall and expect to revise our guidance for 2011 and beyond at that point. 
From an income capital perspective, we continue to execute our quick-hit capital program. We are on track to spend about $50 million to $60 million in 2010, and we expect to realize a total of $25 million in related EBITDA this year. Also, we continue to make very good progress on our $165 million non-capital initiatives for this year and having realized about half of that target improvements year-to-date.
To further strengthen our competitive position, we announced yesterday changes to our corporate overhead and benefit plans that, when fully implemented by the end of this year, will have a significant impact on our expenses, cash flow and future liabilities. These changes to our corporate overhead include a reduction in force and other overhead efficiency improvements that we expect to reduce total overhead costs by $40 million to $50 million annually. 
In addition, we concluded a study of our benefits programs during the quarter and made changes that we expect will reduce our ongoing benefit expenses by $80 million to $90 million annually. The changes are primarily to post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits that bring us more in line with our peers and reduce the estimated post-retirement benefit liabilities on our balance sheet. The change to the post-retirement life benefits allow us to record a pretax gain of $43 million, net of severance accrual during the quarter. And because our savings are mostly related to accruals of future obligations, the cash savings start out small in the $5 million to $10 million range, but then they grow at an estimated $25 million annually in about 10 years.
As significant as the P&L and cash savings are is the reduction in estimated post-retirement benefit obligations on our balance sheet. In round numbers, these changes will reduce both liabilities from a projected $900 million at the end of this year to just under $600 million. And where that liability was projected to grow to nearly $1.2 billion by 2014, we're now projecting that liability to stay relatively constant at about $600 million, so at about 50% of the level it would have grown to. 
Finally, let me update you on the status of our actions to improve the pricing for the fuel oil that we supply to Hawaii Electric. As was mentioned last quarter, Tesoro and Hawaii Electric Public Utility reached an agreement on a new pricing formula related to low sulfur fuel oil sales. We are still awaiting approval from the Hawaiian Public Utility Commission (sic) [Hawaiian Public Utilities Commission]. However, based on HECO findings with the PUC, a ruling is expected sometime in the fourth quarter. At this point, we prefer not to provide any financial guidance related to the new pricing formula until we have the final approval through the PUC. 
Today, we believe we have the right assets in the right markets, and we see significant opportunity to strengthen our competitive position by improving our cost structure and driving improvements with our capital and non-capital initiatives. We also continue to believe that structurally, the West Coast is one of the most attractive markets and offer some advantages that we like. Having said that, we have initiated a comprehensive strategic review of our business. And as I talked about earlier, we plan to discuss our strategic plans at the fall Analyst Day event. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott Spendlove, our CFO, for a more detailed discussion of our quarterly results and to provide guidance for the third quarter. And then at the end, I'll come back and provide some concluding comments. Scott?"

During the second quarter, we reported net income of $67 million or $0.47 per diluted share. These results include one-time after-tax benefits of $24 million or $0.17 per diluted share. There are three primary items that account for these ad",577,"Thanks, Greg. During the second quarter, we reported net income of $67 million or $0.47 per diluted share. These results include one-time after-tax benefits of $24 million or $0.17 per diluted share. There are three primary items that account for these adjustments. Greg already mentioned the $43 million net that's primarily related to our post-retirement benefit changes. After tax, these net benefits, the changes is a $26 million credit earnings.
Also in the quarter, there were one-time after-tax charges of $7 million related to expense accruals and asset write-offs at our Anacortes refinery. Finally, we took an after-tax benefit of $5 million related to a state tax settlement, arising from exploration and production activities of Tesoro over 15 years ago. Adjusted for special items, that leaves us with net income of $43 million or $0.30 per diluted share. 
Segment operating income was $180 million for the quarter, $153 million net of the special items, up significantly from the $11 million we reported for the quarter last year and driven by the margin gains Greg described earlier. Our manufacturing costs in the second quarter were $248 million, in line with the first quarter of this year.
We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $191 million and had $713 million of availability on the revolving credit facility. Once again, we were undrawn on that facility during the quarter. At the end the quarter, our total debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 37%.
Year-to-date, cash is down over $200 million as CapEx, changes in working capital and interest payments outpaced EBITDA and tax refunds. As Greg mentioned earlier, we spent $140 million in capital expenditures during the quarter. This was up from the first quarter, primarily due to the full-plant turnaround at our Mandan refinery. Looking forward to the remainder of 2010, the only material turnaround work we have is currently underway at our Hawaii refinery.
Turning to the quarter, we see gasoline demand on the West Coast remaining stagnant, as California unemployment remains at its peak of around 12.5%, some 3% above the national average. Supply changes, however, are balancing low demand with crude runs, gasoline production and gasoline inventories all close to their five-year lows in July. As a result, so far in July, the West Coast crack is up more than $3 per barrel over July of last year, and the gasoline difference to the Gulf Coast is close to its five-year high for the month at over $0.25 per gallon. 
I'll close with providing guidance for the third quarter for your modeling purposes. In these assumptions, we have assumed the Anacortes refinery remains idle during the month of July and August, with a restart currently expected for September. We estimate throughput in thousands of barrels per day to be 75 to 85 in the Pacific Northwest, 55 to 65 in the Mid-Pacific, 110 to 120 in the Mid-Continent and 240 to 250 in the California region. 
OpEx guidance for the third quarter in dollars per barrel is as follows: 745 in the Pacific Northwest, 375 in the Mid-Pacific, 330 in the Mid-Continent and 710 in the California region. Our depreciation for refining is estimated at $95 million. An additional second quarter guidance items include corporate expense of $37 million, which includes the savings expected from recent changes to our corporate overhead structure and interest expense before interest income of $40 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Greg for closing comments. Greg?"

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call today. We are pleased to report third quarter earnings of $0.39 per diluted share or $0.51 per diluted share excluding onetime expenses of $0.12. The onetime expenses are mainly attributable to our maintenance work at the Anacortes refinery. These earnings were achieved with Anacortes idled and Hawaii at reduced rates for a plant turnaround as both industry spreads and our capture rates improved during the quarter. 
The Tesoro Index in the quarter was up 17% from the third quarter of last year. This improvement was driven by diesel spreads, which were up more than 50% over last year. 
Demand for the distillate barrel is up globally, and we see this reflected in diesel exports, much of which is going to Latin America. In our markets in particular, we continue to see an increase in West Coast seaport traffic, which, during the quarter, reached levels not seen since late 2007. West Coast gasoline spreads meanwhile continued to suffer from weak demand as unemployment in California remains high. 
Capture rates throughout our system were up significantly in the quarter, driven by strong clean product yields. Importantly, we were able to produce more diesel, allowing us to capture the stronger distillate margins.
We also saw an improvement in our feedstock costs as we ran an overall heavier diet of crude oil and captured improved light heavy differentials, specifically from Canadians and South American heavy crudes. Retail marketing margins were also strong during the quarter. Spot prices for light products, which generally follow the price of crude oil, fell more rapidly than street prices. However, throughput rates during the quarter were down significantly from last year's third quarter, as we repaired the Anacortes refinery and successfully completed the plant turnaround of our Hawaii refinery during the quarter.
As we reported in our press release, substantial progress has been made towards the restart of the Anacortes Washington refinery. Today, most of the refinery is operating, and we expect to be back to normal operations soon. In addition to completing repairs to the damaged units, we also accelerated extensive future inspection and maintenance work to take advantage of the plant downtime.
We hired a well-respected engineering firm immediately after the incident to conduct a refinery-wide review of equipment, specifically targeting High Temperature Hydrogen Attack or HTHA, which is what we believe was a source of the April 2 accident at Anacortes.
We also hired outside experts to conduct a review process of inspection records related to specific units in order to provide assurance that all of our processes are in accordance with standard industry practices, and they are.
We inspected hundreds of vertical vessels and performed several thousand discrete examinations regarding appropriate alloy content of specific units. We replaced the heat exchangers on the naptha hydrotreater, with new units designed according to current industry standards. And then we also conducted inspections of units at all of our refineries that are in similar service.
While we remain saddened by the human cost of the Anacortes accident, we continue to expect that the overall financial impact of this incident, even taking into account the allegations made by the Washington regulatory agency, will be limited to our insurance deductibles and that we have adequate insurance coverage for this event.
As we've previously stated, our insurance deductibles are $10 million for property and $25 million for business interruption. In fact, as of this call, we have received $27 million in business interruption proceeds, net of the deductible for partial losses of income through June 30. We have filed additional business interruption and property damage claims, which we anticipate could be settled during the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2011. These are cash proceeds that will be reflected in higher net income.
I can't stress enough how thankful we are towards Tesoro employees at the Anacortes facility and throughout the organization, as they worked so hard to make the necessary repairs and successfully and safely restart the refinery. 
Most of the investigations are now complete, and we are waiting the final results. The Chemical Safety Board has until April 2011 to issue the results of their investigation.
We filed a notice of appeal to all citations and penalties in response to the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries on October 22. While we disagree with the characterization of the department's allegations, we are encouraged that we may be able to work with the department to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution to the citations.
As we look forward from here, we still see economic challenges and the effect of a weaker economy on product demand and margins. We're also disappointed that California voted against Proposition 23 that would have deferred implementation of AB 32 until unemployment rates in California dropped below 5.5%. 
Regarding the potential costs of compliance with AB 32, we are not in a position to provide any details on the call today. Since the specifics of the regulations are being developed, it is premature to speculate on the impact at this point in time.
We are currently in the process of digesting carbs recent draft of the Cap-and-Trade Regulation. I would say that if you combine their initial credit allocation with our recent energy efficiency projects and those currently underway, we believe reaching the mandate of threshold on stationary sources will be attainable.
In summary, given these economic and regulatory challenges, we remain very focused on the things that we can do to improve our bottom line despite the lower margin environment. We're on track to realize our capital and non-capital improvement initiatives for this year, which we expect will add just under $200 million in EBITDA to this year's results. And our efforts to improve our cost structure are progressing as planned.
We'll discuss these and other initiatives and plans for 2011 and beyond at our Analyst Day event in December. I look forward to seeing many of you there.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott Spendlove, our CFO, for a more detailed discussion of our quarterly results and to provide guidance for the fourth quarter. Scott?"
307816,114137319,85865,"Tesoro Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2010",2010-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Andeavor","Executives","Thanks, Greg. As we reported last night for the third quarter, net income was $73 million or $0.51 per share before onetime after-tax expenses of $17 million or $0.12 per diluted share.

As we reported last night for the third quarter, net income was $73 million or $0.51 per share before onetime after-tax expenses of $17 million or $0.12 per diluted share. The majority of these onetime items reflect after-tax expenses related to maintenance and repair work at our Anacortes refinery. About half of these expenses are attributable to the incident itself and will be part of our insurance claims.
The other half reflects acceleration of inspection and maintenance work plan for the future and completed while the refinery was idled. You can see these charges reflected in higher manufacturing expenses in our Pacific Northwest region. 
Segment operating income was $178 million for the quarter, $201 million net of the special items, up significantly from the $137 million we reported for the quarter last year and driven by the margin and capture gains Greg described earlier.
Our manufacturing costs in the third quarter were $266 million, up $18 million from the second quarter of this year, driven primarily by the onetime cost I previously mentioned. Corporate and unallocated costs, net of depreciation, were $45 million for the quarter. Our guidance for the quarter was $37 million, reflecting expected reductions in overhead costs. What we realized in expenses was actually better than our guidance, but two additional non-cash charges took the final number to $45 million.
The first is a charge of $4 million relating to expenses incurred to sublease a portion of our corporate headquarters. The sublease will result in significant cash savings over the term of the lease but resulted in onetime charges in the period. The remaining amount of the difference relates to accruals for stock-based compensation. Our stock price gained nearly 14% during the period, leading to a higher accrual for stock-based compensation expense.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $339 million and had $827 million of availability on the revolving credit facility. Once again, we were undrawn on that facility during the quarter. At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-total cap was 37%.
Changing cash for the quarter was a build of $148 million, as EBITDA exceeded capital spending. Working capital was flat. We had no cash interest payments in the quarter, and we're currently not a cash taxpayer.
As Greg mentioned earlier, we spent $110 million on capital projects during the quarter. This was down from the second quarter because of less turnaround activities at our refineries. We have no additional plant turnaround work for the remainder of 2010. We continue to expect that capital spending, including turnarounds for 2010, will be in the $475 million to $500 million range.
Turning to the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is typically a weak gasoline demand period, with PADD V demand declining more than 4% on average versus the third quarter. Supply reductions have supported margins in PADD V during October, but they weaken during the first part of November. 
PADD V crude runs in October were 85,000 barrels a day or 4% lower relative to the same period last year, which was a record low. California gasoline production was down by more than 5%, relative to the same period last year.
And based on the latest Department of Energy data, PADD V gasoline inventories have declined to the five-year average unlike overall domestic markets, which remain above historical levels. This has led to relative margin strength in on West Coast in October where cracks have averaged just under $14 per barrel, down only slightly from September and well above the same period last year.
Additionally, the West Coast gasoline differentials to the NYMEX have averaged $0.15 per gallon, up $0.02 per gallon relative to both September and the same period last year.
So again, October was a good start to the fourth quarter, but we've seen a reduction in margins to this point in November. 
Let me close with guidance for the fourth quarter for your modeling purposes. We estimate throughput in thousand of barrels per day to be 100 to 110 in the Pacific Northwest, 65 to 75 in the Mid-Pacific, 110 to 120 in the MidCon and 230 to 240 in the California region.
OpEx guidance for the third quarter in dollars per barrel is as follows, $5.85 in the Pacific Northwest, $3.25 in the mid-Pacific, $3.25 in the MidCon and $7.55 per barrel in the California region. Our depreciation for refining is estimated at $92 million. Additional fourth quarter guidance items include corporate expense, excluding depreciation, of $36 million and interest expense before interest income of $42 million.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Greg for closing comments. Greg?"

The purpose of that, there's three or four things that we're trying to do there. One of the them is it allows us to supply, to source of crudes, South American crudes into our West Coast systems. So that when we see opportunities to acquire crudes that will fit into our system, that gives us some operational flexibility to do that. The second thing is because of the commitments that we have around the pipelines and the tankage, it allows us to -- when there are opportunities with the market structure, if we want to be able to store crudes, either for our own system, for future running or to resell in the marketplace to companies that we have commercial relationships, it allow us to do that. It allows us to manage the freight economics between the pipeline, as well as what other companies may do by go in and not using the pipeline. It allows us to go in and take advantage of blending opportunities.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call today. We are pleased to report third quarter earnings of $0.39 per diluted share or $0.51 per diluted share excluding onetime expenses of $0.12. The onetime expenses are mainly attributable to our maintenance work at the Anacortes refinery. These earnings were achieved with Anacortes idled and Hawaii at reduced rates for a plant turnaround as both industry spreads and our capture rates improved during the quarter. 
The Tesoro Index in the quarter was up 17% from the third quarter of last year. This improvement was driven by diesel spreads, which were up more than 50% over last year. 
Demand for the distillate barrel is up globally, and we see this reflected in distillate exports, much of which is going to Latin America. In our markets in particular, we continue to see an increase in West Coast seaport traffic, which, during the quarter, reached levels not seen since late 2007. West Coast gasoline spreads meanwhile continued to suffer from weak demand as unemployment in California remains high. 
Capture rates throughout our system were up significantly in the quarter, driven by strong clean product yields. Importantly, we were able to produce more diesel, allowing us to capture the stronger distillate margins.
We also saw an improvement in our feedstock costs as we ran an overall heavier diet of crude oil and captured improved light heavy differentials, specifically from Canadians and South American heavy crudes. Retail marketing margins were also strong during the quarter. Spot prices for light products, which generally follow the price of crude oil, fell more rapidly than street prices. However, throughput rates during the quarter were down significantly from last year's third quarter, as we repaired the Anacortes refinery and successfully completed the plant turnaround of our Hawaii refinery during the quarter.
As we reported in our press release, substantial progress has been made towards the restart of the Anacortes Washington refinery. Today, most of the refinery is operating, and we expect to be back to normal operations soon. In addition to completing repairs to the damaged units, we also accelerated extensive future inspection and maintenance work to take advantage of the plant’s downtime.
We hired a well-respected engineering firm immediately after the incident to conduct a refinery-wide review of equipment, specifically targeting High Temperature Hydrogen Attack or HTHA, which is what we believe was a source of the April 2 accident at Anacortes.
We also hired outside experts to conduct a review process of inspection records related to specific units in order to provide assurance that all of our processes are in accordance with standard industry practices, and they are.
We inspected hundreds of vertical vessels and performed several thousand discrete examinations regarding appropriate alloy content of specific units. We replaced the heat exchangers on the naptha hydrotreater, with new units designed according to current industry standards. And then we also conducted inspections of units at all of our refineries that are in similar service.
While we remain saddened by the human cost of the Anacortes accident, we continue to expect that the overall financial impact of this incident, even taking into account the allegations made by the Washington regulatory agency, will be limited to our insurance deductibles and that we have adequate insurance coverage for this event.
As we've previously stated, our insurance deductibles are $10 million for property and $25 million for business interruption. In fact, as of this call, we have received $27 million in business interruption proceeds, net of the deductible for partial losses of income through June 30. We have filed additional business interruption and property damage claims, which we anticipate could be settled during the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2011. These are cash proceeds that will be reflected in higher net income.
I can't stress enough how thankful we are to our Tesoro employees at the Anacortes facility and throughout the organization, as they worked so hard to make the necessary repairs and successfully and safely restart the refinery. 
Most of the investigations are now complete, and we are waiting the final results. The Chemical Safety Board has until April 2011 to issue the results of their investigation.
We filed a notice of appeal to all citations and penalties in response to the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries on October 22. While we disagree with the characterization of the department's allegations, we are encouraged that we may be able to work with the department to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution to the citations.
As we look forward from here, we still see economic challenges and the effect of a weaker economy on product demand and margins. We're also disappointed that Californians voted against Proposition 23 that would have deferred implementation of AB 32 until unemployment rates in California dropped below 5.5%. 
Regarding the potential costs of compliance with AB 32, we are not in a position to provide any details on the call today. Since the specifics of the regulations are being developed, it is premature to speculate on the impact at this point in time.
We are currently in the process of digesting CARB’s recent draft of the Cap-and-Trade Regulation. I would say that if you combine their initial emission credit allocation with our recent energy efficiency projects and those currently underway, we believe reaching the mandated of thresholds on stationary sources will be attainable.
In summary, given these economic and regulatory challenges, we remain very focused on the things that we can do to improve our bottom line despite the lower margin environment. We're on track to realize our capital and non-capital improvement initiatives for this year, which we expect will add just under $200 million in EBITDA to this year's results. And our efforts to improve our cost structure are progressing as planned.
We'll discuss these and other initiatives and plans for 2011 and beyond at our Analyst Day event in December. I look forward to seeing many of you there.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott Spendlove, our CFO, for a more detailed discussion of our quarterly results and to provide guidance for the fourth quarter. Scott?"

As we reported last night for the third quarter, net income was $73 million or $0.51 per share before onetime after-tax expenses of $17 million or $0.12 per diluted share.

As we reported last night for the third quarter, net income was $73 million or $0.51 per share before onetime after-tax expenses of $17 million or $0.12 per diluted share. The majority of these onetime items reflect after-tax expenses related to maintenance and repair work at our Anacortes refinery. About half of these expenses are attributable to the incident itself and will be part of our insurance claims.
The other half reflects acceleration of inspection and maintenance work we had planned for the future and completed while the refinery was idled. You can see these charges reflected in higher manufacturing expenses in our Pacific Northwest region. 
Segment operating income was $178 million for the quarter, $201 million net of the special items, up significantly from the $137 million we reported for the quarter last year and driven by the margin and capture gains Greg described earlier.
Our manufacturing costs in the third quarter were $266 million, up $18 million from the second quarter of this year, driven primarily by the onetime cost I previously mentioned. Corporate and unallocated costs, net of depreciation, were $45 million for the quarter. Our guidance for the quarter was $37 million, reflecting expected reductions in overhead costs. What we realized in expenses was actually better than our guidance, but two additional non-cash charges took the final number to $45 million.
The first is a charge of $4 million relating to expenses incurred to sublease a portion of our corporate headquarters. The sublease will result in significant cash savings over the term of the lease but resulted in onetime charges in the period. The remaining amount of the difference relates to accruals for stock-based compensation. Our stock price gained nearly 14% during the period, leading to a higher accrual for stock-based compensation expense.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $339 million and had $827 million of availability on the revolving credit facility. Once again, we were undrawn on that facility during the quarter. At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-total cap was 37%.
Changing cash for the quarter was a build of $148 million, as EBITDA exceeded capital spending. Working capital was flat. We had no cash interest payments in the quarter, and we're currently not a cash taxpayer.
As Greg mentioned earlier, we spent $110 million on capital projects during the quarter. This was down from the second quarter because of less turnaround activities at our refineries. We have no additional planned turnaround work for the remainder of 2010. We continue to expect that capital spending, including turnarounds for 2010, will be in the $475 million to $500 million range.
Turning to the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is typically a weak gasoline demand period, with PADD V demand declining more than 4% on average versus the third quarter. Supply reductions have supported margins in PADD V during October, but they weaken during the first part of November. 
PADD V crude runs in October were 85,000 barrels a day or 4% lower relative to the same period last year, which was a record low. California gasoline production was down by more than 5%, relative to the same period last year.
And based on the latest Department of Energy data, PADD V gasoline inventories have declined to the five-year average unlike overall domestic markets, which remain above historical levels. This has led to relative margin strength on the West Coast in October where cracks have averaged just under $14 per barrel, down only slightly from September and well above the same period last year.
Additionally, the West Coast gasoline differentials to the NYMEX have averaged $0.15 per gallon, up $0.02 per gallon relative to both September and the same period last year.
So again, October was a good start to the fourth quarter, but we've seen a reduction in margins to this point in November. 
Let me close with guidance for the fourth quarter for your modeling purposes. We estimate throughput in thousands of barrels per day to be 100 to 110 in the Pacific Northwest, 65 to 75 in the Mid-Pacific, 110 to 120 in the MidCon and 230 to 240 in the California region.
OpEx guidance for the third quarter in dollars per barrel is as follows, $5.85 in the Pacific Northwest, $3.25 in the mid-Pacific, $3.25 in the MidCon and $7.55 per barrel in the California region. Our depreciation for refining is estimated at $92 million. Additional fourth quarter guidance items include corporate expense, excluding depreciation, of $36 million and interest expense before interest income of $42 million.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Greg for closing comments. Greg?"

It's actually the Consumer Advocate who provides an opinion to the Public Utilities Commission regarding the agreement that we have with HECO regarding the increase in price on the fuel oil.

And that has taken longer than we thought. I mean, part of it is that they are a politically appointed body and with the elections and that, we believe that there was probably some delay in taking action on that. So we expect that to happen very shortly. It's been a long process since we reached commercial agreements with HECO back at the very beginning part of the summer. So everything that we see so far, that should move forward there. What we're not certain of is when the amount of retro-activity that we will receive.

And we believe that all of our insurance policy will provide coverage for any potential claims that we have. And part of the way that the process works in the state of Washington with the labor and industry is that as they go through and everyone has seen publicly what the 44 citations that we received, 39 of them, which were considered by them to be willful valuations. It's the process that they you go through to basically categorize their assessment of the violations. And that's what, like I said in the call, that is one thing that we disagree with. And that's why we have filed an appeal to work with them basically on the characterization of those accusations. But at this point in time, we can't really comment on whether that has an impact one way or the other on any potential litigation that may come from that because they characterize them as willful work. We're very hopeful that we can go back and work through with the L&I to go back and look at all of those violations."

The purpose of that, there's three or four things that we're trying to do there. One of them is it allows us to supply, to source of crudes, South American crudes into our West Coast systems. So that when we see opportunities to acquire crudes that will fit into our system, that gives us some operational flexibility to do that. The second thing is because of the commitments that we have around the pipelines and the tankage, it allows us to -- when there are opportunities with the market structure, if we want to be able to store crudes, either for our own system, for future running or to resell in the marketplace to companies that we have commercial relationships, it allow us to do that. It allows us to manage the freight economics between the pipeline, as well as what other companies may do by go in and not using the pipeline.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call today. We are pleased to report third quarter earnings of $0.39 per diluted share or $0.51 per diluted share excluding onetime expenses of $0.12. The onetime expenses are mainly attributable to our maintenance work at the Anacortes refinery. These earnings were achieved with Anacortes idled and Hawaii at reduced rates for a plant turnaround as both industry spreads and our capture rates improved during the quarter.
 The Tesoro Index in the quarter was up 17% from the third quarter of last year. This improvement was driven by diesel spreads, which were up more than 50% over last year.
 Demand for the distillate barrel is up globally, and we see this reflected in diesel exports, much of which is going to Latin America. In our markets in particular, we continue to see an increase in West Coast seaport traffic, which, during the quarter, reached levels not seen since late 2007. West Coast gasoline spreads meanwhile continued to suffer from weak demand as unemployment in California remains high.
 Capture rates throughout our system were up significantly in the quarter, driven by strong clean product yields. Importantly, we were able to produce more diesel, allowing us to capture the stronger distillate margins.
 We also saw an improvement in our feedstock costs as we ran an overall heavier diet of crude oil and captured improved light heavy differentials, specifically from Canadians and South American heavy crudes. Retail marketing margins were also strong during the quarter. Spot prices for light products, which generally follow the price of crude oil, fell more rapidly than street prices. However, throughput rates during the quarter were down significantly from last year's third quarter, as we repaired the Anacortes refinery and successfully completed the plant turnaround of our Hawaii refinery during the quarter.
 As we reported in our press release, substantial progress has been made towards the restart of the Anacortes Washington refinery. Today, most of the refinery is operating, and we expect to be back to normal operations soon. In addition to completing repairs to the damaged units, we also accelerated extensive future inspection and maintenance work to take advantage of the plant downtime.
 We hired a well-respected engineering firm immediately after the incident to conduct a refinery-wide review of equipment, specifically targeting High Temperature Hydrogen Attack or HTHA, which is what we believe was a source of the April 2 accident at Anacortes.
 We also hired outside experts to conduct a review process of inspection records related to specific units in order to provide assurance that all of our processes are in accordance with standard industry practices, and they are.
 We inspected hundreds of vertical vessels and performed several thousand discrete examinations regarding appropriate alloy content of specific units. We replaced the heat exchangers on the naptha hydrotreater, with new units designed according to current industry standards. And then we also conducted inspections of units at all of our refineries that are in similar service.
 While we remain saddened by the human cost of the Anacortes accident, we continue to expect that the overall financial impact of this incident, even taking into account the allegations made by the Washington regulatory agency, will be limited to our insurance deductibles and that we have adequate insurance coverage for this event.
 As we've previously stated, our insurance deductibles are $10 million for property and $25 million for business interruption. In fact, as of this call, we have received $27 million in business interruption proceeds, net of the deductible for partial losses of income through June 30. We have filed additional business interruption and property damage claims, which we anticipate could be settled during the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2011. These are cash proceeds that will be reflected in higher net income.
 I can't stress enough how thankful we are towards Tesoro employees at the Anacortes facility and throughout the organization, as they worked so hard to make the necessary repairs and successfully and safely restart the refinery.
 Most of the investigations are now complete, and we are waiting the final results. The Chemical Safety Board has until April 2011 to issue the results of their investigation.
 We filed a notice of appeal to all citations and penalties in response to the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries on October 22. While we disagree with the characterization of the department's allegations, we are encouraged that we may be able to work with the department to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution to the citations.
 As we look forward from here, we still see economic challenges and the effect of a weaker economy on product demand and margins. We're also disappointed that California voted against Proposition 23 that would have deferred implementation of AB 32 until unemployment rates in California dropped below 5.5%.
 Regarding the potential costs of compliance with AB 32, we are not in a position to provide any details on the call today. Since the specifics of the regulations are being developed, it is premature to speculate on the impact at this point in time.
 We are currently in the process of digesting carbs recent draft of the Cap-and-Trade Regulation. I would say that if you combine their initial credit allocation with our recent energy efficiency projects and those currently underway, we believe reaching the mandate of threshold on stationary sources will be attainable.
 In summary, given these economic and regulatory challenges, we remain very focused on the things that we can do to improve our bottom line despite the lower margin environment. We're on track to realize our capital and non-capital improvement initiatives for this year, which we expect will add just under $200 million in EBITDA to this year's results. And our efforts to improve our cost structure are progressing as planned.
 We'll discuss these and other initiatives and plans for 2011 and beyond at our Analyst Day event in December. I look forward to seeing many of you there.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott Spendlove, our CFO, for a more detailed discussion of our quarterly results and to provide guidance for the fourth quarter. Scott?

As we reported last night for the third quarter, net income was $73 million or $0.51 per share before onetime after-tax expenses of $17 million or $0.12 per diluted share. The majority of these onetime items reflect after-tax expenses relat",773," Thanks, Greg. As we reported last night for the third quarter, net income was $73 million or $0.51 per share before onetime after-tax expenses of $17 million or $0.12 per diluted share. The majority of these onetime items reflect after-tax expenses related to maintenance and repair work at our Anacortes refinery. About half of these expenses are attributable to the incident itself and will be part of our insurance claims.
 The other half reflects acceleration of inspection and maintenance work plan for the future and completed while the refinery was idled. You can see these charges reflected in higher manufacturing expenses in our Pacific Northwest region.
 Segment operating income was $178 million for the quarter, $201 million net of the special items, up significantly from the $137 million we reported for the quarter last year and driven by the margin and capture gains Greg described earlier.
 Our manufacturing costs in the third quarter were $266 million, up $18 million from the second quarter of this year, driven primarily by the onetime cost I previously mentioned. Corporate and unallocated costs, net of depreciation, were $45 million for the quarter. Our guidance for the quarter was $37 million, reflecting expected reductions in overhead costs. What we realized in expenses was actually better than our guidance, but two additional non-cash charges took the final number to $45 million.
 The first is a charge of $4 million relating to expenses incurred to sublease a portion of our corporate headquarters. The sublease will result in significant cash savings over the term of the lease but resulted in onetime charges in the period. The remaining amount of the difference relates to accruals for stock-based compensation. Our stock price gained nearly 14% during the period, leading to a higher accrual for stock-based compensation expense.
 We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $339 million and had $827 million of availability on the revolving credit facility. Once again, we were undrawn on that facility during the quarter. At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-total cap was 37%.
 Changing cash for the quarter was a build of $148 million, as EBITDA exceeded capital spending. Working capital was flat. We had no cash interest payments in the quarter, and we're currently not a cash taxpayer.
 As Greg mentioned earlier, we spent $110 million on capital projects during the quarter. This was down from the second quarter because of less turnaround activities at our refineries. We have no additional plant turnaround work for the remainder of 2010. We continue to expect that capital spending, including turnarounds for 2010, will be in the $475 million to $500 million range.
 Turning to the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is typically a weak gasoline demand period, with PADD V demand declining more than 4% on average versus the third quarter. Supply reductions have supported margins in PADD V during October, but they weaken during the first part of November.
 PADD V crude runs in October were 85,000 barrels a day or 4% lower relative to the same period last year, which was a record low. California gasoline production was down by more than 5%, relative to the same period last year.
 And based on the latest Department of Energy data, PADD V gasoline inventories have declined to the five-year average unlike overall domestic markets, which remain above historical levels. This has led to relative margin strength in on West Coast in October where cracks have averaged just under $14 per barrel, down only slightly from September and well above the same period last year.
 Additionally, the West Coast gasoline differentials to the NYMEX have averaged $0.15 per gallon, up $0.02 per gallon relative to both September and the same period last year.
 So again, October was a good start to the fourth quarter, but we've seen a reduction in margins to this point in November.
 Let me close with guidance for the fourth quarter for your modeling purposes. We estimate throughput in thousand of barrels per day to be 100 to 110 in the Pacific Northwest, 65 to 75 in the Mid-Pacific, 110 to 120 in the MidCon and 230 to 240 in the California region.
 OpEx guidance for the third quarter in dollars per barrel is as follows, $5.85 in the Pacific Northwest, $3.25 in the mid-Pacific, $3.25 in the MidCon and $7.55 per barrel in the California region. Our depreciation for refining is estimated at $92 million. Additional fourth quarter guidance items include corporate expense, excluding depreciation, of $36 million and interest expense before interest income of $42 million.
 With that, I'll turn the call back over to Greg for closing comments. Greg?

It's actually the Consumer Advocate who provides an opinion to the Public Utilities Commission regarding the agreement that we have with HECO regarding the increase in  price on the fuel oil. And you're exactly right, sometime ago the Consumer Advocate provided their opinion to the Public Utilities Commission that they saw no disagreement with what had been negotiated between ourself and HECO and therefore gave their support to the Public Utilities Commission, which they'll need to take action on the increase for the fuel oil. And that has taken longer than we thought. I mean, part of it is that they are a politically appointed body and with the elections and that, we believe that there was probably some delay in taking action on that. But we expect that to happen very shortly. It's been a long process since we reached commercial agreements with HECO back at the very beginning part of the summer. So everything that we see so far, that should move forward there. What we're not certain of is when the amount of retro-activity that we will receive.

And in April of this year, as I think we mentioned earlier, that contract came into effect so that we have commitments to move a certain amount of volume across the pipeline and access to the tankage. The purpose of that, there's three or four things that we're trying to do there. One of the them is it allows us to supply, to source of crudes, South American crudes into our West Coast systems. So that when we see opportunities to acquire crudes that will fit into our system, that gives us some operational flexibility to do that. The second thing is because of the commitments that we have around the pipelines and the tankage, it allows us to -- when there are opportunities with the market structure, if we want to be able to store crudes, either for our own system, for future running or to resell in the marketplace to companies that we have commercial relationships, it allow us to do that. It allows us to manage the freight economics between the pipeline, as well as what other companies may do by go in and not using the pipeline. It allows us to go in and take advantage of blending opportunities. So the whole purpose is really, to take commercially position ourselves from a crude supply standpoint as well as other commercial opportunities to move primarily South American crudes.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call today. As everyone knows, I joined Tesoro about three months ago. The first three months had been challenging and exciting, and we have embarked on a very focused and ambitious agenda to drive fundamental improvement in the business. Later in the call today, I will talk a little bit about some of those key initiatives. And then during the fourth quarter of this year, we will also provide a very compelling plan to deliver shareholder value during our Analyst Meeting. 
Today, we are pleased to report second quarter earnings of $0.47 per share or $0.30 per diluted share for one-time benefits of $0.17. These earnings were achieved with the Anacortes refinery idled and the Mandan refinery down for plant turnaround as industry spreads improved significantly during the quarter, and our capture rates also improved. 
The Tesoro Index in the quarter was nearly double what we saw in the first quarter, and it was up about 15% from the second quarter of last year. We saw positive signs of economic recovery during the quarter, specifically on the West Coast port traffic and rail activity, which we believe supported higher diesel margins. Gasoline spreads, meanwhile, continue to suffer from weak demand as unemployment in California remains high.
Capture rates throughout our system were up significantly in the quarter, driven by three or four key things: one, strong commercial and wholesale margins; two, improved crude differentials; three, an ethanol discount to gasoline of about $0.55 per gallon, which improved the margin on ethanol-blended gasoline; and finally, as a result of the shutdown of the Anacortes refinery, we were still able to profitably meet our customer requirements in the Pacific Northwest.
Retail marketing margins were also strong during the quarter, as spot prices fell more rapidly than street prices. And of course, our throughput rates during the quarter were down significantly from last year's second quarter as we idled the Anacortes refinery following the fire on the naptha hydrotreater. Additionally, our Mandan refinery successfully completed its full-plant turnaround during the quarter. It's probably important to note about the Mandan refinery is it's on about a 6.5 year-plus turnaround cycle.
Anacortes remains idled today, but we have begun work to repair the damaged units. That work is progressing well and on schedule, and we expect the plant should be operational as early as September. Meanwhile, we continue to work closely with the investigators regarding the incident.
We have successfully moved unfinished products produced at Anacortes during April to our other refineries for further processing. Additionally, we were able to divert water-borne crude cargoes heading to Anacortes to our California refineries, and we continue to successfully supply our customers with products either sourced from our Tesoro refineries or third-party purchases. Regarding Anacortes, it is also important to note that we expect the financial impact of this incident to be limited to our insurance deductibles. 
And finally, I can't stress enough how thankful we are to our employees at the Anacortes facility. They worked admirably to get us through this terrible tragedy. 
Despite the improvement in margins and earnings during the quarter, we remain focused on our core objective of driving operations excellence and capital discipline. And while we have seen some signs of economic improvement, high unemployment in California and excess refining capacity in the U.S. still weigh on margins. And generally, we continue to plan for a margin environment similar to what we saw in 2009.
As such, we remain focused on operating our assets safely and reliably, optimizing the system and allowing local demand to be the primary driver of production and yield. We remain focused on maximizing cash flows and delivering the expected results from our capital and non-capital initiatives.
As we announced in our press release, our capital spending, including turnarounds in the second quarter, was about $140 million, and our estimate for this year is now in the range of $475 million to $500 million. We also expect future capital spending to be lower than guidance previously given. We remain committed to investing in safety, reliability, environmental protection and to our quick-hit capital program announced last fall. However, we continue to look for and find ways to capture advantages and lower our overall capital spending.
Examples of where we've been able to reduce our capital spending requirements while still achieving the objectives of the necessary work include NOx reductions at our Los Angeles refinery and benzene reductions across our whole refining system. As was mentioned on the first quarter call, we originally expected to comply with NOx reductions requirements through significant investments in a cogeneration facility and boiler replacements. We have since discovered that we will be able to meet our requirements through more efficient investments and the purchase of perpetual credits. This has significantly changed the scope of the multi-year projects that originally totaled about $315 million.
Similarly, we continue to assess our plans for benzene compliance and have reduced our expected spend by about $15 million and have found ways to push the spending out through 2013, which is about a year longer than we previously expected. We will be completing our annual capital planning process in the fall and expect to revise our guidance for 2011 and beyond at that point. 
From an income capital perspective, we continue to execute our quick-hit capital program. We are on track to spend about $50 million to $60 million in 2010, and we expect to realize a total of $25 million in related EBITDA this year. Also, we continue to make very good progress on our $165 million non-capital initiatives for this year and having realized about half of that target improvements year-to-date.
To further strengthen our competitive position, we announced yesterday changes to our corporate overhead and benefit plans that, when fully implemented by the end of this year, will have a significant impact on our expenses, cash flow and future liabilities. These changes to our corporate overhead include a reduction in force and other overhead efficiency improvements that we expect to reduce total overhead costs by $40 million to $50 million annually. 
In addition, we concluded a study of our benefits programs during the quarter and made changes that we expect will reduce our ongoing benefit expenses by $80 million to $90 million annually. The changes are primarily to post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits that bring us more in line with our peers and reduce the estimated post-retirement benefit liabilities on our balance sheet. The change to the post-retirement life benefits allow us to record a pretax gain of $43 million, net of severance accrual during the quarter. And because our savings are mostly related to accruals of future obligations, the cash savings start out small in the $5 million to $10 million range, but then they grow at an estimated $25 million annually in about 10 years.
As significant as the P&L and cash savings are is the reduction in estimated post-retirement benefit obligations on our balance sheet. In round numbers, these changes will reduce both liabilities from a projected $900 million at the end of this year to just under $600 million. And where that liability was projected to grow to nearly $1.2 billion by 2014, we're now projecting that liability to stay relatively constant at about $600 million, so at about 50% of the level it would have grown to. 
Finally, let me update you on the status of our actions to improve the pricing for the fuel oil that we supply to Hawaii Electric. As was mentioned last quarter, Tesoro and Hawaii Electric Public Utility reached an agreement on a new pricing formula related to low sulfur fuel oil sales. We are still awaiting approval from the Hawaiian Public Utility Commission (sic) [Hawaiian Public Utilities Commission]. However, based on HECO findings with the PUC, a ruling is expected sometime in the fourth quarter. At this point, we prefer not to provide any financial guidance related to the new pricing formula until we have the final approval through the PUC. 
Today, we believe we have the right assets in the right markets, and we see significant opportunity to strengthen our competitive position by improving our cost structure and driving improvements with our capital and non-capital initiatives. We also continue to believe that structurally, the West Coast is one of the most attractive markets and offer some advantages that we like. Having said that, we have initiated a comprehensive strategic review of our business. And as I talked about earlier, we plan to discuss our strategic plans at the fall Analyst Day event. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott Spendlove, our CFO, for a more detailed discussion of our quarterly results and to provide guidance for the third quarter. And then at the end, I'll come back and provide some concluding comments. Scott?"

These results include one-time after-tax benefits of $24 million or $0.17 per diluted share. There are three primary items that account for these adjustments. Greg already mentioned the $43 million net that's primarily related to our post-retirement benefit changes. After tax, these net benefits, the changes is a $26 million credit earnings.
Also in the quarter, there were one-time after-tax charges of $7 million related to expense accruals and asset write-offs at our Anacortes refinery. Finally, we took an after-tax benefit of $5 million related to a state tax settlement, arising from exploration and production activities of Tesoro over 15 years ago. Adjusted for special items, that leaves us with net income of $43 million or $0.30 per diluted share. 
Segment operating income was $180 million for the quarter, $153 million net of the special items, up significantly from the $11 million we reported for the quarter last year and driven by the margin gains Greg described earlier. Our manufacturing costs in the second quarter were $248 million, in line with the first quarter of this year.
We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $191 million and had $713 million of availability on the revolving credit facility. Once again, we were undrawn on that facility during the quarter. At the end the quarter, our total debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 37%.
Year-to-date, cash is down over $200 million as CapEx, changes in working capital and interest payments outpaced EBITDA and tax refunds. As Greg mentioned earlier, we spent $140 million in capital expenditures during the quarter. This was up from the first quarter, primarily due to the full-plant turnaround at our Mandan refinery. Looking forward to the remainder of 2010, the only material turnaround work we have is currently underway at our Hawaii refinery.
Turning to the quarter, we see gasoline demand on the West Coast remaining stagnant, as California unemployment remains at its peak of around 12.5%, some 3% above the national average. Supply changes, however, are balancing low demand with crude runs, gasoline production and gasoline inventories all close to their five-year lows in July. As a result, so far in July, the West Coast crack is up more than $3 per barrel over July of last year, and the gasoline difference to the Gulf Coast is close to its five-year high for the month at over $0.25 per gallon. 
I'll close with providing guidance for the third quarter for your modeling purposes. In these assumptions, we have assumed the Anacortes refinery remains idle during the month of July and August, with a restart currently expected for September. We estimate throughput in thousands of barrels per day to be 75 to 85 in the Pacific Northwest, 55 to 65 in the Mid-Pacific, 110 to 120 in the Mid-Continent and 240 to 250 in the California region. 
OpEx guidance for the third quarter in dollars per barrel is as follows: 745 in the Pacific Northwest, 375 in the Mid-Pacific, 330 in the Mid-Continent and 710 in the California region. Our depreciation for refining is estimated at $95 million. An additional second quarter guidance items include corporate expense of $37 million, which includes the savings expected from recent changes to our corporate overhead structure and interest expense before interest income of $40 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Greg for closing comments. Greg?"

We are pleased to report third quarter earnings of $0.39 per diluted share or $0.51 per diluted share excluding onetime expenses of $0.12. The onetime expenses are mainly",1029,"Thanks, Louie. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call today. We are pleased to report third quarter earnings of $0.39 per diluted share or $0.51 per diluted share excluding onetime expenses of $0.12. The onetime expenses are mainly attributable to our maintenance work at the Anacortes refinery. These earnings were achieved with Anacortes idled and Hawaii at reduced rates for a plant turnaround as both industry spreads and our capture rates improved during the quarter. 
The Tesoro Index in the quarter was up 17% from the third quarter of last year. This improvement was driven by diesel spreads, which were up more than 50% over last year. 
Demand for the distillate barrel is up globally, and we see this reflected in distillate exports, much of which is going to Latin America. In our markets in particular, we continue to see an increase in West Coast seaport traffic, which, during the quarter, reached levels not seen since late 2007. West Coast gasoline spreads meanwhile continued to suffer from weak demand as unemployment in California remains high. 
Capture rates throughout our system were up significantly in the quarter, driven by strong clean product yields. Importantly, we were able to produce more diesel, allowing us to capture the stronger distillate margins.
We also saw an improvement in our feedstock costs as we ran an overall heavier diet of crude oil and captured improved light heavy differentials, specifically from Canadians and South American heavy crudes. Retail marketing margins were also strong during the quarter. Spot prices for light products, which generally follow the price of crude oil, fell more rapidly than street prices. However, throughput rates during the quarter were down significantly from last year's third quarter, as we repaired the Anacortes refinery and successfully completed the plant turnaround of our Hawaii refinery during the quarter.
As we reported in our press release, substantial progress has been made towards the restart of the Anacortes Washington refinery. Today, most of the refinery is operating, and we expect to be back to normal operations soon. In addition to completing repairs to the damaged units, we also accelerated extensive future inspection and maintenance work to take advantage of the plant’s downtime.
We hired a well-respected engineering firm immediately after the incident to conduct a refinery-wide review of equipment, specifically targeting High Temperature Hydrogen Attack or HTHA, which is what we believe was a source of the April 2 accident at Anacortes.
We also hired outside experts to conduct a review process of inspection records related to specific units in order to provide assurance that all of our processes are in accordance with standard industry practices, and they are.
We inspected hundreds of vertical vessels and performed several thousand discrete examinations regarding appropriate alloy content of specific units. We replaced the heat exchangers on the naptha hydrotreater, with new units designed according to current industry standards. And then we also conducted inspections of units at all of our refineries that are in similar service.
While we remain saddened by the human cost of the Anacortes accident, we continue to expect that the overall financial impact of this incident, even taking into account the allegations made by the Washington regulatory agency, will be limited to our insurance deductibles and that we have adequate insurance coverage for this event.
As we've previously stated, our insurance deductibles are $10 million for property and $25 million for business interruption. In fact, as of this call, we have received $27 million in business interruption proceeds, net of the deductible for partial losses of income through June 30. We have filed additional business interruption and property damage claims, which we anticipate could be settled during the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2011. These are cash proceeds that will be reflected in higher net income.
I can't stress enough how thankful we are to our Tesoro employees at the Anacortes facility and throughout the organization, as they worked so hard to make the necessary repairs and successfully and safely restart the refinery. 
Most of the investigations are now complete, and we are waiting the final results. The Chemical Safety Board has until April 2011 to issue the results of their investigation.
We filed a notice of appeal to all citations and penalties in response to the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries on October 22. While we disagree with the characterization of the department's allegations, we are encouraged that we may be able to work with the department to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution to the citations.
As we look forward from here, we still see economic challenges and the effect of a weaker economy on product demand and margins. We're also disappointed that Californians voted against Proposition 23 that would have deferred implementation of AB 32 until unemployment rates in California dropped below 5.5%. 
Regarding the potential costs of compliance with AB 32, we are not in a position to provide any details on the call today. Since the specifics of the regulations are being developed, it is premature to speculate on the impact at this point in time.
We are currently in the process of digesting CARB’s recent draft of the Cap-and-Trade Regulation. I would say that if you combine their initial emission credit allocation with our recent energy efficiency projects and those currently underway, we believe reaching the mandated of thresholds on stationary sources will be attainable.
In summary, given these economic and regulatory challenges, we remain very focused on the things that we can do to improve our bottom line despite the lower margin environment. We're on track to realize our capital and non-capital improvement initiatives for this year, which we expect will add just under $200 million in EBITDA to this year's results. And our efforts to improve our cost structure are progressing as planned.
We'll discuss these and other initiatives and plans for 2011 and beyond at our Analyst Day event in December. I look forward to seeing many of you there.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott Spendlove, our CFO, for a more detailed discussion of our quarterly results and to provide guidance for the fourth quarter. Scott?"

As we reported last night for the third quarter, net income was $73 million or $0.51 per share before onetime after-tax expenses of $17 million or $0.12 per diluted share. The majority of these onetime items reflect after-tax expenses related to maintenance and repair work at our Anacortes refinery. About half of these expenses are attributable to the incident itself and will be part of our insurance claims.
The other half reflects acceleration of inspection and maintenance work we had planned for the future and completed while the refinery was idled. You can see these charges reflected in higher manufacturing expenses in our Pacific Northwest region. 
Segment operating income was $178 million for the quarter, $201 million net of the special items, up significantly from the $137 million we reported for the quarter last year and driven by the margin and capture gains Greg described earlier.
Our manufacturing costs in the third quarter were $266 million, up $18 million from the second quarter of this year, driven primarily by the onetime cost I previously mentioned. Corporate and unallocated costs, net of depreciation, were $45 million for the quarter. Our guidance for the quarter was $37 million, reflecting expected reductions in overhead costs. What we realized in expenses was actually better than our guidance, but two additional non-cash charges took the final number to $45 million.
The first is a charge of $4 million relating to expenses incurred to sublease a portion of our corporate headquarters. The sublease will result in significant cash savings over the term of the lease but resulted in onetime charges in the period. The remaining amount of the difference relates to accruals for stock-based compensation. Our stock price gained nearly 14% during the period, leading to a higher accrual for stock-based compensation expense.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $339 million and had $827 million of availability on the revolving credit facility. Once again, we were undrawn on that facility during the quarter. At the end of the quarter, our debt-to-total cap was 37%.
Changing cash for the quarter was a build of $148 million, as EBITDA exceeded capital spending. Working capital was flat. We had no cash interest payments in the quarter, and we're currently not a cash taxpayer.
As Greg mentioned earlier, we spent $110 million on capital projects during the quarter. This was down from the second quarter because of less turnaround activities at our refineries. We have no additional planned turnaround work for the remainder of 2010. We continue to expect that capital spending, including turnarounds for 2010, will be in the $475 million to $500 million range.
Turning to the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is typically a weak gasoline demand period, with PADD V demand declining more than 4% on average versus the third quarter. Supply reductions have supported margins in PADD V during October, but they weaken during the first part of November. 
PADD V crude runs in October were 85,000 barrels a day or 4% lower relative to the same period last year, which was a record low. California gasoline production was down by more than 5%, relative to the same period last year.
And based on the latest Department of Energy data, PADD V gasoline inventories have declined to the five-year average unlike overall domestic markets, which remain above historical levels. This has led to relative margin strength on the West Coast in October where cracks have averaged just under $14 per barrel, down only slightly from September and well above the same period last year.
Additionally, the West Coast gasoline differentials to the NYMEX have averaged $0.15 per gallon, up $0.02 per gallon relative to both September and the same period last year.
So again, October was a good start to the fourth quarter, but we've seen a reduction in margins to this point in November. 
Let me close with guidance for the fourth quarter for your modeling purposes. We estimate throughput in thousands of barrels per day to be 100 to 110 in the Pacific Northwest, 65 to 75 in the Mid-Pacific, 110 to 120 in the MidCon and 230 to 240 in the California region.
OpEx guidance for the third quarter in dollars per barrel is as follows, $5.85 in the Pacific Northwest, $3.25 in the mid-Pacific, $3.25 in the MidCon and $7.55 per barrel in the California region. Our depreciation for refining is estimated at $92 million. Additional fourth quarter guidance items include corporate expense, excluding depreciation, of $36 million and interest expense before interest income of $42 million.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Greg for closing comments. Greg?"

And that has taken longer than we thought. I mean, part of it is that they are a politically appointed body and with the elections and that, we believe that there was probably some delay in taking action on that. So we expect that to happen very shortly. It's been a long process since we reached commercial agreements with HECO back at the very beginning part of the summer.

It's the process that they you go through to basically categorize their assessment of the violations. And that's what, like I said in the call, that is one thing that we disagree with. And that's why we have filed an appeal to work with them basically on the characterization of those accusations. But at this point in time, we can't really comment on whether that has an impact one way or the other on any potential litigation that may come from that because they characterize them as willful work.

And in April of this year, as I think we mentioned earlier, that contract came into effect so that we have commitments to move a certain amount of volume across the pipeline and access to the tankage. The purpose of that, there's three or four things that we're trying to do there. One of them is it allows us to supply, to source of crudes, South American crudes into our West Coast systems. So that when we see opportunities to acquire crudes that will fit into our system, that gives us some operational flexibility to do that. The second thing is because of the commitments that we have around the pipelines and the tankage, it allows us to -- when there are opportunities with the market structure, if we want to be able to store crudes, either for our own system, for future running or to resell in the marketplace to companies that we have commercial relationships, it allow us to do that. It allows us to manage the freight economics between the pipeline, as well as what other companies may do by go in and not using the pipeline. It allows us to go in and take advantage of blending opportunities. So the whole purpose is really, to take commercially position ourselves from a crude supply standpoint as well as other commercial opportunities to move primarily South American crudes."
