I'll begin with comments about our business performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, then Gordon will provide more insights and the financial results for the quarter and I'll",1802,"Thanks, Joyce. And I'd like to welcome everyone on this call as well. I'll begin with comments about our business performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, then Gordon will provide more insights and the financial results for the quarter and I'll wrap up with our outlook for further growth in 2010.Due to the seasonality of our business at McCormick, the fourth quarter of the fiscal year is historically a big part of our annual profit results and an even larger part of our cash flow. The most recent fourth quarter was no exception. Strong financial results led to a record year in profit and cash flow for 2009. Taking a look at Slide 4, on a comparable basis with the fourth quarter of 2008, we grew earnings per share 8%, sales growth and margin improvement were key drivers. This year, we had our largest holiday marketing program ever in support of our seasonal items, including spices, herbs, gravies and holiday essentials here in the United States. We also increased marketing this quarter behind our consumer favorites such as Vahiné dessert items in France and behind new products, such as honey jams in China. While we grew Consumer sales 4% in the fourth quarter, sales in our Industrial business continued to be hampered by moderation in new product innovation by food manufacturers and continued pressure on the food service industry. We were pleased to deliver another quarter of increased operating income for our Industrial business, which was up 6% on a comparable basis excluding restructuring charges and unusual items. On the same basis, we increased operating income for our Consumer business 12%. These results were driven largely by progress with CCI, our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program. Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was particularly strong, exceeding our expectations with further achievements and working capital management.Turning to results for fiscal year 2009 and Slide 5, excluding restructuring charges, we achieved earnings of $2.35 per share and reached a record $416 million in cash flow from operations. We were particularly pleased with the cash results, since this was well in excess of the previous high of $342 million. Excluding restructuring charges and unusual items, earnings per share of $2.35 was a 10% increase from the prior year and above our latest guidance of 8% to 9%. This was our fourth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth on a comparable basis. With 100-basis-point improvement in gross profit margin, we surpassed our 50-basis-point goal for the year. Another area of excellent achievement was in cost reductions, which totaled $42 million for the year, 40% ahead of our initial 2000 goal, and we reduced our cash conversion cycle by five days at the top-end of our three-to-five-day target. This is a total reduction of 10 days since 2007, bringing our cash conversion cycle down by more than 10%.Now let's talk about sales growth, which is the one area that came in below our expectations. We grew sales 5% in local currency. This increase was mainly due to incremental sales from Lawry's, which we're right on target. However, the sales growth in our base business lagged our expectations, hampered by the impact of the economy on our customers and consumers. In 2009, food retailers faced heightened competition and an economically constrained consumer. Certain retailers responded by placing more emphasis on their private label products during the year while others, including dollar stores and hard discounters, chose to expand their branded offerings. The net effect of these actions was some share loss of our spices and herbs products to private label during 2009. However, we were able to grow sales of our branded spices and seasonings at retail with our marketing support and new product innovations.  As seen the Slide 6, based on retail scanner data, consumer purchases of our products were up in each of our four largest geographic markets in 2009. Inventory reductions by food retailers also impacted sales growth in our major markets. During 2009 the growth in consumer purchases at retail exceeded the growth rate for our net sales of spices and seasonings as shown on Slide 7. Likewise, our Industrial customers were affected by tough economy in 2009. While we had some great new product winds early in the year, and success in lowering cost for this part of our business, sales to Industrial customers had slowed by the fourth quarter. Among our Industrial customer groups, quick-service restaurants fared relatively well and our sales to this channel was the best performing part of our Industrial business in 2009. This performance was lagged by sales to food service distributors which serve higher-end restaurants and institutions. We also had a disruption from the bankruptcy of our U.K. distributor.As for food manufacturers, 2009 was a year when many of these customers focused on core items, with limited activity behind innovation and a fair amount of SKU reduction. At this time, we are encouraged by an increased in activity in 2010 and our innovation pipeline. We continue to have strong win rates on new products. For both Consumer and Industrial businesses, 2009 marked the period of further volatility and in both input cost and currency. Our sourcing teams worked to minimize the profit impact of higher cost and our pricing actions provided an effective offset, which accounted for about 4% of sales growth for the year. However, the stronger dollar was a real headwind to our reported sales growth in 2009 reducing sales by 5% for the year. By the fourth quarter, the impact of currency was neutral and at today's exchange rates should provide a bit of a tailwind in the first half of 2010.With changes underway by our customers, costs and currency volatility and consumers still under pressure, our business leaders were agile in addressing these challenges and pursuing opportunities for growth. We also stayed focused on several key initiatives. Job number one in 2009 was a seamless integration of Lawry's. Looking back on the work of our team, this has been one of our most effective integration efforts. Our new marketing campaign has been underway for more than six months now and I'm encouraged by the year-on-year growth achieved in the fourth quarter with unit sales up 8%. Based on results to date for sales, profit and cash, this has been a very successful acquisition at McCormick. In 2009, we increased our brand marketing support by $20 million and our spending is now up more than 50% in the last five years. During this year, we optimized the spending by adapting the current market conditions. To address the actions of various retailers behind the assortment of brand and private label in our core categories, we worked directly and diligently with many major retailers to optimize product mix, pricing and promotion for both brand and private labels.In addition to emphasize the value of our brands, we directed a portion of our promotion and advertising to coupons and feature prices in both the U.S. and certain international markets. Consumers have responded with our coupon redemption rates up more than 50% in the U.S. and branded sales growth in most major markets as I showed earlier. Doing part of more online advertising, traffic to our U.S. website exceeded 200 million visits last year. Following the relaunch of our UK Schwartz site, an increase in advertising search activity hit rates in October and November doubled versus the previous year. These consumers are actually spending an average of about seven minutes of each visit. On Slide 12, a portion of our marketing supported many of our consumer favorites and grew up sales. Our revitalized McCormick brand dry seasoning mixes grew 6% in the U.S, outpacing the increase in private label. Grill Mates sales were up 20%. In Australia, higher sales of slow cooker seasonings led to 3.5% share gain in the Recipe Mix category and Aeroplane gelatin sales rose 14%.Our promotion and advertising also featured some of our newer items such as Lawry's reduced sodium seasoning, honey jams in China and Schwartz flavorful products in the UK. Pâtissierie Vahiné in France is an extension of our leading brand of dessert items to a range of cake mixes. In just over a year, we've gained a 6% share of the Cake Mix category in France with these new items and our marketing campaign. Together with our marketing efforts, innovation helped drive category growth in our four largest markets that's shown in units on Slide 14. New product wins on the industrial side of our business, including condiments, as well as seasonings for chicken and seasonings for snacks.In 2009, we continued to expand the geographic footprint for the McCormick brand in China. And in the last two years have doubled the number of major cities where consumers can purchase our products. During this period, we also gained new distribution with value-priced retailers in the U.S., Canada and France. Another key initiative behind our success was cost reduction. Our process reliability program, coupled with the McCormick high-performance work system have unleashed capacity in all of our major locations. We have successfully completed our restructuring program which began in late 2005. This initiative has enabled us to reduce the number of major facilities by 26% and increased our sales per facility by 66%.In 2009, we also made great progress with CCI and it's illustrated on Slide 16. Employees in all parts of the business contributed to the substantial cost reductions achieved. In addition, we have made impressive results from a sustainability standpoint. Our largest production facility in the U.K. was named Sustainable Manufacturer of the Year by a leading manufacturing publication, in recognition of a 14% reduction in electricity usage and a 48% increase in recycling. A new recycling unit in our Atlanta, Georgia plant contributed to a 43% solid waste reduction for this facility. Across all major facilities, we've reduced greenhouse gases by 24%, water usage by 19% and electricity usage by 14% since 2005.  While the 2009 profit results of our unconsolidated income declined in U.S. dollars, we have impressive results from our largest and long-standing joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, which grew sales 19% in local currency. As a sign of the consistent and steady performance at McCormick, the Board approved in November an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend. This marked the 24th consecutive year of increases in our shareholder dividends. I hope that these latest achievements in our 2009 financial results give you a sense of the talent and energy of our employees. We have a wonderful culture and high-employee engagement and we were pleased to be named just last week, the Fortune Magazine's 100 Best Companies to Work For list. Before discussing our outlook for 2010, Gordon is going to provide you with some further insights into our fourth quarter financial results and business performance."

As previously stated, our fourth quarter results were a strong finish to the year. On a comparable basis, fourth quarter earnings per share rose 8%, with an underlying increase in each of our two segments. On this same basis, we achieved the double-digit increase in Consumer business' operating income, which rose 12%, including the impact of higher brand marketing support and a solid 6% increase in industrial operating income. Just as we had for the full year, we saw areas of both strength and weakness in the quarter for our two segments. For the Consumer business, we increased the operating income $17 million on a comparable basis. This includes a $5 million increase in marketing support for the quarter, which totaled $6 million for both business segments. We grew operating income with sales growth and cost savings from CCI, as well as with a favorable business mix. Keep in mind that we closed the acquisition of Lawry's in the third quarter of 2008 and there is no incremental impact on this acquisition in fourth quarter results.For the total Consumer segment on Slide 23, sales rose 4% in the fourth quarter, with pricing up 3% and a 1% benefit from foreign currency exchange rates. As a reminder, our pricing actions in the Consumer business occurred late in 2008 and early in 2009 in order to offset higher costs. At this time, the impact of pricing actions for our Consumer business in 2010 are expected to be minimal. For Consumer sales in the Americas, the increase was 5%, with 2/3 from pricing and 1/3 from volume and product mix. This quarter, our largest unit increases in the U.S, for dry seasoning mixes, up 5%; Lawry's items, up 8%; McCormick-branded spices and herbs, up 5%; and grilling products, up 16%, evidence that grilling has truly become a year-round event.Sales for each of these product lines was driven by greater marketing support, which included television, print, Internet and coupons. Offsetting some of the strengths were declines in unit sales of our gourmet line. For our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, EMEA, we reported a 1% increase in Consumer sales. However in local currency, sales were down 2%. A 2% benefit from pricing was more than offset by lower volume and product mix.Through the fourth quarter, our business in France continued to be of benefit from healthy category growth for our Ducros spices and seasonings, as well as our growth initiatives behind Vahiné dessert items. However, the retail environment in the U.K. continues to be challenging and affected our fourth quarter sales in this market. In the Asia Pacific region, we reported a 15% increase in Consumer sales. In local currency, the increase was 7%, with higher volume and product mix, the primary driver. In China, our geographic expansion in new product activity, as well as a portion of our incremental marketing, led to this increase. Let's turn to the Industrial business. We increased fourth quarter operating income 6% on a comparable basis. In the quarter where segment sales declined, this profit increased as evidence of our effectiveness, CCI-driven savings and careful cost management. Also, the majority of new products added to our portfolio in 2009 are accretive to the overall margins. Across all regions, Industrial sales declined 2% and were down 1% in local currency. Pricing actions to reflect input cost changes added 2% of sales, while volume and product mix were unfavorable. In the Americas, Industrial sales were down 4% and down 2% in local currency. This is a reversal from the performance in earlier quarters during 2009. We continued to benefit from new product activity with quick-service restaurants but saw a lower demand from food manufacturers during this period. Our relationships with these strategic partners remain strong and they remain committed to McCormick as a supplier.In EMEA, we achieved sales growth with Industrial customers through the end of 2009. Sales were up 2% and up 6% in local currency, primarily as a result of the pass-through pricing for higher costs. In the Asia Pacific region, we saw a slowdown in demand from the restaurant customers during this period. Industrial sales in the fourth quarter were down 2% and down 6% in local currency as a result of unfavorable volume and product mix. In China, our customers have focused on core menu items in recent months and their pace of innovation slowed in the fourth quarter.Let's look at how this adds up to the total business. Sales rose 2%, primarily as a result of higher pricing, with the pluses and minuses of volume and product mix across our segments and regions having a minimal impact on this quarter's sale. Gross profit this quarter rose 190 basis points to a seasonally strong 45.6%, due in part to our move toward a more favorable business mix. Our margin improvement is also being driven by CCI, as well as our restructuring actions and discretionary cost controls throughout our operations.Turning to Slide 29, SG&A in the fourth quarter of 2009 was 25.8% of net sales, an increase of 30 basis points. A $6 million increase in brand marketing added 60 basis points. This increase was offset in part by our progress with CCI and cost controls, as well as lower distribution costs and favorable benefit expenses. Operating income reached $178 million. On a comparable basis, excluding restructuring charges, we increased operating income 11% in the fourth quarter versus the year-ago period.Our tax rate for the quarter at 33.6% brought our fiscal year rate to 31.9%, which reflected our mix of business. We expect our tax rate in 2010 to also be close to 32%. Today's 67% increase, income from unconsolidated operations this quarter showed a dramatic turnaround from the year-to-date declines we had been reporting. As Alan shared, our joint venture in Mexico has had strong sales all year. In the fourth quarter, with the weaker U.S. dollar and lower soybean oil cost, we saw a significant profit growth from this business. We are looking for further gains in 2010 and expect to reach or exceed the level of profitability reported in 2008.If you look at the bottom line, shows fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.87 compared to $0.62 last year. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded restructuring charges and an impairment charge that had lowered EPS by $0.22. In 2009, restructuring charges lowered EPS by $0.04. Excluding these items, EPS increased 8% or $0.07 to $0.91 from $0.84 in the prior year. Higher operating income added $0.10 per share. Lower net interest expense added $0.01 and the income from unconsolidated operations added $0.02, offset in part by $0.06 from an increased tax rate.Before turning I turn it back over to Alan, I'll comment briefly on the balance sheet and cash flow and refer you to Slide 32. Beginning in 2008, we began to reward our business leaders, not only for strong operating income performance but also for their management of working capital. In our second year at McCormick Profit, we are growing both profit and cash. With a further improvement in the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations reached $416 million, an increase of $101 million from 2008. This increase has been driven by higher net income, including the positive impact of Lawry's, as well as effective working capital management. Alan shared with you already our continued progress in compressing our cash conversion cycle which now stands at just above 80 days. Keep in mind that our cash flow from operations includes an increase in pension contributions. In 2009, we contributed $72 million versus $19 million in 2008. This brought our funded level for the primary U.S. pension plan back above 90%, based on the accumulated benefit obligation liability. At this time, we anticipate contributions in 2010 of approximately $45 million. About half of this amount was funded in early December. As we discussed last quarter, 2010 pension expense is expected to increase substantially, due primarily to changes in the actuarial assumptions, primarily the discount rate. We now expect pension expense to be approximately $27 million in 2010, compared to $13 million in 2009. The increase from 2009 to 2010 is expected to reduce EPS by $0.07, approximately 3%. Note that our cash flow will benefit from the lower expected contributions and that the increase in pension expense is a non-cash item. I'll conclude my comments on the balance sheet and cash flow by pointing to our great progress with debt reduction. As you know, our primary use of cash during 2009 has been the reduction of debt from the Lawry's acquisition. This focus approach in strong cash generation has allowed us to reduce our debt by $252 million during 2009. Our priorities for uses of cash, as we head into 2010, will be to reduce debt and fund potential acquisitions, as well as fund dividend payments in an estimated $100 million in capital expenditures. In a few minutes, I'll look forward to discussing your questions. But I first want to turn it back over to Alan."

We're excited about our prospects for growth in 2010. While we expect our customers, both Consumer and Industrial customers, to be operating under continued pressure during a gradual economic recovery, we are seeing more appetite for innovation. There's some clear path platforms for growth in our business around health and wellness, convenience, authentic ethnic flavors and value. In 2010, these platforms direct our product innovation for both Consumer and Industrial businesses, as well as our marketing support. As we stated earlier, we have high win rates with our Industrial customers and an innovation pipeline that includes new products for food manufacturers in the food service channel. As discussed in our last call, the new product line up for our U.S. Consumer business, includes Perfect Pinch and Recipe Inspirations, which both did very well in test markets during 2009. We've received some early support for Recipe Inspirations from consumer trends experts, Phil Lempert, who discovered this product and has included it in his food industry remarks in ABC, Supermarket Guru, The View, and more recently on the Today Show. He commented, ""This is going to pave the way for other similar concepts that will expand our palate."" We've had an unprecedented reaction from our customers with 14 key grocery requesting early shipments on Recipe Inspirations in anticipation of strong consumer demand. We are introducing new varieties in McCormick brand dry seasoning mixes and Lawry's marinades and will be extending our range of products imported from our joint venture in Mexico through our line of popular teas. In Canada, we are revitalizing our Club House brand core spices, featuring new labeling, new products and media advertising. Consumers in Europe will see a U.K. version of Perfect Pinch and new varieties of our Schwartz flavorful range. In France, we're expanding our line of Vahiné cake mixes and decorations. And our team in Australia is introducing a line of slow cooker seasonings for rice. In 2010, we're also going to seize the opportunity to increase marketing support behind our leading brand and new products to capture consumer interest, as they continue to prepare meals at home. We're getting a good value for our marketing dollars when purchasing advertising. And then the U.S. and Europe have achieved strong ROIs in these dollars, as measured by incremental consumer purchases. We've also tested a higher levels of marketing with good results. With a 50% increase in media, we were able to deliver a double-digit increase in sales from most of the products we tested. At this time, we intend to add $20 million to our marketing programs in support of our core items, as well as new product innovation. This is an increase of 14% from 2009. Core items support will include ads that feature the anti-oxidant benefits of our super spices, our latest flavor forecast and first ever grilling-flavored forecast. The convenience of our dry seasoning mixes, the authentic ethnic flavors of brands such as Zatarain's, Thai Kitchen and Simply Asia and support for the Vahiné line in France. As shown on Slide 40, a large portion of the promotion and advertising behind product innovation will be concentrated on our national launch of Recipe Inspirations and Perfect Pinch here in the U.S. We are fueling these investments in our business with cost savings from CCI. Our goal in 2010 is to reduce cost of goods sold as well as SG&A expenses in the range of $35 million to $40 million. We have high confidence in this target with many initiatives already underway. These 2010 cost savings will fuel our incremental marketing support and help offset modest increases and input costs. Gross profit margin is projected to improve by at least 50 basis points, as a result of productivity and our continued shift toward a more favorable business mix. With incremental marketing support and our product innovation plans, we expect to grow sales 2% to 4% in local currency. Based on current rates, the impact of foreign currency will boost sales by 2% for a total projected increase of 4% to 6%. We've also added sales performance as a component of our operating divisions annual incentive compensation to bring increased focus.While healthy sales growth and margin expansion will drive profit growth in 2010, higher pension expense will be a headwind, as Gordon indicated, reducing EPS growth by about 3%. Taking this into account, we expect to achieve earnings per share in a $2.49 to $2.54 range. On a comparable basis for 2009, excluding the impact of restructuring charges recorded in 2009, this is a 6% to 8% increase. Note that no further restructuring charges are expected in 2010.We're looking for another year of excellent cash generation from our business, with higher profit and further reduction in our working capital. Our search for more great acquisitions to fold into our portfolio continues with a focus in Asia. Along with further pay down of our debt, acquisitions are our preferred use of cash in 2010. We have a number of interesting businesses on our radar screen, both in developed and emerging markets. Let me summarize so we can get to your questions. Our passion for flavor is the foundation of our success. Taste continues to rank first in what we choose to eat, ahead of quality, health and convenience. From premium gourmet items to the private label items we supply, our products offer consumers a good value, providing 90% of the flavor for meal and less than 10% of the cost. And we have long-term relationships with our customers who rely on McCormick for superior quality and service. With our marketing program lineup and innovation plans, McCormick's leadership team is excited about driving growth in 2010 on both the top line and the bottom line. It's the skill, energy and enthusiasm of McCormick employees around the world that give me confidence in the great performance and achievement of our financial goals for the year. Gordon and I look forward to reporting first quarter results with you in March and a more in-depth discussion at our Investor Conference in April. We thank our investors for your continued confidence and thank everyone on the call for your attention this morning. Now let's take some questions."

We're pleased to report strong financial performance for McCormick's first quarter of 2010. Our results included 6% sales growth, gross profit margin up 100 basis points and a 16% increase in earnings per share. Gordon will be reviewing some of the details with you shortly. But I'd like to start off the discussion by sharing with you some important business highlights. One of our key objectives for 2010 is to increase our brand marketing support, to connect with consumers at a time when they are preparing more meals at home and looking for great taste, convenience and a good value. We set a goal to spend an incremental $20 million on marketing programs, with a large portion of this to occur in the first half of 2010. For the first quarter, we increased promotion and advertising by $8 million. This is 28% more than we spent in the prior year period. In the U.S., we boosted our holiday programs with television ads and our first ever Holiday Flavor Forecast. Incremental advertising also featured Zatarain's reduced sodium products and a high antioxidant levels of our Super Spices. We drove great first quarter results in our Consumer business with these campaigns. As you can see on Slide 6, for our U.S. Consumer business, unit volume of herbs and spices were up 7%. Extract's up 23%, and we achieved 10% increases for both our McCormick brand dry seasoning mixes and our Zatarain's line. In this same market, our sales of private label and economy brands declined. Internationally, support for our PâtissierieVahiné range of premium quality homemade dessert mixes led to a solid sales growth in France. We grew sales for broad array of Schwartz brand products in the U.K. And our McCormick brand sales in China were up double digit with an increase in marketing support, as well as our ongoing distribution expansion efforts.Turning to product innovation for the Consumer business, our sales force have made strong progress in transitioning our range of bottled wins to the Perfect Pinch line. Perfect Pinch makes it easy for consumers to explore new flavors and create inspired meals. In addition, we've had enthusiastic retailer acceptance of our Recipe Inspirations items, with commitments from 2/3 of our retail accounts. Recipe Inspirations feature pre-measured spices and a collectible recipe card that make it easy to create flavorful meals at home. For each of these new lines, we're geared up for a dedicated marketing campaign set to launch in the next few weeks. While I'm going to let Gordon provide the financial details, I want to make some general remarks about our Industrial business as outlined on Slide 8. We were pleased to win some new business that included flavors sold to food manufacturers in both the United States and Mexico. We also grew sales with a number of existing items and customers. For example, we increased our sales to quick service restaurants in both Europe and Asia. However, we continue to face some challenges in the current environment. Demand from quick service restaurants was down in the U.S., and we had reductions in sales of bulk honey in Canada and bulk spices in Asia. In addition, we still have some sales weakness in the U.K. food service channel, following the 2009 bankruptcy of our primary distributor.That was a long list of pluses and minuses for our Industrial business, but the net result was that we moved the sales mix towards more value-added, higher-margin products. And the net result from the profit line was a big plus. This positive mix of sales, along with CCI-led productivity improvements delivered an outstanding 34% increase in operating income for our Industrial business. Our teams are doing a great job navigating the current environment and driving profitability. I mentioned CCI, our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, as the factor behind these results. There was good progress across all of our operations early in the year. And we've now identified projects that account primarily to all of the $35 million to $40 million that we set out to deliver. We are confident that this is an achievable goal for 2010.One more highlight from the current quarter, before I turn it over to Gordon, is that of our joint venture in Mexico. Driven by results with McCormick de Mexico, our income from unconsolidated income nearly doubled from the year-ago period. As indicated in our January call, we expected a significant increase, led by our joint venture in Mexico. If you recall, back in the first quarter of 2009, this business was affected by an unfavorable position with soybean oil and an unfavorable currency rate. About midway through 2009, we had worked through this inventory position, and currency rates stabilized. These improvements continued into the first quarter of 2010 and led to a significant increase in income. While this swing in material costs and currency are noteworthy, I would be remiss if I didn't highlight the impressive sales increase from our McCormick de Mexico joint venture. Using the McCormick brand name, McCormick de Mexico's products includes spices and seasonings, teas, marmalade and mustard. But the leading product line is mayonnaise. Mayonnaise is a growing category in Mexico. And our business is stimulating this growth with products and packaging innovation and with advertising. With a 350 basis point increase in market share the past 12 months, these efforts are clearly having a positive impact on retailers and consumers. We'll hold additional topics for our Investor Conference here in Baltimore, which is just a few weeks away. A number of you have already registered for this event, and you can check with Joyce if you have not yet registered and would like to do so. At this conference, we look forward to discussing our progress with key growth initiatives and our longer-term outlook for McCormick. Those attending will have a chance to hear from and meet the key members of our leadership team. I'll conclude my remarks with a heartfelt thanks to McCormick employees around the world for their commitment, their talent and their energy. They're driving great results and have us off to a strong start in 2010. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Gordon."

I'd like to go through some of the details behind our strong first quarter financial results. Let's start with a look at our Consumer business. As Alan indicated, we increased our brand marketing support in the first quarter, which, for this part of our business, was up 31% to $32 million, an $8 million increase. Even with this higher spending, operating income for this business grew 8% with higher sales in cost savings from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI. In the Americas region, sales rose 5% and in local currency grew 3%. Our investment in brand marketing support is paying off in topline growth with increases in holiday spices and extracts, dry seasoning mixes and Zatarain's products. We were extremely pleased with this response to our marketing support. Offsetting these unit increases were reductions in our U.S. sales of private label and economy brands and an unfavorable product mix in Canada. Our consumer sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, rose 13% in the quarter with a significant benefit from currency exchange rates. We were pleased with growth of 3% in local currency, with contributions from both favorable volume and product mix and pricing actions. Category increases in the U.K. and France remain robust. And we achieved strong sales in these markets in the first quarter with incremental marketing for our Schwartz, Ducros and Vahiné branded products. These increases were offset in part by the sales performance in some of the smaller markets where we do business including Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands. In the Asia/Pacific region, sales increased 20% with growth in local currency, 6%. This was driven by a double-digit increase in China, where we significantly increased marketing support and continue to gain distribution into new cities and retail channels.Our primary areas of focus in the Industrial business in 2010 are product innovation and margin improvement result to a [ph] (22:36) more favorable business mix and CCI-led cost savings. In the first quarter, we made great strides in each of these areas. While sales in local currency declined 1%, operating income rose 34% as a result of a positive shift in our sales mix and greater productivity across our operations. With the introduction of some new value-added products, we offset the impact of continued weakness in certain food service channels. Let's take a look at first quarter sales results for each of our three regions on Slide 14. Sales in the Americas rose 1% and in local currency declined 1%. In response to lower commodity costs such as dairy items, we reduced pricing for certain products during this period. We grew volume with the introduction of new flavors sold to food manufacturers in the U.S. and in Mexico. This was offset by the sales impact of weak demand from the restaurant industry. For both food manufacturers and food service customers, we are encouraged by a number of new products in the pipeline.In EMEA, Industrial sales rose 15% and in local currency increased 1%. We had good sales growth with quick service restaurants in this region and with snack seasonings. Our sales of branded products to the U.K. food service customers continue to be impacted by the bankruptcy of our primary distributor that occurred in the second quarter of 2009. Sales rose 11% in the Asia/Pacific region with a 1% increase in local currency. Here too, sales to quick service restaurants were quite strong with improving restaurant traffic in China. This was offset in part by a reduction in our bulk ingredient sales during the first quarter. Across both segments, sales rose 6% and in local currency, the increase was 2% largely from higher volume and product mix. With an 8% increase in operating income for our Consumer business and the 34% growth in Industrial products, we increased operating income for the total business 12%, with the operating income margin up 70 basis points.As Alan mentioned, gross profit margin improvement was significant at 100 basis points for this quarter. This was ahead of our 50 basis point projection for the year as a result of a particularly favorable business mix during this period. I would also note that our cost of goods sold for the first quarter included $5 million of costs associated with our recall of a limited number of products that contained an ingredient supplied by Basic Food Flavors."

At McCormick, this ingredient is a very small component in our products. And our action to recall a product was done from an abundance of caution. The results have been used about a recall of products containing contaminated pepper. This recall affected a number of companies that purchased pepper from several of our competitors. I want to point out that McCormick was not involved in any of these pepper-related incidents. We pride ourselves and our commitment to producing high-quality, wholesome food and have great confidence in our food safety protocols and the effectiveness of our supply chain."

In the first quarter, income from unconsolidated operations nearly doubled from the year-ago period. As Alan indicated, an excellent performance by McCormick de Mexico led to this impressive increase. Keep in mind that a year-on-year benefit",632,"Thanks, Alan. In the first quarter, income from unconsolidated operations nearly doubled from the year-ago period. As Alan indicated, an excellent performance by McCormick de Mexico led to this impressive increase. Keep in mind that a year-on-year benefit from soybean oil costs and foreign currency exchange rates will moderate as we head into the second quarter and remainder of 2010. Our 31% tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 was above the tax rate in the first quarter of 2009, which included a benefit from discrete tax items. We continue to expect the tax rate for 2010 to be near 32%. Earnings per share on the quarter reached $0.51, up 16% from the prior year. The $0.07 increase was comprised of $0.06 from higher operating income and $0.02 in income from unconsolidated operations. The net impact of favorable interest expense and unfavorable tax rate and higher shares outstanding lowered EPS by $0.01.I'll comment briefly on the balance sheet and first quarter cash flow and refer you to Slide 18. As is typical in the first two quarters of our year, cash flow from operations was fairly neutral. For the first quarter of 2010, cash flow from operations was a negative $5 million compared to a negative $13 million in the first quarter of 2009. The current year result includes an incremental $25 million in U.S. pension contributions. We continue to make headway with our McCormick Profit and the focus it brings on working capital. With McCormick Profit, we reward our business leaders not only for strong operating income, but also for their management of working capital and saw a good progress this quarter with inventory reductions. Let me finish up with our 2010 guidance. If you turn to Slide 19, I would like to comment on our financial outlook for the fiscal year. While earnings per share exceeded our expectations for the first quarter, we continue to project a range of $2.49 to $2.54. As we move into the balance of the year, we expect a more moderate increase in our joint venture income and gross profit margin improvement closer to our 50 basis point target. We reaffirm 2% to 4% sales growth in local currency and continue to project a 2% benefit from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Other aspects of our guidance also remain unchanged: 50 basis points of gross margin improvement, $35 million to $45 million (sic) [$35 million to $40 million] of cost savings from CCI and a $20 million increase in marketing support. While we do not typically provide quarterly guidance, we do want to point out that we do not expect a repeat of our 2010 first quarter results in the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, we had particularly favorable sales mix in the first quarter that significantly improved gross profit margin. Also, we are planning an even greater increase in our marketing support. This is on top of a $10 million marketing increase in the second quarter of 2009. Because a large portion of the 2010 spending is related to awareness building for our new products, it won't have the immediate sales lift we saw with our first quarter spending.I'd also like to point out that we expect the increase in income from unconsolidated operations to moderate a bit from the first quarter's result as pointed out earlier in our remarks. As a result of these factors, our current outlook is for second quarter EPS to be in a $0.42 to $0.45 range. To wrap up our remarks this morning, our first quarter sales, profit and cash have given us increased confidence in our outlook for another year of strong performance. We believe 2010 will be a year of record financial results and increased value for McCormick shareholders. Now let's take the first question."

In terms of a go forward, the indication that we're giving is that we expect the gross margin to be more in line with the full year guidance of 50 basis points. The main reason for that is as we promote into mainly in the second quarter, we're looking at awareness-building activities as it relates to new product introductions.

But we did have a number of new product wins for consumer manufacturers that have started to launch and we're seeing the volume of that.

We're pleased to report strong financial performance for McCormick's first quarter of 2010. Our results included 6% sales growth, gross profit margin up 100 basis points and a 16% increase in earnings per share. Gordon will be reviewing some of the details with you shortly. But I'd like to start off the discussion by sharing with you some important business highlights. One of our key objectives for 2010 is to increase our brand marketing support, to connect with consumers at a time when they are preparing more meals at home and looking for great taste, convenience and a good value. We set a goal to spend an incremental $20 million on marketing programs, with a large portion of this to occur in the first half of 2010. For the first quarter, we increased promotion and advertising by $8 million. This is 28% more than we spent in the prior year period. In the U.S., we boosted our holiday programs with television ads and our first ever Holiday Flavor Forecast. Incremental advertising also featured Zatarain's reduced sodium products and a high antioxidant levels of our Super Spices. We drove great first quarter results in our Consumer business with these campaigns. As you can see on Slide 6, for our U.S. Consumer business, unit volume of herbs and spices were up 7%. Extract's up 23%, and we achieved 10% increases for both our McCormick brand dry seasoning mixes and our Zatarain's line. In this same market, our sales of private label and economy brands declined. Internationally, support for our PâtissierieVahiné range of premium quality homemade dessert mixes led to a solid sales growth in France. We grew sales for broad array of Schwartz brand products in the U.K. And our McCormick brand sales in China were up double digit with an increase in marketing support, as well as our ongoing distribution expansion efforts.Turning to product innovation for the Consumer business, our sales force have made strong progress in transitioning our range of bottled wins to the Perfect Pinch line. Perfect Pinch makes it easy for consumers to explore new flavors and create inspired meals. In addition, we've had enthusiastic retailer acceptance of our Recipe Inspirations items, with commitments from 2/3 of our retail accounts. Recipe Inspirations feature pre-measured spices and a collectible recipe card that make it easy to create flavorful meals at home. For each of these new lines, we're geared up for a dedicated marketing campaign set to launch in the next few weeks. While I'm going to let Gordon provide the financial details, I want to make some general remarks about our Industrial business as outlined on Slide 8. We were pleased to win some new business that included flavors sold to food manufacturers in both the United States and Mexico. We also grew sales with a number of existing items and customers. For example, we increased our sales to quick service restaurants in both Europe and Asia. However, we continue to face some challenges in the current environment. Demand from quick service restaurants was down in the U.S., and we had reductions in sales of bulk honey in Canada and bulk spices in Asia. In addition, we still have some sales weakness in the U.K. food service channel, following the 2009 bankruptcy of our primary distributor.That was a long list of pluses and minuses for our Industrial business, but the net result was that we moved the sales mix towards more value-added, higher-margin products. And the net result from the profit line was a big plus. This positive mix of sales, along with CCI-led productivity improvements delivered an outstanding 34% increase in operating income for our Industrial business. Our teams are doing a great job navigating the current environment and driving profitability. I mentioned CCI, our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, as the factor behind these results. There was good progress across all of our operations early in the year. And we've now identified projects that account primarily to all of the $35 million to $40 million that we set out to deliver. We are confident that this is an achievable goal for 2010.One more highlight from the current quarter, before I turn it over to Gordon, is that of our joint venture in Mexico. Driven by results with McCormick de Mexico, our income from unconsolidated income nearly doubled from the year-ago period. As indicated in our January call, we expected a significant increase, led by our joint venture in Mexico. If you recall, back in the first quarter of 2009, this business was affected by an unfavorable position with soybean oil and an unfavorable currency rate. About midway through 2009, we had worked through this inventory position, and currency rates stabilized. These improvements continued into the first quarter of 2010 and led to a significant increase in income. While this swing in material costs and currency are noteworthy, I would be remiss if I didn't highlight the impressive sales increase from our McCormick de Mexico joint venture. Using the McCormick brand name, McCormick de Mexico's products includes spices and seasonings, teas, marmalade and mustard. But the leading product line is mayonnaise. Mayonnaise is a growing category in Mexico. And our business is stimulating this growth with products and packaging innovation and with advertising. With a 350 basis point increase in market share the past 12 months, these efforts are clearly having a positive impact on retailers and consumers. We'll hold additional topics for our Investor Conference here in Baltimore, which is just a few weeks away. A number of you have already registered for this event, and you can check with Joyce if you have not yet registered and would like to do so. At this conference, we look forward to discussing our progress with key growth initiatives and our longer-term outlook for McCormick. Those attending will have a chance to hear from and meet the key members of our leadership team. I'll conclude my remarks with a heartfelt thanks to McCormick employees around the world for their commitment, their talent and their energy. They're driving great results and have us off to a strong start in 2010. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Gordon."

I'd like to go through some of the details behind our strong first quarter financial results. Let's start with a look at our Consumer business. As Alan indicated, we increased our brand marketing support in the first quarter, which for this part of our business, was up 31% to $32 million, an $8 million increase. Even with this higher spending, operating income for this business grew 8% with higher sales in cost savings from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, CCI. In the Americas region, sales rose 5% and in local currency grew 3%. Our investment in brand marketing support is paying off in topline growth with increases in holiday spices and extracts, dry seasoning mixes and Zatarain's products. We were extremely pleased with this response to our marketing support. Offsetting these unit increases were reductions in our U.S. sales of private label and economy brands and an unfavorable product mix in Canada. Our consumer sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, rose 13% in the quarter with a significant benefit from currency exchange rates. We were pleased with growth of 3% in local currency, with contributions from both favorable volume and product mix and pricing actions. Category increases in the U.K. and France remain robust. And we achieved strong sales in these markets in the first quarter with incremental marketing for our Schwartz, Ducros and Vahiné branded products. These increases were offset in part by the sales performance in some of the smaller markets where we do business including Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands. In the Asia/Pacific region, sales increased 20% with growth in local currency, 6%. This was driven by a double-digit increase in China, where we significantly increased marketing support and continue to gain distribution into new cities and retail channels.Our primary areas of focus in the Industrial business in 2010 are product innovation and margin improvement resulting to a [ph] (22:36) more favorable business mix and CCI-led cost savings. In the first quarter, we made great strides in each of these areas. While sales in local currency declined 1%, operating income rose 34% as a result of a positive shift in our sales mix and greater productivity across our operations. With the introduction of some new value-added products, we offset the impact of continued weakness in certain food service channels. Let's take a look at first quarter sales results for each of our three regions on Slide 14. Sales in the Americas rose 1% and in local currency declined 1%. In response to lower commodity costs such as dairy items, we reduced pricing for certain products during this period. We grew volume with the introduction of new flavors sold to food manufacturers in the U.S. and in Mexico. This was offset by the sales impact of weak demand from the restaurant industry. For both food manufacturers and food service customers, we are encouraged by a number of new products in the pipeline.In EMEA, Industrial sales rose 15% and in local currency increased 1%. We had good sales growth with quick service restaurants in this region and with snack seasonings. Our sales of branded products to the U.K. food service customers continue to be impacted by the bankruptcy of our primary distributor that occurred in the second quarter of 2009. Sales rose 11% in the Asia/Pacific region with a 1% increase in local currency. Here too, sales to quick service restaurants were quite strong with improving restaurant traffic in China. This was offset in part by a reduction in our bulk ingredient sales during the first quarter. Across both segments, sales rose 6% and in local currency, the increase was 2% largely from higher volume and product mix. With an 8% increase in operating income for our Consumer business and the 34% growth in Industrial products, we increased operating income for the total business 12%, with the operating income margin up 70 basis points.As Alan mentioned, gross profit margin improvement was significant at 100 basis points for this quarter. This was ahead of our 50 basis point projection for the year as a result of a particularly favorable business mix during this period. I would also note that our cost of goods sold for the first quarter included $5 million of costs associated with our recall of a limited number of products that contained an ingredient supplied by Basic Food Flavors."

As those of you who closely follow food companies realize, this was an industry-wide issue that affected a significant number of companies and products. At McCormick, this ingredient is a very small component in our products, and our action to recall a product was done from an abundance of caution. There has also been news about a recall of products containing contaminated pepper. This recall affected a number of companies that purchased pepper from several of our competitors. I want to point out that McCormick was not involved in any of these pepper-related incidents. We pride ourselves in our commitment to producing high-quality, wholesome food and have great confidence in our food safety protocols and the effectiveness of our supply chain."

In the first quarter, income from unconsolidated operations nearly doubled from the year ago period. As Alan indicated, an excellent performance by McCormick de Mexico led to this impressive increase. Keep in mind that the year-on-year benefit from soybean oil costs and foreign currency exchange rates will moderate as we head into the second quarter and remainder of 2010. Our 31% tax rate for the first quarter of 2010 was above the tax rate in the first quarter of 2009, which included a benefit from discrete tax items. We continue to expect the tax rate for 2010 to be near 32%. Earnings per share on the quarter reached $0.51, up 16% from the prior year. The $0.07 increase was comprised of $0.06 from higher operating income and $0.02 in income from unconsolidated operations. The net impact of favorable interest expense and unfavorable tax rate and higher shares outstanding lowered EPS by $0.01.I'll comment briefly on the balance sheet and first quarter cash flow and refer you to Slide 18. As is typical in the first two quarters of our year, cash flow from operations was fairly neutral. For the first quarter of 2010, cash flow from operations was a negative $5 million compared to a negative $13 million in the first quarter of 2009. The current year result includes an incremental $25 million in U.S. pension contributions. We continue to make headway with our McCormick Profit and the focus it brings on working capital. With McCormick Profit, we reward our business leaders not only for strong operating income but also for their management of working capital and saw a good progress this quarter with inventory reductions. Let me finish up with our 2010 guidance. If you turn to Slide 19, I would like to comment on our financial outlook for the fiscal year. While earnings per share exceeded our expectations for the first quarter, we continue to project a range of $2.49 to $2.54. As we move into the balance of the year, we expect a more moderate increase in our joint venture income and gross profit margin improvement closer to our 50 basis point target. We reaffirm 2% to 4% sales growth in local currency and continue to project a 2% benefit from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Other aspects of our guidance also remain unchanged: 50 basis points of gross margin improvement, $35 million to $45 million (sic) [$35 million to $40 million] of cost savings from CCI and a $20 million increase in marketing support. While we do not typically provide quarterly guidance, we do want to point out that we do not expect a repeat of our 2010 first quarter results in the second quarter. As mentioned earlier, we had particularly favorable sales mix in the first quarter that significantly improved gross profit margin. Also, we are planning an even greater increase in our marketing support. This is on top of a $10 million marketing increase in the second quarter of 2009. Because a large portion of the 2010 spending is related to awareness building for our new products, it won't have the immediate sales lift we saw with our first quarter spending.I'd also like to point out that we expect the increase in income from unconsolidated operations to moderate a bit from the first quarter's result as pointed out earlier in our remarks. As a result of these factors, our current outlook is for second quarter EPS to be in a $0.42 to $0.45 range. To wrap up our remarks this morning, our first quarter sales, profit and cash have given us increased confidence in our outlook for another year of strong performance. We believe 2010 will be a year of record financial results and increased value for McCormick shareholders. Now let's take the first question."

The main reason for that is as we promote into mainly in the second quarter, we're looking at awareness-building activities as it relates to new product introductions.

We're pleased to report another quarter of strong financial performance at McCormick. Our results for the second quarter demonstrated our passion for flavor and the effectiveness of our strategy; to invest in the business, and to fuel our growth with improved margins.
Product innovation, increased brand marketing, and distribution gains drove the top-line, and above the target progress with our CCI program has gross profit margin up 110 basis points year-to-date. This level of success was accomplished in the midst of a global economy that remains challenging in a number of our markets.
Although conditions remain difficult, based on these results and our latest outlook, we're well positioned heading into the second half.
This morning, I would like to begin with an update on the business environment, and progress with our growth initiatives. After that I'll comment briefly on this week's announcement of a new share repurchase program.
Across our primary markets in locations around the world, we see varying degrees of economic recovery. From our perspective, consumers in the Americas remain cautious but seem more willing to explore new flavors.
Increased retail purchases of our new products, our more exotic gourmet spices, and our authentic ethnic brands suggest that there's a willingness to branch out and to experiment with more distinctive flavors. We believe other food manufacturers are seeing this too based on the product innovation activity in our industrial business.
While parts of the food service channel continue to be a bit weak, we saw some increased demand from food service distributors. In addition, some of our industrial customers in the Americas are once again focusing on the strongest part of our value proposition, quality and reliability, which has won us an increased share of their business.
In Europe the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, our two primary markets are the U.K. and France. These economies are still in recovery from the economic downturn, and private label pressure remains a factor, although the growth of private label moderated slightly in the latest period.
The U.K. and France will be the focus of our media in the second half as we step up our marketing behind differentiated products such as the flavorful range for Schwartz in the U.K. Beyond these two markets, our business has been affected by the severe declines in several countries where we have smaller businesses, in particular Spain and Portugal, and the currency situation for Europe is expected to turn unfavorable for us in the second half.
In away-from-home eating, quick service restaurants in Europe have maintained traffic with their value pricing and promotions, which has led to good growth opportunities for McCormick.
Turning to our third geographic region, Asia-Pacific, we also operate in some very distinct markets. China and Southeast Asia offer abundant opportunities for growth in grocery and food service channels and with global packaged foods companies, calling for a rapid expansion in new products, new distribution channels and consumer marketing.
Australia has a concentrated retail market, and our focus there remains on categories where we have a strong lead like Aeroplane Jelly and seasoning brands. Given these varying markets and economies, and the changes in consumer behavior and retailer actions, our management team has operated with a great deal of energy and agility which has enabled excellent progress with our growth initiatives.
Through the first half of 2010, we have increased marketing support by 22% to invest in the growth of our leading brands. In the second quarter, much of this increase has been in the United States to build consumer awareness and trial for our new Recipe Inspirations and Perfect Pinch products and set the stage for their future growth. We gained excellent retailer acceptance and placement for these products in the first quarter, and followed that with media advertising in the second quarter.
Scanner data for May showed that all six varieties of recipe inspirations ranked in the top 40% of McCormick blends, with Rosemary Roasted Chicken ranking in the top 50 items for the total spice and seasoning category. That means that it turned at a rate comparable to our Grill Mates seasoning blends, and did so during Grill Mates' peak selling period.
Other marketing and new product activity in the quarter feature Grill Mates, Simply Asia, Flavorful in the U.K., Sauces in China, and Rice Cookers in Australia. Gordon will have more to share on these in his remarks.
Let me comment next on our progress towards improving the margins of our industrial business. Industrial business operating income margin for fiscal year 2009 was 6.7%, and if you recall included costs related to the 2009 bankruptcy of our primary food service distributor in the U.K. which were recorded in the second quarter.
Year-to-date in 2010, operating income margin for this part of our business was 7.7%. As you can see from the graph on slide 8, we are definitely moving in the right direction, with the improvement driven by both CCI-led cost savings and a more favorable product and customer mix.
For example, employees at our condiment plant in the United Kingdom have made great strides toward increasing the efficiency of that operation. Operating at a lower cost is enabling us to both improve margins and compete more effectively.
We're making good progress toward our goal of 9% to 10% operating income margin for our industrial business by 2013. I mentioned CCI, our comprehensive, continuous improvement program as a factor behind these results. Employees are increasing productivity not only in the U.K. but across all of our operations.
Many of our manufacturing facilities have high performance work systems in place as we discussed in our 2010 investor conference, engaging employees at all levels in the CCI program. With CCI, we are also lowering cost by buying more effectively, applying tools and technology, and streamlining processes.
On Tuesday, we announced that the Board authorized a $400 million share repurchase program. At quarter end $33 million remained on the prior authorization. Along with our increased dividends, we view share repurchases as an important element of our return to shareholders. Between dividends and share repurchases we have returned more than $1 billion of cash to our shareholders in the past five years.
Since the acquisition of Lawry's we've made steady progress toward reducing our debt levels and in the fourth quarter expect to increase the pace of our repurchase activity.
By the end of fiscal year 2010, we expect to have spent between $50 million to $100 million on share repurchases. As we've stated in the past, over time, we expect our program to reduce shares outstanding by about 2% annually in the absence of significant acquisition activity. Priorities for cash continue to be our dividend payment and the acquisition of strong brands. In the absence of acquisition activity, we will use a portion of cash to repurchase shares.
Let me summarize. As we head into the second half, the economic environment remains uncertain, and we will continue to face challenges. At McCormick, we have become increasingly adept at working through these challenges, while gaining good traction with our growth initiatives and CCI program.
I'll conclude my remarks with a sincere thanks to McCormick employees around the world for their commitment and talent, their agility in managing this business, and their ability to achieve great results.
Gordon, let me turn it over to you at this point, and I'll come back into the conversation for Q&A.

181176,107513702,66298,"McCormick & Co. Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jun 24, 2010",2010-06-24,"Earnings Calls","McCormick & Company, Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Alan, and good morning everyone. Let me provide some additional details behind our second quarter financial results, and begin with a look at our consumer business and top-line growth on slide 11.In the Americas region, sales rose 4%, and in loc",1523,"Thanks, Alan, and good morning everyone. Let me provide some additional details behind our second quarter financial results, and begin with a look at our consumer business and top-line growth on slide 11.
In the Americas region, sales rose 4%, and in local currency the increase was 2%, due to favorable volume and product mix. An important part of the second quarter sales increase came from Recipe Inspirations and Perfect Pinch. And for a number of other products, the positive results we reported in the first quarter extended into the second quarter. For example, in the U.S. we had another quarter of increased sales of our spices and herbs, which outpaced the sales growth rate of the private label items we supply.
In addition, we achieved double digit increases for Grill Mates, gourmet items and Simply Asia products. Also in the Americas, we had excellent growth during this period in Canada, with promotions behind grilling products and new distribution games for Billy Bee Honey.
Consumer sales in EMEA were flat to the year-ago quarter, and down 3% in local currency. Currency through the second quarter still had a positive impact. Sales this quarter were impacted by a significant decrease in several European markets struggling with severe economic declines. In these markets we are seeing not only weak consumer demand, but retailers pulling back on inventory levels.
Our largest consumer markets in this region, France and the U.K. have fared better. We achieved volume growth through the first half, and while private label continues to outpace the growth of brands, the rate of increase has moderated in the latest period. Given this backdrop and recent trends, we remain cautious in the third and fourth quarter outlook for our consumer business in EMEA.
In the Asia-Pacific region, second quarter sales increased 22%, with strong growth in local currency of 7%. We grew volume and product mix in this market by 11%, led by excellent results in China. In this country, we continue to gain distribution, including product placement in frequently shopped street markets.
In addition, we have launched several new products, including Thai chili sauce, which plays to our strength in the bottled sauce category at retail, and it's supported by a full media campaign. And we have added new flavors of ice-cream toppings to expand our number one position in this category.
Operating income for our consumer business was $68 million. Excluding restructuring charges recorded in the second quarter of 2009, operating income was down $3 million. This was due largely to the additional $7 million investment in marketing spend in the second quarter of 2010, which was directed toward building consumer awareness and trial of our new products. Income was favorably impacted during the quarter by higher sales and cost savings from CCI.
Turning to our industrial business on slide 13, we delivered $29 million of operating income. In comparison to the second quarter of 2009, we drove profit with higher sales and the productivity improvements that Alan discussed. This result also included $1 million of incremental marketing behind our food service brands.
Let's take a look at the sales performance for this part of our business on slide 14. Industrial sales in the Americas rose 2%, and in local currency were down 1%. In response to lower commodity cost, primarily dairy ingredients, we passed through lower pricing for certain products during this period.
We grew volume and product mix 2% with the introduction of new flavors sold to food manufacturers in the U.S. and in Mexico. We were also encouraged by the improvement in sales to food service distributors, as we roll out the new packaging phase of our McCormick for Chef's program.
Looking ahead, we are encouraged by our pipeline of new products for both food manufacturers and food service customers in the Americas. In EMEA, industrial sales rose 22%, and in local currency increased an impressive 12%. We grew sales to quick service restaurants in this region, which continued to have good traffic and promotions that emphasize items we flavor. As in the Americas, we have a number of items such as sauces and other condiments in the pipeline.
In the second quarter of 2010, sales also benefited from the recovery in branded food service products in the U.K. when compared to a period of disruption in the second quarter of 2009. Industrial sales rose 24% in the Asia-Pacific region with a 13% increase in local currency, led by growth in China. In this market, sales to quick service restaurants were quite strong and included new product wins for chicken wing marinades, beverage flavors and other items.
Our industrial team there has been extremely successful, with more than 50 items scheduled for launch this year. Across both segments, sales rose 5%, and in local currency the increase was 2%. A 3% increase in volume and product mix was offset by reduced pricing, which primarily related to the pass-through of lower cost to industrial customers.
Operating income for the total business was up 9%, excluding the impact of restructuring charges in the second quarter of 2009, as shown on slide 16.
Gross profit margin improvement was significant at 100 basis points for the quarter. This was ahead of our 50 basis point projection for the year, and an indication of the effectiveness of our CCI program and move toward a more favorable mix of products and customers.
SG&A as a percent of sales rose 60 basis points. A large part of the increase related to $8 million of incremental marketing support along with the higher cost of benefits in fuel. SG&A in the second quarter of 2009 included $7 million in costs related to the bankruptcy of our U.K. distributor.
The tax rate in the second quarter of 2010 was 30.2%, comprised of a 33% underlying rate net of discrete tax benefits. For the second half of 2010, we expect the tax rate to remain at 33%, which is an increase from our initial guidance of 32%.
Income from unconsolidated operations increased significantly as result of our McCormick to Mexico joint venture, which had a large benefit from favorable soybean oil cost and foreign currency exchange rates through the first half. For the second quarter, sales from unconsolidated operations were up 11%.
While we expect continued growth of these businesses in the second half, our projections do not include additional large variances from favorable input costs and currency.
Second quarter earnings per share were $0.49 compared to $0.38 in the prior year. On a comparable basis, excluding $0.04 of restructuring charges recorded in the second quarter of 2009, EPS rose 17%. This is an increase of $0.07, which included higher operating income, as well as $0.02 each from favorable tax rate and income from unconsolidated operations, offset in part by higher shares outstanding.
I'll comment briefly on cash flow. For the first half of 2010, cash flow from operations was $65 million compared to $97 million in the first half of 2009. The higher net income added $26 million to 2010. Cash flow in the first half of 2009 included the benefit of a significant improvement in receivables.
McCormick profit continues to bring focus to working capital, and business leaders are rewarded not only for strong operating income, but also for their management of working capital. This has continued in 2010, as we work toward our 2012 goal to reduce the cash conversion cycle by another 10 days.
Let me wrap up with our latest outlook for 2010, as outlined on slide 21. While earnings per share exceeded our expectations for the first half, we remain cautious as we move into the second half, given the perspective on the global economy that Alan provided.
We will continue to incur higher benefit costs primarily due to pension expense. In addition, our tax rate is expected to be at a higher level. And as I stated earlier, the steep increases in income from unconsolidated operations are expected to moderate. We are also seeing costs for some of our raw and packaging materials starting to rise. And as further headwind, we expect currency exchange rates to have an unfavorable impact.
So for the full year, we are maintaining our earnings per share range of $2.49 to $2.54, but now expect to be at the upper end of this range. We are also reaffirming 2% to 4% sales growth in local currency, but now project a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates based on prevailing rates. This assumes an unfavorable sales impact of 2% in the second half.
As for gross profit margin improvement, based on an excellent year-to-date result and current outlook, we expect to exceed 50 basis points and are on track to exceed $40 million in CCI-led cost savings. Both of these are increases from our initial projection. As for incremental marketing expense, we still expect $20 million for the year, most of which occurred in the first half.
Let me summarize by stating that we are pleased with our business performance and financial results through the first half, and confident that 2010 will be a record year for McCormick.

We're pleased to report another quarter of strong financial performance at McCormick. Our results for the second quarter demonstrated our passion for flavor and the effectiveness of our strategy, to invest in the business and to fuel our growth with improved margins. Product innovation, increased brand marketing and distribution gains drove the top line, and above-target progress with our CCI program has gross profit margin up 110 basis points year-to-date. 
This level of success was accomplished in the midst of a global economy that remains challenging in a number of our markets. Although conditions remain difficult, based on these results and our latest outlook, we're well positioned heading into the second half. 
This morning, I would like to begin with an update on the business environment and progress with our growth initiatives. After that, I will comment briefly on of this week's announcement of a new share repurchase program.
Across our primary markets in locations around the world, we see varying degrees of economic recovery. From our perspective, consumers in the Americas remain cautious but seem more willing to explore new flavors. Increased retail purchases of our new products, our more exotic gourmet spices and our authentic ethnic brands suggest that there is a willingness to branch out and to experiment with more distinctive flavors. We believe other food manufacturers are seeing this too based on the product innovation activity in our Industrial business. 
While parts of the food service channel continue to be a bit weak, we saw some increased demand from food service distributors. In addition, some of our industrial customers in the Americas are once again focusing on the strongest part of our value proposition, quality and reliability, which has won us an increased share of their business. 
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, our two primary markets are the U.K. and France. These economies are still in recovery from the economic downturn, and private label pressure remains a factor, although the growth of private label moderated slightly in the latest period. The U.K. and France will be the focus of our media in the second half as we step up our marketing behind differentiated products such as the flavorful range for Schwartz in the U.K. 
Beyond these two markets, our business has been affected by the severe declines in several countries where we have smaller businesses, in particular Spain and Portugal, and the currency situation for Europe is expected to turn unfavorable for us in the second half. In away-from-home eating, quick-service restaurants in Europe have maintained traffic with their value pricing and promotions, which has led to good growth opportunities for McCormick. 
Turning to our third geographic region, Asia/Pacific. We also operate in some very distinct markets. China and Southeast Asia offer abundant opportunities for growth in grocery and food service channels and with global packaged foods companies, calling for a rapid expansion in new products, new distribution channels and consumer marketing. Australia has a concentrated retail market, and our focus there remains on categories where we have a strong lead like Aeroplane Jelly and seasoning blends. 
Given these varying markets and economies and the changes in consumer behavior and retailer actions, our management team has operated with a great deal of energy and agility, which has enabled excellent progress with our growth initiatives. Through the first half of 2010, we have increased marketing support by 22% to invest in the growth of our leading brands. 
In the second quarter, much of this increase has been in the United States to build consumer awareness and trial for our new Recipe Inspirations and Perfect Pinch products and set the stage for their future growth. We gained excellent retailer acceptance and placement for these products in the first quarter and followed that with media advertising in the second quarter. 
Scanner data for May showed that all six varieties of Recipe Inspirations ranked in the top 40% of McCormick blends with Rosemary Roasted Chicken ranking in the top 50 items for the total spice and seasoning category. That means that it turned at a rate comparable to our Grill Mates seasoning blends and did so during Grill Mates' peak selling period. 
Other marketing and new product activity in the quarter featured Grill Mates, Simply Asia, Flavorful in the U.K., Sauces in China and Rice Cookers in Australia. Gordon will have more to share on these in his remarks. 
Let me comment next on our progress towards improving the margins of our Industrial business. Industrial business operating income margin for fiscal year 2009 was 6.7%, and if you recall, included cost related to the 2009 bankruptcy of our primary food service distributor in the U.K., which were recorded in the second quarter. Year-to-date in 2010, operating income margin for this part of the business [ph] was 7.7%. 
As you can see from the graph on Slide 8, we are definitely moving in the right direction with the improvement driven by both CCI-led cost savings and the more favorable product and customer mix. For example, employees at our condiment plant in the United Kingdom have made great strides toward increasing the efficiency of that operation. Operating at a lower cost is enabling us to both improve margins and compete more effectively. We're making good progress toward our goal of 9% to 10% operating income margin for our Industrial business by 2013. 
I mentioned CCI, our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, as a factor behind these results. Employees are increasing productivity, not only in the U.K., but across all of our operations. Many of our manufacturing facilities have high-performance work systems in place as we discussed in our 2010 Investor Conference, engaging employees at all levels in the CCI program. With CCI, we are also lowering cost by buying more effectively, applying tools and technology and streamlining processes. 
On Tuesday, we announced that the board authorized a $400 million share repurchase program. At quarter end, $33 million remained on the prior authorization. Along with our increased dividends, we view share repurchases as an important element of our return to shareholders. Between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned more than $1 billion of cash to our shareholders in the past five years. 
Since the acquisition of Lawry's, we've made steady progress toward reducing our debt levels, and in the fourth quarter, expect to increase the pace of our repurchase activity. By the end of fiscal year 2010, we expect to have spent between $50 million to $100 million on share repurchases. 
As we've stated in the past, over time, we expect our program to reduce shares outstanding by about 2% annually in the absence of significant acquisition activity. Priorities for cash continue to be our dividend payment and the acquisition of strong brands. In the absence of acquisition activity, we will use a portion of cash to repurchase shares.
Let me summarize. As we head into the second half, the economic environment remains uncertain, and we will continue to face challenges. At McCormick, we have become increasingly adept at working through these challenges while gaining good traction with our growth initiatives and CCI program. 
I'll conclude my remarks with a sincere thanks to McCormick employees around the world for their commitment and talent, their agility in managing this business and their ability to achieve great results. Gordon, let me turn it over to you at this point, and I'll come back into the conversation for Q&A."

Let me provide some additional details behind our second quarter financial results and begin with a look at our Consumer business and top line growth on Slide 11. 
In the Americas region, sales rose 4%, and in local currency, the increase was 2% due to favorable volume and product mix. An important part of the second quarter sales increase came from Recipe Inspirations and Perfect Pinch. And for a number of other products, the positive results we reported in the first quarter extended into the second quarter. For example, in the U.S., we had another quarter of increased sales of our spices and herbs, which outpaced the sales growth rate of the private label items we supply. In addition, we achieved double-digit increases for Grill Mates, gourmet items and Simply Asia products. 
Also in the Americas, we had excellent growth during this period in Canada with promotions behind grilling products and new distribution gains for Billy Bee Honey. Consumer sales in EMEA were flat to the year-ago quarter and down 3% in local currency. Currency through the second quarter still had a positive impact. 
Sales this quarter were impacted by a significant decrease in several European markets struggling with severe economic declines. In these markets, we are seeing not only weak consumer demand but retailers pulling back on inventory levels. 
Our largest consumer markets in this region, France and the U.K., have fared better. We achieved volume growth through the first half, and while private label continues to outpace the growth of brands, the rate of increase has moderated in the latest period. Given this backdrop and recent trends, we remain cautious in the third and fourth quarter outlook for our Consumer business in EMEA. 
In the Asia/Pacific region, second quarter sales increased 22%, with strong growth in local currency of 7%. We grew volume and product mix in this market by 11% led by excellent results in China. 
In this country, we continue to gain distribution, including product placement and frequently shopped street markets. In addition, we have launched several new products, including Thai Chili Sauce, which plays to our strength in the bottled-sauce category at retail and is supported by a full-media campaign, and we have added new flavors of ice cream toppings to expand our number one position in this category. 
Operating income for our Consumer business was $68 million. Excluding restructuring charges recorded in the second quarter of 2009, operating income was down $3 million. This was due largely to the additional $7 million investment in marketing spend in the second quarter of 2010, which was directed toward building consumer awareness and trial of our new products. Income was favorably impacted during the quarter by higher sales and cost savings from CCI.
Turning to our Industrial business on Slide 13. We delivered $29 million of operating income. In comparison to the second quarter of 2009, we drove profit with higher sales and the productivity improvement that Alan discussed. This result also included $1 million of incremental marketing behind our food service brands. 
Let's take a look at the sales performance for this part of our business on Slide 14. Industrial sales in the Americas rose 2%, and in local currency, were down 1%. In response to lower commodity cost, primarily dairy ingredients, we passed through lower pricing for certain products during this period. 
We grew volume and product mix 2% with the introduction of new flavors sold to food manufacturers in the U.S. and in Mexico. We were also encouraged by an improvement in sales to food service distributors, as we roll out the new packaging phase of our McCormick for Chefs program. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by our pipeline of new products for both food manufacturers and food service customers in the Americas. 
In EMEA, industrial sales rose 22%, and in local currency, increased an impressive 12%. We grew sales to quick-service restaurants in this region, which continue to have good traffic and promotions that emphasize items we flavor. As in the Americas, we have a number of items such as sauces and other condiments in the pipeline. 
In the second quarter of 2010, sales also benefited from the recovery in branded food service products in the U.K. when compared to a period of disruption in the second quarter of 2009. Industrial sales rose 24% in the Asia/Pacific region, with a 13% increase in local currency led by growth in China. In this market, sales to quick-service restaurants were quite strong and included new product wins for chicken wing marinade, beverage flavors and other items. 
Our industrial team there has been extremely successful, with more than 50 items scheduled for launch this year. Across both segments, sales rose 5%, and in local currency, the increase was 2%. A 3% increase in volume and product mix was offset by reduced pricing, which primarily related to the pass-through of lower cost to industrial customers. 
Operating income for the total business was up 9% excluding the impact of restructuring charges in the second quarter of 2009 as shown on Slide 16. Gross profit margin improvement was significant at 100 basis points for the quarter. This was ahead of our 50-basis-point projection for the year and an indication of the effectiveness of our CCI program and move toward a more favorable mix of products and customers.
SG&A as a percent of sales rose 60 basis points. A large part of the increase related to $8 million of incremental marketing support along with the higher cost of benefits and fuel. SG&A in the second quarter of 2009 included $7 million in cost related to the bankruptcy of our U.K. distributor. 
The tax rate in the second quarter of 2010 was 30.2%, comprised of a 33% underlying rate, net of discreet tax benefits. For the second half of 2010, we expect the tax rate to remain at 33%, which is an increase from our initial guidance of 32%.
Income from unconsolidated operations increased significantly as a result of our McCormick de Mexico joint venture, which had a large benefit from favorable soybean oil cost and foreign currency exchange rates through the first half. For the second quarter, sales from unconsolidated operations were up 11%. While we expect continued growth of these businesses in the second half, our projections do not include additional large variances from favorable input cost and currency.
Second quarter earnings per share were $0.49 compared to $0.38 in the prior year. On a comparable basis, excluding $0.04 of restructuring charges recorded in the second quarter of 2009, EPS rose 17%. This is an increase of $0.07, which included higher operating income, as well as $0.02 each from favorable tax rate and income from unconsolidated operations, offset in part by higher shares outstanding.
I'll comment briefly on cash flow. For the first half of 2010, cash flow from operations was $65 million compared to $97 million in the first half of 2009. While higher net income added $26 million to 2010, cash flow in the first half of 2009 included the benefit of a significant improvement in receivables. 
McCormick profit continues to bring focus to working capital, and business leaders are rewarded not only for strong operating income but also for their management of working capital. This is continued in 2010 as we work toward our 2012 goal to reduce the cash conversion cycle by another 10 days.
Let me wrap up with our latest outlook for 2010 as outlined on Slide 21. While earnings per share exceeded our expectations for the first half, we remain cautious as we move into the second half given the perspective on the global economy that Alan provided. We will continue to incur higher benefit cost primarily due to pension expense. In addition, our tax rate is expected to be at a higher level, and as I stated earlier, the steep increases in income from unconsolidated operations are expected to moderate. 
We are also seeing cost for some of our raw and packaging materials starting to rise, and as a further headwind, we expect currency exchange rates to have an unfavorable impact. So for the full year, we are maintaining our earnings per share range of $2.49 to $2.54, but now expect to be at the upper end of this range. We are also reaffirming 2% to 4% sales growth in local currency, but now project a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates based on prevailing rates. This assumes an unfavorable sales impact of 2% in the second half.
As for gross profit margin improvement, based on an excellent year-to-date result and current outlook, we expect to exceed 50 basis points and are on track to exceed $40 million in CCI-led cost savings. Both of these are increases from our initial projection.  As for incremental marketing expense, we still expect $20 million for the year, most of which occurred in the first half.

In the U.S. market, we have not only maintained shelf space, but across all outlets, have grown our share. Since 2008, we've expended distribution of our brand in alternative channels such as dollar stores. 
For the past 18 months, there's been a great deal of speculation concerning various spice category solutions at Wal-Mart. I'd like to share with you that later this summer, the core spice and herbs section of Wal-Mart Supercenters will be merchandised in a consistent manner across the United States with an assortment consisting primarily of McCormick branded products and a limited number of great-value private brand items. Wal-Mart has also agreed to carry our new Recipe Inspiration items in most of their stores nationally. We're very pleased with the opportunity to demonstrate the strength of our brands with our valued customers.

And so we look at what we're doing there and what we think the outlook is as we make our pricing decisions. Those wouldn't necessarily be passed through automatically. We make a more rational decision on those. Although for customers that are buying in bulk, they're buying based on whatever the price is on the day that we quote it, so it's not necessarily contract pricing for those either. But in our Consumer business, as you know, we take pricing more strategically than tactically. But we are seeing some upward pressure in a number of the input costs."

We're pleased to report another quarter of strong financial performance at McCormick. Our results for the second quarter demonstrated our passion for flavor and the effectiveness of our strategy, to invest in the business and to fuel our growth with improved margins. Product innovation, increased brand marketing and distribution gains drove the top line, and above-target progress with our CCI program has gross profit margin up 110 basis points year-to-date. 
This level of success was accomplished in the midst of a global economy that remains challenging in a number of our markets. Although conditions remain difficult, based on these results and our latest outlook, we're well positioned heading into the second half. 
This morning, I would like to begin with an update on the business environment and progress with our growth initiatives. After that, I will comment briefly on of this week's announcement of a new share repurchase program.
Across our primary markets in locations around the world, we see varying degrees of economic recovery. From our perspective, consumers in the Americas remain cautious but seem more willing to explore new flavors. Increased retail purchases of our new products, our more exotic gourmet spices and our authentic ethnic brands suggest that there is a willingness to branch out and to experiment with more distinctive flavors. We believe other food manufacturers are seeing this too based on the product innovation activity in our Industrial business. 
While parts of the food service channel continue to be a bit weak, we saw some increased demand from food service distributors. In addition, some of our industrial customers in the Americas are once again focusing on the strongest part of our value proposition, quality and reliability, which has won us an increased share of their business. 
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, our two primary markets are the U.K. and France. These economies are still in recovery from the economic downturn, and private label pressure remains a factor, although the growth of private label moderated slightly in the latest period. The U.K. and France will be the focus of our media in the second half as we step up our marketing behind differentiated products such as the flavorful range for Schwartz in the U.K. 
Beyond these two markets, our business has been affected by the severe declines in several countries where we have smaller businesses, in particular Spain and Portugal, and the currency situation for Europe is expected to turn unfavorable for us in the second half. In away-from-home eating, quick-service restaurants in Europe have maintained traffic with their value pricing and promotions, which has led to good growth opportunities for McCormick. 
Turning to our third geographic region, Asia/Pacific. We also operate in some very distinct markets. China and Southeast Asia offer abundant opportunities for growth in grocery and food service channels and with global packaged foods companies, calling for a rapid expansion in new products, new distribution channels and consumer marketing. Australia has a concentrated retail market, and our focus there remains on categories where we have a strong lead like Aeroplane Jelly and seasoning blends. 
Given these varying markets and economies and the changes in consumer behavior and retailer actions, our management team has operated with a great deal of energy and agility, which has enabled excellent progress with our growth initiatives. Through the first half of 2010, we have increased marketing support by 22% to invest in the growth of our leading brands. 
In the second quarter, much of this increase has been in the United States to build consumer awareness and trial for our new Recipe Inspirations and Perfect Pinch products and set the stage for their future growth. We gained excellent retailer acceptance and placement for these products in the first quarter and followed that with media advertising in the second quarter. 
Scanner data for May showed that all six varieties of Recipe Inspirations ranked in the top 40% of McCormick blends with Rosemary Roasted Chicken ranking in the top 50 items for the total spice and seasoning category. That means that it turned at a rate comparable to our Grill Mates seasoning blends and did so during Grill Mates' peak selling period. 
Other marketing and new product activity in the quarter featured Grill Mates, Simply Asia, Flavorful in the U.K., Sauces in China and Rice Cookers in Australia. Gordon will have more to share on these in his remarks. 
Let me comment next on our progress towards improving the margins of our Industrial business. Industrial business operating income margin for fiscal year 2009 was 6.7%, and if you recall, included cost related to the 2009 bankruptcy of our primary food service distributor in the U.K., which were recorded in the second quarter. Year-to-date in 2010, operating income margin for this part of our business was 7.7%. 
As you can see from the graph on Slide 8, we are definitely moving in the right direction with the improvement driven by both CCI-led cost savings and the more favorable product and customer mix. For example, employees at our condiment plant in the United Kingdom have made great strides toward increasing the efficiency of that operation. Operating at a lower cost is enabling us to both improve margins and compete more effectively. We're making good progress toward our goal of 9% to 10% operating income margin for our Industrial business by 2013. 
I mentioned CCI, our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program, as a factor behind these results. Employees are increasing productivity, not only in the U.K., but across all of our operations. Many of our manufacturing facilities have high-performance work systems in place as we discussed in our 2010 Investor Conference, engaging employees at all levels in the CCI program. With CCI, we are also lowering cost by buying more effectively, applying tools and technology and streamlining processes. 
On Tuesday, we announced that the board authorized a $400 million share repurchase program. At quarter end, $33 million remained on the prior authorization. Along with our increased dividends, we view share repurchases as an important element of our return to shareholders. Between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned more than $1 billion of cash to our shareholders in the past five years. 
Since the acquisition of Lawry's, we've made steady progress toward reducing our debt levels, and in the fourth quarter, expect to increase the pace of our repurchase activity. By the end of fiscal year 2010, we expect to have spent between $50 million to $100 million on share repurchases. 
As we've stated in the past, over time, we expect our program to reduce shares outstanding by about 2% annually in the absence of significant acquisition activity. Priorities for cash continue to be our dividend payment and the acquisition of strong brands. In the absence of acquisition activity, we will use a portion of cash to repurchase shares.
Let me summarize. As we head into the second half, the economic environment remains uncertain, and we will continue to face challenges. At McCormick, we have become increasingly adept at working through these challenges while gaining good traction with our growth initiatives and CCI program. 
I'll conclude my remarks with a sincere thanks to McCormick employees around the world for their commitment and talent, their agility in managing this business and their ability to achieve great results. Gordon, let me turn it over to you at this point, and I'll come back into the conversation for Q&A."
181176,107513702,66318,"McCormick & Co. Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jun 24, 2010",2010-06-24,"Earnings Calls","McCormick & Company, Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide some additional details behind our second quarter financial results and begin with a look at our Consumer business and top line growth on Slide 11. In the Americas region, sales rose 4%, and in lo",1520,"Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide some additional details behind our second quarter financial results and begin with a look at our Consumer business and top line growth on Slide 11. 
In the Americas region, sales rose 4%, and in local currency, the increase was 2% due to favorable volume and product mix. An important part of the second quarter sales increase came from Recipe Inspirations and Perfect Pinch. And for a number of other products, the positive results we reported in the first quarter extended into the second quarter. For example, in the U.S., we had another quarter of increased sales of our spices and herbs, which outpaced the sales growth rate of the private label items we supply. In addition, we achieved double-digit increases for Grill Mates, gourmet items and Simply Asia products. 
Also in the Americas, we had excellent growth during this period in Canada with promotions behind grilling products and new distribution gains for Billy Bee Honey. Consumer sales in EMEA were flat to the year-ago quarter and down 3% in local currency. Currency through the second quarter still had a positive impact. 
Sales this quarter were impacted by a significant decrease in several European markets struggling with severe economic declines. In these markets, we are seeing not only weak consumer demand but retailers pulling back on inventory levels. 
Our largest consumer markets in this region, France and the U.K., have fared better. We achieved volume growth through the first half, and while private label continues to outpace the growth of brands, the rate of increase has moderated in the latest period. Given this backdrop and recent trends, we remain cautious in the third and fourth quarter outlook for our Consumer business in EMEA. 
In the Asia/Pacific region, second quarter sales increased 22%, with strong growth in local currency of 7%. We grew volume and product mix in this market by 11% led by excellent results in China. 
In this country, we continue to gain distribution, including product placement and frequently shopped street markets. In addition, we have launched several new products, including Thai Chili Sauce, which plays to our strength in the bottled-sauce category at retail and is supported by a full-media campaign, and we have added new flavors of ice cream toppings to expand our number one position in this category. 
Operating income for our Consumer business was $68 million. Excluding restructuring charges recorded in the second quarter of 2009, operating income was down $3 million. This was due largely to the additional $7 million investment in marketing spend in the second quarter of 2010, which was directed toward building consumer awareness and trial of our new products. Income was favorably impacted during the quarter by higher sales and cost savings from CCI.
Turning to our Industrial business on Slide 13. We delivered $29 million of operating income. In comparison to the second quarter of 2009, we drove profit with higher sales and the productivity improvement that Alan discussed. This result also included $1 million of incremental marketing behind our food service brands. 
Let's take a look at the sales performance for this part of our business on Slide 14. Industrial sales in the Americas rose 2%, and in local currency, were down 1%. In response to lower commodity cost, primarily dairy ingredients, we passed through lower pricing for certain products during this period. 
We grew volume and product mix 2% with the introduction of new flavors sold to food manufacturers in the U.S. and in Mexico. We were also encouraged by an improvement in sales to food service distributors, as we roll out the new packaging phase of our McCormick for Chefs program. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by our pipeline of new products for both food manufacturers and food service customers in the Americas. 
In EMEA, industrial sales rose 22%, and in local currency, increased an impressive 12%. We grew sales to quick-service restaurants in this region, which continue to have good traffic and promotions that emphasize items we flavor. As in the Americas, we have a number of items such as sauces and other condiments in the pipeline. 
In the second quarter of 2010, sales also benefited from a recovery in branded food service products in the U.K. when compared to a period of disruption in the second quarter of 2009. Industrial sales rose 24% in the Asia/Pacific region, with a 13% increase in local currency led by growth in China. In this market, sales to quick-service restaurants were quite strong and included new product wins for chicken wing marinade, beverage flavors and other items. 
Our industrial team there has been extremely successful, with more than 50 items scheduled for launch this year. Across both segments, sales rose 5%, and in local currency, the increase was 2%. A 3% increase in volume and product mix was offset by reduced pricing, which primarily related to the pass-through of lower cost to industrial customers. 
Operating income for the total business was up 9%, excluding the impact of restructuring charges in the second quarter of 2009, as shown on Slide 16. Gross profit margin improvement was significant at 100 basis points for the quarter. This was ahead of our 50-basis-point projection for the year and an indication of the effectiveness of our CCI program and move toward a more favorable mix of products and customers.
SG&A as a percent of sales rose 60 basis points. A large part of the increase related to $8 million of incremental marketing support along with the higher cost of benefits and fuel. SG&A in the second quarter of 2009 included $7 million in cost related to the bankruptcy of our U.K. distributor. 
The tax rate in the second quarter of 2010 was 30.2%, comprised of a 33% underlying rate, net of discreet tax benefits. For the second half of 2010, we expect the tax rate to remain at 33%, which is an increase from our initial guidance of 32%.
Income from unconsolidated operations increased significantly as a result of our McCormick de Mexico joint venture, which had a large benefit from favorable soybean oil cost and foreign currency exchange rates through the first half. For the second quarter, sales from unconsolidated operations were up 11%. While we expect continued growth of these businesses in the second half, our projections do not include additional large variances from favorable input cost and currency.
Second quarter earnings per share were $0.49 compared to $0.38 in the prior year. On a comparable basis, excluding $0.04 of restructuring charges recorded in the second quarter of 2009, EPS rose 17%. This is an increase of $0.07, which included higher operating income, as well as $0.02 each from favorable tax rate and income from unconsolidated operations, offset in part by higher shares outstanding.
I'll comment briefly on cash flow. For the first half of 2010, cash flow from operations was $65 million compared to $97 million in the first half of 2009. While higher net income added $26 million to 2010, cash flow in the first half of 2009 included the benefit of a significant improvement in receivables. 
McCormick profit continues to bring focus to working capital, and business leaders are rewarded not only for strong operating income but also for their management of working capital. This has continued in 2010 as we work toward our 2012 goal to reduce the cash conversion cycle by another 10 days.
Let me wrap up with our latest outlook for 2010, as outlined on Slide 21. While earnings per share exceeded our expectations for the first half, we remain cautious as we move into the second half given the perspective on the global economy that Alan provided. We will continue to incur higher benefit cost primarily due to pension expense. In addition, our tax rate is expected to be at a higher level, and as I stated earlier, the steep increases in income from unconsolidated operations are expected to moderate. 
We are also seeing cost for some of our raw and packaging materials starting to rise, and as a further headwind, we expect currency exchange rates to have an unfavorable impact. So for the full year, we are maintaining our earnings per share range of $2.49 to $2.54, but now expect to be at the upper end of this range. We are also reaffirming 2% to 4% sales growth in local currency, but now project a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates based on prevailing rates. This assumes an unfavorable sales impact of 2% in the second half.
As for gross profit margin improvement, based on an excellent year-to-date result and current outlook, we expect to exceed 50 basis points and are on track to exceed $40 million in CCI-led cost savings. Both of these are increases from our initial projection.  As for incremental marketing expense, we still expect $20 million for the year, most of which occurred in the first half. Let me summarize by stating that we are pleased with our business performance and financial results through the first half and confident that 2010 will be a record year for McCormick."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong financial performance at McCormick. While the economy continues to be challenging and consumers in many of our markets remain cautious,",1884,"Thanks, Joyce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong financial performance at McCormick. While the economy continues to be challenging and consumers in many of our markets remain cautious, we achieved solid sales growth, exceptional margin improvement and a strong increase in profits. 
With the range of conditions across our major markets, our pace of sales growth vary by market. While the benefits of product innovation incremental marketing and expanded distribution have been offset in part by certain areas of weakness, we consider our year-to-date sales results a solid performance in today's environment.
During the same period, gross profit margin improvement has been tracking well ahead of our 50-basis-point objective, with gross profit margin up 130 basis points year-to-date. Our margin improvement has made its way to the bottom line, more than offsetting higher brand marketing support and increased pension cost. And as a result, we have increased EPS at a double-digit pace due to first three quarters when items affecting comparability are excluded.
This margin performance is being driven both by Comprehensive Continuous Improvement, our CCI program, and a more favorable mix of business. McCormick employees have made excellent progress in increasing productivity. Throughout our operations, we are buying more effectively, applying tools and technology and streamlining processes. We expect to surpass our initial goal to reduce cost by $35 million to $40 million in 2010 and now project at least $45 million in cost savings. We have CCI champions in place in all major locations, and they already have a list of projects ready for 2011.
We're also seeing a more favorable mix of business being achieved in two ways. First, consumer sales growth outpaced that of the Industrial business. With the inherently higher margin of our Consumer business relative to our Industrial business, this shift in mix is accretive to gross profit margin for the total company. 
The second aspect of favorable mix is within our Industrial business. For our fifth consecutive quarter, we've improved both the gross profit and operating income margins for this business when measured on a comparable basis. At the operating income line, Industrial business margins reached 8.9% for the third quarter and an 8.1% year-to-date for 2010. This is a result of stronger growth with higher margin products as well as the benefits of CCI-led cost savings. In summary, we're making excellent progress toward our longer-term goal of 9% to 10% operating income margin for the Industrial business.
Next, I'd like to share our perspective on conditions in each of our primary markets and provide an update on our growth initiatives beginning on Slide 7. In the Americas, we believe consumers remain cautious in their purchase decisions and meal choices. As you would expect, we've had good success in the past quarters as we stepped up our coupon and other brand-value messages. And you'll see more of that in the fourth quarter, but we have a lot more underway for the holiday period.
In the U.S., we've gained good traction with our latest product introductions. Backed by a significant ad campaign in the second quarter and with plans again to run again in the fourth quarter, all varieties of Recipe Inspirations have made it in to the top 40% of McCormick blends. 
In 2011, we'll introduce World Flavors, six additional items that offer consumers a low-risk way to prepare restaurant-style ethnic foods  at home.  Some retailers have given Recipe Inspirations secondary placement in the meat section, and others have already accepted all six World Flavors.
Other new products in the U.S. build up our strong consumer franchise for grinders, salad toppings and grilling. In addition, we just introduced our Flavor Forecast Holiday Edition, which is already getting a lot of attention in the media. And for the first time, we're going to run advertising for Thanksgiving that is distinct from our Christmas ads in the U.S.  
In Canada, we revitalized our Club House brand recipe mixes in 2009, exceeding a 50% category share for the first time. In 2010, we're revitalizing our spices and seasonings with new labels, new varieties and marketing support. 
Another area of strength this year has been our sales of ethnic foods in the United States, especially Hispanic items, which were up again in the third quarter. This is a business largely built on authentic Hispanic products and the imports of mayonnaise and other crop items from our joint venture in Mexico.  In 2010, we'll begin to import tea from Mexico and recently added the El Bravo brand of Hispanic products to our portfolio. This was an $11 million acquisition completed in early September.
Beyond Hispanic products, we're extending our Simply Asia brand to dipping sauces and Zatarain’s to frozen entrees, which have gained distribution nationally with a leading warehouse club. While not included in our Consumer business results for the Americas, our joint venture in Mexico has grown sales at a double-digit pace this year, and profit has more than doubled due in part to some favorable soybean prices.
On the Industrial side of our business, in the Americas, product innovation for food manufacturers has been up in 2010 as evidenced by a number of new seasoning blends and flavors in U.S. and Mexico. On the Food Service side, sales were a bit weak in comparison to the third quarter of 2009, which had the benefit of some large, new product launches by quick-service restaurants. We are encouraged by our 2011 pipeline of product innovation for these customers.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, our two largest markets are U.K. and France. In each of these countries, we've seen retail sales growth of our branded spices and herbs outpace private label in the most recent period. Our innovation and marketing have emphasized differentiated products, like Perfect Shake's seasoning blends, Flavorful recipe mixes and Ducros grinders. Perfect Shake is modeling the success of our Perfect Pinch line in the U.S. and has delivered double-digit sales growth of seasoning blends in the U.K.
Incremental marketing in the fourth quarter will be behind these types of products as well as our Vahiné line of homemade desserts. Ready for launch as we head into 2011, our Schwartz recipe mixes for vegetables and a full range of Slow Cookers. In France, we're introducing four new Ducros grinders, seven additional Ducros herbs and spices and three varieties of Pâtissierie Vahiné dessert mixes.  While we've had more steady sales growth in the U.K. and France, we continue to face slower Consumer business sales in some of our smaller markets where the economy is particularly weak.
Industrial sales in Europe had been robust in 2010. This has been driven by good growth opportunities with quick-service restaurants, which have maintained traffic with value pricing and promotions. And our sales to food manufacturers have grown as some of this leading customers expand geographically into markets in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.
The last comment I wanted to make about EMEA relates to a joint venture agreement in Turkey. This is a market where we have operated successfully with an industrial joint venture partner since 1996. Earlier in September, we signed an agreement with Yildiz Holding, a leading food manufacturer in Turkey. Together, our goal is to build a leading brand of spices, herbs and seasoning products in Turkey. We're excited about this opportunity to build a Consumer business in a promising market.
Turning to the Asia/Pacific region, during the third quarter, we were pleased to reach an agreement to purchase a 26% stake in Eastern Condiments for approximately $35 million. We expect to close in this joint venture by the end of 2010. Eastern is a leading brand of spices, seasonings and other food-related products in India and the Middle East. Sales have grown more than 25% on average across the past three years and are approaching $70 million annually. This is a great point of entry into an attractive consumer market and one that complements our just existing joint venture, which was formed more than 10 years ago to source and process spices in India. China and Southeast Asia offer substantial opportunities for growth in both grocery and food service channels. 
In our Consumer business in China, we've introduced new products such as Thai Chili Sauce, expanded our distribution and increased our advertising campaigns all supported by a new team of experienced brand marketers. Our industrial team in this region has gained new distribution to global food manufacturers, most recently with condiments and continues to follow the steady growth of quick-service restaurants. We're a top supplier to these customers, adding flavor to a wide range of menu items, including beverages, ice cream and chicken.
While the economy in Australia has been quite resilient, it's a tough highly concentrated retail market. Our focus there remains on bringing innovation to these categories, where we have a leading brand position. For example, new products under our popular Aeroplane brand have taken our share of the gelatin category in Australia above 70% and it's now approaching 80%.
Across all regions, the Americas, EMEA and Asia/Pacific, we're facing rising input costs, including pepper, garlic and a number of other spices and herbs. We've already taken a price increase on pepper in the U.S. Consumer business and are evaluating additional increases in the Americas and international markets as we head into 2011.
The last topic that I'd like to cover before turning it over to Gordon relates to cash. Those of you who follow us closely know that cash flow typically begins to build in the third quarter and peaks in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We've nearly completed our rapid paydown of debt related to the Lawry's acquisition and have resumed our share repurchase activity. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased $32 million of shares, and in September, completed the $400 million share repurchase program authorized in June 2005. We're now repurchasing shares under the new $400 million share repurchase program. Through the first three quarters, we spent $38 million in share repurchases and expect to continue at a steady pace into the fourth quarter, reaching at least $75 million of share repurchases for the fiscal year. By year end, other uses of cash in 2010 are expected to include, not only share repurchases, but dividends, capital expenditures, debt repayment and acquisitions with the purchase of El Bravo and the anticipated closure of the Eastern joint venture.
To summarize, we're operating successfully in the midst of a tough global economy with consumer still under pressure in many of our primary markets. We're growing sales with effective marketing, on-trend new products and increased distribution. 
Our CCI program and business mix are improving margins throughout the business. This is our fuel for growth and a driver behind higher profit and strong cash flow.  As we head into our fourth quarter, we're well positioned for this important holiday period and on track for a record performance in 2010. 
Let me conclude my remarks with a sincere thanks to McCormick employees around the world for their commitment and talent, their passion for flavor and a demonstrated agility in managing our business and their ability to achieve great results. 
Gordon, I'll turn it over to you at this point and join back in for Q&A."

We are extremely pleased with our latest financial results. Clearly, improved margin and higher profits were the headline news this quarter. We also had some areas of solid sales growth as well as parts of the bus",1619,"Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. We are extremely pleased with our latest financial results. Clearly, improved margin and higher profits were the headline news this quarter. We also had some areas of solid sales growth as well as parts of the business that remain under pressure. For the total company, sales rose 0.4% and in local currency, we're up 1.5%, due primarily to favorable volume and product mix.
As indicated on Slide 15, in the Americas region, Consumer business sales rose 4%, and in local currency, grew 3%. Incremental sales from new products, particularly Recipe Inspirations, drove favorable volume and product mix along with increased sales of Hispanic products and Lawry’s items. 
Sales from the Sam's Club lead market and distribution gains for Billy Bee Honey in Canada also added to sales volume and product mix.  Pricing in this region was also favorable in the third quarter. While the pepper increase that Alan mentioned had a minimal impact on sales, we had a favorable net sales impact from lower coupon activity in comparison to the prior-year period. Although on a year-to-date basis, we're about even with last year's coupon expense.
Consumer sales in EMEA declined 10% from the year-ago quarter with a 1% decrease in local currency. Sales in France remained strong this period with the Ducros brand outperforming the category. In our other large market, the U.K., we are growing sales with new products, such as Perfect Shake and our Flavorful range, and we were recently awarded new distribution in the convenience store channel.
In the fourth quarter, our marketing focus will be on both the U.K. and France with an emphasis on new products and incremental brand support. The third quarter sales increases in our primary markets were offset again this quarter by lower sales in our smaller markets, which account for about 20% of consumer sales in the EMEA region.
In the Asia/Pacific region, we had an excellent quarter, with an 11% increase in consumer sales. In local currency, sales were up 7%. We grew volume and product mix in China through new products, like Thai Chili Sauce, as well as greater market penetration and increased consumer demand. Sales in this market were up 15%.
Operating income, excluding restructuring charges for our Consumer business, was $96 million, an increase of 8% from the third quarter of 2009. We achieved this increase through CCI-led cost savings as well as higher sales. While brand marketing support was down $2 million this period, we have increases planned for the fourth quarter and are on track for our targeted $20 million of additional spending for the fiscal year.
Turning to our Industrial business, we delivered $30 million in operating income, excluding restructuring charges, an increase of 6%. A more favorable business mix and productivity improvements are leading to higher operating income and operating income margin, which was nearly 9% for the third quarter.
Let's take a look at the sales performance for this part of our business on Slide 18. Industrial sales in the Americas declined 1%, and in local currency, we're down 2%. In response to lower commodity costs primarily dairy ingredients, we passed through lower pricing for certain products during this period. This lead to a price reduction of 3%. 
We grew sales volume and product mix with new seasonings and flavors to food manufacturers in the U.S. and Mexico. These gains were largely offset by weak sales to food service customers in comparison to a period of strong new product launches by quick-service restaurants in the third quarter of 2009. As Alan noted, we have some promising products in the pipeline for these customers and are excited about their launch in 2011.
In EMEA, Industrial sales declined 3%, but in local currency, grew 5%. Sales to quick-service restaurants continue to be strong in this region, and we are growing sales of seasonings and other products to major food manufacturers as they expand geographically. In the third quarter, we also benefited from a recovery in branded food service products in the U.K. when compared to a period of weakness in the third quarter of 2009.
Industrial sales rose 10% in the Asia/Pacific region with a 7% increase in local currency. This increase was led by excellent growth in China as a result of new product wins with quick-service restaurants for chicken wing marinade, beverage flavors and other items. We also developed condiments for a major food manufacturer that were recently launched in this market.
For the total business, operating income rose 7%, excluding the impact of restructuring charges in the third quarter of 2009 as shown on Slide 19. Gross profit margin improvement was a significant part of this increase, up 180 basis points for the quarter and up 130 basis points year-to-date. This was well ahead of our 50-basis-point projection for the year and an indication of the effectiveness of our CCI program and our efforts to achieve a more favorable mix of products and customers. SG&A as a percent of sales rose 70 basis points due largely to the higher cost of benefits. 
Turning to taxes. Discrete tax items and a lower underlying rate added $17 million to net income. Of this amount, $14 million related to the reversal of a significant tax accrual for a closed tax year, which is a noncash item. This tax accrual was recorded based on uncertainties about the tax aspects of transactions where the company reorganized its European operations and divested certain joint ventures. 
This reversal increased earnings per share by $0.10 in the third quarter. We are providing you with non-GAAP results that exclude the impact of the reversal of this $14 million tax accrual to allow for a better comparison to prior years and as a more appropriate starting point for 2011 projections.
Excluding this and other discrete tax benefits, our underlying tax rate for 2010 is now 32% based on the mix of earnings across our various tax jurisdictions and projected tax credits in the U.S. This is down from the rate of 33% that we provided in our June call.
Income from unconsolidated operations increased significantly again this quarter as a result of our McCormick de Mexico joint venture. This business grew sales 13% and effectively managed through a period of soybean oil volatility, a key ingredient for the leading product mayonnaise. We believe income from unconsolidated operations could reach a record $25 million in this fiscal year. 
As outlined on Slide 22, third quarter earnings per share were $0.76 compared to $0.57 in the prior year. On a comparable basis, excluding $0.10 from the significant tax items in the third quarter of 2010, EPS rose 17%. This was an increase of $0.09 and was due primarily to higher operating income as well as $0.03 of higher income from unconsolidated operations and a $0.02 impact from additional tax rate items, offset slightly by higher shares outstanding. Note that in the third quarter of 2009, we had minimal restructuring charges.
I'll comment briefly on cash flow. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $145 million in 2010 compared to $195 million in the first three quarters of 2009. While higher net income added $53 million in 2010, this was more than offset by an increase in operating assets and liabilities. 
McCormick profit continues to bring focus to working capital, and business leaders are rewarded not only for strong operating income, but also for their management of working capital. This focus has continued in 2010 as we work toward our 2012 goal to reduce the cash conversion cycle by another 10 days. 
However, our inventory levels were up at the end of the third quarter. This was due in part to certain inventory positions we have taken, some buildup of inventory prior to an SAP implementation in Asia and higher raw material costs. Working to lower our inventory levels is a particular focus for me and the rest of the organization heading into 2011.
As Alan stated share repurchases totaled $38 million year-to-date. We also used cash largely for dividends, capital expenditures and debt paydown.
Let me wrap up with our latest outlook for 2010. Based on our strong year-to-date profit and margin performance, we are raising our guidance. Gross profit margin has been tracking well ahead of our 50-basis-point objective, with a 130-basis-point increase through the first three quarters. For the full year, we are projecting roughly 100 basis points of improvement. This strong improvement is due in large part to our above-target CCI-driven cost savings as well as favorable business mix.
On a comparable basis, which excludes the favorable tax reversal recorded in 2010 and restructuring charges recorded in 2009, we now expect to increase earnings per share in the range of 9% to 11%. This is up from our initial guidance of 6% to 8% and right in line with our long-term objectives. Keep in mind that our EPS guidance continues to include $20 million of incremental marketing programs and $15 million in higher pension expense.
For the fourth quarter, Alan outlined our latest marketing plans, which along with distribution gains and product innovation, have us poised for a solid sales performance. While increased brand support, higher input costs and unfavorable currency exchange rate will affect EPS growth, we expect to be at or above the excellent profit performance achieved in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Let me summarize our remarks by stating that we are on track for 2010 to be a record year for McCormick, which is right in line with our long-term profit growth objective. Alan and I look forward to sharing our fourth quarter results with you in January along with our outlook for 2011. Operator, we'll take the first question."

181176,109790282,79419,"McCormick & Co. Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Sep 30, 2010",2010-09-30,"Earnings Calls","McCormick & Company, Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Joyce. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong financial performance at McCormick. While the economy continues to be challenging, and consumers in many of our markets remain cautious,",1902,"Thanks, Joyce. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong financial performance at McCormick. While the economy continues to be challenging, and consumers in many of our markets remain cautious, we achieved solid sales growth, exceptional margin improvement and a strong increase in profits.
With the range of conditions across our major markets, our pace of sales growth vary by market. While the benefits of product innovation, incremental marketing and expanded distribution have been offset in part by certain areas of weakness, we consider our year-to-date sales result a solid performance in today's environment.
During the same period, gross profit margin improvement has been tracking well ahead of our 50 basis point objective, with gross profit margin up 130 basis points year-to-date. Our margin improvement has made its way to the bottom line, more than offsetting higher brand marketing support and increased pension cost, and as a result, we have increased EPS at a double digit pace through the first three quarters when items affecting comparability are excluded.
This margin performance is being driven both by Comprehensive Continuous Improvement, our CCI program and a more favorable mix of business. McCormick employees have made excellent progress in increasing productivity. Throughout our operations, we are buying more effectively, applying tools and technology and streamlining processes.
We expect to surpass our initial goal to reduce cost by $35 to $40 million in 2010, and now project at least $45 million in cost savings. We have CCI champions in place in all major locations, and they already have a list of projects ready for 2011.
We are also seeing a more favorable mix of business being achieved in two ways. First, consumer sales growth outpaced that of the industrial business. With the inherently higher margin of our consumer business relative to our industrial business, this shift in mix is accretive to gross profit margin for the total company.
The second aspect of favorable mix is within our industrial business. For a fifth consecutive quarter, we have improved both the gross profit and operating income margins for this business when measured on a comparable basis. At the operating income line, industrial business margins reached 8.9% for the third quarter and an 8.1% year-to-date for 2010.
This is a result of stronger growth with higher margin products as well as the benefits of CCI-led cost savings.
In summary, we are making excellent progress toward our longer term goal of 9% to 10% operating income margin for the industrial business.
Next, I'd like to share our perspective on conditions in each of our primary markets and provide an update on our growth initiatives beginning on slide 7. In the Americas, we believe consumers remain cautious in their purchase decisions and meal choices. As you would expect, we've had good success in the past quarters as we stepped up our coupon and other brand value messages. And you'll see more of that in the fourth quarter.
Well, we have a lot more underway for the holiday period. In the U.S. we've gained good traction with our latest product introductions. Backed by a significant ad campaign in the second quarter and the plans again to run again in the fourth quarter, all varieties of recipe inspiration have made it into the top 40% of McCormick blends.
In 2011 we'll introduce World Flavors, six additional items that offer consumers a low-risk way to prepare (Restaurant-Sauvé) ethnic foods at home. Some retailers have recipe inspiration secondary placement in the meat section, and others have already accepted all six World Flavors.
Other new products in the U.S. build up our strong consumer franchise for grinders, salad toppings and grilling. In addition, we just introduced our Flavor Forecast - Holiday Edition! which is already getting a lot of attention in the media. And for the first time, we are going to run advertising for Thanksgiving that is distinct from our Christmas ads in the U.S.
In Canada, we revitalized our Club House brand recipe mixes in 2009, exceeding a 50% category share for the first time. In 2010 we are revitalizing our spices and seasonings with new labels, new varieties, and marketing support.
Another area of strength this year has been our sales of ethnic foods in the United States, especially Hispanic items which were up again in the third quarter. This is a business largely built on authentic Hispanic products and the imports of mayonnaise and other items from our joint venture in Mexico.
In 2010 we began to import tea from Mexico and recently added the El Bravo brand of Hispanic products to our portfolio. This was an $11 million acquisition completed in early September.
Beyond Hispanic products, we are extending our Simply Asia brand to dipping sauces and Zatarain's to frozen entrees which have gained distribution nationally with a leading Red House Club.
While not included in our consumer business results for the Americas, our joint venture in Mexico has grown sales at a double digit pace this year. And profit has more than double, due in part to some favorable soybean prices. On the industrial side of our business, in the Americas, product innovation for food manufacturers has been up in 2010 as evidenced by number of new seasoning blends and flavors in U.S. and Mexico.
On the Food Service side, sales were a bit weak in comparison to the third quarter 2009 which had the benefit of some large new product launches by quick service restaurants. We are encouraged by our 2011 pipeline of product innovation for these customers.
In Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, our two largest markets are U.K. and France. In each of these countries, we've seen retail sales growth of our branded spices and herbs outpace private label in the most recent period.
Our innovations in marketing have emphasized differentiated products like Perfect Shake seasoning blends, Flavorful recipe mixes and Ducros grinders.
Perfect Shake is modeled on the success of our Perfect Pinch line in U.S. and has delivered double digit sales growth of seasoning blends in the U.K.
Incremental Marketing in the fourth quarter will be behind these types of products as well as our Vahine line of homemade desserts. Ready for launch as we had into 2011, our Schwartz recipe mixes for vegetables and a full range of Slow Cookers.
In France we are introducing four new Ducros grinders, seven additional Ducros herbs and spices, and three varieties of Pattiserie Vahine dessert mixes.
While we've had more steady sales growth in the U.K. and France, we continue to face slower consumer business sales in some of our smaller markets where the economy is particularly weak.
Industrial sales in Europe had been robust in 2010. This has been driven good growth opportunities with quick service restaurants, which have maintained traffic with value pricing and promotions. And our sales to food manufacturers have grown as some of these leading customers expand geographically into markets in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.
The last comment I wanted to make about EMEA relates to a joint venture agreement in agreement in Turkey. This is a market where we have operated successfully with an industrial joint venture partner since 1996.
Earlier in September, we signed an agreement with Yildiz Holding, a leading food manufacturer in Turkey. Together our goal is to build a leading brand of spices herbs and seasoning products in Turkey. We are excited about this opportunity to build a consumer business in a promising market.
Turning to Asia-Pacific region, during the third quarter, we were pleased to reach an agreement to purchase 26% stake in Eastern Condiment for approximately $35 million. We expect to close on this joint venture by the end of 2010.
Eastern is a leading brand of spices, seasonings, and other food related products in India and the Middle East.
Sales have grown more than 25% on average across the past three years and we are approaching $70 million annually. This is a great point of entry into an attractive consumer market. And when the complements are existing joint ventures which was four more than ten years ago to source and process spices in India.
China in South-East Asia offer substantial opportunities for growth in both grocery and food service channels. In our consumer business in china, we've introduced new products such as Thai chili sauce, expanded our distribution and increased our advertising campaigns, all supported by a new team of experienced brand marketers.
Our industrial team in this region, has gained new distribution to global food manufacturers most recently with Condiments, and continues to follow the steady growth of quick service restaurants.
We are a top supplier to these customers, adding flavor to a wide range of menu items, including beverages, ice-cream and chicken.
While the economy in Australia has been quite resilient, it's a tough, highly concentrated retail market. Our focus there remains in bringing innovations to these categories where we have a leading brand position.
For example, new products under our popular Aeroplane brand have taken our share of the gelatin category in Australia above 70%, and it's now approaching 80%. Across all regions, the Americas, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific, we are facing rising input cost including pepper, garlic and a number of others spices and herbs. We've already taken a price increase on pepper in the U.S. consumer business, and are evaluating additional increases in the Americas and international markets as we had in 2011.
The last topic that I would like to cover before turning it over to Gordon, relates to cash. Those of you who follow us closely know that cash flow typically begins to build in the third quarter and peaks in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.
We've nearly completed a rapid pay down of debt related to the Lawry's acquisition and have resumed our share repurchase activity.
During the third quarter, we repurchased $32 million of shares, and in September, completed the $400 million share repurchase program authorized in June of 2005.
We are now repurchasing shares under the new $400 million dollar share repurchase program. Through the first three quarters, we spent $38 million on share repurchases and expect to continue at a steady pace into the fourth quarter, reaching at least $75 million of share repurchases for the fiscal year.
By year end, other uses of cash in 2010 are expected to include not only share repurchases, but dividends, capital expenditures, debt repayment and acquisitions with the purchase of El Bravo and the anticipated closure of the eastern joint venture.
To summarize, we're operating successfully in the midst of a tough global economy with consumers still under pressure in many of our primary markets. We're growing sales with effective marketing, entrée'ing new products and increased distribution. Our CCI program and business mix are improving margins throughout the business.
This is our fuel for growth and a driver behind higher profit, ensuring cash flow. As we head into our fourth quarter, we're well positioned for this important holiday period and on track for a record performance in 2010.
Let me conclude my remarks with a sincere thanks to McCormick employees around the world for their commitment and talent, their passion for flavor, and a demonstrated agility in managing our business and their ability to achieve great results.
Gordon, I'll turn it over to you at this point and join back in for Q&A.

Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Sep 30, 2010",2010-09-30,"Earnings Calls","McCormick & Company, Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Alan, and good morning everyone. We are extremely pleased with our latest financial results. Clearly, improved margins and higher profits were the headline news this quarter. We also had some areas of solid sales growth as well as parts of the bus",1636,"Thanks, Alan, and good morning everyone. We are extremely pleased with our latest financial results. Clearly, improved margins and higher profits were the headline news this quarter. We also had some areas of solid sales growth as well as parts of the business that remained under pressure.
For the total company, sales rose 0.4% and in local currency were up 1.5% due primarily to favorable volume and product mix. As indicated on Slide 15, in the Americas region, consumer business sales rose 4% and in local currency grew 3%.
Incremental sales from new products, particularly Recipe Inspirations drove favorable volume and product mix along with increased sales of Hispanic products and Lawry's items. Sales from the Sam's Club lead market and distribution gains for Billy Bee Honey in Canada also added to sales volume and product mix.
Spicing in this region was also favorable in the third quarter. While the Pepper increase that Alan mentioned had a minimal impact on sales, we had a favorable net sales impact from lower food productivity in comparison to the prior year period, although on a year-to-date basis we are about even with last year's coupon expense.
Consumer sales in EMEA declined 10% from the year-ago quarter with a 1% decrease in local currency. Sales in France remained strong this period with the Ducros brand outperforming the category. In our other large market, the U.K., we are growing sales with new products such as Perfect Shake and our Flavorful range, and we were recently awarded new distribution in the Convenience Store channel.
In the fourth quarter, our marketing focus will be on both the U.K. and France with an emphasis on new products and incremental brand support. The third quarter sales increases in our primary markets were offset again this quarter by lower sales in our smaller markets which account for about 20% of consumer sales in the EMEA region.
In the Asia-Pacific region, we had an excellent quarter with an 11% increase in consumer sales. In local currency, sales were up 7%. We grew volume and product mix in China through new products like Thai Chili Sauce, as well as greater market penetration and increased consumer demand. Sales in this market were up 15%.
Operating income, excluding restructuring charges for our consumer business was $96 million, an increase of 8% from the third quarter of 2009. We achieved this increase through CCI-led cost savings as well as higher sales. While brand marketing support was down $2 million this period, we have increases planned for the fourth quarter, and are on track for our targeted $20 million of additional spending for the fiscal year.
Turning to our industrial business, we delivered $30 million in operating income, excluding restructuring charges, an increase of 6%. And more favorable business mix and productivity improvements are leading to higher operating income and operating income margin, which was nearly 9% for the third quarter.
Let's take a look at the sales performance for this part of our business on Slide 18. Industrial sales in the Americas declined 1% and in local currency were down 2%. In response to lower commodity costs, primarily dairy ingredients, we passed through lower pricing for certain products during this period. This led to a price reduction of 3%.
We grew sales volume and product mix with new seasonings and flavors to food manufacturers in the U.S. and Mexico. The sales were largely offset by weak sales to food service customers in comparison to a period of strong new product launches by quick service restaurants in the third quarter of 2009.
As Alan noted, we have some promising products in the pipeline for these customers and are excited about their launch in 2011.
In EMEA, industrial sales declined 3% but in local currency grew 5%. Sales to quick service restaurants continue to be strong in this region, and we are growing sales of seasonings and other products to major food manufacturers as they expand geographically. In the third quarter, we also benefited from a recovery in branded food service products in the U.K. when compared to a period of weakness in the third quarter of 2009.
Industrial sales rose 10% in the Asia Pacific region with a 7% increase in local currency. This increase was led by excellent growth in China as a result of new product wins with quick service restaurants for chicken wing marinades, beverage flavors and other items. We also developed condiments for a major food manufacturer that we recently launched in this market.
For the total business, operating income rose 7%, excluding the impact of restructuring charges in the third quarter of 2009, as shown on Slide 19. Gross profit margin improvement was a significant part of this increase, up 180 basis points for the quarter, and up 130 basis points year-to-date. This was well ahead of our 50 basis point projection for the year, and an indication of the effectiveness of our CCI program and our efforts to achieve a more favorable mix of products and customers.
SG&A as a percent of sales rose 70 basis points, due largely to the higher cost of benefits. Turning to taxes, discrete tax items and a lower underlying rate added $17 million to net income. Of this amount, $14 million related to the reversal of a significant tax accrual for a closed tax year, which is a non-cash item.
This tax accrual was reported based on uncertainties about the tax aspects of transactions where the company reorganized its European operations and divested certain joint ventures. This reversal increased earnings per share by $0.10 in the third quarter. We are providing you with non-GAAP results that exclude the impact of the reversal of this $14 million tax accrual to allow for a better comparison to prior years, and as a more appropriate starting point for 2011 projections.
Excluding this and other discrete tax benefits, our underlying tax rate for 2010 is now 32%, based on the mix of earnings across our various tax jurisdictions and projected tax credits in the U.S. This is down from the rate of 33% that we provided in our June call.
Income from unconsolidated operations increased significantly again this quarter as a result of our McCormick to Mexico joint venture. This business grew sales 13% and effectively managed through a period of soybean oil volatility, a key ingredient for the leading product, mayonnaise. We believe income from unconsolidated operations could reach a record $25 million in this fiscal year.
As outlined on Slide 22, third quarter earnings per share were $0.76 compared to $0.57 in the prior year. On a comparable basis, excluding $0.10 from the significant tax item in the third quarter of 2010, EPS rose 17%. This was an increase of $0.09 and was due primarily to higher operating income, as well as $0.03 of higher income from unconsolidated operations and $0.02 impact from additional tax rate items, offset slightly by higher shares outstanding. Note that in the third quarter of 2009, we had minimal restructuring charges.
I'll comment briefly on cash flow. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $145 million in 2010 compared to $195 million in the first three quarters of 2009. While higher net income added $53 million in 2010, this was more than offset by an increase in operating assets and liabilities.
McCormick profit continues to bring focus to working capital, and business leaders are rewarded not only for strong operating income, but also for their management of working capital. This focus has continued in 2010, as we work toward our 2012 goal to reduce the cash conversion cycle by another 10 days.
However, our inventory levels were up at the end of the third quarter. This was due in part to certain inventory positions we have taken, some build up of inventory prior to an SAP implementation in Asia and higher raw material costs. Working to lower our inventory levels is a particular focus for me and the rest of the organization heading into 2011.
As Alan stated, share repurchases total $38 million year-to-date. We also used cash largely for dividends, capital expenditures and debt pay down.
Let me wrap up with our latest outlook for 2010. Based on our strong year-to-date profit and margin performance, we are raising our guidance. Gross profit margin has been tracking well ahead of our 50 basis point objective, with a 130 basis point increase through the first three quarters. For the full year, we are projecting roughly a 100 basis points of improvement. This strong improvement is due in large part to our above target CCI-driven cost savings as well as favorable business mix.
On a comparable basis, which excludes the favorable tax reversal recorded in 2010 and restructuring charges recorded in 2009, we now expect to increase earnings per share in the range of 9% to 11%. This is up from our initial guidance of 6% to 8%, and right in line with our long term objectives. Keep in mind that our EPS guidance continues to include $20 million of incremental marketing programs and $15 million in higher pension expense.
For the fourth quarter, Alan outlined our latest marketing plans, which along with distribution gains and product innovation have us poised for a solid sales performance. While increased brand support, higher input costs and unfavorable currency exchange rate will effect EPS growth, we expect to be at or above the excellent profit performance achieved in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Let me summarize our remarks by stating that we are on track for 2010 to be a record year for McCormick, which is right in line with our long term profit growth objective. Alan and I look forward to sharing our fourth quarter results with you in January, along with our outlook for 2011.
Operator, we'll take the first question.

Over the last couple of years, we have really increased the percentage of spend against things like social media and reaching consumers in different ways. And we're going to continue to beat that up. We're active on all the networks like Facebook and Twitter, and reaching directly to one-on-one with consumers.
In terms of how we're also dealing that with our retailers, we're working with them and making sure that our products for future and recipe, so before the consumer gets to the store they're thinking about our products. And so it's a combination of reaching directly to consumers with our marketing efforts and working with customers on shopper marketing to make sure that our brands are preferred.
In terms of direct sales to consumers through the internet, that's not something that we're aggressively doing. Certainly in areas where certain products aren't available, we make those available on the internet but it's not a heavy emphasis for us internally. I think I'm getting of what you're asking.

And as we're looking at what we're going to do over the next year, we're considering all those things. What we have to do to recover cost. Offset obviously by our savings programs and then the impact that we'll get on volume and then the investment we'll need to make in advertising and promotion to keep the consumers coming.

So I'd say, we're not setting a new goal out there, but we're real happy with where we're at.

Our Recipe Inspiration is a great example of that where if you look at it on a per ounce for the spices, its fairly significant, but if you look at it on an absolute price point versus buying five or seven bottles of spice, it's a real value to the consumer. So it's a way of making sure you're delivering value, and taking the opportunity to improve margins along the way. The ringbacks are pretty good.

181176,109790282,79421,"McCormick & Co. Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Sep 30, 2010",2010-09-30,"Earnings Calls","McCormick & Company, Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Joyce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong financial performance at McCormick. While the economy continues to be challenging and consumers in many of our markets remain cautious,",1884,"Thanks, Joyce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong financial performance at McCormick. While the economy continues to be challenging and consumers in many of our markets remain cautious, we achieved solid sales growth, exceptional margin improvement and a strong increase in profits. 
With the range of conditions across our major markets, our pace of sales growth vary by market. While the benefits of product innovation, incremental marketing and expanded distribution have been offset in part by certain areas of weakness, we consider our year-to-date sales results a solid performance in today's environment.
During the same period, gross profit margin improvement has been tracking well ahead of our 50-basis-point objective, with gross profit margin up 130 basis points year-to-date. Our margin improvement has made its way to the bottom line, more than offsetting higher brand marketing support and increased pension cost. And as a result, we have increased EPS at a double-digit pace through the first three quarters when items affecting comparability are excluded.
This margin performance is being driven both by Comprehensive Continuous Improvement, our CCI program, and a more favorable mix of business. McCormick employees have made excellent progress in increasing productivity. Throughout our operations, we are buying more effectively, applying tools and technology and streamlining processes. We expect to surpass our initial goal to reduce cost by $35 million to $40 million in 2010 and now project at least $45 million in cost savings. We have CCI champions in place in all major locations, and they already have a list of projects ready for 2011.
We're also seeing a more favorable mix of business being achieved in two ways. First, consumer sales growth outpaced that of the Industrial business. With the inherently higher margin of our Consumer business relative to our Industrial business, this shift in mix is accretive to gross profit margin for the total company. 
The second aspect of favorable mix is within our Industrial business. For our fifth consecutive quarter, we've improved both the gross profit and operating income margins for this business when measured on a comparable basis. At the operating income line, Industrial business margins reached 8.9% for the third quarter and an 8.1% year-to-date for 2010. This is a result of stronger growth with higher margin products as well as the benefits of CCI-led cost savings. In summary, we're making excellent progress toward our longer-term goal of 9% to 10% operating income margin for the Industrial business.
Next, I'd like to share our perspective on conditions in each of our primary markets and provide an update on our growth initiatives beginning on Slide 7. In the Americas, we believe consumers remain cautious in their purchase decisions and meal choices. As you would expect, we've had good success in the past quarters as we stepped up our coupon and other brand-value messages. And you'll see more of that in the fourth quarter, but we have a lot more underway for the holiday period.
In the U.S., we've gained good traction with our latest product introductions. Backed by a significant ad campaign in the second quarter and with plans again to run again in the fourth quarter, all varieties of Recipe Inspirations have made it in to the top 40% of McCormick blends. 
In 2011, we'll introduce World Flavors, six additional items that offer consumers a low-risk way to prepare restaurant-style ethnic foods  at home.  Some retailers have given Recipe Inspirations secondary placement in the meat section, and others have already accepted all six World Flavors.
Other new products in the U.S. build up our strong consumer franchise for grinders, salad toppings and grilling. In addition, we just introduced our Flavor Forecast Holiday Edition, which is already getting a lot of attention in the media. And for the first time, we're going to run advertising for Thanksgiving that is distinct from our Christmas ads in the U.S.  
In Canada, we revitalized our Club House brand recipe mixes in 2009, exceeding a 50% category share for the first time. In 2010, we're revitalizing our spices and seasonings with new labels, new varieties and marketing support. 
Another area of strength this year has been our sales of ethnic foods in the United States, especially Hispanic items, which were up again in the third quarter. This is a business largely built on authentic Hispanic products and the imports of mayonnaise and other crop items from our joint venture in Mexico.  In 2010, we'll begin to import tea from Mexico and recently added the El Bravo brand of Hispanic products to our portfolio. This was an $11 million acquisition completed in early September.
Beyond Hispanic products, we're extending our Simply Asia brand to dipping sauces and Zatarain’s to frozen entrees, which have gained distribution nationally with a leading warehouse club. While not included in our Consumer business results for the Americas, our joint venture in Mexico has grown sales at a double-digit pace this year, and profit has more than doubled, due in part to some favorable soybean prices.
On the Industrial side of our business, in the Americas, product innovation for food manufacturers has been up in 2010 as evidenced by a number of new seasoning blends and flavors in the U.S. and Mexico. On the Food Service side, sales were a bit weak in comparison to the third quarter of 2009, which had the benefit of some large, new product launches by quick-service restaurants. We are encouraged by our 2011 pipeline of product innovation for these customers.
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, EMEA, our two largest markets are U.K. and France. In each of these countries, we've seen retail sales growth of our branded spices and herbs outpace private label in the most recent period. Our innovation and marketing have emphasized differentiated products, like Perfect Shake's seasoning blends, Flavorful recipe mixes and Ducros grinders. Perfect Shake is model on the success of our Perfect Pinch line in the U.S. and has delivered double-digit sales growth of seasoning blends in the U.K.
Incremental marketing in the fourth quarter will be behind these types of products as well as our Vahiné line of homemade desserts. Ready for launch as we head into 2011, our Schwartz recipe mixes for vegetables and a full range of Slow Cookers. In France, we're introducing four new Ducros grinders, seven additional Ducros herbs and spices and three varieties of PâtissierieVahiné dessert mixes.  While we've had more steady sales growth in the U.K. and France, we continue to face slower Consumer business sales in some of our smaller markets where the economy is particularly weak.
Industrial sales in Europe had been robust in 2010. This has been driven by good growth opportunities with quick-service restaurants, which have maintained traffic with value pricing and promotions. And our sales to food manufacturers have grown as some of this leading customers expand geographically into markets in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.
The last comment I wanted to make about EMEA relates to a joint venture agreement in Turkey. This is a market where we have operated successfully with an industrial joint venture partner since 1996. Earlier in September, we signed an agreement with Yildiz Holding, a leading food manufacturer in Turkey. Together, our goal is to build a leading brand of spices, herbs and seasoning products in Turkey. We're excited about this opportunity to build a Consumer business in a promising market.
Turning to the Asia/Pacific region, during the third quarter, we were pleased to reach an agreement to purchase a 26% stake in Eastern Condiments for approximately $35 million. We expect to close in this joint venture by the end of 2010. Eastern is a leading brand of spices, seasonings and other food-related products in India and the Middle East. Sales have grown more than 25% on average across the past three years and are approaching $70 million annually. This is a great point of entry into an attractive consumer market and one that complements our existing joint venture, which was formed more than 10 years ago to source and process spices in India. China and Southeast Asia offer substantial opportunities for growth in both grocery and food service channels. 
In our Consumer business in China, we've introduced new products such as Thai Chili Sauce, expanded our distribution and increased our advertising campaigns, all supported by a new team of experienced brand marketers. Our industrial team in this region has gained new distribution to global food manufacturers, most recently with condiments, and continues to follow the steady growth of quick-service restaurants. We're a top supplier to these customers, adding flavor to a wide range of menu items, including beverages, ice cream and chicken.
While the economy in Australia has been quite resilient, it's a tough, highly concentrated retail market. Our focus there remains on bringing innovation to these categories where we have a leading brand position. For example, new products under our popular Aeroplane brand have taken our share of the gelatin category in Australia above 70%, and it's now approaching 80%.
Across all regions, the Americas, EMEA and Asia/Pacific, we're facing rising input costs, including pepper, garlic and a number of other spices and herbs. We've already taken a price increase on pepper in the U.S. Consumer business and are evaluating additional increases in the Americas and international markets as we head into 2011.
The last topic that I'd like to cover before turning it over to Gordon relates to cash. Those of you who follow us closely know that cash flow typically begins to build in the third quarter and peaks in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We've nearly completed our rapid paydown of debt related to the Lawry's acquisition and have resumed our share repurchase activity. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased $32 million of shares, and in September, completed the $400 million share repurchase program authorized in June 2005. We're now repurchasing shares under the new $400 million share repurchase program. Through the first three quarters, we spent $38 million in share repurchases and expect to continue at a steady pace into the fourth quarter, reaching at least $75 million of share repurchases for the fiscal year. By year end, other uses of cash in 2010 are expected to include not only share repurchases, but dividends, capital expenditures, debt repayment and acquisitions with the purchase of El Bravo and the anticipated closure of the Eastern joint venture.
To summarize, we're operating successfully in the midst of a tough global economy with consumers still under pressure in many of our primary markets. We're growing sales with effective marketing, on-trend new products and increased distribution. 
Our CCI program and business mix are improving margins throughout the business. This is our fuel for growth and a driver behind higher profit and strong cash flow.  As we head into our fourth quarter, we're well positioned for this important holiday period and on track for a record performance in 2010. 
Let me conclude my remarks with a sincere thanks to McCormick employees around the world for their commitment and talent, their passion for flavor and a demonstrated agility in managing our business and their ability to achieve great results. 
Gordon, I'll turn it over to you at this point and join back in for Q&A."

Clearly, improved margins and higher profits were the headline news this quarter. We also had some areas of solid sales growth as well as parts of the business that remain under pressure. For the total company, sales rose 0.4%, and in local currency, we're up 1.5%, due primarily to favorable volume and product mix.
As indicated on Slide 15, in the Americas region, Consumer business sales rose 4% and in local currency grew 3%. Incremental sales from new products, particularly Recipe Inspirations, drove favorable volume and product mix, along with increased sales of Hispanic products and Lawry’s items. 
Sales from the Sam's Club lead market and distribution gains for Billy Bee Honey in Canada also added to sales volume and product mix.  Pricing in this region was also favorable in the third quarter. While the pepper increase that Alan mentioned had a minimal impact on sales, we had a favorable net sales impact from lower coupon activity in comparison to the prior-year period, although on a year-to-date basis, we're about even with last year's coupon expense.
Consumer sales in EMEA declined 10% from the year-ago quarter, with a 1% decrease in local currency. Sales in France remained strong this period, with the Ducros brand outperforming the category. In our other large market, the U.K., we are growing sales with new products, such as Perfect Shake and our Flavorful range, and we were recently awarded new distribution in the convenience store channel.
In the fourth quarter, our marketing focus will be on both the U.K. and France, with an emphasis on new products and incremental brand support. The third quarter sales increases in our primary markets were offset again this quarter by lower sales in our smaller markets, which account for about 20% of consumer sales in the EMEA region.
In the Asia/Pacific region, we had an excellent quarter with an 11% increase in consumer sales. In local currency, sales were up 7%. We grew volume and product mix in China through new products like Thai Chili Sauce as well as greater market penetration and increased consumer demand. Sales in this market were up 15%.
Operating income, excluding restructuring charges for our Consumer business, was $96 million, an increase of 8% from the third quarter of 2009. We achieved this increase through CCI-led cost savings as well as higher sales. While brand marketing support was down $2 million this period, we have increases planned for the fourth quarter and are on track for our targeted $20 million of additional spending for the fiscal year.
Turning to our Industrial business, we delivered $30 million in operating income excluding restructuring charges, an increase of 6%. A more favorable business mix and productivity improvements are leading to higher operating income and operating income margin, which was nearly 9% for the third quarter.
Let's take a look at the sales performance for this part of our business on Slide 18. Industrial sales in the Americas declined 1%, and in local currency, we're down 2%. In response to lower commodity costs, primarily dairy ingredients, we passed through lower pricing for certain products during this period. This led to a price reduction of 3%. 
We grew sales volume and product mix with new seasonings and flavors to food manufacturers in the U.S. and Mexico. These gains were largely offset by weak sales to food service customers in comparison to a period of strong new product launches by quick-service restaurants in the third quarter of 2009. As Alan noted, we have some promising products in the pipeline for these customers and are excited about their launch in 2011.
In EMEA, Industrial sales declined 3% but in local currency grew 5%. Sales to quick-service restaurants continue to be strong in this region, and we are growing sales of seasonings and other products to major food manufacturers as they expand geographically. In the third quarter, we also benefited from a recovery in branded food service products in the U.K. when compared to a period of weakness in the third quarter of 2009.
Industrial sales rose 10% in the Asia/Pacific region, with a 7% increase in local currency. This increase was led by excellent growth in China as a result of new product wins with quick-service restaurants for chicken wing marinade, beverage flavors and other items. We also developed condiments for a major food manufacturer that were recently launched in this market.
For the total business, operating income rose 7% excluding the impact of restructuring charges in the third quarter of 2009, as shown on Slide 19. Gross profit margin improvement was a significant part of this increase, up 180 basis points for the quarter and up 130 basis points year-to-date. This was well ahead of our 50-basis-point projection for the year and an indication of the effectiveness of our CCI program and our efforts to achieve a more favorable mix of products and customers. SG&A as a percent of sales rose 70 basis points due largely to the higher cost of benefits. 
Turning to taxes. Discrete tax items and a lower underlying rate added $17 million to net income. Of this amount, $14 million related to the reversal of a significant tax accrual for a closed tax year, which is a noncash item. This tax accrual was recorded based on uncertainties about the tax aspects of transactions where the company reorganized its European operations and divested certain joint ventures. 
This reversal increased earnings per share by $0.10 in the third quarter. We are providing you with non-GAAP results that exclude the impact of the reversal of this $14 million tax accrual to allow for a better comparison to prior years and as a more appropriate starting point for 2011 projections.
Excluding this and other discrete tax benefits, our underlying tax rate for 2010 is now 32% based on the mix of earnings across our various tax jurisdictions and projected tax credits in the U.S. This is down from the rate of 33% that we provided in our June call.
Income from unconsolidated operations increased significantly again this quarter as a result of our McCormick de Mexico joint venture. This business grew sales 13% and effectively managed through a period of soybean oil volatility, a key ingredient for the leading product, mayonnaise. We believe income from unconsolidated operations could reach a record $25 million in this fiscal year. 
As outlined on Slide 22, third quarter earnings per share were $0.76 compared to $0.57 in the prior year. On a comparable basis, excluding $0.10 from the significant tax item in the third quarter of 2010, EPS rose 17%. This was an increase of $0.09 and was due primarily to higher operating income as well as $0.03 of higher income from unconsolidated operations and a $0.02 impact from additional tax rate items, offset slightly by higher shares outstanding. Note that in the third quarter of 2009, we had minimal restructuring charges.
I'll comment briefly on cash flow. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $145 million in 2010 compared to $195 million in the first three quarters of 2009. While higher net income added $53 million in 2010, this was more than offset by an increase in operating assets and liabilities. 
McCormick profit continues to bring focus to working capital, and business leaders are rewarded not only for strong operating income, but also for their management of working capital. This focus has continued in 2010 as we work toward our 2012 goal to reduce the cash conversion cycle by another 10 days. 
However, our inventory levels were up at the end of the third quarter. This was due in part to certain inventory positions we have taken, some buildup of inventory prior to an SAP implementation in Asia and higher raw material costs. Working to lower our inventory levels is a particular focus for me and the rest of the organization heading into 2011.
As Alan stated, share repurchases totaled $38 million year-to-date. We also used cash largely for dividends, capital expenditures and debt paydown.
Let me wrap up with our latest outlook for 2010. Based on our strong year-to-date profit and margin performance, we are raising our guidance. Gross profit margin has been tracking well ahead of our 50-basis-point objective, with a 130-basis-point increase through the first three quarters. For the full year, we are projecting roughly 100 basis points of improvement. This strong improvement is due in large part to our above-target CCI-driven cost savings as well as favorable business mix.
On a comparable basis, which excludes the favorable tax reversal recorded in 2010 and restructuring charges recorded in 2009, we now expect to increase earnings per share in the range of 9% to 11%. This is up from our initial guidance of 6% to 8% and right in line with our long-term objectives. Keep in mind that our EPS guidance continues to include $20 million of incremental marketing programs and $15 million in higher pension expense.
For the fourth quarter, Alan outlined our latest marketing plans, which, along with distribution gains and product innovation, have us poised for a solid sales performance. While increased brand support, higher input costs and unfavorable currency exchange rate will affect EPS growth, we expect to be at or above the excellent profit performance achieved in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Let me summarize our remarks by stating that we are on track for 2010 to be a record year for McCormick, which is right in line with our long-term profit growth objective. Alan and I look forward to sharing our fourth quarter results with you in January along with our outlook for 2011. Operator, we'll take the first question."

What we've seen and, certainly, if you read the consumer reaction on pepper, we just announced and implemented the increase over the last couple of weeks. But we take that very carefully to make sure that we understand the trade-off between recovering costs by raising prices and the impact on volume. And as we're looking at what we're going to do over the next year, we're considering all those things, what we have to do to recover costs, offset, obviously, by our savings programs. And then the impact that we'll get on volume and then the investment that we'll need to make in advertising and promotion to keep the consumers coming. So it's something that we really tightly consider. We were successful in getting the pepper price increase through. And we're going to watch, certainly, volumes. It's something that we really consider too."

But could you just comment on just a little bit how we should look at the data that, obviously, we all see on a scanner basis, because since, basically, 2007, you just still continue to lose some dollar share in track channels. And I'm not sure -- that could just be because of a shift to more demand in track channels, or if it's because the pricing is too high or -- I'm just trying to get a little bit of clarity so I can understand better how to read a loss in share in those channels relative to what we're not seeing in other channels."

The scanner data that you're talking about covers only spices and herbs, and people have ignored our share gains and dry seasoning mixes. You're only looking at about half the store population in the U.S, because it doesn't cover warehouse clubs, dollar stores, mass market like Walmart and others. And it doesn't include all the sales that we have to Hispanic stores or Zatarain’s products. And so it's capturing a smaller portion of that. Now we're not happy about share losses in any channel, and our teams are working aggressively to make sure that we both continue to grow our share in the grocery channel and that we drive sales and volume through that. Because that's something that we are very, very sensitive to. But again, I don't want to put too much emphasis on what represents a smaller percentage of our sales as we look at those.
