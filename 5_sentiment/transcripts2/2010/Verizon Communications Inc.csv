Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Ivan Seidenberg, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Killian, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future result is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.Next, I'd like to cover the difference between reported and adjusted earnings this quarter. In the fourth quarter, we reported a net loss per diluted share of $0.23. Adjusted earnings before the effects of special items were $0.54 per share. The differences between reported and adjusted earnings this quarter were due to the following special items: The first one is a $3 billion pretax charge for severance and pension and benefit settlement and curtailment costs related to our force reduction program. On an after-tax basis, this equates to about $1.9 billion or $0.66 per share. About $950 million of the pretax charge is for additions to severance reserves. The remaining charges of approximately $2.1 billion pretax are related to pension settlement losses resulting from lump-sum distributions during the quarter and curtailment costs related to the large number of employee separations.The second item is an after-tax charge of $127 million or $0.02 per share for merger integration costs relating to Alltel. We are also excluding $246 million after-tax or $0.09 per share in non-operational charges. These costs are related to our Wireline cost-reduction initiatives, as well as costs in connection with our ongoing efforts to spin off our Local Exchange business in 14 states. These costs are related to network, software and other activities required for these facilities to function as a separate company.  With that, I will now turn the call over to John Killian."

Let me start with a quick look at our fourth quarter highlights on Slide 3. We've had strong cash flow growth all year long. And our fourth quarter was no exception. Cash flow from operations was up 10.8% compare",2559,"Thanks, Ron, and good morning to everyone. Let me start with a quick look at our fourth quarter highlights on Slide 3. We've had strong cash flow growth all year long. And our fourth quarter was no exception. Cash flow from operations was up 10.8% compared with the year-ago quarter, demonstrating our continued focus on operating and capital discipline.We made good progress this quarter in all of our key strategic areas. In Wireless, we delivered a strong quarter of subscriber growth with total net adds of 2.2 million, 1.2 million of which were retail and primarily postpaid, and one million from resellers. Wireless data revenues were up more than 26%, and the Wireless team is successfully integrating the Alltel properties, which will help growth in 2010.In Wireline, FiOS revenues grew more than 46% compared with fourth quarter last year. And although we were somewhat surprised by the continued level of economic pressures impacting our enterprise and wholesale markets, fourth quarter revenues from strategic services, such as IP data services, grew 6% year-over-year. We also continue to tightly manage costs. In the fourth quarter, we reduced our total headcount by 7,400. For the full year, total headcount was down about 17,000. Capital expenditures for 2009 totaled $17 billion, which was well below our targeted range of $17.4 billion to $17.8 billion, and also down year-over-year.  This was the result of continued efforts to improve our capital efficiency and capture the CapEx benefits of reduced demand from the economy. So we ended the year with continued progress in the key areas, operating with good financial discipline but still facing a very challenging economic environment. Before we get to the operational results and trends, let's first review consolidated earnings and cash flow.  As Ron indicated earlier, we generated $0.54 in adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year result to $2.40 per share, which was down 5.5% or $0.14 below 2008. Our financial objectives at this time last year were focused on growing earnings in the face of some tough cyclical secular intention-related headwinds. And just as important, increasing free cash flow by tightly managing our costs in the capital program and returning cash to shareholders. From an earnings perspective, and this became more evident in the second half of the year, the prolonged effects of the economic downturn coupled with the incremental $0.11 per share pension and retiree benefit impact were too large to be fully offset by growth in our key areas and the productivity improvements we achieved during the year. However, many of these are in pressures were non-cash related. So our cash generation was even stronger than we anticipated.Let's take a closer look at cash flow on Slide 5. So from a cash flow perspective, we had a very good year. As you know, our Board of Directors raised the dividend in September by 3.3%. Cash flow from operations grew by $4 billion or 14.5% in 2009, led by strong cash generation in Wireless. And free cash flow of $14.5 billion was significantly higher than last year, up $4.2 billion or 40.7%. As I said earlier, 2009 capital expenditures, which included incremental spending related to our Alltel acquisition was $17 billion. So in spite of the addition of Alltel, we were down about $200 million year-over-year.In addition to returning cash to shareholders in the form of $5.3 billion in dividend payments in 2009, we also utilized cash to reduce debt. On a consolidated basis, net debt at the end of the year was $60.2 billion, down $4.4 billion since the end of January, which was right after we completed the financing to acquire Alltel. We ended the year with net debt to EBITDA of about 1.7x.Let's take a closer look at the revenue trends starting on Slide 6. In spite of difficult economic conditions, 2009 consolidated revenues grew 1.5% compared with 2008 on a pro-forma basis. Similar to the trends we've seen throughout 2009, top line results were mixed followed by strategic year [ph] continue to post good growth, particularly Wireless data and FiOS. But cyclical weakness in the business markets continued primarily in volume-driven voice products. Let's move to the segments next starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Our Wireless business continue to deliver strong performance this quarter. Total operating revenues for the fourth quarter were $15.7 billion, up 3.1% on a pro-forma basis over the fourth quarter last year. Total service revenues grew 5% on the fourth quarter. As we have seen all year, service revenue growth is driven by Wireless data which represented about 32% of total service revenues in the quarter. As I highlighted earlier, we had a great quarter in terms of subscriber growth with 2.2 million net adds.  In 2009, we added approximately six million new customers. So we ended the year with 91.2 million customers, an increase of 7%. Let's take a closer look now at what's driving data revenue in ARPU growth on Slide 8.  Data revenue is now in excess of $16 billion annually. That's up 31% in 2009. Total data ARPU was over $16 in the fourth quarter, which was 18.7% higher year-over-year. This explosive growth is being driven by increasing mobile broadband adoption, with the proliferation of innovative new devices like smartphones and netbooks, as well as new data applications on these devices. Text messaging, which makes up about 40% of data revenue is still showing good growth, up 21% in the quarter. Revenues from non-messaging services, which make up the other 60% of data revenue increased about 31% on the fourth quarter.As you can see on Slide 8, revenue from web and email services has grown to over $2 billion per quarter, up 47% from a year ago. We believe there are significant opportunities to continue to grow data revenue. We have a strong and growing smartphone portfolio that is meeting the increased customer demand for high-speed, high-capability devices that can support a large number of applications.Our DROID franchise is a good example. We were very pleased with the sales of our new smartphones this quarter. The Motorola DROID, the HTC DROID Eris and the BlackBerry Storm2, all posted strong sales. As you know, we have simplified our devices into three categories: 3G smartphones, 3G multimedia devices and simple-feature phones. At the end of 2009, 26% of our retail postpaid base had 3G multimedia devices or smartphones. 15% were smartphones and 11% were multimedia devices. All of these devices now require a data plan. 3G smartphones have a requirement for a $30 plan and 3G multimedia devices have a $10 minimum plan requirement.So looking ahead, we see plenty of data growth opportunities driven by new and enhanced devices and innovative applications and content. All powered by Verizon's expansive 3G network today and our new 4G network later this year.  As we think about 4G and encourage innovation through our open-development initiative, it is becoming clear that the business is expanding to include opportunities in both the retail and wholesale markets. However, retail continues to be our primary focus and represents the largest portion of our Wireless business. 96% of our total customer base is retail and 82.2 million or 90% of the base are retail postpaid subscribers. In the fourth quarter, we added 1.2 million retail customers, 67,000 were prepaid and the rest were postpaid. Retail service revenue of $13.2 billion in the fourth quarter grew 5.2% year-over-year. Retail postpaid ARPU was $52.40 was stable with 0.2% year-over-year growth. And our customer retention metrics remain very strong. Retail postpaid churn of 1.06% improved by four basis points year-over-year on a pro-forma basis, as did total churn of 1.42%.In terms of profitability, as you can see on Slide 10, we maintain strong EBITDA service margin performance, finishing the full year at 45.9%. Our fourth quarter margin performance of 45% was very strong, particularly in light of higher gross adds and an increased level of upgrade activity, driven by the high level of interest in the DROID, Eris and Storm2 in the quarter. So another quarter of strong and disciplined performance by our Wireless business.Let's move now to our Wireline segment on Slide 11. In our Wireline business, we continue to see a transformation of the consumer market from voice to broadband connectivity. And within our business markets, we're seeing continued economic pressures. Our FiOS initiative is gaining scale, now covering about half of our households. At the end of 2009, we had nearly three million FiOS TV customers and over three million FiOS Internet subscribers. Including DSL, we have more than 9.2 million broadband customers. Our penetration metrics are on target and total broadband and video revenues exceeded $6 billion in 2009 and grew 25.5% in the fourth quarter. Let's take a closer look at both the consumer and business markets starting on Slide 12. The strength of our broadband and video products continues to derive consumer revenue and ARPU growth. Consumer revenue grew 1.2% on a year-over-year basis. And we're seeing strong growth in consumer ARPU, which increased to just over $77 this quarter, up 12.6% from a year ago. FiOS ARPU remains very strong at more than $140 per month. Consumer revenue from our broadband and video services totaled $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter, up 28.6% year-over-year. Revenue from these services was about 40% of total consumer revenue in the quarter, up from 31% a year ago. FiOS consumer broadband and video revenue totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter, up 52.2% from a year ago.During the quarter, net adds for TV and Internet both totaled 153,000. Our full year additions in 2009 were roughly the same as 2008. So we maintained good momentum. Our churn levels are low. And we have excellent customer satisfaction ratings.Slide 13 shows our global enterprise and global wholesale revenue performance. As I said earlier, we continue to see economic pressures affecting both the business retail and wholesale markets. High levels of unemployment continue to impact usage volumes. And we are not seeing any significant pick up yet in capital or IT spending by our largest customers. We're encouraged by the continued growth and quarterly revenue from strategic services, which grew 6% year-over-year and about 3% sequentially, led by sales of IP data services. Global enterprise revenue declined 4.5% in the fourth quarter as compared with a 5.3% decline in the third. However, adjusting for the impact of foreign currency effects, revenue growth declined 5.4% year-over-year and about $125 million sequentially. Fourth quarter CPE sales were down about 9% year-over-year, further indicating weakness in IT spending?Global wholesale revenue also declined 4.5% in the fourth quarter. We are seeing growth in Ethernet services related to Wireless backhaul and the migration of traditional data services to IP, but usage volumes continue to be down 4% to 4.5%. We continue to believe that the primary leading indicator for sustained improvement in the business market will be a return to hiring on the pot of large enterprise businesses. So we're holding our own with existing customers and remaining competitive when it comes to new business, the signs of recovery are slow. Let's talk about the Wireline profitability picture.  As shown on Slide 14, Wireline EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter declined 70 basis points sequentially to 23%. There are three conditions that we are working very hard to offset: Temporary economic pressures, ongoing secular changes and incremental pension and benefits expense. I can assure you that we have a strong focus on our core structure. And we've taken several actions that will help us in 2010. We reduced our Wireline-related force by 13,000 people or about 9% in 2009. About 5,000 of these employees came off the payroll late in the fourth quarter. And we expect a similar level of the annual force reductions in 2010.Along with these force reductions, we are also looking at a number of initiatives to simplify our Wireline operations and drive cost out of the business. For example, we are working on a comprehensive redesign of our entire call center infrastructure which will reduce the number of call centers and improve our utilization and efficiency metrics. Another example is a Wireline network consolidation initiative that result in operating efficiency improvements.We believe that a combination of better revenue performance and improving economy, the effect of our ongoing force reductions and our ability to achieve some of these other cost-reduction opportunities will help improve margins over time. We are also focused on our capital spending. Wireline CapEx was down $905 million or 9.2% year-over-year. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to provide some additional details on our 2010 outlook and our key focus areas, which are on Slide 15.  In Wireless, we will continue to focus on growing revenue and market share, expanding data penetration and growing data revenue, developing LTE and offering 4G services in 25 to 30 markets before year-end and capitalizing on the successful integration of Alltel. Lastly, we will also remain disciplined in balancing our growth initiatives and profitability. In Wireline, we will continue to capitalize on our investments in FiOS and our global IP networks by driving higher FiOS penetration and growing ARPU and revenue. And by increasing our market share in professional and managed enterprise services and growing strategic services revenue. As I said earlier, we will remain focused on our cost structure and achieve meaningful cost reductions, and we will make sure the business is ready to quickly benefit from improvements in employment in the overall economy.We have taken steps in both our Wireless and Wireline segments to strengthen the business going forward. We continue to expect solid cash flow generation in 2010. Our capital spending in 2010 is targeted to be in the range of $16.8 billion to $17.2 billion. We expect Wireless CapEx to be modestly higher year-over-year, reflecting increased demand for smartphones and higher data usage. And we expect Wireline CapEx to continue to decline. So we'll have flexibility to allocate capital dollars between the segments.In addition to the capital spending I just described, we will use cash to pay down debt. I'm targeting to reach a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.4x to 1.5x by year end. I do not anticipate any share repurchasing activity at this time. And of course, I expect we will maintain a competitive dividend. Consistent with previous years, I won't give specific earnings guidance. However, there are a few items I would highlight.  There will be approximately $0.04 to $0.06 of incremental pressure on EPS due to non-cash pension and retiree benefit cost in 2010, which is down from the year-over-year impact in 2009. And the annual effective tax rate attributable to Verizon is expected to be in the range of 33% to 35%.  Finally, as we report results in 2010, we will no longer adjust reported earnings results. Instead, only reporting GAAP earnings, consistent with trends in corporate reporting. By eliminating adjusted results, we will simplify our financial reporting. Of course, we will continue to provide the detailed information you need to understand and analyze our reported results, including the identification of material non-operational items. For example, as we approach completion of the strategic transactions we initiated in 2009, we will fully disclose any related costs and the impact of divesting properties in our financial results. And with that, I'd like to turn it back to Ron."

But for the full year, we were 45.9%, just short of 46%. Fourth quarter we came at 45%. As you know, we don't provide specific point guidance here but we really had a very strong year. The fourth quarter at 45% did see the impact of a very heavy level of upgrade activity. And as you can see in our numbers, very strong growth in the fourth quarter. We had the series of new smartphones introduced in early November. So the DROID, the Eris, they have been extremely well received and particularly, a strong take up in the fourth quarter. So that was some of the impact we saw there. We think we're very well positioned in the Wireless business in 2010. We have the right handset lineup. We're getting more and more data penetration, very good data growth. So our focus, as it has been in the past, both driving growth and profitability. We won't put out a specific target. But we feel very good about our position and our ability to continue to drive industry-leading margins in the Wireless business. On the reseller side, you are right, very good performance in the fourth quarter. We added one million new reseller customers as we mentioned. Now a point of interest here, this comes from several different resellers contributed to this. It just wasn't one party. The other point I would make is that the new resellers that are coming in are coming in at much higher ARPU levels than the traditional reseller base we had in the past. So we also see this as an opportunity to expand the marketplace. We haven't changed our strategy. Our strategy is still very much focused on the postpaid base and the retail base, but that doesn't mean we're not going to participate in other segments of the market where we can drive positive MPDs for our shareholders. And that's how we see the reseller market right now."

We are through all of the billing system conversions for the former Alltel. So they're all now on our billing areas. Our target for the year was $500 million to $600 million in expense synergies. We actually did a little bit better than that. Our target for full year 2010 is $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We're well on path to that. We're not fully done with all of the integration work. The integration work remaining in '10 is more around network. We've got a lot of network integration work done in '09 but we have more cell site conversion to be done and we'll be working on that. So we feel very good. We spent a little bit more on the CapEx side in '09 on Alltel integration than we had originally anticipated. But the aggregate amount we will spend will be the same. So there'll be a little bit of a benefit, less spending in '10 as we go through there. So I think Alltel has turned out to be very positive for us and we expect it to continue to be positive. From a FiOS perspective, Simon, we're pleased with our overall FiOS performance and as we look back on the last several years, we continue to see expanded penetration. A very good ARPU as we pointed out, over $140. A really strong video ARPUs and great reaction to the product. Churn is running low and continues to run low. And we've also seen, as we expected to do, continuation in improving our operational metrics in the fiber network, running with much lower maintenance costs than the copper network. Now you think about growth, two years in a row, we've gained over $900,000. Over those two years, we've had fluctuations quarter-by-quarter. It hasn't been an exactly linear climb up. So we feel very good that there's still has a lot of opportunity to expand penetration. We will have new homes being opened for sale also. So we feel good about our position here. Fourth quarter, I think, there was a little bit of impact from the economy from consumer spending. But we think as we continue to enhance the product, we're very well positioned."

And we were comfortable that a lot of our organic plans would pick up momentum. So here we are at the beginning of 2010, we feel that our organic momentum is good. We have good growth in all our strategic areas, as John pointed out a minute ago. But we're facing some more significant headwinds than we thought we would face from the economy. So to answer your question, when we look at 2010, this is kind of the way our management team out the year together. We have a lot of confidence that we can continue to drive success in our organic areas. As John mentioned just now, in FiOS, we feel we have a good formula in Wireless. And so I think we feel we're pretty good shape in that score. The economy won't help us as much as we thought. So the truth of the matter is, from an organic standpoint, we're shooting from some modest organic growth as you look at our core business going into 2010. Now when you wrap that around, the broader question you asked about shareholder returns, I think our strong suit in 2010 is obviously going to be the excellence of our operations and the generation of cash. So we'll be able to continue to delever, our credit metrics will improve, our balance sheet will get better. We'll be able to focus on maintaining a very strong and competitive dividend. As you mentioned, these two transactions that will be completed, and particularly, the Frontier one, will offer investors an opportunity for some added value creation. So when you add this all up, we're looking at the possibility here in 2010 that we can drive total returns, total shareholder value. And in terms of what shareholders can expect, somewhere in the high single digits, that's kind of our view of how the year could pan out. There's some risk to that, there's also some upside. The economy could be on upside but our view this year is we have sort of discounted a lot of help from the economy because in my view, and talking to other companies and our work on the business roundtable, even if the economy starts to pick up, it won't be -- toward maybe the end of the year which wont have a material impact on 2010. So Vijay, I hope that answers the question. Now one more point, we feel much more bullish about 2011. Because in 2011, I think we will have furthered our position in a lot of areas we're working on organic. And this should be clearly some impact and positive impact to the economy as we go forward. So we're thinking this is a year where we do better than we did in '09 and '11 should be a much even a stronger year for that."

I guess in the fourth quarter for instance, service revenue in Wireless and I know this is not a sequential business, but it was up about 20 basis points. That's the lowest sequential revenue growth over the last five years we've seen by as much as 100 basis points. And John, I go back to some of your comments from the introduction of the new pricing plans where we were expecting voice pressure to kind of be the first thing felt, and then data upside later. So I guess, as we look into a tougher year from a net add growth standpoint, are we maybe at the point where we're going to start to see some more volatility and possible negative Wireless services revenue growth here. And if not, I'd love to hear the argument there. And in the second piece, if I could go back to the FiOS side of things, obviously third quarter, the target was kind of a 250 run rate. We showed up in the fourth quarter with 150, last quarter you were very aggressive on promotions. You've reversed out of those promotions, you've raised prices for FiOS and some of the low-end DSL stuff. So it feels like as you focus on profitability, you're willing to sacrifice market share in the near term. And also, I'd love to hear your thoughts on that."

Yes, we have seen a deceleration in Wireless service revenue growth as we've gone through the year. As we went through the year though, you saw a pretty good pick up as we went through the third and fourth quarter, and continued strong pick up on net adds on the Retail Postpaid side, and you also saw the positive impact on the Reseller side. When you look at ARPU here and particularly, the one I'd focus more on is Postpaid ARPU. So we continue to grow. Growth slowed down a little bit, 0.2% growth, as we went through the fourth quarter. The Voice side, the rate of decline was about the same level in the fourth quarter as it was in the third quarter, but we continue to see very strong growth on the Data side. So I think as we look to 2010, we think we can accelerate growth on Data. A little bit we're competing in a disadvantaged position through the early part of '09, in terms of our smartphone lineup. We think we've done a lot to fix that. The DROID has been extremely well received. As you know, we have additional new smartphones being rolled out in January, the Palm product in particular. So our handset lineup is very strong. Our data attachment rate is very strong. We're seeing a much higher penetration of both smartphones and multimedia phones. In the script, we mentioned about 26% of our base at the end of '09 comes from either a smartphone or a multimedia. If you look at our fourth quarter direct sales, it was a factor of 2.5x that in terms of mix. So we're going to be getting a much higher ARPU customer coming through, and I think we'll see more of the benefits there as we go through in 2010. On the trade-off of growth and profitability, as I mentioned to you on FiOS, we feel we're in a very good position on the FiOS side. We are also focused on driving strong margins. As you know, content costs go up, other kinds of factors, so we're not going to stand still from a price perspective. But you are right, we have changed our promotions in the first quarter. We've gone away from $150 cash back. That wasn't because of pressure on profitability, it really was on driving market reaction to our proposition. So now we're leading with an $89 offer that's bringing traffic in. And then we have significant opportunity to upsell. So if you look at our FiOS platform, we think we're extremely well positioned. All of the consumer reports are rating it very highly. Our customer reaction to the product is very positive. So we think we can continue to improve the profitability of the FiOS offering and at the same time, continue to sustain growth. We don't think every quarter is going to be exactly like you need to react pretty quickly to different competitor offerings, but we feel good about our FiOS position."

If you",520,"I think we had three factors in particular, that are impacting our Wireline margins, and particularly in '09, and we're going to live with some of this as we go through 2010. I think the biggest factor in '09 as we look back really, is the economy. If you look at our Enterprise business and our Wholesale business, both of them were down in the 4% to 5% range in the fourth quarter. Earlier in the year, the Wholesale business was down a little bit more than that. So the economy particularly in those areas, had a significant impact on the ability to sustain and hold margins as we lost some of that and particularly, in the Wholesale side, some of that higher margin revenue. We've also got the issues with shifts from the secular side with some of our traffic moving to the Wireless side, so we're dealing with the secular pressures that we've been dealing with. And as you mentioned, another big factor last year was pension and benefits. So our focus has been to do a couple of different things but at the lead of this is, is to take a lot of costs out of the business. Now if you look back in '09, our force reductions were much more back-end loaded. So Wireline business in total, we reduced about 13,000. We've reduced the total workforce by about 17,000. About 4,000 of that was related to Alltel integration, so the pure Wireline, but it was much more back-end loaded. So we didn't see as much of the benefit of that in '09 as we would have liked to have seen. We will see benefit of that in 2010. And then you can also see in the results that we also provided for further force reductions in 2010, and you should think about that at about the same level that we did in 2009. So our team will be extremely focused on rightsizing the cost structure, there's a series of other areas where we will be attacking if things like real estate, reducing square footage, as we bring the employee base down, we have excess facilities within the system. So we will go through a process of terminating some leases, we'll sell some additional buildings. And you can just get a feeling that virtually every expense line will have a lot of pressure on it. Now we also look at expanding penetration in the marketplace, so it isn't just cost. As mentioned earlier, we just did a couple of price changes on FiOS. We don't think they're going to inhibit our ability to grow, but we think they're going to allow us to drive more margin from a FiOS perspective. Now FiOS you mentioned, FiOS is performing pretty much where we thought it would be. We continue to see improving profitability as we go further through the investment. We think that will continue to accelerate as we go through 2010. It's not exactly like the original business case we laid out, some cases of FiOS have done better than others, but we're pleased with our FiOS performance."

The introduction of the DROID and other products helped us a lot there. So we're pleased with our performance from a net add perspective, and we see that opportunity to continue on the porting side as we go into 2010. Churn is running both on the video and data product in the low ones in absolute terms, and it has improved a little bit but stayed very steady despite a very competitive market on FiOS Internet and the TV side. We think a lot of that has to do with the quality of the offer that we have, the product we have, and the enhancements that you can see through the advertising that we continue to make. So links to things like Facebook and Twitter, and adding -- continuing to add added value that isn't available through a lot of the competitor offerings. So by strengthening the quality of the product, it's having very positive impacts on churn."

Let's start out with what John said, is we get really good, terrific grounding with our customers. Now for the past two or three years, we have these big events in which we open a lot of homes for sale, which generates a point of pressure in the marketplace where we do a lot of promotions, our competitors do a lot of promotions, and we get some footing in the marketplace. Now what we've found is, given that we're out there a long time, and we've watched a behavior that once offices are open for two or three years, we've seen a very steady improvement in penetration that we're very satisfied with. And so we have discovered the idea that if we focus a little bit better, we're going to get the market without having to necessarily overheat the market at any point in time. So I think where we are now is, we naturally have to experiment with a couple of things. But what's maturing is the fact we're nearing our full plate of passing homes, and so you just don't market now, the same way you might have marketed when you first opened it. So I think we're more conscious about the fact we're confident we'll get the market, we have to make sure we're careful about profitability. And I would also say this, FiOS is doing fine. The other point I'd make is, I'm not happy about the fact the economy has slowed down the improvement and the earnings on the business side. So the issue is, when we look at the whole Wireline segment, we do need to balance a little bit of profitability to make sure that where the economy is hurting us, that we offset some of that by not being too aggressive on the FiOS side. So it's a timing question. So the way I'd ask you to think about this, is we think we're going to get the market, we'll just time it a little bit different. We'll try to do a little bit better, hold around on the business side, and as John said, the glue that sort of helps us here is a fairly aggressive focus on our cost structure. So maybe that's a way that we're thinking about the evolution of the Wireline sector as we move into 2010."

If you look at the Postpaid ARPU as I mentioned earlier, yes, the last quarter we grew 0.2%, so we are still seeing growth. The pressure, as all of you know, is more on the Voice side. So we were down 7 4 in fourth quarter, we were down 7 3 in third quarter. So good news there from my mind is it didn't get much worse in the fourth quarter. Now the drivers here, there's a couple of different things that I'd point to. Clearly, as people have gone through bigger buckets of minutes, we're seeing less overage. That's not a surprise, we expect that to continue particularly, with the attractiveness of our new unlimited plan. And we think by the way, that's going to lead to people buying up and that will create a good opportunity. Texting has taken the place, as we all know that, the explosion on texting has had some pressure. Another area where we had some pressure in the third and fourth quarter is, we had a lot of growth in our Family plan customers. Some of that was tied to more growth than we had had in the first and second quarter. Some of that was tied to the Alltel billing system conversions that we went through, so that also contributed. And then as you look at the full year, early in the year, we were not participating as much as we would have liked to on the higher end of the marketplace. Part of that because of the device lineup. So I think as we've gone through 2009, Lowe and his team did a terrific job getting the device lineup in a very strong position. From a Wireline perspective, we're still driving a lot of cash flow in that business. You saw the fourth quarter numbers, the full year numbers, so cash flow is very strong. A number of the earnings depressants are non-cash in nature, it's some of the pension and benefit items. The FiOS investment is doing extremely well. We have very high depreciation reserves in the non-FiOS area. So we always go through all of the GAAP requirements on impairments and those kind of things. We will continue to do that, but as of the moment, we're in good shape there and the cash flow is strong, and our depreciation reserves are in pretty good position. I'm going to ask Ivan to comment here, too."

I think as you move forward though, as we move to LTE and we start to see a completely different dynamic out in the marketplace, with 8x the capacity and much lower cost per transport of a megabit, I think we're feeling very comfortable that the smartphone market will move into more parity for us, with respect to handling that. We have done a lot of work at modeling what the DROID does, what the Palm will do, what the ERIS does, and what the BlackBerry does. So we kind of feel we know what the capacity limitations are in this, and we're feeling pretty good that we're out in front of this issue. And to the extent that usage picks up, I think our guys have done a very good job in making sure that we stay in front of that issue.

We've spent a lot more capital in the last two years on capacity, and probably people realize that. And I think when you look out as we move into 2011, and we start to get into full deployment of LTE, we're going to get a big, big improvement in terms of our efficiency.

We have a number of things that I think will help us there, if you think about the Wireless business, we believe we will grow profitability in the Wireless business. We're going to have a pretty good revenue growth, we think. We're going to continue to grow our share as we mentioned earlier, more data plan penetration should be very positive to us and we'll also have the benefit of the synergies. On the Wireline business, we have the same kind of issues we had in '09 to work through. We will see some benefit from the force reductions but the biggest unknowns to me right now is, what impact is the economy going to have. So our plan assumes there's a pretty good recovery in the second half of 2010. That really is key to our performance. If you look at '09 by our estimates, the economy lost about 4 million non-farm jobs from an employment standpoint. We see that growing as we go through '10. The first quarter, we see slightly down in our forecast. That's what we're assuming, but a pick up in the second half of the year. So that will be a big variable, which will have impact. If we do better on the economy, I think we'll see positive volumes coming through our Wholesale business and our Enterprise business from that perspective. So it certainly is our focus to grow organically beyond the adjustments. By the way, on the frontier-related spend, we're targeting second quarter close on that, so we'll work through the details of that as we get closer to a close."

You've picked up on all the key points, so you all know the issues that we're working on. If I had to put a small sort of emphasis on a couple of things, let me just make sure that we're all in the same place. When we look at 2010, looking at Wireless, we're committed to maintain reasonable growth and profitable growth. And we understand that it can't come in any cost, but we do think we have a differentiated business with key attributes, and we can drive continued expansion of our share in this space and we'll do that, and we'll do it smartly. One of the things we haven't talked about is that we have lots of opportunities in Wireless to continue to even make the business more efficient. I think if you look at our cost numbers in 2009, you would see that there's probably room for improvement to get our cost for gross adds or across the business into even a better shape. So I think part of the issues you raised about how we fund the growth and how we maintain profitability, we're here to make sure that we do a good a job as possible in Wireless on that, and the Alltel synergies helped with that a great deal. On the Wireline side, I'd like you to think about the fact that we feel we have a great platform in FiOS. But we recognize that our total value creation is not being helped by, unless we start to turn the corner on moving the margin issue up again. And we're not going to overstate what we can do, but the issue there is profitability in the Wireline section is going to be a focus for us, and we need to sort of build some momentum. So then as we head toward the end of the year into next year, you could see some good progress on that. Our strong suit, as I said earlier, is going to be, our operating metrics are good, our cash is strong, our dividend is strong, our balance sheet is strong. So the key for us is, until the economy picks up, is to hunker down and do all the things that you would do from a smart cash management position, make sure we return sufficient value to shareholders to keep people interested in our stock, and then participate in the broader expansion of the economy, once that begins to happen. So Ron, let me turn it back to you."

I'm Ron Lataille and with me this morning is John Killian, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. 
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future result is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.
As we indicated on our last earnings conference call, beginning this quarter we are no longer adjusting reported earnings results, instead only reporting GAAP earnings, consistent with trends in corporate reporting. Of course, we will continue to provide the detailed information you need to understand and analyze our reported results, including the identification of material non-operational items. 
For the first quarter, GAAP earnings were $0.14 per share. These earnings results include a total of $0.42 of non-operational charges, the largest of which is for reduced tax benefits related to retiree healthcare. This one-time non-cash tax charge totaled $962 million or $0.34 per share. 
In addition, we incurred a non-cash charge of $0.03 per share related to pension settlement losses, resulting from our previously announced separation plan. As you know, pension accounting rules require that settlement losses be recorded once prescribed payment thresholds have been reached. 
We also incurred non-operational cost in connection with the spin-off of our local exchange business in 14 states. As we previously discussed, these costs are related to network, software and other activities required for these facilities to function as a separate company. This quarter, these get-ready costs amounted to $0.04 per share.
Lastly, we incurred $0.01 per share this quarter related to Alltel merger integration costs. I would also point out that all of these non-operational items are recorded at the consolidated level, and therefore, do not affect any comparison of our Wireless or Wireline segment results to prior periods. 
One last item I'd like to mention relates to certain revenue reclassifications within the Wireline segment due primarily to business customer shifts between mass-market, Global Enterprise and Global Wholesale. The largest shift involved businesses with 20 or more employees. These accounts are now being managed by our Enterprise sales teams, and the corresponding revenues will be reported on the Global Enterprise line. Revenue from businesses with less than 20 employees will continue to be included in the mass-market line. Prior period history has been reclassified and is provided in the supplemental schedules and historical files on our website. These changes in revenue line item reporting did not have a significant effect on historical growth rate. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to John Killian."

Before get into the operational details, let me start with some brief comments on the business overall, and add some perspective to the results for this quarter. In January, we outlined our key focus areas for 20",2942,"Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Before get into the operational details, let me start with some brief comments on the business overall, and add some perspective to the results for this quarter. 
In January, we outlined our key focus areas for 2010. In summary, we said that we expect to continue generating solid cash flows and maintain tight control over capital spending. 
Second, we would continue to capitalize on our investments in Wireless, FiOS and global IP networks to grow revenues and market share, drive deeper penetration and increase ARPU. Finally, we would remain focused on our cost structure, achieve meaningful cost reductions and make sure the business is ready to quickly benefit from improvements and employment figures in the overall economy.
In the first quarter, we executed on the business plan we described to you. Free cash flow grew over 25% this quarter, driven by strong cash flow from operations and a lower capital spending. 
We saw a good customer growth in Wireless and FiOS, and we may be seeing some positive early signs of recovery in the business markets. Revenue trends this quarter were better on a consolidated basis, as well as in the Wireless and Wireline segments. 
In Wireless, data growth was particularly strong this quarter, driven by the significant amount of smartphone sales and upgrades. We feel very good about our retail postpaid ARPU and customer retention performance this quarter. On the cost side, we continue to benefit from the synergy savings of the Alltel acquisition and Wireless margins expanded this quarter. 
In our Wireline segment, we continue to be aggressive and persistent in our cost restructuring to preserve margins. Force reductions of 5,000 last quarter, and 2,300 this quarter, resulted in cost savings of about $80 million in the first quarter. 
However, the continued economic pressures on the topline, incremental pension and retiree benefit costs, and higher costs related to the record-setting storms affecting much of our franchise territory, resulted in a lower margin. 
My goal continues to be to stabilize the Wireline margin this year, and we are on track with our plans to accomplish this goal. And I am confident that we can achieve this objective and expand margins in the future.  Lastly, on the strategic front, our pending transactions involving the sale of the Alltel divestiture markets and the spin-off of access lines are both moving forward. 
With this as an overview, lets turn to Slide 4 and start our detailed discussion of the quarter.  As Ron indicated earlier, our first quarter earnings results included the non-operational charges you see here, a majority being non-cash and related to deferred tax and pension expense recognition. Our cash summary presents a much different growth picture. 
Cash flow from operations in the quarter was strong, up 7.5% over last year. Our capital spending was down $251 million or 6.8%. Free cash flow at the end of the quarter was $3.7 billion, up almost $750 million or 25.6%. 
In Wireline, first quarter capital expenditures of $1.6 billion were down $437 million year-over-year. In Wireless, capital costs were higher by $219 million. 
Although we started the year conservatively, I'd reiterate that our 2010 guidance for capital spending is in the $16.8 billion to $17.2 billion range. As far as the balance sheet is concerned, we continue to reduce  leverage. In the first three months, we reduced net debt by $1.7 billion, and net debt is down from 10% a year ago. 
Let's now turn to revenue trends, which are on Slide 5.  Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $26.9 billion, up 1.2% from the first quarter a year ago, a better growth rate than each of the last two quarters. This reflects improvements in both Wireless and Wireline. 
Wireless revenues were up $661 million or 4.4%, driven primarily by data. Wireline revenues were down 2.9% this quarter due primarily to continued economic pressures in our business markets. 
But FiOS revenue growth continues to be strong, up 40% year-on-year. This is the third consecutive quarter of lower year-over-year revenue declines in Wireline.  
With that snapshot of revenues, let's move to the segments next starting with Wireless on Slide 6.
In the first quarter, total service revenues were up $770 million, or 5.9%, versus the year-ago quarter, and we saw strong sequential improvement of 2.2%, which is the highest sequential growth rate we've seen in the last six quarters. This revenue performance is, of course, driven by our strong focus on expanding the data market. 
Data revenues, which comprised 1/3 of total service revenues in the quarter, grew 26.4% year-over-year. Total data ARPU was 18% higher than a year ago. 
In terms of the components of data growth, quarterly revenues from Web and email services was $2.4 billion, up 43.5% from first quarter last year. Messaging revenues of $1.8 billion grew 16.2%. 
Our strategy continues to center on taking advantage of the expanding smartphone category. Our approach has been to feature a number of different operating systems and platforms which gives us the opportunity to not only attract new customers, but aggressively upgrade existing customers to high-end, data-capable devices. In addition to the obvious benefits to metrics like ARPU and churn, this will drive sustained data revenue growth, and we have plenty of upside in terms of data penetration.
At the end of the first quarter, more than 30% of our retail postpaid base had 3G multimedia devices or smartphones, up from 26% at the end of 2009. 17% had smartphones and 13% had 3G multimedia devices. We believe customer demand for data mobility will only increase as we further strengthen our device lineup and feature innovative applications and content. 
Let's take a look at customer growth on Slide 7. 
We've added a new chart this quarter to highlight a category of other connections not previously disclosed or counted in our subscriber metrics in the past. At the end of the first quarter, we had 92.8 million customers and more than 100 million total connections. Our high-quality customer base is heavily weighted towards retail postpaid customers, which comprise 89% of our subscriber base. This customer segment remains our key focus as we continue to drive revenue growth to increase data usage and penetration.
In the first quarter, we added more than 1.5 million net new customers with 423,000 retail postpaid net adds and 1.3 million reseller additions. With regard to the change in mix, we typically see seasonal effects in the first quarter. In any given year, the sequential decline in retail postpaid net adds between fourth and first quarter can be about 25% to 30%. This quarter, the decline was magnified, but we did not see any significant shift in market share, overall reporting ratios or any increase in churn. 
In fact, our churn rates improved. Total churn showed declines both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially, and postpaid churn posted a 6% improvement compared to the first quarter last year. I would also add that these improvements are from already remarkably low industry-leading churn levels.
Although total Wireless market penetration is above 90%, we are still very bullish about our growth opportunities in the retail postpaid market. By continuing to strengthen our smartphone device lineup and offering differentiated services like NFL Mobile and Skype Mobile, we will stimulate upgrades within our existing base, as well as attract and retain high-value customers.
Net adds in our Reseller channel were very strong again this quarter, which is not surprising given typical prepaid seasonality. The Reseller market is a low-cost channel for us and an effective way for us to attract the incremental prepaid customer. I would also remind you that we do not have unlimited pricing arrangements with our Reseller partners. 
The new category, ""Other Connections"", totaled $7.3 million at this time and will include all kinds of machine-to-machine devices like vehicle tracking, telematics, eReaders, consumer electronics, smart grid solutions, medical alert devices, essentially anything that has a wireless chip in it. Looking ahead, particularly when we commercialize LTE, the proliferation of these type of devices will be another source of incremental Wireless growth. And as we've mentioned in the past, we have a separate organization dedicated to open development, and Verizon Wireless is taking a leadership role in facilitating and stimulating innovation in this area. Examples include nPhase, which is our joint venture with QUALCOMM, to provide advanced end-to-end solutions, the establishment of the Verizon Technology Innovation Center in Waltham and the creation of the 4G venture forum. 
Let's take a closer look at our retail performance on Slide 8.  Our focus continues to be on the retail postpaid market. It is the largest and most important portion of our business. Retail service revenue, which accounts for about 85% of total Wireless revenues, grew 5% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. As I mentioned earlier, our retail postpaid ARPU this quarter grew 0.6% versus the year-ago quarter. This accretion is driven by our data growth strategy with an increasing percentage of our customers using smartphones and multimedia devices. 
Device upgrades were strong as 8.6% of our postpaid base upgraded in the first quarter, representing an increase of almost 15% from a year ago. This is extremely positive from a churn and ARPU accretion perspective. Customers are responding very well to our portfolio of smartphones and multimedia devices. 36% of device sales from our direct channels were smartphones with a $30 monthly data plan, and 24% were for multimedia devices which have minimum $10 monthly data plan attached.
The pricing simplification we implemented in January is helping to drive some of these excellent metrics, and the results were exactly what we anticipated. While we experienced the downward migration of customers from the $99 unlimited price point, we also saw a healthy migration of customers up to new $69 unlimited price point. 
Another positive development is an increasing percentage of gross adds for new customers opting for voice plans at 900 minutes per month or more, which obviously bodes well for revenue and ARPU. As Lowell described in the Investor Call in January, our goal is to drive further smartphone penetration and stimulate data growth, which will offset some of the voice declines. In addition, as we launch LTE later this year, having a large number of data customers provides us with a great opportunity to meet their increasing need for higher speeds and more sophisticated application-based devices. The first quarter results indicate that this is the right strategy: Revenue growth improved, our key customer retention metrics improved, and we saw a retail postpaid ARPU accretion.
In terms of profitability, we had another excellent quarter, generating $6.4 billion of EBITDA, up 5.7% from first quarter last year. Our first quarter margin performance of 46% is a strong result, reflecting both lower retail gross additions and stronger upgrades to higher-end devices. I think the Wireless team did a great job this quarter, driving this margin result given our aggressive upgrade strategy. 
Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue achieving both growth and profitability with a focus on gaining share in the retail postpaid market and increasing the penetration of smartphones and other data devices which will further expand the data market. 
Let's move now to our Wireline segment on Slide 10.
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see both cyclical and secular pressures in our Wireline consumer and business markets, with total Wireline revenues down 2.9% from a year ago. Our broadband and video products are driving a significant shift in our consumer revenue mix, and we continue to be very pleased with the success of FiOS. FiOS revenues are up 40% and ARPU increased 5% year-over-year. 
Minutes in IP services continue to transform the business revenue mix. In the first quarter, Strategic Services Revenue and Enterprise was up 4.2%. 
Let's take a closer look at both the consumer and business markets starting on Slide 11.  A year ago, FiOS made up about 30% of our consumer revenue. At the end of this quarter, FiOS represented more than 41%, a significant increase in just four quarters. The strength of our broadband and video products continues to drive consumer revenue and ARPU growth. 
Consumer revenue in the first quarter grew 0.9% on a year-over-year basis, and we continue to see strong growth in consumer ARPU, which increased to more than $78 this quarter, up 12.3% from a year ago. 
The entire FiOS initiative continues to be very successful, and we saw very positive levels of customer additions for both FiOS TV and Internet this quarter. We have surpassed the 3 million customer mark in FiOS TV with 168,000 net adds this quarter, and with 12 million homes open for sale, penetration of FiOS TV is 25%. 
In FiOS Internet, we added 185,000 customers this quarter, bringing our total to 3.6 million. With 12.6 million homes open for sale, internet penetration is 29%.
Let's move next to our business markets on Slide 12, which shows our Global Enterprise and Global Wholesale Revenue performance. As you can see, revenue in each of these categories has been relatively stable for the last five quarters. As a result, we are seeing improved comparisons on a year-over-year basis. 
Global Enterprise revenues was a down $57 million or 1.4% in the first quarter compared with a 4.8% year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter. The steady increase in the number of private IP site activations is an encouraging indicator as our CPE sales, which were higher than we typically see in the first quarter. Enterprise long-distance usage volumes, which have typically seasonal fluctuations, showed year-over-year growth for the first time in quite a while. All of these factors point to early signs of a recovery that should help our revenue performance in future quarters. 
Global Wholesale revenue in the first quarter declined $69 million, or 2.9% year-over-year, compared with a 4.9% decline in the fourth quarter. And while we continue to see growth in Ethernet services related to Wireless backlog, we are not seeing a pickup in wholesale long-distance usage volumes yet. Foreign currency effects this quarter were similar to what we have experienced in the fourth quarter. 
So the key point here is that revenue is stable and there is some optimism for improved performance and a recovery starting in the second half of the year. 
Let's cover Wireline profitability next.  From my perspective, we're competing well in the market, and we remain focused within the Wireline segment on four key strategies: Driving FiOS growth, improving Enterprise, driving cost out, and capital efficiency. 
In the first quarter, the fundamental trends underlying the overall Wireline results have not changed. The secular changes in the consumer market and the impact of the economic downturn in our business markets are still quite evident. And while Wireless revenues are still declining, it is at a lower rate, which is positive. The facts are that in the first quarter, the sequential decline in Wireline revenues was nearly a $0.25 billion. We did realize about $80 million of savings attributable to cost reductions. 
However, these savings were more than offset by a combination of cost pressures, including an unusually high amount of storm-related costs and incremental pension and retiree benefit expenses. I am confident that as we go through the year, we will be able to stabilize the Wireline margin with a combination of better revenue performance and our cost-restructuring efforts. 
Every line item of expense is being attacked within our Wireline business. Let's take a look at some of the key areas. 
First, headcount. In January, I indicated that our plans were to reduce the Wireline workforce by a similar level to what we achieved in 2009. A reduction of 10,000 people, for example, results in an annual run rate cost savings of about $600 million. 
In the first quarter, we reduced our workforce by 2,300. Keep in mind that our teams have executed well in this area with more than 28,000 reductions since the beginning of 2008.
Next, real estate. We have been doing an extensive amount of work rationalizing our real estate portfolio to reduce costs. This includes plans to close facilities and reducing square footage, reductions in energy usage, as well as facility maintenance savings.  Our plan identifies roughly $125 million in cost savings in 2010 alone. Over the course of the next 3 years, we plan to reduce our total square footage by about 10%. 
Other initiatives involve cost savings from network convergence, which includes center consolidations, operating and support system eliminations, and new technology efficiencies. We've identified $100 million in projected savings here by the end of 2010.
Other areas of projected savings include managing third-party interconnect and content clusts and a variety of reduction initiatives associated with supply chain, inventory management and energy. Over the course of the next two years, we have plans in place to resize our cost structure and capture run rate savings in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Once again, we have a well-organized and realistic plan, and I'm confident that we will capture these savings. 
To sum up, as we move into the second quarter, we remain focused on the key areas I mentioned earlier. First, continuing to generate solid cash flows and maintaining tight control over capital spending. Second, continuing to capitalize on our investments in Wireless, FiOS and Global IP networks to grow revenue and market share, drive deeper penetration and increase ARPU. And, third, remaining focused on our cost structure, achieving meaningful cost reductions and making sure the business is ready to quickly benefit from improvements in the employment rates and the overall economy.

Typically, the first quarter is down seasonally somewhere in the range of 20% and 30%. Obviously, that was magnified in this quarter. We came off a very strong fourth quarter, as you know, where we have gained 1.1 million, really on the back of the strong introduction of the DROID and the Android-based operating devices. We had no really major new devices launched in Q1. The Android-itself-based operating system continues to do very well. In fact, when you look at actual gross numbers, we moved more of them in Q1 than we did in Q4. So we're very satisfied with what we would label as the Droid franchise. And you're going to here a lot more about that in the coming months, particularly with an important launch for us coming up shortly, which is the HTC Incredible, which the early reviews on is extremely positive. Now the other thing in the quarter, we put a lot of emphasis around upgrades, and we did see an uptick of about 15% in our upgrade level. Now that's great news for us. It's great news for our ARPU. It's great news for retention. And, by the way, we see a lot of ability with tailwinds there to continue to do well with that.

We are not ready to throw the towel and to say that postpaid growth is going to be substantially lower. Now, by the way, we recognize where penetration is, we don't think we are going to have $2 million quarters, but we did we could do better than we did in Q1. Now I would also underpin this by saying that we're going to be very responsible in terms of how we go after that. We are very focused on profitability, making sure we got the right mix. We do have a huge upgrade opportunity as I mentioned before. And the other thought I would give you here is that this is really a foundation, as we look at it, for our LTE launch later this year. We are more excited than ever about the prospects and the capability of LTE. So as we get more and more of our customers with smartphone-based devices, it's going to be a very nice transition into the LTE launch. Now a couple of thoughts for you here on margin. We had a very good quarter from a margin perspective, 46%. As you know, we don't have a particular point guidance out there. We have seen, particularly in these economic times, a bit of a mixed shift towards all-you-can-eat plans. That's really driven more on the lower end of the marketplace. We've seen some of our prepaid base move to the reseller plans. We've seen some of the lower end of the market. That will probably continue for a little while, but we still believe there will be a lot of strength on postpaid. Now just to refresh you on this, our reseller pricing is not unlimited. It's really a bucket of minutes. The reseller customers that we're attracting now carry much higher ARPUs than our additional ones and are very profitable and are not dilutive to our overall margin. We think we can continue to grow margin quite nicely in the Wireless business and be in a very good position."

One is we just passed the 10th Year Anniversary, hard to believe, of Verizon Wireless of being created. In partnership with Vodafone, I think our teams have done a great job. We've had a great working relationship with them over the last 10 years and the business is doing extremely well. Now let me hit the dividend issue first because I think it's important. I want to make sure from our perspective that our shareholders understand that we view the dividend as being very safe. We're a business that generates a lot of cash flow, over $30 billion of cash flow. We have a lot of different levers we can pull to make sure we have the ability to pay the dividend. I'm surprised that becomes as big of a question as it does become, given all of the levers and all of the cash flow that we have. We have numerous sources of cash that is being generated. And, by the way, paying the dividend to our shareholders, our shareholders are a priority for us. So the dividend and making sure we have stability and being in a position to recommend to the Board dividend increases is highly, highly important to us. Now on the strategic side of it, Tim, over the last 10 years, you and I both have watched there were kind of cycles where the whole ownership question gets more and more attention. We're in one of those times right now. From where I sit, the business is working extremely well. We've never made a secret of the fact that under the right conditions, right terms, of course, we would be interested in buying out the minority interest, the 45%. Why wouldn't we be in a business that's working as well as it is? Now from my perspective as the CFO, that's very much a financial transaction. We run the business today. We operate the business. We manage it. We control it. So I would look at what is the price tag that the other party would be -- if they were interested in selling, what's the price tag. What's the multiple. It doesn't make sense to us from a financial perspective. I don't know where that's going to go. But our view is pretty clear on that from that perspective. The discussions around merger that have been out there in the press, Ivan commented on that recently, and it does reflect the belief of the management team. We don't -- we're not convinced there's industrial logic behind putting the two organizations together. By the way, not that we're not open to listening, hearing new information on that, but we do not see a significant level of synergies. Cross-border mergers have not been historically highly successful. A lot of management complexity comes with that. So while we're always interested to hear about that, we don't really see the industrial logic. Now on the cash flow from Wireless, the great news is there's a lot of cash flow. It's growing. It's getting better. It's going to continue getting better. We've been clear what our view is of that in the short term, which is to use it to de-lever Verizon Wireless. That is still our view. We have an annual discussion with Vodafone in December of each year. We'll have another one next year. There is not religion though, I don't want you to think that we would never dividend cash out of Verizon Wireless. At some point, when we're in a position where leverage is much lower than it is today, and when it is appropriate, we will dividend cash out of Verizon Wireless. It's not just a 2010 event. We'll look at that again as we get into 2011. But it's an event off into the future."

We're very focused on growing penetration. Our build plans, we're still on the path to build ultimately to about 18 million premises within our franchise territories. This year, we're going to pass about 1 million premises in 2010, give or take 100,000, 200,000 on either side. Part of that is an intentional strategy, Simon, this year to focus down on a lot of the inventory we have, a very strong focus around the MDU population within our franchise territory. We don't believe we'd have enough focus there, and it's a great opportunity and a very cost effective way to drive new subscribers in new retention. Now from an RCM perspective, you are right. We've had very good growth in FiOS RCM, more focused on the video side. We have had some price increases there, which are natural in terms of the video side. We've also seen improvements in some of our Video-on-Demand kind of services that are also contributing to that. So we're very pleased with FiOS. The profitability continues to improve. We've been operating income positive for the last couple of quarters. The cost metrics that we believe we would see ultimately with FiOS has positioned us very well. And we think we've got a great foundation here on the Wireline side for the future that we will have somewhere in the range of post-Frontier spin-out 70% to 80%, in that range, of footprint covered with Fiber. And that's going to position us very well for the future. We've also got to focus on making sure that we've got capital discipline within the Wireline business. We have, suffered a little bit from the economy in some of the cyclical change. So there is a focus on making sure we are investing at the right level in that business."

It came. You guys really got more aggressive on your smartphone portfolio than you had really ever been in the third quarter and that kind of led to a market share swing back in your favor.

I mean, it is a very competitive environment, as you know, and continues to be, but I don't see anything in the quarter or this year that has really shifted. When you look at our results, we did better in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter. Our total broadband was 89,000, just short of 100,000. That was up on third and fourth quarter a year ago. We continue to do reasonably well here. We would like to drive to a little bit higher numbers as we go through the next several quarters. We think with the economy starting to come back a little bit, we're positioned for that. Our Wireline team is very focused on it. We don't see -- and, Dave, customer satisfaction and independent reports continue to put FiOS at the top of the list in all areas. We think we've got a great product here. You're incenting people to change. They've already got service typically. So that's the trick for us. On the second question, Dave, it's really more of what we're doing now. We think we have found a very strong lineup. And, again, not just based on one operating system but the Android-based system, the Rim systems. We've had some Microsoft launches recently. But you will see a lot of emphasis around the Droid as we go through the year. We think we have a very competitive lineup. There's no question Apple's done a great job with the iPhone. But look at our results. I mean, we've performed very well both from a growth -- revenue growth this quarter on the Wireless side is better than it was last quarter. Our service revenue is upticking. We have several different new devices coming as the year goes on, most notably, the one I just mentioned, which is the HTC Incredible. So I think we'll be earlier in the process this year having very strong devices to be very competitive. But, again, based on multiple systems and we think we'll be in a very good position."

You know we don't put out guidance numbers on that in point estimates. Let me just give you a little color on what we think happened in the first quarter, where we're focused on and where we think we're going. So if you look at the margin in the quarter of 21.7%, we had to eat through a sequential revenue decline of about $225 million. By the way, we see good news there because rate of revenue decline in the quarter was only 2.9%. It was 3.9% in the fourth quarter. So we see improvement there. We had a couple of unique issues in the quarter that hurt us a little bit. We had mentioned that this year, we do have some incremental pension and OPEB costs. That was about $40 million in the quarter.  And this is one we don't usually like to point to and talk to, but it was such a factor in this quarter I'm going to mention it. We did have extraordinary weather conditions on the East Coast. That minimally cost us $50 million in the quarter. That was related to a lot of overtime because of the flooding conditions, record snow flow in the mid-Atlantic states, which you usually don't have that caused complications. So there were a lot of issues that contributed to the first quarter. Now when you look at our focus going forward, it's really focused around four items. We continue to focus on FiOS. We're very pleased with the profitability where FiOS is, but we think it can get a lot better as we continue to get more and more scale. So that's going to continue to ramp up and help us. We think our Enterprise and Businesses Services as the economy gets better as we go through '10, probably saw a little sign of that in the first quarter. I don't think there was much of it in our numbers. But we think we'll see more of that, particularly in the second half of the year. That will be very helpful to us. Now on the cost side, I hope you get the feel here that we are very focused on improving and continuing to improve the cost structure. I mentioned on previous calls the last couple of years, we've reduced our Wireline workforce by about 13,000 per year, and I said we would do the same this year. I actually think we have now the ability to do more than that this year. You'll probably read in the press later today that we did reach agreement with our unions, and our East Coast unions, the CWA and the IBEW, on an enhanced incentive offer last night. And that is going to allow  us to take out a significant number of associates. And one of our limitations on our ability to downsize the workforce was we were limited in our ability to lay off in our East Coast contracts. We could lay off post-2003 hired employees, and we did some of that last year, but beyond that, it was voluntary incentives that drove it. We reached agreement on an enhancement.  I think this year we should be able to beat the 13,000 number. I'm not going to put an exact number on that yet because we're still factoring through that based on the agreement.  But I think we'll be very focused on additional force reductions this year. In addition to that, Mike, we're also very focused around cash flow in the Wireline business. That ties back to some of the other questions and capital efficiency will improve. So I'm not going to put a number or a date on when this is going to turn, but I think I am convinced we have all of the rights initiatives in place. We have the conviction to get it done and that we should see the ability to stabilize and then improve our Wireline margins over time."

That's at a time where there is a little slow down, as you've mentioned, on the postpaid side. We feel good about where we are on Wireless market share. And we think we'll continue to do well as we go through the year. From an Enterprise perspective, a couple of thoughts here for you. Our number in the quarter is only down 1.4%.  It had been down 4.8%  in the fourth quarter, 6.2% in the third quarter. Even when you adjust for FX, we were down 2.3% in the quarter versus 5.6% in the fourth and 5.3%.  So we're definitely seeing improvement here in Enterprise perspective. We repeatedly said we've been very successful in winning new opportunities in the marketplace. We continue to do that. A number of those are incremental. We're still seeing moves on both a private IP perspective, as well as security services. We did see some benefits in the quarter, also from CPE. Now that's a good indicator, I think, of the economy. So that all puts us in a good position. Now on how important is it? It's important. But there are four or five different major contributors that we need to get them all clicking. Cost is probably number one right now in terms of biggest contribution, but continuing the progress on FiOS, continuing the progress on Enterprise are all very important. So I know you've got another call at 9:30. So I think we're going to call this a wrap. 
I want to leave you with a couple of closing comments you. First of all, let me thank you for joining us today. If you look at our Wireless business, we continue to see great opportunities to grow the business and to make the business more efficient. Our strategy around aggressive 4G deployment and increased smartphone penetration through multiple operating platforms will drive data growth and continue to differentiate us from our competitors. 
We remain committed to maintaining reasonable growth and strong profitability on our Wireless segment. On the Wireline side, we believe that the strategy we put in place a few years ago, that is having a smaller footprint with the majority covered by FiOS, coupled with a more Global Enterprise Business focused on multinationals, is the right strategy that also differentiates us from our peers and will help drive growth for the long-term. I also recognize that the issue in the Wireline segment is stabilizing and improving profitability. I do not want to overstate what we can do here on the short-term, but I believe our cost reduction initiatives will gain traction. And with an improving economy, we will see better Wireline margins.

Thanks for joining us this morning.  I’m Ron Lataille and with me this morning is John Killian our Chief Financial Officer.Before we get started, let me remind you that our",542,"Good morning and welcome to our First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call.  Thanks for joining us this morning.  I’m Ron Lataille and with me this morning is John Killian our Chief Financial Officer.
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our investor relations website.  This call is being webcast.  If you would like to listen to a replay you can do so from our website.  
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement.  Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties.  Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon’s filings with the SEC which are available on our website.  This presentation also contains certain non- GAAP financial measures.  Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.
As we indicated on our last earnings conference call, beginning this quarter we are no longer adjusting reported earnings results.  Instead, we are only reporting GAAP earnings, consistent with trends in corporate reporting.  Of course we will continue to provide the detailed information you need to understand and analyze our reported results, including the identification of material, non-operational items.
For the first quarter GAAP earnings were $0.14 per share.  These earnings results include a total of $0.42 of non-operational charges, the largest of which is for reduced tax benefits related to retiree healthcare.  This onetime, non-cash tax charge totaled $962 million or $0.34 per share.  In addition, we incurred a non-cash charge of $0.03 per share related to pension settlement losses resulting from our previously announced separation plan.  As you know, pension accounting rules require that settlement losses be recorded once prescribed payment thresholds have been reached.
We also incurred non-operational costs in connection with the spinoff of our local exchange business in 14 states.  As we’ve previously discussed, these costs are related to network, software and other activities required for these facilities to function as a separate company.  This quarter these get ready costs amounted to $0.04 per share.  Lastly, we incurred $0.01 per share this quarter related to Alltel merger integration costs.
I would also point out that all of these non-operational items are reported at the consolidated level and therefore do affect any comparison for wireless or wireline segment results to prior periods.  
One last item I’d like to mention relates to certain revenue reclassifications within the wireline segment, due primarily to business customer shifts between mass market, global enterprise and global wholesale.  The largest shift involved businesses with 20 or more employees.  These accounts are now being managed by our enterprise sales teams and the corresponding revenues will be reported on the global enterprise line.  Revenue from businesses with less than 20 employees will continue to be included in the mass market line.
Prior period history has been reclassified and is provided in the supplemental schedule and historical files on our website.  These changes in revenue line item reporting did not have a significant effect on historical growth rates.  With that, I will now turn the call over to John Killian.

Before we get into the operational details, let me start with some brief comments on the business overall and add some perspective to the results for this quarter.  In January, we outlined our key focus areas for 2",2951,"Thanks, Ron, and good morning everyone.  Before we get into the operational details, let me start with some brief comments on the business overall and add some perspective to the results for this quarter.  In January, we outlined our key focus areas for 2010.  In summary, we said that we expect to continue generating solid cash flows and maintain tight control over capital spending.  
Second, we would continue to capitalize on our investments in wireless, FiOS and global IP networks to grow revenues and market share, drive deeper penetration and increase ARPU.  Finally, we would remain focused on our cost structure, achieve meaningful cost reductions, and make sure the business is ready to quickly benefit from improvements in employment figures in the overall economy.  
In the first quarter, we executed on the business plan we described to you.  Free cash flow grew over 25% this quarter, driven by strong cash flow from operations and a lower capital spending.  We saw good customer growth in wireless and FiOS and we may be seeing some positive early signs of recovery in the business markets.
Revenue trends this quarter were better on a consolidated basis, as well as in the wireless and wireline segments.  In wireless, data growth was particularly strong this quarter driven by the significant amount of smart phone sales and upgrades.  We feel very good about our retail postpaid ARPU and customer retention performance this quarter.
On the cost side, we continue to benefit from the synergy savings of the Alltel acquisition and wireless margins expanded this quarter.  In our wireline segment we continue to be aggressive and persistent in our cost restructuring to preserve margins.  Cost reductions of 5,000 last quarter and 2,300 this quarter resulted in cost savings of about $80 million in the first quarter.  However, the continued economic pressures on the top line, incremental pension and retiree benefit costs, and a higher cost related to record setting storms, affecting much of our franchise territory, resulted in a lower margin.  
My goal continues to be to stabilize the wireline margin this year.  We are on track with our plans to accomplish this goal.  I am confident that we can achieve this objective and expand margins in the future.  Lastly, on the strategic front, our pending transactions involving the sale of the Alltel divestiture markets and the spinoff of access lines are both moving forward.  With this as an overview, let’s turn to Slide 4 and start our detailed discussion of the quarter.
As Ron indicated earlier, our first quarter earnings results included the non-operational charges you see here.  A majority being non-cash and related to deferred tax and pension expense recognition.  Our cash summary presents a much different growth picture.  Cash flow from operations in the quarter was strong, up 7.5% over last year.  Our capital spending was down $251 million or 6.8%.  Free cash flow at the end of the quarter was $3.7 billion up almost $750 million or 25.6%.  
In wireline, first quarter capital expenditures of $1.6 billion were down $437 million year over year.  In wireless, capital costs were higher by $219 million.  Although we’ve started the year conservatively, I’d reiterate that our 2010 guidance for capital spending is in the $16.8 billion to $17.2 billion range.  As far as the balance sheet is concerned, we continue to reduce leverage.  In the first 3 months we’ve reduced net debt by $1.7 billion and net debt is down more than 10% from a year ago.  
Let’s now turn to revenue trends, which are on Slide 5.  Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $26.9 billion, up 1.2% from the first quarter a year ago; a better growth rate than each of the last two quarters.  This reflects improvements in both wireless and wireline.  Wireless revenues were up $661 million or 4.4% driven primarily by data.  Wireline revenues were down 2.9% this quarter due primarily to continued economic pressures in our business markets.  FiOS revenue growth continues to be strong, up 40% year on year.  This is the third consecutive quarter of lower year over year revenue decline in wireline.  
With that snapshot of revenues, let’s move to the segments next, starting with wireless on Slide 6.  In the first quarter, total service revenues were up $770 million or 5.9% versus the year ago quarter and we saw strong sequential improvement of 2.2% which is the highest sequential growth rate we’ve see in the last six quarters.  
This revenue performance is of course driven by our strong focus on expanding the data market.  Data revenues, which comprised one-third of total service revenues in the quarter, grew 26.4% year-over-year.  Total ARPU was 18% higher than a year ago.
In terms of the components of data growth, quarterly revenues from web and email services was $2.4 billion, up 43.5% from first quarter last year. Messaging revenues of $1.8 billion grew 16.2%.  
Our strategy continues to center on taking advantage of the expanding smart phone category.  Our approach has been to feature a number of different operating systems and platforms which gives us the opportunity to not only attract new customers, but aggressively upgrade existing customers to high end data capable devices.  
In addition to the obvious benefits to metrics like ARPU and churn, this will drive sustained data revenue growth.  We have plenty of upside in terms of data penetration.  At the end of the first quarter, more than 30% of our retail postpaid base had 3G multimedia devices or smartphones, up from 26% at the end of 2009.  17% had smartphones and 13% had 3G multimedia devices.  We believe customer demand for data mobility for connections not previously disclosed were counted in our subscriber metrics in the past.
At the end of the first quarter we had 92.8 million customers and more than 100 million total connections.  Our high quality customer base is heavily weighted toward retail postpaid customers which comprised 89% of our subscriber base.
This customer segment remains our key focus as we continue to drive revenue growth through increased data usage in penetration.  In the first quarter we added more than 1.5 million net new customers with 423,000 retail postpaid net adds and 1.3 million reseller additions.
With regard to the change in mix, we typically see seasonal effects in the first quarter.  In any given year the sequential decline in retail postpaid net adds between fourth and first quarter can be about 25% to 30%.  This quarter the decline was magnified.  But we did not see any significant shift in market share, overall porting ratios or any increase in churn.  In fact our churn rates improved.  Total churn showed declines both on a year over year basis and sequentially.
In postpaid, churn posted a 6% improvement compared to the first quarter last year.  I would also add that these improvements are from already remarkably low industry leading churn levels.  Although total wireless market penetration is above 90%, we are still very bullish about our growth opportunities in the retail postpaid market.
By continuing to strengthen our smart phone device lineup, in ordering differentiated services like NFL mobile and Skype mobile, we will stimulate upgrades within our existing base as well as attract and retain high value customers.
Net adds in our reseller channel were very strong again this quarter which is not surprising given typical prepaid seasonality.  The reseller market is a low-cost channel for us and an effective way for us to attract the incremental prepaid customer.  I would also remind you that we do not have unlimited pricing arrangements with our reseller partners.
The new category - other connections - totals 7.3 million at this time and will include all kinds of machine to machine devices like vehicle tracking, telematics, e-readers, consumer electronics, smart grid solutions, medical alert devices, essentially anything that has a wireless chip in it.
Looking ahead, particularly when we commercialize LTE, the proliferation of these types of devices will be another source of incremental wireless growth.  As we’ve mentioned in the past we have a separate organization dedicated to open development and Verizon wireless is taking a leadership role in facilitating and stimulating innovation in this area.  Examples include nPhase which is our joint venture with Qualcomm to provide advanced M2M solutions, the establishment of the Verizon Technology Innovation Center in Waltham and the creation of the 4G Venture Forum.
Let’s take a closer look at our retail performance on Slide 8.  Our focus continues to be on the retail postpaid market.  It is the largest and most important portion of our business.  Retail service revenue -- which accounts for about 85% of total wireless revenues -- grew 5% in the first quarter on a year over year basis.
As I mentioned earlier, our retail postpaid ARPU grew 0.6% versus the year ago quarter.  This accretion is driven by our data growth strategy with an increasing percentage of our customers using smart phones and multimedia devices.
Device upgrades were strong as 8.6% of our postpaid base upgraded in the first quarter representing an increase of almost 15% from a year ago.  This is extremely positive from a churn and ARPU accretion perspective.
Customers are responding very well to our portfolios, smart phones, and multimedia devices.  36% of device sales from our direct channels were smart phones with a $30 monthly data plan and 24% were from multimedia devices, which have a minimum $10 monthly data plan attached.
The pricing simplification we implemented in January is helping to drive some of these excellent metrics and the results were exactly what we anticipated.  While we experienced the downward migration of customers from the $99 unlimited price point, we also saw a healthy migration of customers up to new $69 unlimited price point.
Another positive development is an increasing percentage of gross adds or new customers opting for voice plans at 900 minutes per month or more, which obviously bodes well for revenue and ARPU.
As [Lowell] described on the investor call in January, our goal is to drive further smart phone penetration and stimulate data growth; which will offset some of the voice declines.  In addition, as we launch LTE later this year, having a large number of data customers provides us with a great opportunity to meet their increasing need for higher speed and more sophisticated application-based devices.
The first quarter results indicate that this is the right strategy.  Revenue growth improved, our key customer retention metrics improved, and we saw retail postpaid ARPU accretion.
In terms of profitability, we had another excellent quarter, generating 6.4 billion of EBITDA up 5.7% from first quarter last year.  Our first quarter margin performance of 46% is a strong result, reflecting both lower retail gross additions and stronger upgrades to higher end devices.
I think the wireless team did a great job this quarter driving this margin result given our aggressive upgrade strategy.  Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue achieving both growth and profitability, with a focus on gaining share in the retail postpaid market and increasing the penetration of smart phones and other data devices which will further expand the data market.
Let’s move now to our wireline segment on Slide 10.  As I mentioned earlier, we continued to see both cyclical and secular pressures in our wireline consumer and business markets, with total wireline revenues down 2.9% from a year ago.
Our broadband and video products are driving a significant shift in our consumer revenue mix and we continue to be very pleased with the success of FiOS.  FiOS revenues are up 40% and ARPU increased 5% year over year.
Managed and IP services continue to transform the business revenue mix.  In the first quarter, strategic services revenue and enterprise was up 4.2%.  Let’s take a closer look at both the consumer and business markets starting on Slide 11.
A year ago FiOS made up about 30% of our consumer revenue.  At the end of this quarter, FiOS represented more than 41%, a significant increase in just four quarters.  The strength of our broadband and video products continues to drive consumer revenue and ARPU growth.
Consumer revenue in the first quarter grew 0.9% on a year over year basis and we continue to see strong growth in consumer ARPU which increased to more than $78 this quarter, up 12.3% from a year ago.
The entire FiOS initiative continues to be very successful and we saw very positive levels of customer additions for both FiOS TV and internet this quarter.  We have surpassed the three million customer mark in FiOS TV, with 168,000 net adds this quarter, and with 12 million homes open for sale, penetration of FiOS TV is 25%.  In FiOS internet we added 185,000 customers this quarter bringing our total to 3.6 million.  With 12.6 million homes open for sale, internet penetration is 29%.
Let’s move next to our business markets on Slide 12 which shows our global enterprise and global wholesale revenue performance.  As you can see, revenue in each of these categories has been relatively stable for the last five quarters.
As a result we’re seeing improved comparisons on a year over year basis.  Global enterprise revenues was down $57 million or 1.4% in the first quarter, compared with a 4.8% year over year decline in the fourth quarter.
The steady increase in the number of private IT site activations is an encouraging indicator, as are CPE sales, which were higher than we typically see in the first quarter. Enterprise long distance usage volumes which have typically seasonal fluctuations show year over year growth for the first time in quite a while. All of these factors point to early signs of a recovery. That should help our review performance in future quarters. 
Global wholesale revenue in the first quarter declined $69 million but 2.9% year-over-year compared with a 4.9% decline in the fourth quarter. While we continue to see growth in ethernet services related to wireless back wall, we are not seeing a pick-up in wholesale long distance usage volumes yet. Foreign currency effects this quarter were similar to what we have experience in the fourth quarter. So the key point here is that revenue is stable and there is some optimism for improved performance in a recovery starting in the second half of the year. 
Let’s cover wireline profitability next. From my perspective we’re competing well in the market and we remain focused within the wireline segment on four key strategies, driving FiOS growth, improving enterprise, driving costs out, and capital efficiency. In the first quarter, the fundamental trends underline the overall wireline results have not changed. The secular changes in the consumer market and the impact of the economic downturn in our business markets are still quite evident and while wireline revenues are still declining it is at a lower rate which is positive. 
The facts are that in the first quarter the sequential decline in wireline revenues was nearly a quarter of a billion dollars. We did realize about $80 million in savings this quarter attributable to force reductions. However, these savings were more than offset by a combination of cost pressures including, an unusually high amount of storm related costs and incremental pension and retiree benefit expenses. I am confident that as we go through the year we will be able to stabilize the wireline margin with a combination of better revenue performance and our cost restructuring efforts. Every line item of expense is being attacked within our wireline business. 
Let’s take a look at some of the key areas. First, head counts.  In January I indicated that our plans were to reduce the wireline workforce by a similar level to what we achieved in 2009. A reduction of 10,000 people for example results in an annual run rate cost savings of about $600 million. In the first quarter we reduced our workforce by 2,300.  Keep in mind that our teams have executed well in this area with more than 28,000 reductions since the beginning of 2008.
Next, real estate. We have been doing an extensive amount of work rationalizing our real estate portfolio to reduce costs. This included plans to close facilities and reducing square footage, reductions in energy usage as well as facility maintenance savings. Our plan identifies roughly $125 million in cost savings in 2010 alone. Over the course of the next three years we plan to reduce our total square footage by about 10%. 
Other initiatives involve cost savings from network convergence which include center consolidations, operating and support system eliminations and new technology efficiencies. We’ve identified $100 million in projected savings here by the end of 2010. Other areas of projected savings include managing third part interconnecting, content costs and a variety of reduction initiatives associated with supply chain inventory management and energy. Over the course of the next two years we have plans in place to resize our cost structure and capture run rate savings in the range of $1.5 to $2 billion. Once again we have a well organized and realistic plan and I am confident that we will capture these savings. 
To sum up, as we move into the second quarter we remain focused on the key areas I mentioned earlier. First, continuing to generate solid cash flows and maintaining tight control over capital spending. Second, continuing to capitalize our investments and wireless FiOS and global IP networks to grow revenue in market share, drive deeper penetration and increase output. and third remaining focused on our cost structure, achieving meaningful cost reductions and making sure the business is ready to quickly benefit from improvements in the employment rates and the overall economy.

Typically the first quarter is down seasonally somewhere in the range of 20% to 30%. Obviously that was magnified in this quarter. We came off a very strong fourth quarter as you know where we had gained 1.1 million. Really, on the back of the strong introduction of the Droid and the Android based operating devices. 
We had no really major new devices launched in Q1. The Android itself based operation system continues to do very well, in fact when you look at actually gross numbers we moved more of them in Q1 than we did in Q4 so we’re very satisfied with what we would label as the Droid franchise and you’re going to hear a lot more about that in the coming months, particularly with an important launch for us coming up shortly which is the HTC Incredible which the early reviews on is extremely positive. 
Now the other thing in the quarter, we put a lot of emphasis around upgrades and we did see an uptick of about 15% in our upgrade level. Now that’s great news for us, it’s great news for ARPU, it’s great news for retention and by the way we see a lot of ability with tailwinds there to continue to do well with that. 
Now as we go forward, just a couple of thoughts for you, we believe we can do better from a post paid perspective than we did in Q1 that will be particularly on the backs of new product introductions. We are not ready to throw the towel in to say that postpaid growth is going to be substantially lower now, by the way we recognize where penetration is, we don’t think we’re going to have $2 million quarters but we think we can do better than we did in Q1. 
Now I would also underpin this saying we are going to be very responsible in terms of how we go after that. We are very focused on profitability, making sure we got the right mix, we do have a huge upgrade opportunity as I mentioned before, and the other thought I would give you here is that this is really a foundation as we look at it for our LTE launch later this year. We’re more excited than ever about the prospects and the capability of LTE so as we get more and more of our customers with smart phone based devices it’s going to be a very nice transition into the LTE launch. 
Now a couple of thoughts for you here on margin. We had a very good quarter from a margin perspective, 46%. As you know we don’t have particular point guidance out there. We have seen particularly in these economic times a bit of a mixed shift towards the all you can eat plans, that’s really driven more on the lower end of the marketplace. We’ve seen some of our prepaid base move to the reseller plans. We’ve seen some of the lower end of the market. That will probably continue for a little while but we still believe that we’ll be a lot of strength on postpaid.
Now just to refresh you on this, our reseller pricing is not unlimited, okay? It’s really a bucket of minutes.
Reseller customers that we're attracting now carry much higher ARPUs than our traditional ones, and are very profitable and are not dilutive to our overall margin.  So we think we can continue to grow margin quite nicely in the wireless business and be in a very good position.

We're a business that generates a lot of cash flow, over $30 billion of cash flow.  We have a lot of different levers we can pull to make sure we have the ability to pay the dividend.  
And you know I'm surprised that becomes as big of a question as it does become given all of the levers and all of the cash flow that we have.  We have numerous sources of cash that is being generated.  And by the way paying the dividend to our shareholders, our shareholders are a priority for us.  So the dividend and making sure we have stability and being in a position to recommend to the board dividend increases is highly, highly important to us.  
Now on the strategic side of it Tim, you know, over the last 10 years you and I have both watched, there are kind of cycles where the whole ownership question gets more and more attention.  We're in one of those times right now.  From where I sit, the business is working extremely well.  We've never made a secret of the fact that under the right conditions, right terms, of course we would be interested in buying out the minority interest for 45%.  Why wouldn't we be in a business that's working as well as it is?  
Now from my perspective as a CFO, that's very much a financial transaction.  We run the business today, we operate the business, we manage it, we control it.  So I would look at, you know, what is the price tag that the other party if they were interested in selling.  What's the price tag?  What's the multiple?  Does it make sense to us from a financial perspective?  
I don't know where that's going to go, but our view is pretty clear on that from that perspective.  The discussions around merger that had been out there in the press, you know, I've made a comment on that recently and it kind of does reflect the belief of the management team.  We're not convinced there's industrial logic behind putting the two organizations together.  
By the way, not that we're not open to listening, hearing new information on that, but we do not see a significant level of synergies, cross border mergers, you know, have not been historically highly successful.  A lot of management complexity comes with that.  So while we're always interested to hear about that, we don't really see the industrial logic.  
Now on the cash flow from wireless, the great news is there's a lot of cash flow.  It's growing, it's getting better.  It's going to continue to get better.  We've been clear what our view is of that in the short-term, which is to use it to delever Verizon Wireless.  That is still our view.  
We have an annual discussion with Vodafone in December of each year.  We'll have another next year.  There is not [religion] though. I don't want you to think that we would never dividend cash out of Verizon Wireless.  At some point when we're in a position where leverage is much lower than it is today, and when it is appropriate, we will dividend cash out of Verizon Wireless.  It's just not a 2010 event.  We'll be looking at that again as we get into 2011, but it's an event off into the future.

We're very focused on growing penetration.  Our build plans, we're still on the path to build alternately to about 18 million premises within our franchise territories.  
This year we're going to pass about 1 million premises in 2010.  You know, give or take 100,000 or 200,000 on either side.  Part of that is an intentional strategy, Simon, this year to focus down on a lot of the inventory we have.  A very strong focus around the NPU population within our franchise territory.  
We don't believe we've had enough focus there, and it's a great opportunity and a very cost effective way to drive new subscribers in new retention.  Now from an RCM perspective you are right.  We've had very good growth in FiOS RCM, more focused on the video side.  We have had some price increases there which are natural, you know, in terms of the video side.  
We've also seen improvements in some of our Video on Demand kind of services that are also contributing to that.  So yes, we're very pleased with FiOS.  The profitability continues to improve.  We've been operating income positive the last couple of quarters.  The cost metrics that we believed we would see ultimately with FiOS has positioned us very well.  
And, you know, we think we've got a great foundation here on the wireline side for the future.  That, you know, we will have somewhere in the range of post Frontier spinout 70% to 80%, in that range, of footprint covered with fiber.  And that's going to position us very well for the future.  You know, we've also got focus on making sure we've got capital discipline within the wireline business.  We have suffered a little bit from the economy and some of the cyclical change.  So there is focus on making sure we're investing at the right level in that business.

The second question would be on the iPhone, not the question you think.  It’s clearer now, I think, than it’s been that there’s probably an iPhone refresh coming around the middle of the year.  Obviously, last year’s game plan was to wait, it came, you really got more aggressive on your smart phone portfolio than you’d really ever been in the third quarter and that led to a market share swing back in your favor.  Looking at it this year, what would be the game plan this year that you would do differently, if anything, to make sure that there isn’t a market share swing in AT&T’s favor the way we saw last year?

It is a very competitive environment, as you know and continues to be but I don’t see anything in the quarter or this year that has really shifted.  When you look at our results, we did better in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter.  
Our total broadband was 89,000 just short of 100,000.  That was up on [30] in fourth quarter a year ago.  We continue to do reasonably well here.  We’d like to drive to a little bit higher numbers as we go through the next several quarters.  We think with the economy starting to come back a little bit we’re positioned for that.  Our wireline team is very focused on it.  We don’t see…and you know Dave, customer satisfaction and independent reports continue to put FiOS at the top of the list in all areas.  We think we’ve got a great product here.  You’re incenting people to change, right?  They’ve already got service, typically, so that’s the trick for us.
On the second question, it’s really more of what we’re doing now.  We think we have found a very strong  lineup, and again, not just based on one operating system but the DROID, Android based system, the [REM] systems, we’ve had some Microsoft launches recently, but you will see a lot of emphasis around the DROID as we go through the year.  We think we have a very competitive lineup.  
There’s no question, Apple’s done a great job with the iPhone, but look at our results.  We’ve performed very well both from a growth, our revenue growth this quarter on the wireless side is better than it was last quarter, our service revenue is upticking .  We have several different, new devices coming as the year goes on, most notably the one I just mentioned, which is the HTC Incredible.  So, I think we’ll be earlier in the process this year of having very strong devices to be very competitive.  But again, based on multiple systems, we think we’ll be in a very good position.

You know we don’t put out guidance numbers on that and point estimates.  Let me just give you a little color to what we think happened in the quarter, where we’ll focus on and where we think we’re going.  
If you look at the margin on the quarter at 21.7, we had to eat through a sequential revenue decline of about $225 million.  By the way, we see good news there because rate of revenue decline in the quarter was only 2.9%, it was 3.9% in the fourth quarter, so we see improvement there.  
We had a couple of unique issues in the quarter that hurt us a little bit.  We had mentioned that this year that we do have some incremental pension and OpEx costs.  That was about $40 million in the quarter.  We had, and this is one we don’t usually like to point to and talk to, but it was such a factor in this quarter that I’m going to mention it, we did have extraordinary weather conditions on the east coast.  That minimally cost us $50 million in the quarter.  That was related to a lot of overtime because of the flooding conditions and record snowfall in the Mid-Atlantic States, which you usually don’t have that caused complications.  There are a lot of issues that contributed to the first quarter.
Now when you look at our focus going forward, it’s really focused around four items.  It’s continuing to focus on FiOS.  We’re very pleased with the profitability where FiOS is but we think it can get a lot better as we continue to get more and more scale.  So that’s going to continue to ramp up and help us.
We think our enterprise and businesses services, as the economy gets better as we go through ’10, probably saw a little sign of that in the first quarter.  I don’t think there was much of it in our numbers, but we think we’ll see more of that particularly in the second half of the year.  That will be very helpful to us.  
Now, on the cost side, I hope you get the feel here that we are very focused on improving and continuing to improve the cost structure.  I mentioned on previous calls the last couple of years we’ve reduced our wireline workforce by about 13,000 per year and I said we would do the same this year.  I actually think we have now the ability to do more than that this year.  
You’ll probably read in the press later today that we did reach agreement with our unions and our east coast unions, the CWA and the IBEW, on an enhanced incentive offer last night.  That is going to allow us to take out a significant number of associates.  One of our limitations on our ability to downsize the workforce was we were limited in our ability to layoff in our east coast contracts.  We could layoff post 2003 hired employees and we did some of that last year, but beyond that it was voluntary incentives that drove it.  
We reached agreement on an enhancement and I think this year we should be able to beat the 13,000 number.  I’m not going to put an exact number on that yet because we’re still factoring through that based on the agreement.  But I think we’ll be very focused on additional force reductions this year.
In addition to that, Mike, we’re also very focused around cash flow in the wireline business.  That ties back to some of the other questions and capital efficiency will improve.  I’m not going to put a number or a date on when this is going to turn, but I am convinced we have all of the right initiatives in place.  We have the conviction to get it done and that we should see the ability to stabilize and then improve our wireline margins over time.

Obviously we look at our churn numbers which are terrific, the postpaid churn at 1.07, we look at our porting ratio, so from our view we’re hanging in there very nicely, and that’s at a time where there is a little slowdown as you’ve mentioned on the postpaid side so we feel good about where we are on wireless market share and we think we’ll continue to do well as we go through the year.
 From an enterprise perspective, a couple thoughts here for you, our number in the quarter only down, 1.4,  had been down 4.8 in fourth quarter, 6.2 in third quarter.  Even would you adjust for FX we were down 2.3 in the quarter versus 5.6 in the fourth, 5.3. So were definitely seeing improvement here from an enterprise perspective. We’ve repeatedly said we’ve been very successful in winning new opportunities in the marketplace. We continue to do that, a number of those are incremental. We’re still seeing moves on both a private IP perspective as well as security services. We did see some benefits in the quarter also from CPE, now that’s a good indicator I think of the economy, so that all puts us in a good position.
Now on how important is it? It’s important but relevantly there are four or five different major contributors that we need to get them all clicking. Cost is probably number one right now in terms of biggest contribution but continuing the progress on FiOS, continuing the progress on enterprise are all very important. 
So I know you have another call at 9:30 so I think we’re going to call this [inaudible] but I want to leave you with a couple of closing comments here.  First of all let me thank you for joining us today. If you look at our wireless business we continue to see great opportunities to grow the business and to make the business more efficient.  Our strategy around aggressive 4G deployment and increased smart phone penetration for multiple operating platforms will drive data growth and continue to differentiate us from our competitors. 
We remain committed to maintaining reasonable growth and strong profitability in our wireless segment. On the wireline side, we believe that the strategy we put in place a few years ago, that is having a smaller footprint with the majority covered by FiOS, coupled with a more global enterprise business focused on multinationals is the right strategy that also differentiates us from our peers and will help drive growth for the long term. 
I also recognize that the issue on the wire line segment is stabilizing and improving profitability. I do not want to overstate what we can do here in the short term but I believe our cost reduction initiatives will gain traction and with an improving economy we will see better wireline modules. Finally we continue to deliver strong cash flow metrics. Our dividend is strong and safe. We’re maintaining good discipline in our capital spending and our balance sheet is solid. 
Thanks again for joining us today on the call.

I'm Ron Lataille and with me this morning is John Killian, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. 
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future result is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.
As we indicated on our last earnings conference call, beginning this quarter we are no longer adjusting reported earnings results, instead only reporting GAAP earnings, consistent with trends in corporate reporting. Of course, we will continue to provide the detailed information you need to understand and analyze our reported results, including the identification of material non-operational items. 
For the first quarter, GAAP earnings were $0.14 per share. These earnings results include a total of $0.42 of non-operational charges, the largest of which is for reduced tax benefits related to retiree healthcare. This one-time non-cash tax charge totaled $962 million or $0.34 per share. 
In addition, we incurred a non-cash charge of $0.03 per share related to pension settlement losses, resulting from our previously announced separation plan. As you know, pension accounting rules require that settlement losses be recorded once prescribed payment thresholds have been reached. 
We also incurred non-operational cost in connection with the spin-off of our local exchange business in 14 states. As we previously discussed, these costs are related to network, software and other activities required for these facilities to function as a separate company. This quarter, these get-ready costs amounted to $0.04 per share.
Lastly, we incurred $0.01 per share this quarter related to Alltel merger integration costs. I would also point out that all of these non-operational items are recorded at the consolidated level, and therefore, do not affect any comparison of our Wireless or Wireline segment results to prior periods. 
One last item I'd like to mention relates to certain revenue reclassifications within the Wireline segment due primarily to business customer shifts between mass-market, Global Enterprise and Global Wholesale. The largest shift involved businesses with 20 or more employees. These accounts are now being managed by our Enterprise sales teams, and the corresponding revenues will be reported on the Global Enterprise line. Revenue from businesses with less than 20 employees will continue to be included in the mass-market line. Prior period history has been reclassified and is provided in the supplemental schedules and historical files on our website. These changes in revenue line item reporting did not have a significant effect on historical growth rate. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to John Killian."

Before get into the operational details, let me start with some brief comments on the business overall, and add some perspective to the results for this quarter. 
In January, we outlined our key focus areas for 2010. In summary, we said that we expect to continue generating solid cash flows and maintain tight control over capital spending. 
Second, we would continue to capitalize on our investments in Wireless, FiOS and global IP networks to grow revenues and market share, drive deeper penetration and increase ARPU. Finally, we would remain focused on our cost structure, achieve meaningful cost reductions and make sure the business is ready to quickly benefit from improvements and employment figures in the overall economy.
In the first quarter, we executed on the business plan we described to you. Free cash flow grew over 25% this quarter, driven by strong cash flow from operations and a lower capital spending. 
We saw a good customer growth in Wireless and FiOS, and we may be seeing some positive early signs of recovery in the business markets. Revenue trends this quarter were better on a consolidated basis, as well as in the Wireless and Wireline segments. 
In Wireless, data growth was particularly strong this quarter, driven by the significant amount of smartphone sales and upgrades. We feel very good about our retail postpaid ARPU and customer retention performance this quarter. On the cost side, we continue to benefit from the synergy savings of the Alltel acquisition and Wireless margins expanded this quarter. 
In our Wireline segment, we continue to be aggressive and persistent in our cost restructuring to preserve margins. Force reductions of 5,000 last quarter, and 2,300 this quarter, resulted in cost savings of about $80 million in the first quarter. 
However, the continued economic pressures on the top line, incremental pension and retiree benefit costs, and higher costs related to the record-setting storms affecting much of our franchise territory, resulted in a lower margin. 
My goal continues to be to stabilize the Wireline margin this year, and we are on track with our plans to accomplish this goal. And I am confident that we can achieve this objective and expand margins in the future.  Lastly, on the strategic front, our pending transactions involving the sale of the Alltel divestiture markets and the spin-off of access lines are both moving forward. 
With this as an overview, lets turn to Slide 4 and start our detailed discussion of the quarter.  As Ron indicated earlier, our first quarter earnings results included the non-operational charges you see here, a majority being non-cash and related to deferred tax and pension expense recognition. Our cash summary presents a much different growth picture. 
Cash flow from operations in the quarter was strong, up 7.5% over last year. Our capital spending was down $251 million or 6.8%. Free cash flow at the end of the quarter was $3.7 billion, up almost $750 million or 25.6%. 
In Wireline, first quarter capital expenditures of $1.6 billion were down $437 million year-over-year. In Wireless, capital costs were higher by $219 million. 
Although we started the year conservatively, I'd reiterate that our 2010 guidance for capital spending is in the $16.8 billion to $17.2 billion range. As far as the balance sheet is concerned, we continue to reduce  leverage. In the first three months, we reduced net debt by $1.7 billion, and net debt is down from 10% a year ago. 
Let's now turn to revenue trends, which are on Slide 5.  Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $26.9 billion, up 1.2% from the first quarter a year ago, a better growth rate than each of the last two quarters. This reflects improvements in both Wireless and Wireline. 
Wireless revenues were up $661 million or 4.4%, driven primarily by data. Wireline revenues were down 2.9% this quarter due primarily to continued economic pressures in our business markets. 
But FiOS revenue growth continues to be strong, up 40% year-on-year. This is the third consecutive quarter of lower year-over-year revenue declines in Wireline.  
With that snapshot of revenues, let's move to the segments next starting with Wireless on Slide 6.
In the first quarter, total service revenues were up $770 million, or 5.9%, versus the year-ago quarter, and we saw strong sequential improvement of 2.2%, which is the highest sequential growth rate we've seen in the last six quarters. This revenue performance is, of course, driven by our strong focus on expanding the data market. 
Data revenues, which comprised 1/3 of total service revenues in the quarter, grew 26.4% year-over-year. Total data ARPU was 18% higher than a year ago. 
In terms of the components of data growth, quarterly revenues from Web and email services was $2.4 billion, up 43.5% from first quarter last year. Messaging revenues of $1.8 billion grew 16.2%. 
Our strategy continues to center on taking advantage of the expanding smartphone category. Our approach has been to feature a number of different operating systems and platforms which gives us the opportunity to not only attract new customers, but aggressively upgrade existing customers to high-end, data-capable devices. In addition to the obvious benefits to metrics like ARPU and churn, this will drive sustained data revenue growth, and we have plenty of upside in terms of data penetration.
At the end of the first quarter, more than 30% of our retail postpaid base had 3G multimedia devices or smartphones, up from 26% at the end of 2009. 17% had smartphones and 13% had 3G multimedia devices. We believe customer demand for data mobility will only increase as we further strengthen our device lineup and feature innovative applications and content. 
Let's take a look at customer growth on Slide 7. 
We've added a new chart this quarter to highlight a category of other connections not previously disclosed or counted in our subscriber metrics in the past. At the end of the first quarter, we had 92.8 million customers and more than 100 million total connections. Our high-quality customer base is heavily weighted towards retail postpaid customers, which comprise 89% of our subscriber base. This customer segment remains our key focus as we continue to drive revenue growth to increase data usage and penetration.
In the first quarter, we added more than 1.5 million net new customers with 423,000 retail postpaid net adds and 1.3 million reseller additions. With regard to the change in mix, we typically see seasonal effects in the first quarter. In any given year, the sequential decline in retail postpaid net adds between fourth and first quarter can be about 25% to 30%. This quarter, the decline was magnified, but we did not see any significant shift in market share, overall porting ratios or any increase in churn. 
In fact, our churn rates improved. Total churn showed declines both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially, and postpaid churn posted a 6% improvement compared to the first quarter last year. I would also add that these improvements are from already remarkably low industry-leading churn levels.
Although total Wireless market penetration is above 90%, we are still very bullish about our growth opportunities in the retail postpaid market. By continuing to strengthen our smartphone device lineup and offering differentiated services like NFL Mobile and Skype Mobile, we will stimulate upgrades within our existing base, as well as attract and retain high-value customers.
Net adds in our Reseller channel were very strong again this quarter, which is not surprising given typical prepaid seasonality. The Reseller market is a low-cost channel for us and an effective way for us to attract the incremental prepaid customer. I would also remind you that we do not have unlimited pricing arrangements with our Reseller partners. 
The new category, other connections, totaled 7.3 million at this time and will include all kinds of machine-to-machine devices like vehicle tracking, telematics, eReaders, consumer electronics, smart grid solutions, medical alert devices, essentially anything that has a wireless chip in it. Looking ahead, particularly when we commercialize LTE, the proliferation of these type of devices will be another source of incremental Wireless growth. And as we've mentioned in the past, we have a separate organization dedicated to open development, and Verizon Wireless is taking a leadership role in facilitating and stimulating innovation in this area. Examples include nPhase, which is our joint venture with QUALCOMM, to provide advanced end-to-end solutions, the establishment of the Verizon Technology Innovation Center in Waltham and the creation of the 4G venture forum. 
Let's take a closer look at our retail performance on Slide 8.  Our focus continues to be on the retail postpaid market. It is the largest and most important portion of our business. Retail service revenue, which accounts for about 85% of total Wireless revenues, grew 5% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. As I mentioned earlier, our retail postpaid ARPU this quarter grew 0.6% versus the year-ago quarter. This accretion is driven by our data growth strategy with an increasing percentage of our customers using smartphones and multimedia devices. 
Device upgrades were strong as 8.6% of our postpaid base upgraded in the first quarter, representing an increase of almost 15% from a year ago. This is extremely positive from a churn and ARPU accretion perspective. Customers are responding very well to our portfolio of smartphones and multimedia devices. 36% of device sales from our direct channels were smartphones with a $30 monthly data plan, and 24% were for multimedia devices which have minimum $10 monthly data plan attached.
The pricing simplification we implemented in January is helping to drive some of these excellent metrics, and the results were exactly what we anticipated. While we experienced the downward migration of customers from the $99 unlimited price point, we also saw a healthy migration of customers up to new $69 unlimited price point. 
Another positive development is an increasing percentage of gross adds for new customers opting for voice plans at 900 minutes per month or more, which obviously bodes well for revenue and ARPU. As Lowell described in the Investor Call in January, our goal is to drive further smartphone penetration and stimulate data growth, which will offset some of the voice declines. In addition, as we launch LTE later this year, having a large number of data customers provides us with a great opportunity to meet their increasing need for higher speeds and more sophisticated application-based devices. The first quarter results indicate that this is the right strategy: Revenue growth improved, our key customer retention metrics improved, and we saw a retail postpaid ARPU accretion.
In terms of profitability, we had another excellent quarter, generating $6.4 billion of EBITDA, up 5.7% from first quarter last year. Our first quarter margin performance of 46% is a strong result, reflecting both lower retail gross additions and stronger upgrades to higher-end devices. I think the Wireless team did a great job this quarter, driving this margin result given our aggressive upgrade strategy. 
Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue achieving both growth and profitability with a focus on gaining share in the retail postpaid market and increasing the penetration of smartphones and other data devices which will further expand the data market. 
Let's move now to our Wireline segment on Slide 10.
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see both cyclical and secular pressures in our Wireline consumer and business markets, with total Wireline revenues down 2.9% from a year ago. Our broadband and video products are driving a significant shift in our consumer revenue mix, and we continue to be very pleased with the success of FiOS. FiOS revenues are up 40% and ARPU increased 5% year-over-year. 
Minutes in IP services continue to transform the business revenue mix. In the first quarter, Strategic Services Revenue and Enterprise was up 4.2%. 
Let's take a closer look at both the consumer and business markets starting on Slide 11.  A year ago, FiOS made up about 30% of our consumer revenue. At the end of this quarter, FiOS represented more than 41%, a significant increase in just four quarters. The strength of our broadband and video products continues to drive consumer revenue and ARPU growth. 
Consumer revenue in the first quarter grew 0.9% on a year-over-year basis, and we continue to see strong growth in consumer ARPU, which increased to more than $78 this quarter, up 12.3% from a year ago. 
The entire FiOS initiative continues to be very successful, and we saw very positive levels of customer additions for both FiOS TV and Internet this quarter. We have surpassed the 3 million customer mark in FiOS TV with 168,000 net adds this quarter, and with 12 million homes open for sale, penetration of FiOS TV is 25%. 
In FiOS Internet, we added 185,000 customers this quarter, bringing our total to 3.6 million. With 12.6 million homes open for sale, internet penetration is 29%.
Let's move next to our business markets on Slide 12, which shows our Global Enterprise and Global Wholesale Revenue performance. As you can see, revenue in each of these categories has been relatively stable for the last five quarters. As a result, we are seeing improved comparisons on a year-over-year basis. 
Global Enterprise revenues was a down $57 million or 1.4% in the first quarter compared with a 4.8% year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter. The steady increase in the number of private IP site activations is an encouraging indicator as our CPE sales, which were higher than we typically see in the first quarter. Enterprise long-distance usage volumes, which have typically seasonal fluctuations, showed year-over-year growth for the first time in quite a while. All of these factors point to early signs of a recovery that should help our revenue performance in future quarters. 
Global Wholesale revenue in the first quarter declined $69 million, or 2.9% year-over-year, compared with a 4.9% decline in the fourth quarter. And while we continue to see growth in Ethernet services related to Wireless backlog, we are not seeing a pickup in wholesale long-distance usage volumes yet. Foreign currency effects this quarter were similar to what we have experienced in the fourth quarter. 
So the key point here is that revenue is stable and there is some optimism for improved performance and a recovery starting in the second half of the year. 
Let's cover Wireline profitability next.  From my perspective, we're competing well in the market, and we remain focused within the Wireline segment on four key strategies: Driving FiOS growth, improving Enterprise, driving cost out, and capital efficiency. 
In the first quarter, the fundamental trends underlying the overall Wireline results have not changed. The secular changes in the consumer market and the impact of the economic downturn in our business markets are still quite evident. And while Wireless revenues are still declining, it is at a lower rate, which is positive. The facts are that in the first quarter, the sequential decline in Wireline revenues was nearly a $0.25 billion. We did realize about $80 million of savings attributable to cost reductions. 
However, these savings were more than offset by a combination of cost pressures, including an unusually high amount of storm-related costs and incremental pension and retiree benefit expenses. I am confident that as we go through the year, we will be able to stabilize the Wireline margin with a combination of better revenue performance and our cost-restructuring efforts. 
Every line item of expense is being attacked within our Wireline business. Let's take a look at some of the key areas. 
First, headcount. In January, I indicated that our plans were to reduce the Wireline workforce by a similar level to what we achieved in 2009. A reduction of 10,000 people, for example, results in an annual run rate cost savings of about $600 million. 
In the first quarter, we reduced our workforce by 2,300. Keep in mind that our teams have executed well in this area with more than 28,000 reductions since the beginning of 2008.
Next, real estate. We have been doing an extensive amount of work rationalizing our real estate portfolio to reduce costs. This includes plans to close facilities and reducing square footage, reductions in energy usage, as well as facility maintenance savings.  Our plan identifies roughly $125 million in cost savings in 2010 alone. Over the course of the next 3 years, we plan to reduce our total square footage by about 10%. 
Other initiatives involve cost savings from network convergence, which includes center consolidations, operating and support system eliminations, and new technology efficiencies. We've identified $100 million in projected savings here by the end of 2010.
Other areas of projected savings include managing third-party interconnect and content clasp and a variety of reduction initiatives associated with supply chain, inventory management and energy. Over the course of the next two years, we have plans in place to resize our cost structure and capture run rate savings in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Once again, we have a well-organized and realistic plan, and I'm confident that we will capture these savings. 
To sum up, as we move into the second quarter, we remain focused on the key areas I mentioned earlier. First, continuing to generate solid cash flows and maintaining tight control over capital spending. Second, continuing to capitalize on our investments in Wireless, FiOS and Global IP networks to grow revenue and market share, drive deeper penetration and increase ARPU. And, third, remaining focused on our cost structure, achieving meaningful cost reductions and making sure the business is ready to quickly benefit from improvements in the employment rates and the overall economy.
Ron, I'll turn it back to you now for questions."

Typically, the first quarter is down seasonally somewhere in the range of 20% to 30%. Obviously, that was magnified in this quarter. We came off a very strong fourth quarter, as you know, where we have gained 1.1 million, really on the back of the strong introduction of the DROID and the Android-based operating devices. We had no really major new devices launched in Q1. The Android-itself-based operating system continues to do very well. In fact, when you look at actual gross numbers, we moved more of them in Q1 than we did in Q4. So we're very satisfied with what we would label as the DROID franchise. And you're going to here a lot more about that in the coming months, particularly with an important launch for us coming up shortly, which is the HTC Incredible, which the early reviews on is extremely positive. Now the other thing in the quarter, we put a lot of emphasis around upgrades, and we did see an uptick of about 15% in our upgrade level. Now that's great news for us. It's great news for our ARPU. It's great news for retention. And, by the way, we see a lot of ability with tailwinds there to continue to do well with that. As we go forward, just a couple of thoughts for you, we believe we can do better from a postpaid perspective than we did in Q1. That will be particularly on the backs of new product introductions. We are not ready to throw the towel and to say that postpaid growth is going to be substantially lower. Now, by the way, we recognize where penetration is, we don't think we are going to have $2 million quarters, but we did we could do better than we did in Q1. Now I would also underpin this by saying that we're going to be very responsible in terms of how we go after that. We are very focused on profitability, making sure we got the right mix. We do have a huge upgrade opportunity as I mentioned before. And the other thought I would give you here is that this is really a foundation, as we look at it, for our LTE launch later this year. We are more excited than ever about the prospects and the capability of LTE. So as we get more and more of our customers with smartphone-based devices, it's going to be a very nice transition into the LTE launch. Now a couple of thoughts for you here on margin. We had a very good quarter from a margin perspective, 46%. As you know, we don't have a particular point guidance out there. We have seen, particularly in these economic times, a bit of a mixed shift towards all-you-can-eat plans. That's really driven more on the lower end of the marketplace. We've seen some of our prepaid base move to the reseller plans. We've seen some of the lower end of the market. That will probably continue for a little while, but we still believe there will be a lot of strength on postpaid. Now just to refresh you on this, our reseller pricing is not unlimited. It's really a bucket of minutes. The reseller customers that we're attracting now carry much higher ARPUs than our additional ones and are very profitable and are not dilutive to our overall margin. We think we can continue to grow margin quite nicely in the Wireless business and be in a very good position."

One is we just passed the 10th Year Anniversary, hard to believe, of Verizon Wireless of being created. In partnership with Vodafone, I think our teams have done a great job. We've had a great working relationship with them over the last 10 years and the business is doing extremely well. Now let me hit the dividend issue first because I think it's important. I want to make sure from our perspective that our shareholders understand that we view the dividend as being very safe. We're a business that generates a lot of cash flow, over $30 billion of cash flow. We have a lot of different levers we can pull to make sure we have the ability to pay the dividend. I'm surprised that becomes as big of a question as it does become, given all of the levers and all of the cash flow that we have. We have numerous sources of cash that is being generated. And, by the way, paying the dividend to our shareholders, our shareholders are a priority for us. So the dividend and making sure we have stability and being in a position to recommend to the Board dividend increases is highly, highly important to us. Now on the strategic side of it, Tim, over the last 10 years, you and I both have watched there were kind of cycles where the whole ownership question gets more and more attention. We're in one of those times right now. From where I sit, the business is working extremely well. We've never made a secret of the fact that under the right conditions, right terms, of course, we would be interested in buying out the minority interest, the 45%. Why wouldn't we be in a business that's working as well as it is? Now from my perspective as the CFO, that's very much a financial transaction. We run the business today. We operate the business. We manage it. We control it. So I would look at what is the price tag that the other party would be -- if they were interested in selling, what's the price tag. What's the multiple. It doesn't make sense to us from a financial perspective. I don't know where that's going to go. But our view is pretty clear on that from that perspective. The discussions around merger that have been out there in the press, Ivan commented on that recently, and it does reflect the belief of the management team. We don't -- we're not convinced there's industrial logic behind putting the two organizations together. By the way, not that we're not open to listening, hearing new information on that, but we do not see a significant level of synergies. Cross-border mergers have not been historically highly successful. A lot of management complexity comes with that. So while we're always interested to hear about that, we don't really see the industrial logic. Now on the cash flow from Wireless, the great news is there's a lot of cash flow. It's growing. It's getting better. It's going to continue getting better. We've been clear what our view is of that in the short term, which is to use it to de-lever Verizon Wireless. That is still our view. We have an annual discussion with Vodafone in December of each year. We'll have another one next year. There is not religion though, I don't want you to think that we would never dividend cash out of Verizon Wireless. At some point, when we're in a position where leverage is much lower than it is today, and when it is appropriate, we will dividend cash out of Verizon Wireless. It's not just a 2010 event. We'll look at that again as we get into 2011. But it's an event off into the future."

We've had very good growth in FiOS RCM, more focused on the video side. We have had some price increases there, which are natural in terms of the video side. We've also seen improvements in some of our Video-on-Demand kind of services that are also contributing to that. So we're very pleased with FiOS. The profitability continues to improve. We've been operating income positive for the last couple of quarters. The cost metrics that we believe we would see ultimately with FiOS has positioned us very well. And we think we've got a great foundation here on the Wireline side for the future that we will have somewhere in the range of post-Frontier spin-out 70% to 80%, in that range, of footprint covered with Fiber. And that's going to position us very well for the future. We've also got to focus on making sure that we've got capital discipline within the Wireline business. We have, suffered a little bit from the economy in some of the cyclical change. So there is a focus on making sure we are investing at the right level in that business."

Not the question you think, but it's clearer now than it's been that there's probably an iPhone refresh coming around the middle of the year. Obviously, last year's game plan was to kind of wait. It came. You guys really got more aggressive on your smartphone portfolio than you had really ever been in the third quarter and that kind of led to a market share swing back in your favor. I guess looking at it this year, what would be the game plan this year that you would do differently, if anything, to kind of make sure that there isn't a market share swing in AT&T's favor the way we saw last year?"

I mean, it is a very competitive environment, as you know, and continues to be, but I don't see anything in the quarter or this year that has really shifted. When you look at our results, we did better in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter. Our total broadband was 89,000, just short of 100,000. That was up on third and fourth quarter a year ago. We continue to do reasonably well here. We would like to drive to a little bit higher numbers as we go through the next several quarters. We think with the economy starting to come back a little bit, we're positioned for that. Our Wireline team is very focused on it. We don't see -- and, Dave, customer satisfaction and independent reports continue to put FiOS at the top of the list in all areas. We think we've got a great product here. You're incenting people to change. They've already got service typically. So that's the trick for us. On the second question, Dave, it's really more of what we're doing now. We think we have found a very strong lineup. And, again, not just based on one operating system but the Android-based system, the RIM systems. We had some Microsoft launches recently. But you will see a lot of emphasis around the DROID as we go through the year. We think we have a very competitive lineup. There's no question Apple's done a great job with the iPhone. But look at our results. I mean, we've performed very well both from a growth -- revenue growth this quarter on the Wireless side is better than it was last quarter. Our service revenue is upticking. We have several different new devices coming as the year goes on, most notably, the one I just mentioned, which is the HTC Incredible. So I think we'll be earlier in the process this year of having very strong devices to be very competitive. But, again, based on multiple systems and we think we'll be in a very good position."

You know we don't put out guidance numbers on that in point estimates. But let me just give you a little color on what we think happened in the quarter, where we're focused on and where we think we're going. So if you look at the margin in the quarter of 21.7%, we had to eat through a sequential revenue decline of about $225 million. By the way, we see good news there because rate-of-revenue decline in the quarter was only 2.9%. It was 3.9% in the fourth quarter. So we see improvement there. We had a couple of unique issues in the quarter that hurt us a little bit. We had mentioned that this year, we do have some incremental pension and OPEB costs. That was about $40 million in the quarter.  And this is one we don't usually like to point to and talk to, but it was such a factor in this quarter I'm going to mention it. We did have extraordinary weather conditions on the East Coast. That minimally cost us $50 million in the quarter. That was related to a lot of overtime because of the flooding conditions, record snow flow in the mid-Atlantic states, which you usually don't have that caused complications. So there were a lot of issues that contributed to the first quarter. Now when you look at our focus going forward, it's really focused around four items. We continue to focus on FiOS. We're very pleased with the profitability where FiOS is, but we think it can get a lot better as we continue to get more and more scale. So that's going to continue to ramp up and help us. We think our Enterprise and Businesses Services as the economy gets better as we go through '10, probably saw a little sign of that in the first quarter. I don't think there was much of it in our numbers. But we think we'll see more of that, particularly in the second half of the year. That will be very helpful to us. Now on the cost side, I hope you get the feel here that we are very focused on improving and continuing to improve the cost structure. I mentioned on previous calls the last couple of years, we've reduced our Wireline workforce by about 13,000 per year, and I said we would do the same this year. I actually think we have now the ability to do more than that this year. You'll probably read in the press later today that we did reach agreement with our unions, and our East Coast unions, the CWA and the IBEW, on an enhanced incentive offer last night. And that is going to allow  us to take out a significant number of associates. And one of our limitations on our ability to downsize the workforce was we were limited in our ability to lay off in our East Coast contracts. We could lay off post-2003 hired employees, and we did some of that last year, but beyond that, it was voluntary incentives that drove it. We reached agreement on an enhancement.  I think this year we should be able to beat the 13,000 number. I'm not going to put an exact number on that yet because we're still factoring through that based on the agreement.  But I think we'll be very focused on additional force reductions this year. In addition to that, Mike, we're also very focused around cash flow in the Wireline business. That ties back to some of the other questions and capital efficiency will improve. So I'm not going to put a number or a date on when this is going to turn, but I think I am convinced we have all of the rights initiatives in place. We have the conviction to get it done and that we should see the ability to stabilize and then improve our Wireline margins over time."

Obviously, we look at our churn numbers, which are terrific. The postpaid churn at 1.07. We look at our porting ratios. From our view, we are hanging in there very nicely. That's at a time where there is a little slow down, as you've mentioned, on the postpaid side. We feel good about where we are on Wireless market share. And we think we'll continue to do well as we go through the year. From an Enterprise perspective, a couple of thoughts here for you. Our number in the quarter is only down 1.4%.  It had been down 4.8%  in the fourth quarter, 6.2% in the third quarter. Even when you adjust for FX, we were down 2.3% in the quarter versus 5.6% in the fourth and 5.3%.  So we're definitely seeing improvement here in Enterprise perspective. We repeatedly said we've been very successful in winning new opportunities in the marketplace. We continue to do that. A number of those are incremental. We're still seeing moves on both a private IP perspective, as well as security services. We did see some benefits in the quarter, also from CPE. Now that's a good indicator, I think, of the economy. So that all puts us in a good position. Now on how important is it? It's important. But there are four or five different major contributors that we need to get them all clicking. Cost is probably number one right now in terms of biggest contribution, but continuing the progress on FiOS, continuing the progress on Enterprise are all very important. So I know you've got another call at 9:30. So I think we're going to call this a wrap. 
I want to leave you with a couple of closing comments you. First of all, let me thank you for joining us today. If you look at our Wireless business, we continue to see great opportunities to grow the business and to make the business more efficient. Our strategy around aggressive 4G deployment and increased smartphone penetration through multiple operating platforms will drive data growth and continue to differentiate us from our competitors. 
We remain committed to maintaining reasonable growth and strong profitability on our Wireless segment. On the Wireline side, we believe that the strategy we put in place a few years ago, that is having a smaller footprint with the majority covered by FiOS, coupled with a more Global Enterprise Business focused on multinationals, is the right strategy that also differentiates us from our peers and will help drive growth for the long-term. I also recognize that the issue in the Wireline segment is stabilizing and improving profitability. I do not want to overstate what we can do here on the short-term, but I believe our cost reduction initiatives will gain traction. And with an improving economy, we will see better Wireline margins. 
Finally, we continue to deliver strong cash flow metrics. Our dividend is strong and safe. We're maintaining good discipline on our capital spending and our balance sheet is solid. 
Thanks again for joining us today on the call."

Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm Ron Lataille. With me this morning is John Killian, our Chief Financial Officer.
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non- GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.
On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss for the second quarter of $0.07 per share. These quarterly results include a total of $0.65 of non-operational or one-time charges which are listed on slide four. The largest items relates to the recognition of costs in connection with our wireline force reduction initiative primarily for severance, special termination benefits and pension charges.
These costs totaled $2.3 billion pre-tax and resulted in a charge to earnings of $0.52 per share. Roughly $1 billion of the pre-tax amount is for additional severance liabilities as a result of the enhanced incentive offer. The remaining $1.3 billion of pre-tax costs are non-cash and relate to the recognition on special termination benefits and pension plan liabilities for the effective employees.
We also incurred non-operational costs in connection with the spin-off of our access line properties to Frontier. As we previously discussed, these costs are related to network, software and other activities required for these facilities to function as a separate company. In the second quarter, these get-ready costs amounted to $195 million pre-tax or a charge of $0.04 per share.
Another item we've been pointing out for you is our merger integration cost related to Alltel. During the second quarter, charges related these activities amounted to $0.02 per share. In addition, the sale of the Alltel divestiture properties resulted in a one-time tax expense worth about $0.04 per share.
The last item that I would like to highlight is a one-time non-cash adjustment of $268 million primarily related to wireless data revenues. This adjustment was recorded to properly defer previously recognized wireless data revenues that will be earned and recognized in the following period. As the amounts involved were not material to our consolidated financial statements in any current or previous reporting period, the $268 million adjustment was reported entirely in the second quarter with an unfavorable impact on consolidated revenues, which equates to $0.03 per share of earnings.
Consistent with our reporting methodology, the items I just described are not included at the segment level primarily due to their non-operational or non-recurring nature. However, they are included in our reported consolidated results.
With that, I will now turn the call over to John Killian.

Before we get into the details, let me start with some brief comments on the business overall and add some of my perspective to our second quarter results.
Our results show that we continue to do a good job executing in our key focus areas. In terms of cash generation, we had an exceptionally strong quarter of cash flow growth with continued tight controls on capital spending. We saw a good customer growth in wireless where data revenue growth continues to be driven by smartphone sales to both new and existing customers. As a result, we saw increasing year-over-year growth in postpaid ARPU and improvements to our industry-leading customer retention metrics in this quarter.
In wireline, our EBITDA margin improvement was driven by cost reductions. During the quarter, we had approximately 11,000 volunteers for our enhanced separation offer in the East and Mid-Atlantic regions. So this will go a long way toward helping us achieve our wireline force reduction objectives for the year.
Broadband and video continue to drive revenue results within the mass markets. Revenue trends in global enterprise improved again this quarter and showed positive year-over-year growth. And while we are seeing stability in underlying trends in the enterprise space, we are still seeing cyclical effects and remain cautiously optimistic with regard to a more meaningful economic recovery.
Lastly, we completed the pending transactions that were part of our overall strategic transformation. During the second quarter, we closed the sale of the 105 markets we were required to divest as part of the Alltel acquisition in 2009. And on July 1, we completed the access line spin-off in merger transaction with Frontier. Through the spin-off, Verizon shareholders received $1.85 per share in value in the form of Frontier shares and cash in what was effectively a stock dividend. So it was an active quarter for sure, with solid overall performance.
Let's now move to a detailed review of the quarter, starting on slide 4. As Ron indicated earlier, our second quarter earnings results included $0.65 of non-operational or one-time charges. With a reported loss of $0.07, you can see that the math gets us to a $0.58 quarterly result.
For the first half of the year, we produced $1.13 in EPS before the effect of non-operational or one-time items. I'd like to add a little more detail on the wireless deferred revenue adjustment. Over the last several years, we have moved away from billing customers on a per use basis for data to billing on a pre-determined price for either a bundle of text messages, a certain amount of data usage or unlimited usage of data on smartphones.
As such, certain data services are billed in advance for services to be provided in the next monthly cycle. Essentially, we are recording an adjustment related to prior periods in which we did not properly defer a portion of monthly billed revenues primarily for certain wireless data services that are billed in advance.
The impact to the deferred revenue adjustment in any given quarter a year was not material. So reported revenue and growth trends were not materially overstated. In fact, had we done this appropriately, the largest single year impact would have been under $80 million. However, since the amount of deferred revenue related to these types of data services had grown progressively over time, the $268 million adjustment does negatively impact consolidated revenues and our growth rates in the second quarter.
This is a one-time adjustment to reconcile our wireless deferred data revenue balance. Given the nature of this adjustment, it is not included in our wireless segment results and does not affect prior period comparisons at the segment level.
Let me now spend a minute on the divested properties, which will no longer be part of our results in the second half of the year. First, on the Alltel divestiture markets or trust properties, as we refer to them, these markets were sold to two different buyers, and closed on two different dates during the quarter. The first sale closed in late April and the second one in late June.
As such, our subscriber numbers at the end of the second quarter exclude the more than 2 million subscribers that we divested in these markets. Our quarterly financial results include these properties up until the date of each sale. But since both transactions closed during the quarter, our results do not reflect a full quarter of activity for the trust properties.
The revenue impact of not having these wireless properties for the entire second quarter is about $100 million. We divested the Frontier properties on July 1, so those results are fully included in our second quarter.
We will be providing pro forma historical information for our wireline and wireless segments to reclassify the impact of these dispositions in late August or early September. And I'll talk more about the impacts of these divested properties on our 2010 earnings outlook at the end of my remarks.
Since a great deal of our earnings performance involves non-cash effects, let's turn our attention now to cash flow, which presents a much different growth picture. As I said earlier, our cash flow performance was quite strong. Cash flow from operations in the quarter totaled $9.8 billion.
Year-to-date cash flow from operations of $16.9 billion, is up 19.4%. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $5.5 billion, up more than 75%. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow of $.2 billion is up $3.1 billion or 52%. Our operational cash flow results continue to be very strong, and we have benefited from lower net tax payments.
Looking at capital spending in total, we were down 3.6% in the quarter, and we are running 5% below 2009 on a year-to-date basis. So at this point in time, we iterate our previously stated full year 2010 guidance of capital expenditures between $16.8 and $17.2 billion.
And as I previously said, we are reallocating capital between our segments, reflecting growth opportunities. This shift will continue as we move through the year.
In wireline, CapEx in the second quarter was $1.8 billion, down almost 24%. Year-to-date, wireline CapEx of $3.3 billion is down nearly $1 billion, reflecting lower FiOS deployment capital as planned, and our tight focus on spending to increase free cash flow. In wireless, capital spending is higher than last year, driven by 4G LTE network deployment and data capacity requirements.
In the second quarter, wireless CapEx was $2.3 billion. Year-to-date we spent $4 billion, which is up $698 million or about 21%.
Turning to the balance sheet, a top priority for us is to continue to reduce leverage. And we're doing well here with net debt of just under $53 billion at the end of the quarter, down $7.5 billion or 125% since the beginning of the year.
Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is about 1.5 times, and we're expecting it to be even lower by the end of the year. On July 1, we transferred $250 million of debt to Frontier and shortly thereafter used the $3.1 billion of cash from the spin-off to further reduce debt.
Let's turn now to revenue trends, which are on slide six. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $26.8 billion, an $88 million or 0.3% decline versus last year. The deferred revenue adjustment that I covered earlier had a negative impact on growth of about 100 basis points. And the timing of the Alltel trust properties sales during the quarter had an unfavorable revenue impact of about $100 million.
During the quarter, we saw revenue growth in our key areas, including wireless data, FiOS, strategic services within the global enterprise market.
With that high-level snapshot of revenues, let's move to the segments next, starting with wireless on slide seven. In wireless, we had another strong quarter, with sequential improvement in revenue, ARPU, churn and profitability. Our revenue growth performance was strong with total service revenues up $697 million or 5.2% year-over-year. And when we look at our results without the Alltel trust properties, in other words on a pro forma basis, total service revenue growth was 6.2%.
Our focus on expanding the data market drove data revenue growth of 23.8% compared with last year. Total data revenues grew to $4.8 billion this quarter and comprised 34.5% of total service revenues. And total data ARPU grew 16.1% year-over-year.
Our strategy is focused on continuing to take advantage of the rapidly growing smartphone device category. Our approach is to support a number of different operating systems and platforms and to offer a robust line-up of devices, which gives us the opportunity to not only attract new customers, but upgrade our existing customers.
In addition to improving ARPU and customer retention, we believe this approach will drive sustained data revenue growth. And we continue to be very bullish about this opportunity. For starters, we see a plenty of upside in terms of data penetration.
At the end of the second quarter, 35% of our retail postpaid base had smartphones or multimedia devices, up from just under 31% at the end of the first quarter and 26% at yearend. 20% of our postpaid customers have smartphones and 15% have multimedia devices.
The DROID franchise has been a great success. We have a steady stream of devices featuring the Android operating system since the first DROID was introduced last fall. To date, we have six devices with multiple manufacturers in our current device line-up with more to come.
The Incredible was introduced late in the second quarter, and we began selling the new DROID X on July 15. Both devices have sold very well and customer feedback has been terrific. We have had some backorder issues, but this is more timing than anything else.
Customer demand and interest in the smartphone category has never been greater. Demand is being driven by the proliferation of new devices with greater capabilities in innovative applications and content. We feel really good about our device portfolio with great momentum going forward.
Looking ahead, particularly with the commercial launch of LTE later this year, we believe that our network advantage will become even more evident and differentiate us more than ever before.
Let's now talk about our customer growth results. We displayed our customer activity on slide eight. So you can clearly differentiate the second quarter net add growth from the effectively Alltel trust properties subscriber adjustments.
We had a good quarter in terms of growth, adding 1.4 million net new customers with 665,000 retail postpaid net adds and 896,000 reseller additions. In the postpaid market, we competed very well this quarter with a strong device line-up. Our increased focus on customer retention drove an excellent sequential improvement in postpaid churn of 13 basis points.
Our net add performance in the reseller channel was also very good, especially since the second quarter is typically seasonally lower in this customer category. As we've said, the reseller market is a low-cost channel for us and an effective way for us to attract incremental prepaid customers. We ended this quarter with 92.1 million customers, which as you know is substantially retail postpaid, representing 89% of total customers.
And as we identified beginning last quarter, the other connections category is where we will be including all kinds of machine-to-machine devices such as vehicle tracking, telematics, e-readers, consumer electronics, smart grid solutions and medical alert devices.
Let's take a closer look at our retail performance on slide nine. Our key focus continues to be on the retail postpaid market where we continue to drive revenue growth through increased data usage and penetration. Retail service revenues grew 4.2% in the quarter. Retail post paid ARPU increased 1.2% compared with the year ago, effectively doubling the year-over-year accretion we saw in the first quarter. This accretion is driven by data plans and the increasing percentage of customers using smartphones and multimedia devices.
Device upgrades were strong once again, with about 9% of our post paid customers upgrading in the second quarter. Customers continue to respond very well to our portfolio of smartphones and multimedia devices. About 40% of device sales from our direct channels were smartphones with a $30 monthly data plan and 17% were from multimedia devices, which have a minimum $10 monthly data plan attached.
Our strategy of stimulating data revenue growth is also improving customers retention. Our churn metrics this quarter were excellent. The improvements were most notable in retail post paid with churn under 1% and improving seven basis points year-over-year.
In terms of profitability, we had another excellent quarter generating $6.7 billion of EBITDA up 7.8% from a year ago. Our second quarter service EBITDA margins expanded to 47.5% driven by strong data revenues, churn improvements and the continued benefit of Alltel synergy savings.
Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue achieving both growth and profitability with a focus on gaining share in the retail post paid market and increasing the penetration of smartphones and other data devices which will further expand the data market.
Let's move to our wireline segment on slide eleven. On the consumer side, broadband and video products continued to drive a significant shift in our revenue mix. FiOS revenue in the quarter grew more than 33% year-over-year and FiOS ARPU, which now exceeds $145 is up 7% over second quarter last year.
On the enterprise side, growth in strategic services, which includes security IP and other managed solutions continue to transform the revenue mix. In wholesale, revenues were impacted by secular pressures and the effect of international pricing changes. Let's take a closer look at both the consumer and business markets starting on slide twelve.
This time last year, FiOS made up about one-third of consumer revenue. FiOS revenues now represent more than 43%. Within consumer, the strength of our broadband and video products together with our increasing sale should continue to drive positive revenue and ARPU growth and offset the secular and competitive pressures in this part of the business.
Consumer revenue in the quarter grew 0.3% versus last year, and we continue to see strong growth in consumer ARPU, which increased to more than $80 this quarter up 11.4% from a year ago. In terms of customer growth we saw a sequential improvement in net additions in both FiOS TV and internet. At the end of the quarter, we had a total of 3.2 million FiOS TV customers adding 174,000 this quarter compared with 168,000 in the first quarter. Our FiOS TV penetration is 26% based on about 12.4 million homes open for sale.
On the broadband side, we added 196,000 new FiOS internet customers this quarter compared to 185,000 in the first quarter, bringing our total to 3.8 million. And with about 12.9 million homes open for sale, FiOS internet penetration is 30%. Adding a high speed internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with 9.3 million broadband connections.
Let's move next to our business markets on slide thirteen, which shows our global enterprise and global wholesale revenue performance. While revenues in the business market continue to be affected by macro economic pressures, we are seeing some signs of stability. Global enterprise revenue showed positive sequential in year-over-year growth up 1.1% versus first quarter and 0.6% versus second quarter last year.
Our revenue performance was helped by strong CPE sales in network and solutions based services. Strategic services, which represent about 40% of global enterprise revenue grew 6.2% year-over-year and 3.5% sequentially. I'd say we are seeing some signs of stabilization, we're still cautious in our optimism as usage volumes and unemployment figures have not shown any meaningful change.
In global wholesale revenue declines were worst than trend, down 8.3% year-over-year and just under 5% sequentially. Domestically, revenues continued to be impacted by secular pressures. Internationally we made a decision to increase voice pricing in certain routes, which resulted in some loss of business in this highly competitive market.
Let's cover wireline profitability next.
In the second quarter, we were able to improve the EBITDA margins by about 100 basis points sequentially to 22.7%. The improvement was primarily driven by wage related savings and third party interconnection costs in the quarter. We're making good progress in our workforce reduction initiative. Wireline headcount was down 3,800 in the second quarter and 6,100 year-to-date.
As I mentioned earlier, we had approximately 11,000 acceptances our enhanced incentive offer in the East and Mid-Atlantic regions. About two-thirds of these employees went off-payroll in late June or early July, with the remainder leaving the business later in the third and fourth quarter, as we carefully manage the transition with a focus on customer service. The benefits of these actions should help our margins in the third and fourth quarters.
We are also considering additional force reductions in other locations within the telecom business. We should know more about this by the end of the third quarter.
As far as our other cost reduction initiatives, we're also making progress in real estate, network convergence, supply chain, inventory management and energy. We have a well organized and realistic plan, and I'm confident that we will capture these savings. We'll also continue to be very disciplined in terms of our capital spending.
To sum up, we had a solid quarter with exceptionally strong cash flow. We will continue to focus on maximizing free cash flow, maintaining a strong balance sheet and reducing debt. Our wireless results were solid. And in wireline, our cost reduction initiatives resulted in margin improvement. And we successfully completed our pending transactions by closing the sale of the Alltel trust markets during the quarter and divesting the access line properties to Frontier on July 1.
The Frontier transaction culminates a strategic transformation that we've undergone since the inception of Verizon 10 years ago. During this process, we have aligned our company with the major growth trends driving our industry. We have simplified the business by divesting our directories business, monetizing our international equity investments and spinning off certain access line properties. We have restructured through strategic acquisitions and investments, significantly increased our exposure to the growth areas of the future, wireless, broadband and global connectivity.
In wireless, we've increased our scale through acquisitions, purchased the valuable spectrum and invested in new technologies that will position us to capture growth in the rapidly evolving mobile broadband space.
We've changed our revenue mix in wireline, reinventing our technology base with fiber and expanding our global presence through acquisition to meet the growing demand of enterprise customers for the global connectivity.
In short, we've positioned ourselves to be a stronger competitor in areas of higher growth and minimized our exposure to areas of the business that are more challenged by secular change.
The revenue pie on slide 16 highlights our current revenue mix. The first observation is that 83% of our consolidated revenues come from wireless and global business customers. Secondly, the wireline mass market business comprises only about 16% of our current revenues, with the majority of our households covered by FiOS.
So the net result of the strategic investments and divestitures that we've made is an outstanding set of high-value assets with greater potential for revenue growth.
We are also confident that over the long term, we can grow profit and shareholder returns. In the short term, I realize that the impact in timing of these divestitures make estimating 2010 earnings more difficult. So in addition to providing pro form historical information soon, I would like to offer investors some thoughts about the impacts of these divestitures in my outlook for the second half of the year.
Before non-operational and one-time items, we had $1.13 of earnings per share in the first half of the year. The assets we spun off to Frontier and the Alltel trust properties accounted for approximately $0.12 of first half earnings. So excluding these properties, we had $1.01 of earnings per share. Our goal is to grow earnings in the second half of this year by 5% to 10% from this first half adjusted base of $1.01.
In the second half of this year, we expect a continuation of the trends we're experiencing in our wireless business. We believe we can continue to grow the business in terms of net adds and drive higher smartphone adoption, leading to accelerating ARPU accretion and revenue growth.
In addition, we will continue to make great progress managing costs. You saw the strong service EBITDA margin that we delivered in the first half, and we expect to continue this performance.
In our wireline business, although we don't expect any significant economic driven improvements in the second half, we will continue to accelerate the success in the cost reduction programs you saw in the first half. Virtually all of the benefit associated with our incentive offer to associates will be reflected in our second half results. In addition, we continue to make great progress in other areas such as reducing our overall access costs and delivering on all of our other cost reduction initiatives.
So again, a good quarter. We are optimistic about the outlook for the second half of the year and we are confident in the long-term potential of the business.
With that, I'll turn it back to Ron so we can get to your questions.

The initial impact as you strip out Frontier is around a couple of hundred basis points. Now, as we've said on the call and we've said on past calls, within the wireline business, we are extremely focused on driving costs out of that business. We had very strong performance in the second quarter.
I had indicated on the first quarter call that we thought that was the case. Force benefits, sequentially we had some wage-related savings principally on the over-time side. We did not see any of the benefit really in the quarter from the 11,000 force reduction that we've got with the associate offer.
So most of the individuals who went off in the second quarter were late in the quarter. We had some more in early July. That was a little over 7,000 of the 11,000 went off there. We should see those benefits in the second half of the year.
So we believe we can improve wireline margin in the second half of the year off of the pro forma wireline margin that we'll be putting out, and we feel good about those initiatives. Every cost line is being attacked in the wireline business; our third-party access cost, our telco cost, our big area of focus, obviously all the headcount items are a strong area of focus.
We are seeing improvements in real estate expense. We have vacated some buildings. Most recently, we terminated the lease in Philadelphia on 1717, Arch Street which was a fairly sizeable commitment for us.
So we think we have a lot of opportunity to drive cost reduction on the wireline side.

And then secondly, with the Vodafone issue looming at some point maybe next year or 2012, wireline CapEx, looks like it's down year-to-date about $1 billion year-over-year.

And we think there is substantial opportunity ahead of us to continue that performance. We are in the early innings of wireless data with only 20% of our base having a smartphone, and then with LTE a whole set of opportunities around video.
So we think there's a lot of opportunity to accelerate top-line performance as we go through the second half of the year and into 2011.
Now, couple of thoughts for you. The wireless team is extremely focused on all areas of cost. If you look actually at the headcount, they are down year-on-year about 8,000 people. Now a couple of thousand of those are related to the trust properties. There's a little bit of other ones in terms of leave of absence, those kinds of things. But net-net, we're down 4,000 to 5,000 people.
They have a series of initiatives within the wireless business that's focused on their distribution side of the business. That's driving more efficiency, more online transactions. Again, an area where we think we are very early in the process of driving that out.
Another area that they have a lot of attention is all of the cost and expenses around managing supply chain inventory levels and just the whole process there. So, you know, just about every area of the wireless side. Again, like wireline, they are attacking the underlying cost structure.
We are very pleased with the margin performance in the second quarter, and think we are in a good position to continue to drive both growth and profitability in that business.

And I think we're performing extremely well here.
So on the dividend side, as you know, that's a Board decision. The Board will consider that in September. I think we put them in a position where they have some pretty good alternatives there from the dividend perspective given the cash flow performance. But at the end of the day, that will be their decision.
On pricing, we're performing extremely well right now. If you look at our data revenues this quarter, they're up about 24% year-on-year. If you look at data ARPU for our postpaid base, they're up over 19%. Again, as I said to you earlier, a lot of upside potential there given where we are on smartphones and multimedia devices in the future.
We have indicated in the past, as we move to an LTE world and LTE pricing, we will probably look very hard at tiered pricing, and that continues to be our thinking right now. So more to come on that.
By the way, I should say that all of our assets, all of our plans on getting LTE launched in the fourth quarter are on schedule. We feel very good about that. We think that's going to open up the whole new set of opportunities to continue to grow this wireless business that is again performing very well.

That relationship has been on for a year now.
I was wondering if you could kind of talk to us about your takeaways and some of the experiments you're doing with the $50 unlimited plan in the Southeast.

On the last quarter call, a lot of people were suggesting that the postpaid market was coming to its end. And we thought there was still a lot of life there for Verizon and we did a lot better in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter. So we feel very good about our position in the postpaid marketplace. That is our prime strategy.
The device lineup [roll] and his team have done a tremendous job with the device lineup. The whole DROID franchise is performing extremely well. We introduced the Incredible, as you know, in the second quarter. We just launched the DROID X. There's more devices to come. So we think our handset lineup is very well positioned.
Now we've also suggested that we decided to play more of the prepaid marketplace, not exclusively. We have our own prepaid offerings that have benefits in terms of handsets and customer service, but that we were playing more of that end of the market through the reseller opportunity. By the way, not just the Straight Talk offering. There is several different resellers, and we've been very satisfied with that.
I mean it's fueled some nice growth for us as we've gone through the past year. The ARPU levels run significantly higher than the traditional reseller offerings we have had. The profitability from the tiered margin percentage basis is pretty good, because you don't have the marketing cost and a lot of the SG&A. So we think that strategy has worked well for us, and we're continuing to do that. There's always some seasonal fluctuation there from a reseller model.
Now, on the prepaid offering that you said, it's just a trial in the South. It's targeted to a specific geographic area. There's not a plan at the moment to bring that nationally. From time-to-time, our e-readers do different things to see what kind of reactions, kind of experiments, and that's what that is all about, nothing more than that.

So our business is continuing to perform extremely well, you haven't seen us rush out to make any kind of a change. We'll continue to monitor the situation of course and look at opportunities that will say what's the best equation for us to drive long term shareholder value and we'll be very focused on that.
I can't say enough though about the opportunity we see ahead given where we are today with smartphone penetration. I mean I think 20% of our base today, where's that number going, ultimately is it 80%.
Some people could argue everyone is going to have a smartphone ultimately, because that's the kind of device that's going to be. So I think there is tremendous opportunity to continue to drive and create value through Verizon wireless.

Enterprise we had better performance this quarter on a reported basis we were up which was very good. Now we had a couple of things that helped us there, we had a very strong CPE quarter. A lot of demand for equipment out there, which is good, I mean it drives some margin. We are doing some pricing change on the CPE lineup.
We did a late second quarter early third quarter to drive a little bit of margin that might temper down the volume just a little bit as we go through the third quarter.
When you underlie and strip out CPE and some of the other things, we did see improved performance in enterprise although it was still a little bit negative year-over-year. I wouldn't say we're seeing any big change from and economic standpoint at this point. I think you're hearing that from every call that's out there right now as maybe in the first quarter there was a little bit of an uptick with everything going on in Europe and other issues that's probably been a little bit of a pause in terms of purchase decisions.
Right now we're hoping that will pick back up in the second half of the year, but from up here enterprise perspective, we were pleased with our performance in the quarter, but we have a little bit of caution as we go through the rest of the year in, again why it's so important to drive more and more cost out of the business, but at the same time very focused on driving more profitability in enterprise.
In fact, as I look at our deals we signed in the second quarter versus the first quarter, margin was up about 250 basis point on those deals quarter-to-quarter. So I think that was a very good sign.
From a wireless post paid ARPU, we think there is upside as we go through the next couple of years. our smartphone line up if you think about it over the last year we solved the problem with the DROID franchise where we were a little bit behind in terms of the smartphone lineup that is paying dividends for us right now.
We expect those dividends to accelerate, that our lineup is going to do extremely well. I would love to see 3% to 4%, I think we will get better. I think the other company that you indicated, they do have a higher concentration of smartphones in their customer base than we do today. But that gap is going to close, because we've got great devices, great lineup and of course our distribution is a machine quarter-after-quarter.
So I think you're going to see improving performance there. And it just comes back to the issue I said earlier is we believe there is tremendous opportunity to continue drive shareholder value in this business field principally on the wireless side.

We are taking costs out of our supply chain process and we will continue to do that. We're managing inventory levels extremely tightly, which is appropriate.
From a supply chain perspective on supply of smartphones, we need to manage through it, which we are. These are kind of global issues with certain devices, but we're in a good position here.

We'll continue to watch this, and we're optimistic that this will come out in the right place for us and for the industry. But time will tell on that. So not a lot more that I could comment on there right now.
We did complete the Frontier transaction. I know you're all anxious for pro forma. We'll get that out to you. But as we look back on that, that was a very, very good transaction for us and for Verizon.
When we first announced the deal, there were about 4.8 million lines in those territories. As you know, we had a fixed value effectively. The value per line was about $1,791. By the time we completed the transaction, it was about $22,140 per line.
So we're very satisfied with what we've done with the Frontier transaction. We think we've gotten very good value here for the Verizon shareholder, both in terms of the value they get in Frontier and the debt relief. So it's a transaction we're very pleased with. And our team I think did an outstanding job working with Frontier on all of the transition.
I would also like to just publicly acknowledge Ron on this call. Many of you did that. He's done a terrific job for us over the last several years. We will be announcing his replacement shortly in August, and I think it will be a top-notch individual. And of course, that individual will have the guidance of Ron on what needs to be done here.

With me this morning is John Killian, our Chief Financial Officer. 
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. 
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future result is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.
On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss for the second quarter of $0.07 per share. These quarterly results include a total of $0.65 of nonoperational or one-time charges, which are listed on Slide 4. The largest item relates to the recognition of costs in connection of our Wireline cost reduction initiative, primarily for severance, special termination benefits and pension charges. These costs totaled $2.3 billion pretax and resulted in a charge to earnings of $0.52 per share. Roughly $1 billion of the pretax amount is for additional severance liabilities as a result of the enhanced incentive offer. The remaining $1.3 billion of pretax costs are non-cash and relate to the recognition of special termination benefits and pension plan liabilities for the affected employees. 
We also incurred nonoperational costs in connection with the spin-off of our Access Line properties to Frontier. As we previously discussed, these costs are related to networks, software and other activities required for these facilities to function as a separate company. In the second quarter, these get-ready costs amounted to $195 million pretax or a charge of $0.04 per share. 
Another item we've been pointing out for you are merger integration costs related to Alltel. During the second quarter, charges related to these activities amounted to $0.02 per share. In addition, the sale of the Alltel divestiture properties resulted in a one-time tax expense worth about $0.04 per share.
The last item that I would like to highlight is a one-time non-cash adjustment of $268 million, primarily related to Wireless data revenues. This adjustment was recorded to properly defer previously recognized Wireless data revenues that will be earned and recognized in the following period. As the amounts involved were not material to our consolidated financial statements in any current or previous reporting period, the $268 million adjustment was recorded entirely in the second quarter, with an unfavorable impact on consolidated revenues, which equates to $0.03 per share of earnings. Consistent with our reporting methodology, the items I just described are not included at the segment level, primarily due to their nonoperational or nonrecurring nature. However, they are included in our reported consolidated results. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to John Killian."

Before we get into the details, let me start with some brief comments on the business overall and add some of my perspective to our second quarter results. Our results show that we continue to do a good job execu",3536,"Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into the details, let me start with some brief comments on the business overall and add some of my perspective to our second quarter results. 
Our results show that we continue to do a good job executing in our key focus areas. In terms of cash generation, we had an exceptionally strong quarter of cash flow growth with continued tight controls on capital spending. We saw a good customer growth in Wireless, where data revenue growth continues to be driven by smartphone sales to both new and existing customers. As a result, we saw increasing year-over-year growth in post-date ARPU and improvements to our industry-leading customer retention metrics this quarter. 
In Wireline, our EBITDA margin improvement was driven by cost reductions. During the quarter, we had approximately 11,000 volunteers for our enhanced separation offer in the East and mid-Atlantic regions. So this will go a long way toward helping us achieve our Wireline cost reduction objectives for the year. 
Broadband and video continue to drive revenue results within the mass markets. Revenue trends in global enterprise improved again this quarter and showed positive year-over-year growth. And while we are seeing stability in underlying trends in the enterprise space, we are still seeing cyclical effects and remain cautiously optimistic with regard to a more meaningful economic recovery.
Lastly, we completed the pending transactions that were part of our overall strategic transformation. During the second quarter, we closed the sale of the 105 markets we were required to divest as part of the Alltel acquisition in 2009. And on July 1, we completed the Access Line spin-off and merger transaction with Frontier. Through the spin-off, Verizon shareholders received $1.85 per share in value in the form of Frontier shares in cash in what was, effectively, a stock dividend. So it was an active quarter for sure with solid overall performance.
Let's now move to our detailed review of the quarter, starting on Slide 4. As Ron indicated earlier, our second quarter earnings results included $0.65 of nonoperational or one-time charges. With a reported loss of $0.07, you can see that the math gets us to a $0.58 quarterly result. For the first half of the year, we produced $1.13 in EPS before the effective nonoperational or one-time items. 
I'd like to add a little more detail on the Wireless deferred revenue adjustment. Over the last several years, we have moved away from billing customers on a per-use basis for data to billing on a predetermined price for either a bundle of text messages, a certain amount of data usage or unlimited usage of data on smartphones. As such, certain data services are billed in advance for services to be provided in the next monthly cycle. Essentially, we are recording an adjustment related to prior periods in which we did not properly defer a portion of monthly billed revenues primarily for certain Wireless data services that are billed in advance.
The impact of the deferred revenue adjustment in any given quarter or year was not material. So reported revenue and growth trends were not materially overstated. In fact, had we done this appropriately, the largest single-year impact would have been under $80 million. However, since the amount of deferred revenue related to these types of data services had grown progressively over time, the $268 million adjustment does negatively impact consolidated revenues and our growth rates in the second quarter. This is a one-time adjustment to reconcile our Wireless deferred data revenue balance. Given the nature of this adjustment, it is not included in our Wireless segment results and does not affect prior-period comparisons at the segment level.
Let me now spend a minute on the divested properties, which will no longer be part of our results in the second half of the year. First, on the Alltel divestiture markets, or trust properties, as we refer to them, these markets were sold to two different buyers and closed on two different dates during the quarter. The first sale closed in late April and the second one in late June. As such, our subscriber numbers at the end of the second quarter exclude the more than 2 million subscribers that we divested in these markets. Our quarterly financial results include these properties up until the date of each sale. But since both transactions closed during the quarter, our results do not reflect a full quarter of activity for the trust properties. The revenue impact of not having these Wireless properties for the entire second quarter is about $100 million. 
We divested the Frontier properties on July 1, so those results are fully included in our second quarter. We will be providing pro forma historical information for our Wireline and Wireless segments to reclassify the impact of these dispositions in late August or early September. Now I'll talk more about the impacts of these divested properties on our 2010 earnings outlook at the end of my remarks.
Since a great deal of our earnings performance involves non-cash effects, let's turn our attention now to cash flow, which presents a much different growth picture. As I said earlier, our cash flow performance was quite strong. Cash flow from operations in the quarter totaled $9.8 billion. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations of $16.9 billion is up 19.4%. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $5.5 billion, up more than 75%. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow of $9.2 billion is up $3.1 billion, or 52%. Our operational cash flow results continue to be very strong, and we have benefited from lower net tax payments. 
Looking at capital spending in total, we were down 3.6% in the quarter and were running 5% below 2009 on a year-to-date basis. So at this point in time, I'd reiterate our previously stated full year 2010 guidance of capital expenditures between $16.8 billion and $17.2 billion. And as I previously said, we're reallocating capital between our segments, reflecting growth opportunities. This shift will continue as we move through the year. 
In Wireline, CapEx in the second quarter was $1.8 billion, down almost 24%. Year-to-date Wireline CapEx of $3.3 billion is down nearly $1 billion, reflecting lower FiOS deployment capital as planned and our tight focus on spending to increase free cash flow.
In Wireless, capital spending is higher than last year, driven by 4G LTE network deployment in data capacity requirements. In the second quarter, Wireless CapEx was $2.3 billion. Year-to-date, we’ve spent $4 billion, which is up $698 million, or about 21%. 
Turning to the balance sheet, a top priority for us is to continue to reduce leverage. And we're doing well here, with net debt of just under $53 billion at the end of the quarter, down $7.5 billion, or 12.5%, since the beginning of the year.
Our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio is about 1.5x, and we're expecting it to be even lower by the end of the year. On July 1, we transferred $250 million of debt to Frontier and shortly thereafter, used the $3.1 billion of cash from the spin-off to further reduce debt. 
Let's turn now to revenue trends, which are on Slide 6. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $26.8 billion, an $88 million, or 0.3%, decline versus last year. The deferred revenue adjustment that I covered earlier had a negative impact on growth of about 100 basis points. And the timing of the Alltel trust property sales during the quarter had an unfavorable revenue impact of about $100 million. During the quarter, we saw revenue growth in our key areas, including Wireless data, FiOS, strategic services within the global enterprise market. 
With that high-level snapshot of revenues, let's move to the segments next, starting with Wireless on Slide 7. In Wireless, we had another strong quarter, with sequential improvement in revenue ARPU churn and profitability. Our revenue growth performance was strong, with total service revenues up $697 million, or 5.2%, year-over-year. And when we look at our results without the Alltel trust properties, in other words on a pro forma basis, total service revenue growth was 6.2%. Our focus on expanding the data market drove data revenue growth of 23.8% compared with last year. Total data revenues grew to $4.8 billion this quarter and comprised 34.5% of total service revenues. And total data ARPU grew 16.1% year-over-year. 
Our strategy is focused on continuing to take advantage of the rapidly growing smartphone device category. Our approach is to support a number of different operating systems and platforms and to offer a robust lineup of devices, which gives us the opportunity to not only attract new customers but upgrade our existing customers.
In addition to improving ARPU and customer retention, we believe this approach will drive sustained data revenue growth, and we continue to be very bullish about this opportunity. For starters, we see plenty of upside in terms of data penetration. At the end of the second quarter, 35% of our retail postpaid base had smartphones or multimedia devices, up from just under 31% at the end of the first quarter and 26% at year end. 20% of our postpaid customers have smartphones and 15% have multimedia devices. 
The DROID franchise has been a great success. We have a steady stream of devices featuring the Android operating system since the first DROID was introduced last fall. To date, we have six devices with multiple manufacturers in our current device lineup with more to come. The Incredible was introduced late in the second quarter, and we began selling the new DROID X on July 15. Both devices have sold very well, and customer feedback has been terrific. We have had some backorder issues, but this is more timing than anything else. 
Customer demand and interest in the smartphone category has never been greater. Demand is being driven by the proliferation of new devices with greater capabilities and innovative applications and content. We feel really good about our device portfolio, with great momentum going forward. Looking ahead, particularly with the commercial launch of LTE later this year, we believe that our network advantage will become even more evident and differentiate us more than ever before.
Let's now talk about our customer-growth results. We display our customer activity on Slide 8, so you can clearly differentiate the second quarter net add growth from the effects of the Alltel trust property subscriber adjustments. We had a good quarter in terms of growth, adding 1.4 million net new customers, with 665,000 retail postpaid net adds and 896,000 Reseller additions. In the postpaid market, we competed very well this quarter with a strong device lineup. Our increased focus on customer retention drove an excellent sequential improvement in postpaid churn of 13 basis points. 
Our net add performance in the Reseller channel was also very good, especially since the second quarter is typically seasonally lower in this customer category. As we've said, the Reseller market is a low-cost channel for us and an effective way for us to attract incremental prepaid customers. We ended this quarter with 92.1 million customers, which as you know, is substantially retail postpaid, representing 89% of total customers.
And as we identified beginning last quarter, the other connections category is where we will be including all kinds of machine-to-machine devices, such as vehicle tracking, telematics, eReaders, consumer electronics, smart grid solutions and medical alert devices. 
Let's take a closer look at our retail performance on Slide 9. Our key focus continues to be on the retail postpaid market, where we continue to drive revenue growth through increased data usage and penetration. Retail service revenues grew 4.2% in the quarter. Retail postpaid ARPU increased 1.2% compared with a year ago, effectively doubling the year-over-year accretion we saw in the first quarter. This accretion is driven by data plans and the increasing percentage of customers using smartphones and multimedia devices. Device upgrades were strong, once again, with about 9% of our postpaid customers upgrading in the second quarter. Customers continue to respond very well to our portfolio of smartphones and multimedia devices. About 40% of devices sales from our direct channels were smartphones with a $30 monthly data plan, and 17% were for multimedia devices, which have a minimum $10 monthly data plan attached. 
Our strategy of stimulating data revenue growth is also improving customer retention. Our churn metrics this quarter were excellent. The improvements were most notable in retail postpaid, with churn under 1% and improving by 7 basis points year-on-year. 
In terms of profitability, we had another excellent quarter, generating $6.7 billion of EBITDA, up 7.8% from a year ago. Our second quarter service EBITDA margins expanded to 47.5%, driven by strong data revenues, churn improvement and the continued benefit of Alltel synergy savings. Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue achieving both growth and profitability, with a focus on gaining share in the retail postpaid market and increasing the penetration of smartphones and other data devices, which will further expand the data market.
Let's move to our Wireline segment on Slide 11. On the consumer side, our broadband and video products continue to drive a significant shift in our revenue mix. FiOS revenue in the quarter grew more than 33% year-over-year, and FiOS ARPU, which now exceed $145, is up 7% over the second quarter last year. On the enterprise side, growth in strategic services, which includes security, IP and other minute [ph] solutions, continue to transform the revenue mix. In wholesale, revenues were impacted by secular pressures and the effect of some international pricing changes.
Let's take a closer look at both the consumer and business markets, starting on Slide 12. This time last year, FiOS made up about 1/3 of consumer revenue. FiOS revenues now represent more than 43%. Within consumer, the strength of our broadband and video products, together with our increasing scale, should continue to drive positive revenue in ARPU growth and offset the secular and competitive pressures in this part of the business. Consumer revenue in the quarter grew 0.3% versus last year, and we continue to see strong growth in consumer ARPU, which increased to more than $80 this quarter, up 11.4% from a year ago. 
In terms of customer growth, we saw a sequential improvement in net additions for both FiOS TV and internet. At the end of the quarter, we had a total of 3.2 million FiOS TV customers, adding 174,000 this quarter compared with 168,000 in the first quarter. Our FiOS TV penetration is 26%, based on about 12.4 million homes opened for sale. On the broadband side, we added 196,000 new FiOS internet customers this quarter compared to 185,000 in the first quarter, bringing our total to 3.8 million. And with about 12.9 million homes open for sale, FiOS Internet penetration is 30%. Adding in High Speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with 9.3 million broadband connections.
Let's move next to our business markets on Slide 13, which shows our Global Enterprise and Global Wholesale revenue performance. While revenues in the business market continue to be affected by macroeconomic pressures, we are seeing some signs of stability. Global Enterprise revenue showed positive sequential and year-over-year growth, up 1.1% versus first quarter and 0.6% versus second quarter last year. Our revenue performance was helped by strong CPE sales in network and solutions-based services. Strategic services, which represents about 40% of Global Enterprise revenue, grew 6.2% year-on-year and 3.5% sequentially. I'd say we are seeing some signs of stabilization. We're still cautious in our optimism, as usage volumes and unemployment figures have not shown any meaningful change.
In Global Wholesale, revenue declines were worse than trend, down 8.3% year-over-year and just under 5% sequentially. Domestically, revenues continue to be impacted by secular pressures. Internationally, we made a decision to increase voice pricing in certain routes, which resulted in some loss of business in this highly competitive market. 
Let's cover Wireline profitability next. In the second quarter, we were able to improve the EBITDA margin by about 100 basis points sequentially to 22.7%. The improvement was primarily driven by wage-related savings and third-party interconnection costs in the quarter. We're making good progress in our workforce reduction initiative. Wireline headcount was down 3,800 in the second quarter and 6,100 year-to-date. 
As I mentioned earlier, we had approximately 11,000 acceptances to our enhanced incentive offer in the East and mid-Atlantic regions. About 2/3 of these employees went off payroll in late June or early July, with the remainder leaving the business later in the third and fourth quarter, as we carefully manage the transition with a focus on customer service. The benefits of these actions should help our margins in the third and fourth quarters.
We are also considering additional force reductions in other locations within the telecom business. We should know more about this by the end of the third quarter. As far as our other cost reduction initiatives, we are also making progress in real estate, network convergence, supply chain, inventory management and energy. We have a well-organized and realistic plan, and I'm confident that we will capture these savings. We'll also continue to be very disciplined in terms of our capital spending.
To sum up, we had a solid quarter with exceptionally strong cash flow. We will continue to focus on maximizing free cash flow, maintaining a strong balance sheet and reducing debt. Our Wireless results were solid. And in Wireline, our cost-reduction initiatives resulted in margin improvements. And we successfully completed our pending transactions by closing the sale of the Alltel trust markets during the quarter and divesting the Access Line properties to Frontier on July 1. 
The Frontier transaction culminates a strategic transformation that we've undergone since the inception of Verizon 10 years ago. During this process, we have aligned our company with the major growth trends driving our industry. We have simplified the business by divesting our Directories business, monetizing our international equity investments and spinning off certain Access Line properties. We have restructured through strategic acquisitions and investments, significantly increased our exposure to the growth areas of the future: Wireless, broadband and global connectivity. 
In Wireless, we've increased our scale through acquisitions, purchased valuable spectrum and invested in new technologies that will position us to capture growth in the rapidly evolving mobile broadband space. We’ve changed our revenue mix in Wireline, reinventing our technology base with Fiber and expanding our global presence through acquisition to meet the growing demand of Enterprise customers for global connectivity. In short, we positioned ourselves to be a stronger competitor in the areas of higher growth and minimized our exposure to areas of business that are more challenged by secular change.
The revenue pie on Slide 16 highlights our current revenue mix. The first observation is that 83% of our consolidated revenues come from Wireless and global business customers. Secondly, the Wireline mass market business comprises only about 16% of our current revenues, with a majority of our households covered by FiOS. So the net result of the strategic investments and divestitures that we made is an outstanding set of high-value assets with greater potential for revenue growth. We are also confident that over the long term, we can grow profit and shareholder returns. In the short-term, I realize that the impact and timing of these divestitures make estimating 2010 earnings more difficult. So in addition to providing pro forma historical information soon, I would like to offer investors some thoughts about the impacts of these divestitures in my outlook for the second half of the year.
Before non-operational and one-time items, we had $1.13 of earnings per share in the first half of the year. The assets we spun off to Frontier and the Alltel trust properties accounted for approximately $0.12 of first half earnings. So excluding these properties, we had $1.01 of earnings per share. Our goal was to grow earnings in the second half of this year by 5% to 10% from this first half adjusted base of $1.01. In the second half of this year, we expect a continuation of the trends we are experiencing in our Wireless business. We believe we can continue to grow the business in terms of net adds and drive higher smartphone adoption leading to accelerated ARPU accretion and revenue growth.
In addition, we will continue to make great progress managing costs. You saw the strong service EBITDA margin that we delivered in the first half, and we expect to continue this performance. In our Wireline business, although we don't expect any significant economic-driven improvements in the second half, we will continue to accelerate the success in the cost reduction programs you saw in the first half. Virtually all of the benefit associated with our incentive offer to associates will be reflected in our second-half results. 
In addition, we continue to make great progress in other areas such as reducing our overall access costs and delivering on all of our other cost-reduction initiatives. So again, a good quarter. We're optimistic about the outlook for the second half of the year, and we're confident in the long-term potential of the business. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Ron so we can get to your questions."

I had indicated on the first quarter call that we thought that was the case. Force benefits, sequentially, we had some wage-related savings, principally on the overtime side. We did not see any of the benefit really in the quarter from the 11,000 force reduction that we've got with the associate offer. So most of the individuals who went off in the second quarter, it was late in the quarter. We had some more in early July. That was a little over 7,000 of the 11,000 went off there. So we should see those benefits in the second half of the year. So we believe we can improve Wireline margin in the second half of the year, off of the pro forma Wireline margin that we'll be putting out, and we feel good about those initiatives. Every cost line is being attacked in the Wireline business. Our third-party access costs or Telco costs are a big area of focus. Obviously, all the headcount items are a strong area of focus. We're seeing improvements in real estate expense. We've vacated some buildings. Most recently, we terminated the lease in Philadelphia, on 1717 Arch Street, which was a fairly sizable commitment for us. So we think we have a lot of opportunity to drive cost reduction on the Wireline side."

So we think there's a lot of opportunity to accelerate top line performance as we go through the second half of the year and into 2011. Now a couple of thoughts for you: The Wireless team is extremely focused on all areas of costs. If you look actually at headcount, they're down year-on-year about 8,000 people. Now a couple of thousand of those are related to the trust properties. There's a little bit of other ones in terms of leave of absence, those kinds of things. But net-net, we're down 4,000 to 5,000 people. They have a series of initiatives within the Wireless business that's focused on their distribution side of the business. That's driving more efficiency, more online transactions, again, an area where we think we're very early in the process of driving that out. Another area that they have a lot of attention is all of the costs and expenses around managing supply chain, inventory levels and just the whole process there. So just about every area of the Wireless side, again, like Wireline, they're attacking the underlying cost structure. We're very pleased with the margin performance in the second quarter and think we're in a good position to continue to drive both growth and profitability in that business."

The team has a tremendous amount of effort and attention there. It's driven principally from operating performance. As part of that, though, is I hope you noticed the working capital benefits because the operating team is very focused on managing inventory levels and all of your days sales outstanding, all of the components that drive cash flow in the business, and I think we're performing extremely well here. So on the dividend side, and as you know, that's a board decision. The board will consider that in September. I think we put them in a position where they have some pretty good alternatives there from a dividend perspective given the cash flow performance. But at the end of the day, that will be their decision. On pricing, we're performing extremely well right now. If you look at our data revenues this quarter, they're up about 24% year-on-year. If you look at data ARPU for our postpaid base, they're up 19%. Again, as I said to you earlier, a lot of upside potential there, given where we are on smartphones and multimedia devices in the future. We have indicated in the past, as we move to an LTE world and LTE pricing, we will probably look very hard at tiered pricing, and that continues to be our thinking right now. So more to come on that. By the way, I should say that all of our efforts, all of our plans on getting LTE launched in the fourth quarter are on schedule. We feel very good about that. We think that's going to open up a whole new set of opportunities to continue to grow this Wireless business that is, again, performing very well."

On the last quarter call, a lot of us, a lot of people were suggesting that the postpaid market was coming to its end. And we suggested to you we thought there was still a lot of life there for Verizon, and we did a lot better in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter. So we feel very good about our position in the postpaid marketplace. That is our prime strategy. Lowell and his team have done a tremendous job with the device lineup, the whole DROID franchise is performing extremely well. We introduced the Incredible, as you know, in the second quarter. We just launched the DROID X. There's more devices to come. So we think our handset lineup is very well positioned. Now we've also suggested that we've decided to play more of the prepaid marketplace, not exclusively. We have our own prepaid offerings that have benefits in terms of handsets and customer service but that we were playing more of that end of the market through the Reseller opportunity. By the way, not just the Straight Talk offering, there's several different retailers. And we've been very satisfied with that. I mean, it's fueled some nice growth for us as we've gone through the past year. The ARPU levels run significantly higher than the traditional Reseller offerings we have had. The profitability from a pure margin percentage basis is pretty good because you don't have the marketing costs and a lot of the SG&A. So we think that strategy has worked well for us, and we're continuing to do that. There's always some seasonal fluctuation there from a Reseller model. Now on the prepaid offering that you said, it's just a trial in the South. It's targeted to a specific geographic area. There's not a plan at the moment to bring that nationally. From time to time, our areas do different things to see what kind of reactions, kind of experiments and that's what that is all about, nothing more than that."

On a reported basis, we were up, which was very good. Now we had a couple of things that helped us there. We had a very strong CPE quarter, a lot of demand for equipment out there, which is good. I mean it drives some margin. We are doing some pricing change on the CPE lineup. We did it late second quarter, early third quarter to drive a little bit of margin. That might temper down the volume just a little bit, as we go through the third quarter. When you underlie and strip out CPE and some of the other things, we did see improved performance in Enterprise, although it was still a little bit negative year-over-year. I wouldn't say we're seeing any big change from an economic standpoint at this point. I think you're hearing that from every call that's out there right now is maybe in the first quarter, there was a little bit of an uptick with everything going on in Europe and other issues. There's probably been a little bit of a pause in terms of purchase decisions right now. We're hoping that will pick back up in the second half of the year. But from a pure Enterprise perspective, we were pleased with our performance in the quarter. But we have a little bit of caution as we go through the rest of the year and again, why it's so important to drive more and more costs out of the business. But at the same time, very focused on driving more profitability in Enterprise. In fact, as I looked at our deals we signed in the second quarter versus the first quarter, margin was up about 250 basis points on those deals quarter-to-quarter. So I think that was a very good sign. From a Wireless postpaid ARPU, we think there is upside as we go through the next couple years. Our smartphone lineup, if you think about it, over the last year, we've solved the problem with the DROID franchise, where we were a little bit behind in terms of the smartphone lineup. That is paying dividends for us right now. We expect those dividends to accelerate that our lineup is going to do extremely well. I'd love to see 3% to 4%. I think we will get better. I think the other company that you indicated, they do have a higher concentration of smartphones in their customer base than we do today. But that gap is going to close because we've got great devices, great lineup, and of course, our distribution is a machine quarter after quarter. So I think you're going to see improving performance there. And it just comes back to the issue I said earlier is we believe there's tremendous opportunity to continue to drive shareholder value in this business, fueled principally on the Wireless side."

And if you look at our machine in terms of what we built over time, we have the ability to manage that and absorb it and still drive good margins, and we believe we can. Now if we had one quarter where we had 3 million DROID net adds, there's probably going to be a little bit of an impact. But by the way, I would take that impact because of what's it's going to do ultimately for value and shareholder value. So we're focused, as we've always said, both on growth and profitability. We will continue to be focused on that. We are taking costs out of our supply chain process, and we will continue to do that. We're managing inventory levels extremely tightly, which is appropriate. From a supply chain perspective on supply of smartphones, we need to manage through it, which we are. These are kind of global issues with certain devices, but we're in a good position here. We think we can fulfill the requirements we have as we go through the second half of the year. We're working extremely closely with all of our manufacturers, and we think we're extremely well positioned. The other comment I'd make here, Tim, on the Washington front, yes, we're actively, actively engaged, including Ivan and Tom Tauke and Randy Milch on all of the issues, both with the policymakers as well as other industry participants. And we'll continue to watch this, and we're optimistic that this will come out in the right place for us and for the industry. But time will tell on that. So not a lot more that I could comment on there right now. 
So I just want to add one other thought here for you before we close off is we did complete the Frontier transaction. I know you're all anxious for pro formas. We'll get that out to you. But as we look back on that, that was a very, very good transaction for us and for Verizon. When we first announced the deal, there were about 4.8 million lines in those territories. As you know, we had a fixed value effectively. The value per line was about $1,791. By the time we completed the transaction, it was about $22,140 per line. So we're very satisfied with what we've done with the Frontier transaction, and we think we've gotten very good value here for the Verizon shareholder, both in terms of the value they get from Frontier and the debt relief. So it's a transaction we're very pleased with. And our team, I think, did an outstanding job working with Frontier around all of the [ph] (1:10:36.2) transition. I would also like to just publicly acknowledge Ron on this call. Many of you did that, but he's done a terrific job for us over the last several years. We will be announcing his replacement shortly in August. And I think it will be a top-notch individual. And of course, that individual will have the guidance of Ron on what needs to be done here. So Ron, I'd just like to thank you, and I know from the industry, you'll be getting a lot of thanks."

With me this morning is John Killian, our Chief Financial Officer. 
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. 
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future result is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.
On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss for the second quarter of $0.07 per share. These quarterly results include a total of $0.65 of nonoperational or one-time charges, which are listed on Slide 4. The largest item relates to the recognition of costs in connection of our Wireline cost reduction initiative, primarily for severance, special termination benefits and pension charges. These costs totaled $2.3 billion pretax and resulted in a charge to earnings of $0.52 per share. Roughly $1 billion of the pretax amount is for additional severance liabilities as a result of the enhanced incentive offer. The remaining $1.3 billion of pretax costs are non-cash and relate to the recognition of special termination benefits and pension plan liabilities for the affected employees. 
We also incurred nonoperational costs in connection with the spin-off of our Access Line properties to Frontier. As we previously discussed, these costs are related to networks, software and other activities required for these facilities to function as a separate company. In the second quarter, these get-ready costs amounted to $195 million pretax or a charge of $0.04 per share. 
Another item we've been pointing out for you are merger integration costs related to Alltel. During the second quarter, charges related to these activities amounted to $0.02 per share. In addition, the sale of the Alltel divestiture properties resulted in a one-time tax expense worth about $0.04 per share.
The last item that I would like to highlight is a one-time non-cash adjustment of $268 million, primarily related to Wireless data revenues. This adjustment was recorded to properly defer previously recognized Wireless data revenues that will be earned and recognized in the following period. As the amounts involved were not material to our consolidated financial statements in any current or previous reporting period, the $268 million adjustment was recorded entirely in the second quarter, with an unfavorable impact on consolidated revenues, which equates to $0.03 per share of earnings. Consistent with our reporting methodology, the items I just described are not included at the segment level, primarily due to their nonoperational or nonrecurring nature. However, they are included in our reported consolidated results. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to John Killian."

Our results show that we continue to do a good job executing in our key focus areas. In terms of cash generation, we had an exceptionally strong quarter of cash flow growth with continued tight controls on capital spending. We saw a good customer growth in Wireless, where data revenue growth continues to be driven by smartphone sales to both new and existing customers. As a result, we saw increasing year-over-year growth in post-date ARPU and improvements to our industry-leading customer retention metrics this quarter. 
In Wireline, our EBITDA margin improvement was driven by cost reductions. During the quarter, we had approximately 11,000 volunteers for our enhanced separation offer in the East and mid-Atlantic regions. So this will go a long way toward helping us achieve our Wireline cost reduction objectives for the year. 
Broadband and video continue to drive revenue results within the mass markets. Revenue trends in global enterprise improved again this quarter and showed positive year-over-year growth. And while we are seeing stability in underlying trends in the enterprise space, we are still seeing cyclical effects and remain cautiously optimistic with regard to a more meaningful economic recovery.
Lastly, we completed the pending transactions that were part of our overall strategic transformation. During the second quarter, we closed the sale of the 105 markets we were required to divest as part of the Alltel acquisition in 2009. And on July 1, we completed the Access Line spin-off and merger transaction with Frontier. Through the spin-off, Verizon's shareholders received $1.85 per share in value in the form of Frontier shares in cash in what was, effectively, a stock dividend. So it was an active quarter for sure with solid overall performance.
Let's now move to our detailed review of the quarter, starting on Slide 4. As Ron indicated earlier, our second quarter earnings results included $0.65 of nonoperational or one-time charges. With a reported loss of $0.07, you can see that the math gets us to a $0.58 quarterly result. For the first half of the year, we produced $1.13 in EPS before the effect of nonoperational or one-time items. 
I'd like to add a little more detail on the Wireless deferred revenue adjustment. Over the last several years, we have moved away from billing customers on a per-use basis for data to billing on a predetermined price for either a bundle of text messages, a certain amount of data usage or unlimited usage of data on smartphones. As such, certain data services are billed in advance for services to be provided in the next monthly cycle. Essentially, we are recording an adjustment related to prior periods in which we did not properly defer a portion of monthly billed revenues primarily for certain Wireless data services that are billed in advance.
The impact of the deferred revenue adjustment in any given quarter or year was not material. So reported revenue and growth trends were not materially overstated. In fact, had we done this appropriately, the largest single-year impact would have been under $80 million. However, since the amount of deferred revenue related to these types of data services had grown progressively over time, the $268 million adjustment does negatively impact consolidated revenues and our growth rates in the second quarter. This is a one-time adjustment to reconcile our Wireless deferred data revenue balance. Given the nature of this adjustment, it is not included in our Wireless segment results and does not affect prior-period comparisons at the segment level.
Let me now spend a minute on the divested properties, which will no longer be part of our results in the second half of the year. First, on the Alltel divestiture markets, or trust properties, as we refer to them, these markets were sold to two different buyers and closed on two different dates during the quarter. The first sale closed in late April and the second one in late June. As such, our subscriber numbers at the end of the second quarter exclude the more than 2 million subscribers that we divested in these markets. Our quarterly financial results include these properties up until the date of each sale. But since both transactions closed during the quarter, our results do not reflect a full quarter of activity for the trust properties. The revenue impact of not having these Wireless properties for the entire second quarter is about $100 million. 
We divested the Frontier properties on July 1, so those results are fully included in our second quarter. We will be providing pro forma historical information for our Wireline and Wireless segments to reclassify the impact of these dispositions in late August or early September. And I'll talk more about the impacts of these divested properties on our 2010 earnings outlook at the end of my remarks.
Since a great deal of our earnings performance involves non-cash effects, let's turn our attention now to cash flow, which presents a much different growth picture. As I said earlier, our cash flow performance was quite strong. Cash flow from operations in the quarter totaled $9.8 billion. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations of $16.9 billion is up 19.4%. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $5.5 billion, up more than 75%. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow of $9.2 billion is up $3.1 billion, or 52%. Our operational cash flow results continue to be very strong, and we have benefited from lower net tax payments. 
Looking at capital spending in total, we were down 3.6% in the quarter and were running 5% below 2009 on a year-to-date basis. So at this point in time, I'd reiterate our previously stated full year 2010 guidance of capital expenditures between $16.8 billion and $17.2 billion. And as I previously said, we're reallocating capital between our segments, reflecting growth opportunities. This shift will continue as we move through the year. 
In Wireline, CapEx in the second quarter was $1.8 billion, down almost 24%. Year-to-date Wireline CapEx of $3.3 billion is down nearly $1 billion, reflecting lower FiOS deployment capital as planned and our tight focus on spending to increase free cash flow.
In Wireless, capital spending is higher than last year, driven by 4G LTE network deployment in data capacity requirements. In the second quarter, Wireless CapEx was $2.3 billion. Year-to-date, we’ve spent $4 billion, which is up $698 million, or about 21%. 
Turning to the balance sheet, a top priority for us is to continue to reduce leverage. And we're doing well here, with net debt of just under $53 billion at the end of the quarter, down $7.5 billion, or 12.5%, since the beginning of the year.
Our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio is about 1.5x, and we're expecting it to be even lower by the end of the year. On July 1, we transferred $250 million of debt to Frontier and shortly thereafter, used the $3.1 billion of cash from the spin-off to further reduce debt. 
Let's turn now to revenue trends, which are on Slide 6. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $26.8 billion, an $88 million, or 0.3%, decline versus last year. The deferred revenue adjustment that I covered earlier had a negative impact on growth of about 100 basis points. And the timing of the Alltel trust property sales during the quarter had an unfavorable revenue impact of about $100 million. During the quarter, we saw revenue growth in our key areas, including Wireless data, FiOS, strategic services within the global enterprise market. 
With that high-level snapshot of revenues, let's move to the segments next, starting with Wireless on Slide 7. In Wireless, we had another strong quarter, with sequential improvement in revenue ARPU churn and profitability. Our revenue growth performance was strong, with total service revenues up $697 million, or 5.2%, year-over-year. And when we look at our results without the Alltel trust properties, in other words on a pro forma basis, total service revenue growth was 6.2%. Our focus on expanding the data market drove data revenue growth of 23.8% compared with last year. Total data revenues grew to $4.8 billion this quarter and comprised 34.5% of total service revenues. And total data ARPU grew 16.1% year-over-year. 
Our strategy is focused on continuing to take advantage of the rapidly growing smartphone device category. Our approach is to support a number of different operating systems and platforms and to offer a robust lineup of devices, which gives us the opportunity to not only attract new customers but upgrade our existing customers.
In addition to improving ARPU and customer retention, we believe this approach will drive sustained data revenue growth, and we continue to be very bullish about this opportunity. For starters, we see plenty of upside in terms of data penetration. At the end of the second quarter, 35% of our retail postpaid base had smartphones or multimedia devices, up from just under 31% at the end of the first quarter and 26% at year end. 20% of our postpaid customers have smartphones and 15% have multimedia devices. 
The DROID franchise has been a great success. We have a steady stream of devices featuring the Android operating system since the first DROID was introduced last fall. To date, we have six devices with multiple manufacturers in our current device lineup with more to come. The Incredible was introduced late in the second quarter, and we began selling the new DROID X on July 15. Both devices have sold very well, and customer feedback has been terrific. We have had some backorder issues, but this is more timing than anything else. 
Customer demand and interest in the smartphone category has never been greater. Demand is being driven by the proliferation of new devices with greater capabilities and innovative applications and content. We feel really good about our device portfolio, with great momentum going forward. Looking ahead, particularly with the commercial launch of LTE later this year, we believe that our network advantage will become even more evident and differentiate us more than ever before.
Let's now talk about our customer-growth results. We display our customer activity on Slide 8, so you can clearly differentiate the second quarter net add growth from the effects of the Alltel trust property subscriber adjustments. We had a good quarter in terms of growth, adding 1.4 million net new customers, with 665,000 retail postpaid net adds and 896,000 Reseller additions. In the postpaid market, we competed very well this quarter with a strong device lineup. Our increased focus on customer retention drove an excellent sequential improvement in postpaid churn of 13 basis points. 
Our net add performance in the Reseller channel was also very good, especially since the second quarter is typically seasonally lower in this customer category. As we've said, the Reseller market is a low-cost channel for us and an effective way for us to attract incremental prepaid customers. We ended this quarter with 92.1 million customers, which as you know, is substantially retail postpaid, representing 89% of total customers.
And as we identified beginning last quarter, the other connections category is where we will be including all kinds of machine-to-machine devices, such as vehicle tracking, telematics, eReaders, consumer electronics, smart grid solutions and medical alert devices. 
Let's take a closer look at our retail performance on Slide 9. Our key focus continues to be on the retail postpaid market, where we continue to drive revenue growth through increased data usage and penetration. Retail service revenues grew 4.2% in the quarter. Retail postpaid ARPU increased 1.2% compared with a year ago, effectively doubling the year-over-year accretion we saw in the first quarter. This accretion is driven by data plans and the increasing percentage of customers using smartphones and multimedia devices. Device upgrades were strong, once again, with about 9% of our postpaid customers upgrading in the second quarter. Customers continue to respond very well to our portfolio of smartphones and multimedia devices. About 40% of devices sales from our direct channels were smartphones with a $30 monthly data plan, and 17% were for multimedia devices, which have a minimum $10 monthly data plan attached. 
Our strategy of stimulating data revenue growth is also improving customer retention. Our churn metrics this quarter were excellent. The improvements were most notable in retail postpaid, with churn under 1% and improving by seven basis points year-on-year. 
In terms of profitability, we had another excellent quarter, generating $6.7 billion of EBITDA, up 7.8% from a year ago. Our second quarter service EBITDA margins expanded to 47.5%, driven by strong data revenues, churn improvement and the continued benefit of Alltel synergy savings. Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue achieving both growth and profitability, with a focus on gaining share in the retail postpaid market and increasing the penetration of smartphones and other data devices, which will further expand the data market.
Let's move to our Wireline segment on Slide 11. On the consumer side, our broadband and video products continue to drive a significant shift in our revenue mix. FiOS revenue in the quarter grew more than 33% year-over-year, and FiOS ARPU, which now exceed $145, is up 7% over the second quarter last year. On the enterprise side, growth in strategic services, which includes security, IP and other managed solutions, continued to transform the revenue mix. In wholesale, revenues were impacted by secular pressures and the effect of some international pricing changes.
Let's take a closer look at both the consumer and business markets, starting on Slide 12. This time last year, FiOS made up about 1/3 of consumer revenue. FiOS revenues now represent more than 43%. Within consumer, the strength of our broadband and video products, together with our increasing scale, should continue to drive positive revenue and ARPU growth and offset the secular and competitive pressures in this part of the business. Consumer revenue in the quarter grew 0.3% versus last year, and we continue to see strong growth in consumer ARPU, which increased to more than $80 this quarter, up 11.4% from a year ago. 
In terms of customer growth, we saw a sequential improvement in net additions for both FiOS TV and Internet. At the end of the quarter, we had a total of 3.2 million FiOS TV customers, adding 174,000 this quarter compared with 168,000 in the first quarter. Our FiOS TV penetration is 26%, based on about 12.4 million homes opened for sale. On the broadband side, we added 196,000 new FiOS Internet customers this quarter compared to 185,000 in the first quarter, bringing our total to 3.8 million. And with about 12.9 million homes open for sale, FiOS Internet penetration is 30%. Adding in High Speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with 9.3 million broadband connections.
Let's move next to our business markets on Slide 13, which shows our Global Enterprise and Global Wholesale revenue performance. While revenues in the business market continue to be affected by macroeconomic pressures, we are seeing some signs of stability. Global Enterprise revenue showed positive sequential and year-over-year growth, up 1.1% versus first quarter and 0.6% versus second quarter last year. Our revenue performance was helped by strong CPE sales in network and solutions-based services. Strategic services, which represent about 40% of Global Enterprise revenue, grew 6.2% year-on-year and 3.5% sequentially. I'd say we are seeing some signs of stabilization. We're still cautious in our optimism, as usage volumes and unemployment figures have not shown any meaningful change.
In Global Wholesale, revenue declines were worse than trend, down 8.3% year-over-year and just under 5% sequentially. Domestically, revenues continue to be impacted by secular pressures. Internationally, we made a decision to increase voice pricing in certain routes, which resulted in some loss of business in this highly competitive market. 
Let's cover Wireline profitability next. In the second quarter, we were able to improve the EBITDA margin by about 100 basis points sequentially to 22.7%. The improvement was primarily driven by wage-related savings and third-party interconnection costs in the quarter. We're making good progress in our workforce reduction initiative. Wireline headcount was down 3,800 in the second quarter and 6,100 year-to-date. 
As I mentioned earlier, we had approximately 11,000 acceptances to our enhanced incentive offer in the East and mid-Atlantic regions. About 2/3 of these employees went off payroll in late June or early July, with the remainder leaving the business later in the third and fourth quarter, as we carefully manage the transition with a focus on customer service. The benefits of these actions should help our margins in the third and fourth quarters.
We are also considering additional force reductions in other locations within the telecom business. We should know more about this by the end of the third quarter. As far as our other cost reduction initiatives, we are also making progress in real estate, network convergence, supply chain, inventory management and energy. We have a well-organized and realistic plan, and I'm confident that we will capture these savings. We'll also continue to be very disciplined in terms of our capital spending.
To sum up, we had a solid quarter with exceptionally strong cash flow. We will continue to focus on maximizing free cash flow, maintaining a strong balance sheet and reducing debt. Our Wireless results were solid. And in Wireline, our cost-reduction initiatives resulted in margin improvements. And we successfully completed our pending transactions by closing the sale of the Alltel trust markets during the quarter and divesting the Access Line properties to Frontier on July 1. 
The Frontier transaction culminates a strategic transformation that we've undergone since the inception of Verizon 10 years ago. During this process, we have aligned our company with the major growth trends driving our industry. We have simplified the business by divesting our Directories business, monetizing our international equity investments and spinning off certain Access Line properties. We have restructured through strategic acquisitions and investments, significantly increased our exposure to the growth areas of the future: Wireless, broadband and global connectivity. 
In Wireless, we've increased our scale through acquisitions, purchased valuable spectrum and invested in new technologies that will position us to capture growth in the rapidly evolving mobile broadband space. We’ve changed our revenue mix in Wireline, reinventing our technology base with Fiber and expanding our global presence through acquisition to meet the growing demand of Enterprise customers for global connectivity. In short, we positioned ourselves to be a stronger competitor in the areas of higher growth and minimized our exposure to areas of business that are more challenged by secular change.
The revenue pie on Slide 16 highlights our current revenue mix. The first observation is that 83% of our consolidated revenues come from Wireless and global business customers. Secondly, the Wireline mass market business comprises only about 16% of our current revenues, with a majority of our households covered by FiOS. So the net result of the strategic investments and divestitures that we made is an outstanding set of high-value assets with greater potential for revenue growth. We are also confident that over the long term, we can grow profit and shareholder returns. In the short-term, I realize that the impact and timing of these divestitures make estimating 2010 earnings more difficult. So in addition to providing pro forma historical information soon, I would like to offer investors some thoughts about the impacts of these divestitures in my outlook for the second half of the year.
Before non-operational and one-time items, we had $1.13 of earnings per share in the first half of the year. The assets we spun off to Frontier and the Alltel trust properties accounted for approximately $0.12 of first half earnings. So excluding these properties, we had $1.01 of earnings per share. Our goal was to grow earnings in the second half of this year by 5% to 10% from this first half adjusted base of $1.01. In the second half of this year, we expect a continuation of the trends we are experiencing in our Wireless business. We believe we can continue to grow the business in terms of net adds and drive higher smartphone adoption leading to accelerated ARPU accretion and revenue growth.
In addition, we will continue to make great progress managing costs. You saw the strong service EBITDA margin that we delivered in the first half, and we expect to continue this performance. In our Wireline business, although we don't expect any significant economic-driven improvements in the second half, we will continue to accelerate the success in the cost reduction programs you saw in the first half. Virtually all of the benefit associated with our incentive offer to associates will be reflected in our second-half results. 
In addition, we continue to make great progress in other areas such as reducing our overall access costs and delivering on all of our other cost-reduction initiatives. So again, a good quarter. We're optimistic about the outlook for the second half of the year, and we're confident in the long-term potential of the business. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Ron so we can get to your questions."

I had indicated on the first quarter call that we thought that was the case. Force benefits, sequentially, we had some wage-related savings, principally on the overtime side. We did not see any of the benefit really in the quarter from the 11,000 force reduction that we've got with the associate offer. So most of the individuals who went off in the second quarter, it was late in the quarter. We had some more in early July. That was a little over 7,000 of the 11,000 went off there. So we should see those benefits in the second half of the year. So we believe we can improve Wireline margin in the second half of the year, off of the pro forma Wireline margin that we'll be putting out, and we feel good about those initiatives. Every cost line is being attacked in the Wireline business. Our third-party access costs or Telco costs are a big area of focus. Obviously, all the headcount items are a strong area of focus. We're seeing improvements in real estate expense. We've vacated some buildings. Most recently, we terminated the lease in Philadelphia, on 1717 Arch Street, which was a fairly sizable commitment for us. So we think we have a lot of opportunity to drive cost reduction on the Wireline side."

Clearly, I think you can see from the call that our Wireless business is really firing on all cylinders, and we think there is substantial opportunity ahead of us to continue that performance.

So we think there's a lot of opportunity to accelerate top line performance as we go through the second half of the year and into 2011. Now a couple of thoughts for you: The Wireless team is extremely focused on all areas of costs. If you look actually at headcount, they're down year-on-year about 8,000 people. Now a couple of thousand of those are related to the trust properties. There's a little bit of other ones in terms of leave of absence, those kinds of things. But net-net, we're down 4,000 to 5,000 people. They have a series of initiatives within the Wireless business that's focused on their distribution side of the business. That's driving more efficiency, more online transactions, again, an area where we think we're very early in the process of driving that out. Another area that they have a lot of attention is all of the costs and expenses around managing supply chain, inventory levels and just the whole process there. So just about every area of the Wireless side, again, like Wireline, they're attacking the underlying cost structure. We're very pleased with the margin performance in the second quarter and think we're in a good position to continue to drive both growth and profitability in that business."

The team has a tremendous amount of effort and attention there. It's driven principally from operating performance. As part of that, though, is I hope you noticed the working capital benefits because the operating team is very focused on managing inventory levels and all of your days sales outstanding, all of the components that drive cash flow in the business, and I think we're performing extremely well here. So on the dividend side, and as you know, that's a board decision. The board will consider that in September. I think we put them in a position where they have some pretty good alternatives there from a dividend perspective given the cash flow performance. But at the end of the day, that will be their decision. On pricing, we're performing extremely well right now. If you look at our data revenues this quarter, they're up about 24% year-on-year. If you look at data ARPU for our postpaid base, they're up over 19%. Again, as I said to you earlier, a lot of upside potential there, given where we are on smartphones and multimedia devices in the future. We have indicated in the past, as we move to an LTE world and LTE pricing, we will probably look very hard at tiered pricing, and that continues to be our thinking right now. So more to come on that. By the way, I should say that all of our efforts, all of our plans on getting LTE launched in the fourth quarter are on schedule. We feel very good about that. We think that's going to open up a whole new set of opportunities to continue to grow this Wireless business that is, again, performing very well."

On the last quarter call, a lot of us, a lot of people were suggesting that the postpaid market was coming to its end. And we suggested to you we thought there was still a lot of life there for Verizon, and we did a lot better in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter. So we feel very good about our position in the postpaid marketplace. That is our prime strategy. Lowell and his team have done a tremendous job with the device lineup, the whole DROID franchise is performing extremely well. We introduced the Incredible, as you know, in the second quarter. We just launched the DROID X. There's more devices to come. So we think our handset lineup is very well positioned. Now we've also suggested that we've decided to play more of the prepaid marketplace, not exclusively. We have our own prepaid offerings that have benefits in terms of handsets and customer service but that we were playing more of that end of the market through the Reseller opportunity. By the way, not just the Straight Talk offering, there's several different retailers. And we've been very satisfied with that. I mean, it's fueled some nice growth for us as we've gone through the past year. The ARPU levels run significantly higher than the traditional Reseller offerings we have had. The profitability from a pure margin percentage basis is pretty good because you don't have the marketing costs and a lot of the SG&A. So we think that strategy has worked well for us, and we're continuing to do that. There's always some seasonal fluctuation there from a Reseller model. Now on the prepaid offering that you said, it's just a trial in the South. It's targeted to a specific geographic area. There's not a plan at the moment to bring that nationally. From time to time, our areas do different things to see what kind of reactions, kind of experiments and that's what that is all about, nothing more than that."

On a reported basis, we were up, which was very good. Now we had a couple of things that helped us there. We had a very strong CPE quarter, a lot of demand for equipment out there, which is good. I mean it drives some margin. We are doing some pricing change on the CPE lineup. We did it late second quarter, early third quarter to drive a little bit of margin. That might temper down the volume just a little bit, as we go through the third quarter. When you underlie and strip out CPE and some of the other things, we did see improved performance in Enterprise, although it was still a little bit negative year-over-year. I wouldn't say we're seeing any big change from an economic standpoint at this point. I think you're hearing that from every call that's out there right now is maybe in the first quarter, there was a little bit of an uptick with everything going on in Europe and other issues. There's probably been a little bit of a pause in terms of purchase decisions right now. We're hoping that will pick back up in the second half of the year. But from a pure Enterprise perspective, we were pleased with our performance in the quarter. But we have a little bit of caution as we go through the rest of the year and again, why it's so important to drive more and more costs out of the business. But at the same time, very focused on driving more profitability in Enterprise. In fact, as I looked at our deals we signed in the second quarter versus the first quarter, margin was up about 250 basis points on those deals quarter-to-quarter. So I think that was a very good sign. From a Wireless postpaid ARPU, we think there is upside as we go through the next couple years. Our smartphone lineup, if you think about it, over the last year, we've solved the problem with the DROID franchise, where we were a little bit behind in terms of the smartphone lineup. That is paying dividends for us right now. We expect those dividends to accelerate that our lineup is going to do extremely well. I'd love to see 3% to 4%. I think we will get better. I think the other company that you indicated, they do have a higher concentration of smartphones in their customer base than we do today. But that gap is going to close because we've got great devices, great lineup, and of course, our distribution is a machine quarter after quarter. So I think you're going to see improving performance there. And it just comes back to the issue I said earlier is we believe there's tremendous opportunity to continue to drive shareholder value in this business, fueled principally on the Wireless side."

And if you look at our machine in terms of what we built over time, we have the ability to manage that and absorb it and still drive good margins, and we believe we can. Now if we had one quarter where we had 3 million DROID net adds, there's probably going to be a little bit of an impact. But by the way, I would take that impact because of what's it's going to do ultimately for value and shareholder value. So we're focused, as we've always said, both on growth and profitability. We will continue to be focused on that. We are taking costs out of our supply chain process, and we will continue to do that. We're managing inventory levels extremely tightly, which is appropriate. From a supply chain perspective on supply of smartphones, we need to manage through it, which we are. These are kind of global issues with certain devices, but we're in a good position here. We think we can fulfill the requirements we have as we go through the second half of the year. We're working extremely closely with all of our manufacturers, and we think we're extremely well positioned. The other comment I'd make here, Tim, on the Washington front, yes, we're actively, actively engaged, including Ivan and Tom Tauke and Randy Milch on all of the issues, both with the policymakers as well as other industry participants. And we'll continue to watch this, and we're optimistic that this will come out in the right place for us and for the industry. But time will tell on that. So not a lot more that I could comment on there right now. 
So I just want to add one other thought here for you before we close off is we did complete the Frontier transaction. I know you're all anxious for pro formas. We'll get that out to you. But as we look back on that, that was a very, very good transaction for us and for Verizon. When we first announced the deal, there were about 4.8 million lines in those territories. As you know, we had a fixed value effectively. The value per line was about $1,791. By the time we completed the transaction, it was about $22,140 per line. So we're very satisfied with what we've done with the Frontier transaction, and we think we've gotten very good value here for the Verizon shareholder, both in terms of the value they get from Frontier and the debt relief. So it's a transaction we're very pleased with. And our team, I think, did an outstanding job working with Frontier around all of the [ph] (1:10:36.2) transition. I would also like to just publicly acknowledge Ron on this call. Many of you did that, but he's done a terrific job for us over the last several years. We will be announcing his replacement shortly in August. And I think it will be a top-notch individual. And of course, that individual will have the guidance of Ron on what needs to be done here. So Ron, I'd just like to thank you, and I know from the industry, you'll be getting a lot of thanks."

I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future result is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.
On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss for the second quarter of $0.07 per share. These quarterly results include a total of $0.65 of nonoperational or one-time charges, which are listed on Slide 4. The largest item relates to the recognition of costs in connection of our Wireline cost reduction initiative, primarily for severance, special termination benefits and pension charges. These costs totaled $2.3 billion pretax and resulted in a charge to earnings of $0.52 per share. Roughly $1 billion of the pretax amount is for additional severance liabilities as a result of the enhanced incentive offer. The remaining $1.3 billion of pretax costs are non-cash and relate to the recognition of special termination benefits and pension plan liabilities for the affected employees. 
We also incurred nonoperational costs in connection with the spin-off of our Access Line properties to Frontier. As we previously discussed, these costs are related to networks, software and other activities required for these facilities to function as a separate company. In the second quarter, these get-ready costs amounted to $195 million pretax or a charge of $0.04 per share. 
Another item we've been pointing out for you are merger integration costs related to Alltel. During the second quarter, charges related to these activities amounted to $0.02 per share. In addition, the sale of the Alltel divestiture properties resulted in a one-time tax expense worth about $0.04 per share.
The last item that I would like to highlight is a one-time non-cash adjustment of $268 million, primarily related to Wireless data revenues. This adjustment was recorded to properly defer previously recognized Wireless data revenues that will be earned and recognized in the following period. As the amounts involved were not material to our consolidated financial statements in any current or previous reporting period, the $268 million adjustment was recorded entirely in the second quarter, with an unfavorable impact on consolidated revenues, which equates to $0.03 per share of earnings. Consistent with our reporting methodology, the items I just described are not included at the segment level, primarily due to their nonoperational or nonrecurring nature. However, they are included in our reported consolidated results. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to John Killian."

Before we get into the details, let me start with some brief comments on the business overall and add some of my perspective to our second quarter results. 
Our results show that we continue to do a good job executing in our key focus areas. In terms of cash generation, we had an exceptionally strong quarter of cash flow growth with continued tight controls on capital spending. We saw a good customer growth in Wireless, where data revenue growth continues to be driven by smartphone sales to both new and existing customers. As a result, we saw increasing year-over-year growth in post-date ARPU and improvements to our industry-leading customer retention metrics this quarter. 
In Wireline, our EBITDA margin improvement was driven by cost reductions. During the quarter, we had approximately 11,000 volunteers for our enhanced separation offer in the East and mid-Atlantic regions. So this will go a long way toward helping us achieve our Wireline cost reduction objectives for the year. 
Broadband and video continue to drive revenue results within the mass markets. Revenue trends in global enterprise improved again this quarter and showed positive year-over-year growth. And while we are seeing stability in underlying trends in the enterprise space, we are still seeing cyclical effects and remain cautiously optimistic with regard to a more meaningful economic recovery.
Lastly, we completed the pending transactions that were part of our overall strategic transformation. During the second quarter, we closed the sale of the 105 markets we were required to divest as part of the Alltel acquisition in 2009. And on July 1, we completed the Access Line spin-off and merger transaction with Frontier. Through the spin-off, Verizon's shareholders received $1.85 per share in value in the form of Frontier shares in cash in what was, effectively, a stock dividend. So it was an active quarter for sure with solid overall performance.
Let's now move to our detailed review of the quarter, starting on Slide 4. As Ron indicated earlier, our second quarter earnings results included $0.65 of nonoperational or one-time charges. With a reported loss of $0.07, you can see that the math gets us to a $0.58 quarterly result. For the first half of the year, we produced $1.13 in EPS before the effect of nonoperational or one-time items. 
I'd like to add a little more detail on the Wireless deferred revenue adjustment. Over the last several years, we have moved away from billing customers on a per-use basis for data to billing on a predetermined price for either a bundle of text messages, a certain amount of data usage or unlimited usage of data on smartphones. As such, certain data services are billed in advance for services to be provided in the next monthly cycle. Essentially, we are recording an adjustment related to prior periods in which we did not properly defer a portion of monthly billed revenues primarily for certain Wireless data services that are billed in advance.
The impact of the deferred revenue adjustment in any given quarter or year was not material. So reported revenue and growth trends were not materially overstated. In fact, had we done this appropriately, the largest single-year impact would have been under $80 million. However, since the amount of deferred revenue related to these types of data services had grown progressively over time, the $268 million adjustment does negatively impact consolidated revenues and our growth rates in the second quarter. This is a one-time adjustment to reconcile our Wireless deferred data revenue balance. Given the nature of this adjustment, it is not included in our Wireless segment results and does not affect prior-period comparisons at the segment level.
Let me now spend a minute on the divested properties, which will no longer be part of our results in the second half of the year. First, on the Alltel divestiture markets, or trust properties, as we refer to them, these markets were sold to two different buyers and closed on two different dates during the quarter. The first sale closed in late April and the second one in late June. As such, our subscriber numbers at the end of the second quarter exclude the more than 2 million subscribers that we divested in these markets. Our quarterly financial results include these properties up until the date of each sale. But since both transactions closed during the quarter, our results do not reflect a full quarter of activity for the trust properties. The revenue impact of not having these Wireless properties for the entire second quarter is about $100 million. 
We divested the Frontier properties on July 1, so those results are fully included in our second quarter. We will be providing pro forma historical information for our Wireline and Wireless segments to reclassify the impact of these dispositions in late August or early September. And I'll talk more about the impacts of these divested properties on our 2010 earnings outlook at the end of my remarks.
Since a great deal of our earnings performance involves non-cash effects, let's turn our attention now to cash flow, which presents a much different growth picture. As I said earlier, our cash flow performance was quite strong. Cash flow from operations in the quarter totaled $9.8 billion. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations of $16.9 billion is up 19.4%. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $5.5 billion, up more than 75%. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow of $9.2 billion is up $3.1 billion, or 52%. Our operational cash flow results continue to be very strong, and we have benefited from lower net tax payments. 
Looking at capital spending in total, we were down 3.6% in the quarter and were running 5% below 2009 on a year-to-date basis. So at this point in time, I'd reiterate our previously stated full year 2010 guidance of capital expenditures between $16.8 billion and $17.2 billion. And as I previously said, we're reallocating capital between our segments, reflecting growth opportunities. This shift will continue as we move through the year. 
In Wireline, CapEx in the second quarter was $1.8 billion, down almost 24%. Year-to-date Wireline CapEx of $3.3 billion is down nearly $1 billion, reflecting lower FiOS deployment capital as planned and our tight focus on spending to increase free cash flow.
In Wireless, capital spending is higher than last year, driven by 4G LTE network deployment in data capacity requirements. In the second quarter, Wireless CapEx was $2.3 billion. Year-to-date, we’ve spent $4 billion, which is up $698 million, or about 21%. 
Turning to the balance sheet, a top priority for us is to continue to reduce leverage. And we're doing well here, with net debt of just under $53 billion at the end of the quarter, down $7.5 billion, or 12.5%, since the beginning of the year.
Our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio is about 1.5x, and we're expecting it to be even lower by the end of the year. On July 1, we transferred $250 million of debt to Frontier and shortly thereafter, used the $3.1 billion of cash from the spin-off to further reduce debt. 
Let's turn now to revenue trends, which are on Slide 6. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $26.8 billion, an $88 million, or 0.3%, decline versus last year. The deferred revenue adjustment that I covered earlier had a negative impact on growth of about 100 basis points. And the timing of the Alltel trust property sales during the quarter had an unfavorable revenue impact of about $100 million. During the quarter, we saw revenue growth in our key areas, including Wireless data, FiOS, strategic services within the global enterprise market. 
With that high-level snapshot of revenues, let's move to the segments next, starting with Wireless on Slide 7. In Wireless, we had another strong quarter, with sequential improvement in revenue ARPU churn and profitability. Our revenue growth performance was strong, with total service revenues up $697 million, or 5.2%, year-over-year. And when we look at our results without the Alltel trust properties, in other words on a pro forma basis, total service revenue growth was 6.2%. Our focus on expanding the data market drove data revenue growth of 23.8% compared with last year. Total data revenues grew to $4.8 billion this quarter and comprised 34.5% of total service revenues. And total data ARPU grew 16.1% year-over-year. 
Our strategy is focused on continuing to take advantage of the rapidly growing smartphone device category. Our approach is to support a number of different operating systems and platforms and to offer a robust lineup of devices, which gives us the opportunity to not only attract new customers but upgrade our existing customers.
In addition to improving ARPU and customer retention, we believe this approach will drive sustained data revenue growth, and we continue to be very bullish about this opportunity. For starters, we see plenty of upside in terms of data penetration. At the end of the second quarter, 35% of our retail postpaid base had smartphones or multimedia devices, up from just under 31% at the end of the first quarter and 26% at year end. 20% of our postpaid customers have smartphones and 15% have multimedia devices. 
The DROID franchise has been a great success. We have a steady stream of devices featuring the Android operating system since the first DROID was introduced last fall. To date, we have six devices with multiple manufacturers in our current device lineup with more to come. The Incredible was introduced late in the second quarter, and we began selling the new DROID X on July 15. Both devices have sold very well, and customer feedback has been terrific. We have had some backorder issues, but this is more timing than anything else. 
Customer demand and interest in the smartphone category has never been greater. Demand is being driven by the proliferation of new devices with greater capabilities and innovative applications and content. We feel really good about our device portfolio, with great momentum going forward. Looking ahead, particularly with the commercial launch of LTE later this year, we believe that our network advantage will become even more evident and differentiate us more than ever before.
Let's now talk about our customer-growth results. We display our customer activity on Slide 8, so you can clearly differentiate the second quarter net add growth from the effects of the Alltel trust property subscriber adjustments. We had a good quarter in terms of growth, adding 1.4 million net new customers, with 665,000 retail postpaid net adds and 896,000 Reseller additions. In the postpaid market, we competed very well this quarter with a strong device lineup. Our increased focus on customer retention drove an excellent sequential improvement in postpaid churn of 13 basis points. 
Our net add performance in the Reseller channel was also very good, especially since the second quarter is typically seasonally lower in this customer category. As we've said, the Reseller market is a low-cost channel for us and an effective way for us to attract incremental prepaid customers. We ended this quarter with 92.1 million customers, which as you know, is substantially retail postpaid, representing 89% of total customers.
And as we identified beginning last quarter, the other connections category is where we will be including all kinds of machine-to-machine devices, such as vehicle tracking, telematics, eReaders, consumer electronics, smart grid solutions and medical alert devices. 
Let's take a closer look at our retail performance on Slide 9. Our key focus continues to be on the retail postpaid market, where we continue to drive revenue growth through increased data usage and penetration. Retail service revenues grew 4.2% in the quarter. Retail postpaid ARPU increased 1.2% compared with a year ago, effectively doubling the year-over-year accretion we saw in the first quarter. This accretion is driven by data plans and the increasing percentage of customers using smartphones and multimedia devices. Device upgrades were strong, once again, with about 9% of our postpaid customers upgrading in the second quarter. Customers continue to respond very well to our portfolio of smartphones and multimedia devices. About 40% of devices sales from our direct channels were smartphones with a $30 monthly data plan, and 17% were for multimedia devices, which have a minimum $10 monthly data plan attached. 
Our strategy of stimulating data revenue growth is also improving customer retention. Our churn metrics this quarter were excellent. The improvements were most notable in retail postpaid, with churn under 1% and improving by seven basis points year-on-year. 
In terms of profitability, we had another excellent quarter, generating $6.7 billion of EBITDA, up 7.8% from a year ago. Our second quarter service EBITDA margins expanded to 47.5%, driven by strong data revenues, churn improvement and the continued benefit of Alltel synergy savings. Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue achieving both growth and profitability, with a focus on gaining share in the retail postpaid market and increasing the penetration of smartphones and other data devices, which will further expand the data market.
Let's move to our Wireline segment on Slide 11. On the consumer side, our broadband and video products continue to drive a significant shift in our revenue mix. FiOS revenue in the quarter grew more than 33% year-over-year, and FiOS ARPU, which now exceed $145, is up 7% over the second quarter last year. On the enterprise side, growth in strategic services, which includes security, IP and other managed solutions, continued to transform the revenue mix. In wholesale, revenues were impacted by secular pressures and the effect of some international pricing changes.
Let's take a closer look at both the consumer and business markets, starting on Slide 12. This time last year, FiOS made up about 1/3 of consumer revenue. FiOS revenues now represent more than 43%. Within consumer, the strength of our broadband and video products, together with our increasing scale, should continue to drive positive revenue and ARPU growth and offset the secular and competitive pressures in this part of the business. Consumer revenue in the quarter grew 0.3% versus last year, and we continue to see strong growth in consumer ARPU, which increased to more than $80 this quarter, up 11.4% from a year ago. 
In terms of customer growth, we saw a sequential improvement in net additions for both FiOS TV and Internet. At the end of the quarter, we had a total of 3.2 million FiOS TV customers, adding 174,000 this quarter compared with 168,000 in the first quarter. Our FiOS TV penetration is 26%, based on about 12.4 million homes opened for sale. On the broadband side, we added 196,000 new FiOS Internet customers this quarter compared to 185,000 in the first quarter, bringing our total to 3.8 million. And with about 12.9 million homes open for sale, FiOS Internet penetration is 30%. Adding in High Speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with 9.3 million broadband connections.
Let's move next to our business markets on Slide 13, which shows our Global Enterprise and Global Wholesale revenue performance. While revenues in the business market continue to be affected by macroeconomic pressures, we are seeing some signs of stability. Global Enterprise revenue showed positive sequential and year-over-year growth, up 1.1% versus first quarter and 0.6% versus second quarter last year. Our revenue performance was helped by strong CPE sales in network and solutions-based services. Strategic services, which represent about 40% of Global Enterprise revenue, grew 6.2% year-on-year and 3.5% sequentially. I'd say we are seeing some signs of stabilization. We're still cautious in our optimism, as usage volumes and unemployment figures have not shown any meaningful change.
In Global Wholesale, revenue declines were worse than trend, down 8.3% year-over-year and just under 5% sequentially. Domestically, revenues continue to be impacted by secular pressures. Internationally, we made a decision to increase voice pricing in certain routes, which resulted in some loss of business in this highly competitive market. 
Let's cover Wireline profitability next. In the second quarter, we were able to improve the EBITDA margin by about 100 basis points sequentially to 22.7%. The improvement was primarily driven by wage-related savings and third-party interconnection costs in the quarter. We're making good progress in our workforce reduction initiative. Wireline headcount was down 3,800 in the second quarter and 6,100 year-to-date. 
As I mentioned earlier, we had approximately 11,000 acceptances to our enhanced incentive offer in the East and mid-Atlantic regions. About 2/3 of these employees went off payroll in late June or early July, with the remainder leaving the business later in the third and fourth quarter, as we carefully manage the transition with a focus on customer service. The benefits of these actions should help our margins in the third and fourth quarters.
We are also considering additional force reductions in other locations within the telecom business. We should know more about this by the end of the third quarter. As far as our other cost reduction initiatives, we are also making progress in real estate, network convergence, supply chain, inventory management and energy. We have a well-organized and realistic plan, and I'm confident that we will capture these savings. We'll also continue to be very disciplined in terms of our capital spending.
To sum up, we had a solid quarter with exceptionally strong cash flow. We will continue to focus on maximizing free cash flow, maintaining a strong balance sheet and reducing debt. Our Wireless results were solid. And in Wireline, our cost-reduction initiatives resulted in margin improvements. And we successfully completed our pending transactions by closing the sale of the Alltel trust markets during the quarter and divesting the Access Line properties to Frontier on July 1. 
The Frontier transaction culminates a strategic transformation that we've undergone since the inception of Verizon 10 years ago. During this process, we have aligned our company with the major growth trends driving our industry. We have simplified the business by divesting our Directories business, monetizing our international equity investments and spinning off certain Access Line properties. We have restructured through strategic acquisitions and investments, significantly increased our exposure to the growth areas of the future: Wireless, broadband and global connectivity. 
In Wireless, we've increased our scale through acquisitions, purchased valuable spectrum and invested in new technologies that will position us to capture growth in the rapidly evolving mobile broadband space. We’ve changed our revenue mix in Wireline, reinventing our technology base with Fiber and expanding our global presence through acquisition to meet the growing demand of Enterprise customers for global connectivity. In short, we positioned ourselves to be a stronger competitor in the areas of higher growth and minimized our exposure to areas of business that are more challenged by secular change.
The revenue pie on Slide 16 highlights our current revenue mix. The first observation is that 83% of our consolidated revenues come from Wireless and global business customers. Secondly, the Wireline mass market business comprises only about 16% of our current revenues, with a majority of our households covered by FiOS. So the net result of the strategic investments and divestitures that we made is an outstanding set of high-value assets with greater potential for revenue growth. We are also confident that over the long term, we can grow profit and shareholder returns. In the short-term, I realize that the impact and timing of these divestitures make estimating 2010 earnings more difficult. So in addition to providing pro forma historical information soon, I would like to offer investors some thoughts about the impacts of these divestitures in my outlook for the second half of the year.
Before non-operational and one-time items, we had $1.13 of earnings per share in the first half of the year. The assets we spun off to Frontier and the Alltel trust properties accounted for approximately $0.12 of first half earnings. So excluding these properties, we had $1.01 of earnings per share. Our goal was to grow earnings in the second half of this year by 5% to 10% from this first half adjusted base of $1.01. In the second half of this year, we expect a continuation of the trends we are experiencing in our Wireless business. We believe we can continue to grow the business in terms of net adds and drive higher smartphone adoption leading to accelerated ARPU accretion and revenue growth.
In addition, we will continue to make great progress managing costs. You saw the strong service EBITDA margin that we delivered in the first half, and we expect to continue this performance. In our Wireline business, although we don't expect any significant economic-driven improvements in the second half, we will continue to accelerate the success in the cost reduction programs you saw in the first half. Virtually all of the benefit associated with our incentive offer to associates will be reflected in our second-half results. 
In addition, we continue to make great progress in other areas such as reducing our overall access costs and delivering on all of our other cost-reduction initiatives. So again, a good quarter. We're optimistic about the outlook for the second half of the year, and we're confident in the long-term potential of the business. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Ron so we can get to your questions."

I had indicated on the first quarter call that we thought that was the case. Force benefits, sequentially, we had some wage-related savings, principally on the overtime side. We did not see any of the benefit really in the quarter from the 11,000 force reduction that we've got with the associate offer. So most of the individuals who went off in the second quarter, it was late in the quarter. We had some more in early July. That was a little over 7,000 of the 11,000 went off there. So we should see those benefits in the second half of the year. So we believe we can improve Wireline margin in the second half of the year, off of the pro forma Wireline margin that we'll be putting out, and we feel good about those initiatives. Every cost line is being attacked in the Wireline business. Our third-party access costs or Telco costs are a big area of focus. Obviously, all the headcount items are a strong area of focus. We're seeing improvements in real estate expense. We've vacated some buildings. Most recently, we terminated the lease in Philadelphia, on 1717 Arch Street, which was a fairly sizable commitment for us. So we think we have a lot of opportunity to drive cost reduction on the Wireline side."

Clearly, I think you can see from the call that our Wireless business is really firing on all cylinders, and we think there is substantial opportunity ahead of us to continue that performance. We're in the early innings of Wireless data with only 20% of our base having a smartphone and then with LTE, a whole set of opportunities around video. So we think there's a lot of opportunity to accelerate top line performance as we go through the second half of the year and into 2011. Now a couple of thoughts for you: The Wireless team is extremely focused on all areas of costs. If you look actually at headcount, they're down year-on-year about 8,000 people. Now a couple of thousand of those are related to the trust properties. There's a little bit of other ones in terms of leave of absence, those kinds of things. But net-net, we're down 4,000 to 5,000 people. They have a series of initiatives within the Wireless business that's focused on their distribution side of the business. That's driving more efficiency, more online transactions, again, an area where we think we're very early in the process of driving that out. Another area that they have a lot of attention is all of the costs and expenses around managing supply chain, inventory levels and just the whole process there. So just about every area of the Wireless side, again, like Wireline, they're attacking the underlying cost structure. We're very pleased with the margin performance in the second quarter and think we're in a good position to continue to drive both growth and profitability in that business."

I expect that trend to continue as we go into 2011. I think we can take another bite out of it down next year. I'm not going to size that right now because we're early in the process. But I think our overall CapEx spending, as we look at 2011, will be down from where we are today, although we will keep a pretty strong allocation to the Wireless side, as you know the Wireless side being fueled by LTE and by data."

The team has a tremendous amount of effort and attention there. It's driven principally from operating performance. As part of that, though, is I hope you noticed the working capital benefits because the operating team is very focused on managing inventory levels and all of your days sales outstanding, all of the components that drive cash flow in the business, and I think we're performing extremely well here. So on the dividend side, and as you know, that's a board decision. The board will consider that in September. I think we put them in a position where they have some pretty good alternatives there from a dividend perspective given the cash flow performance. But at the end of the day, that will be their decision. On pricing, we're performing extremely well right now. If you look at our data revenues this quarter, they're up about 24% year-on-year. If you look at data ARPU for our postpaid base, they're up over 19%. Again, as I said to you earlier, a lot of upside potential there, given where we are on smartphones and multimedia devices in the future. We have indicated in the past, as we move to an LTE world and LTE pricing, we will probably look very hard at tiered pricing, and that continues to be our thinking right now. So more to come on that. By the way, I should say that all of our efforts, all of our plans on getting LTE launched in the fourth quarter are on schedule. We feel very good about that. We think that's going to open up a whole new set of opportunities to continue to grow this Wireless business that is, again, performing very well."

On the last quarter call, a lot of us, a lot of people were suggesting that the postpaid market was coming to its end. And we suggested to you we thought there was still a lot of life there for Verizon, and we did a lot better in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter. So we feel very good about our position in the postpaid marketplace. That is our prime strategy. Lowell and his team have done a tremendous job with the device lineup, the whole DROID franchise is performing extremely well. We introduced the Incredible, as you know, in the second quarter. We just launched the DROID X. There's more devices to come. So we think our handset lineup is very well positioned. Now we've also suggested that we've decided to play more of the prepaid marketplace, not exclusively. We have our own prepaid offerings that have benefits in terms of handsets and customer service but that we were playing more of that end of the market through the Reseller opportunity. By the way, not just the Straight Talk offering, there's several different retailers. And we've been very satisfied with that. I mean, it's fueled some nice growth for us as we've gone through the past year. The ARPU levels run significantly higher than the traditional Reseller offerings we have had. The profitability from a pure margin percentage basis is pretty good because you don't have the marketing costs and a lot of the SG&A. So we think that strategy has worked well for us, and we're continuing to do that. There's always some seasonal fluctuation there from a Reseller model. Now on the prepaid offering that you said, it's just a trial in the South. It's targeted to a specific geographic area. There's not a plan at the moment to bring that nationally. From time to time, our areas do different things to see what kind of reactions, kind of experiments and that's what that is all about, nothing more than that."

On a reported basis, we were up, which was very good. Now we had a couple of things that helped us there. We had a very strong CPE quarter, a lot of demand for equipment out there, which is good. I mean it drives some margin. We are doing some pricing change on the CPE lineup. We did it late second quarter, early third quarter to drive a little bit of margin. That might temper down the volume just a little bit, as we go through the third quarter. When you underlie and strip out CPE and some of the other things, we did see improved performance in Enterprise, although it was still a little bit negative year-over-year. I wouldn't say we're seeing any big change from an economic standpoint at this point. I think you're hearing that from every call that's out there right now is maybe in the first quarter, there was a little bit of an uptick with everything going on in Europe and other issues. There's probably been a little bit of a pause in terms of purchase decisions right now. We're hoping that will pick back up in the second half of the year. But from a pure Enterprise perspective, we were pleased with our performance in the quarter. But we have a little bit of caution as we go through the rest of the year and again, why it's so important to drive more and more costs out of the business. But at the same time, very focused on driving more profitability in Enterprise. In fact, as I looked at our deals we signed in the second quarter versus the first quarter, margin was up about 250 basis points on those deals quarter-to-quarter. So I think that was a very good sign. From a Wireless postpaid ARPU, we think there is upside as we go through the next couple years. Our smartphone lineup, if you think about it, over the last year, we've solved the problem with the DROID franchise, where we were a little bit behind in terms of the smartphone lineup. That is paying dividends for us right now. We expect those dividends to accelerate that our lineup is going to do extremely well. I'd love to see 3% to 4%. I think we will get better. I think the other company that you indicated, they do have a higher concentration of smartphones in their customer base than we do today. But that gap is going to close because we've got great devices, great lineup, and of course, our distribution is a machine quarter after quarter. So I think you're going to see improving performance there. And it just comes back to the issue I said earlier is we believe there's tremendous opportunity to continue to drive shareholder value in this business, fueled principally on the Wireless side."

And if you look at our machine in terms of what we built over time, we have the ability to manage that and absorb it and still drive good margins, and we believe we can. Now if we had one quarter where we had 3 million DROID net adds, there's probably going to be a little bit of an impact. But by the way, I would take that impact because of what's it's going to do ultimately for value and shareholder value. So we're focused, as we've always said, both on growth and profitability. We will continue to be focused on that. We are taking costs out of our supply chain process, and we will continue to do that. We're managing inventory levels extremely tightly, which is appropriate. From a supply chain perspective on supply of smartphones, we need to manage through it, which we are. These are kind of global issues with certain devices, but we're in a good position here. We think we can fulfill the requirements we have as we go through the second half of the year. We're working extremely closely with all of our manufacturers, and we think we're extremely well positioned. The other comment I'd make here, Tim, on the Washington front, yes, we're actively, actively engaged, including Ivan and Tom Tauke and Randy Milch on all of the issues, both with the policymakers as well as other industry participants. And we'll continue to watch this, and we're optimistic that this will come out in the right place for us and for the industry. But time will tell on that. So not a lot more that I could comment on there right now. 
So I just want to add one other thought here for you before we close off is we did complete the Frontier transaction. I know you're all anxious for pro formas. We'll get that out to you. But as we look back on that, that was a very, very good transaction for us and for Verizon. When we first announced the deal, there were about 4.8 million lines in those territories. As you know, we had a fixed value effectively. The value per line was about $1,791. By the time we completed the transaction, it was about $22,140 per line. So we're very satisfied with what we've done with the Frontier transaction, and we think we've gotten very good value here for the Verizon shareholder, both in terms of the value they get from Frontier and the debt relief. So it's a transaction we're very pleased with. And our team, I think, did an outstanding job working with Frontier around all of the [ph] (1:10:36.2) transition. I would also like to just publicly acknowledge Ron on this call. Many of you did that, but he's done a terrific job for us over the last several years. We will be announcing his replacement shortly in August. And I think it will be a top-notch individual. And of course, that individual will have the guidance of Ron on what needs to be done here. So Ron, I'd just like to thank you, and I know from the industry, you'll be getting a lot of thanks."

Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is John Killian, our Chief Financial Officer; and Fran Shammo, who will be assuming the CFO role on November 1.
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.
I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.
This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.
As I'm sure you are aware, we published reclassified historical financial information for the past six quarters for the results associated with the Frontier transaction, as well as the divested wireless trust properties. In addition, we reclassified prior period wireless results for the deferred revenue adjustment that we recognized in the second quarter of 2010.
The financial and operating metrics included in our slides are therefore presented on a comparable basis. However, on the balance sheets and segments of cash flows, prior periods were not reclassified for the impact of the divested properties. On a GAAP basis, we reported earning of $0.31 per share in the third quarter.
These quarterly results include a total of $0.25 of non-operational charges, which are listed on Slide 4. The largest item is a non-cash charge of $0.19 per share relating to the recognition of pension settlement losses resulting from our workforce reduction and separation plans.
Pension accounting rules require that settlement losses be recorded, once prescribed payment thresholds have been reached. In connection with the closing of the Frontier spin-off, we also incurred a charge of $0.04 per share for certain non-operational and transaction related costs.
The last item is merger integration costs related to Alltel. During the third quarter, charges related to these activities amounted to $0.02 per share.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to John Killian.

We had another sol",3298,"Thanks, John, and good morning everyone. Before we get into the details, let me start with some comments on our overall performance and add some of my perspective to our third quarter results.
The business is performing extremely well. We had another solid quarter, and we continue to execute well on our key focus areas. We had strong earnings performance in the quarter, showing sequential improvement.
On our last conference call, I stated that our goal was to grow earnings in the second half of the year by 5% to 10% from our first half adjusted base of $1.10 per share. Our third quarter results indicate that we are on track to meet this goal, and expect to be at the high end of this guidance.
Wireless had a very good quarter, with accelerating revenue growth driven by strong postpaid ARPU accretion. New customer additions and device upgrades once again resulted in higher smartphone sales and drove data revenue increases. And we sustained our wireless EBITDA margin of 47.2%, which remains by far the highest in the industry.
In Wireline, we continue to make steady progress. We had a very strong quarter of customer growth in FiOS with our third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement, adding more than 200,000 new customers in both TV and Internet, our highest net add totals since the second quarter of 2009.
Revenues in global enterprise were stable, showing modest sequential improvement. And while the wireline revenue picture is essentially unchanged, we were able to improve our EBITDA margin on sequential basis, coming in more than 20 basis points higher than last quarter at 21%.
We'll talk more about this in a few minutes, but we feel confident that our workforce and other cost reduction efforts have stabilized wireline profitability, and we should continue to see these benefits in the fourth quarter.
In terms of cash generation, we had another outstanding quarter. Our improved business performance and tight controls on capital have resulted in significant increases in free cash flow for the first nine months of the year. And our focus on reducing leverage has improved our key credit metrics and strength in the balance sheet.
I'd also highlight that our Board of Directors approved a 2.6% dividend increase in September, which on an annual basis is an increase from $1.90 to $1.95 a share. This marks the fourth consecutive year of dividend increases. So all in all, we're pleased with our continued strong performance.
Let's now move to a more detailed review of the quarter, starting with some financial highlights on Slide 4.
Reported earnings for the quarter were $0.31 per share. The non-operational charges amounted to $0.25. So you can see that gets us to a $0.56 quarterly result. So we're building solid earnings momentum.
I would point out that we saw about a $0.01 EPS benefit in the third quarter due to a lower effective tax rate post the Frontier spin-off. For the full year 2010, absent any further significant tax law changes, you should expect that the adjusted effective tax rate attributable to Verizon will be in the 31% to 32% range. Consolidated topline growth accelerated to 2.1% year-over-year and drove an 8.3% increase in operating income.
Our adjusted EBITDA margin also expanded 130 basis points to 33.4%. And cash flow continues to be very strong. One addition point on earnings, we are seeing sequential improvement. Slide 5 shows our quarterly earnings on a comparable basis. So our $0.56 per share this quarter is a 7.7% improvement over the second quarter.
Let's spend a few more minutes on cash flow, dividends, capital spending and debt on Slide 6.
Cash flow from operations in the third quarter totaled $8.3 billion and free cash flow was $4.2 billion. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations of $25.2 billion is up 9.1%. And free cash flow of $13.4 billion is up $2.7 billion or 25.3%.
In addition, we received $3.1 billion in cash from the Frontier transaction in early July that we used to reduce debt and a cash distribution of about $440 million from Omnitel this quarter. As I highlighted earlier, our Board approved a dividend increase for the fourth consecutive year, demonstrating their confidence in the strength of our cash flow and balance sheet and our commitment to return cash to shareholders.
In addition, our shareholders received $1.85 per share and value through the Frontier transaction in July. I can assure you that we have adequate dividend coverage based on our cash flow and our capital spending outlook. We have no material funding requirement for our qualified pension plans in 2010. And as is customary, we fund our other post retirement benefit plans on a pay-as-you-go basis out of operating cash flows.
Looking at capital, we spend $4.2 billion during the third quarter which was 4.5% less than a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, total CapEx was $11.8 billion, 4.9% below the first nine months of last year. During the year, we've effectively reallocated capital between our operating segments, reflecting growth opportunities. In wireless, capital spending is higher than last year, driven by 4G LTE deployment and network capacity requirements.
Wireless CapEx totaled $6.2 billion year-to-date which is an increase of $1.1 billion or about 21%. In Wireline, capital spending is down reflecting lower files deployment capital as planned. And our tight focus on spending to increase free cash flow. Wireline CapEx was $5.1 billion year-to-date, a decrease of $1.5 billion or 23%.
Looking ahead, we expect our total capital spending for the year will be at the low end or slightly below our targeted range of $16.8 billion to $17.2 billion for 2010. In terms of the balance sheet, our top priority has been to reduce leverage. We're doing very well here with net debt of $47.8 billion at the end of the third quarter down $12.5 billion or 20.7% since the beginning of the year.
Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio has improved to about 1.4 times, and we expect to be even lower by the end of the year. Let's take a look at our revenue trends which are on Slide 7.
Our overall revenue performance is improving, and we saw an acceleration of growth in the third quarter on a comparable basis. Consolidated quarterly revenue of $26.5 billion were up $550 million or 2.1% from a year ago. Growth was driven by solid performance in all our strategic areas which comprised roughly two-thirds of our total revenue.
We'll get into more detail at the segment level, but we saw an uptick in wireless service revenue growth driven of course by strong data performance. We had a very good quarter in FiOS with year-over-year revenue growth of more than 29%. And growth in strategic enterprises services is accelerating, up nearly 7%.
With that high level summary of revenues, let's move to the segments next, starting with Wireless on Slide 8.
Our Wireless business turned in another very good quarter particularly respect to revenue growth. Total revenue grew to $16.3 billion on the quarter, up $919 million or 6% year-over-year. And growth in total service revenue accelerated to 7.7% in the third quarter, our highest year-over-year growth rate since the second quarter of 2009. Our continued focus on expanding the market for mobile broadband drove data revenue to $5.1 billion this quarter, up 26.3% over last year; that's more than $1 billion of growth in just one year.
We continue to make excellent progress in terms of increasing our smartphone penetration. With 23% of our retail postpaid base with these devices, we feel very good about our current portfolio smartphones and we've build great momentum in a short period of time with Droid franchise. Our recent announcement to begin selling Apple iPads at retail locations is designed to stimulate sales of our MiFi devices which have already become quite popular with customers.
We're performing well in this very competitive marketplace, but as confident we are about our ability to compete today, we are even more excited about the future.
Earlier this month at a CTIA event in San Francisco, Lowell McAdam announced our Phase I 4G LTE launch locations. Our plan is to cover more than 110 million POPs and 38 major metropolitan areas and 62 airports by the end of this year. In the next phase we'll expand coverage to about 200 million POPs over the next 18 months. By the end of 2013, we'll have virtually the same nationwide coverage we have today on 3G.
With wireless data revenue exceeding $5 billion this quarter, it's hard to believe that we're still in the early earnings in terms of this revenue growth opportunity. But we are very excited about mobile broadband, and we believe the growing interest in smartphones, tablets and other devices signals a new wave of growth for the industry.
With the commercial launch of LTE just around the corner, we are extremely well positioned in this expanding market. We firmly believe that our network advantage will become even more of a differentiator for Verizon, given the consistent and substantial investment in our wireless network over many years.
Let's now turn to our customer and connection results on Slide 9. We had a solid quarter of growth, adding about 1 million net new customers and about 250,000 other connections. In the retail postpaid market, we had 584,000 net adds and a strong quarter in terms of device sales. Retail postpaid gross adds in the quarter were up 9.8% sequentially, and device upgrades were also higher.
Our performance in the reseller channel was also very good with 550,000 net adds this quarter. As we've said before, the reseller market continues to be a low-cost channel for us, and an effective way for us to attract incremental prepaid customers. We ended the quarter with 93.2 million total customers, with 88% of the base being retail postpaid, 5% retail prepaid and 7% reseller. In terms of other connections, we had a total of 7.9 million machine-to-machine connections, which include vehicle tracking and telematics.
Let's take a closer look at our retail performance on Slide 10. As you know, our key focus is on the retail postpaid market, where we continue to drive revenue growth by increasing data usage and driving higher smartphone penetration. Retail service revenues in the quarter grew 5% year-over-year. Retail postpaid ARPU increased 2% compared with a year ago, sharply higher than the year-over-year accretion we saw in each of the first two quarters of this year.
As I mentioned a moment ago, we had another strong quarter of overall device sales with about 9.5% of our existing postpaid customers upgrading to a newer device, our highest level since the fourth quarter last year. Our churn metrics, although a bit higher than the second quarter due to seasonality, were excellent once again this quarter. Retail postpaid trend was 1.07% and total churn was 1.36%.
In terms of smartphone sales, we now have 23% of our retail postpaid base with these devices. That's up substantially from last year, and there's plenty of headroom left. About 43% of device sales from our direct channels this quarter were smartphones, taking into account both gross adds and upgrades. And 60% of our existing postpaid customers buying smartphones were new to the category. So this is significant in terms of incremental data revenue for us.
Revenue from web and e-mail services increased to more than 2.7 billion this quarter, up above 43% from a year ago.
Messaging, which makes up about 36% of data revenue is still showing good growth, up 11% on a year-over-year basis. And we've made rapid progress in a relatively short period of time, adding 8.4 million smartphone customers, and increasing data ARPU by 17.6% in the past 12 months. We believe penetration and data ARPU growth could really explode over the next several years, particularly in light of the growth opportunities in front of us with LTE.
In terms of profitability, we had another excellent quarter, generating $6.7 billion of EBITDA, up 11.4% from a year ago. Our third quarter service EBITDA margin was 47.2%, driven by strong data revenues, churn improvement and the continued benefit of Alltel synergies.
Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue achieving both growth and profitability with a focus on gaining share in the retail postpaid market and increasing the penetration of smartphones and other data devices which will drive continued data revenue growth.
Let's move to our Wireline segment on Slide 13. On the consumer side, our broadband and video products continue to drive a significant shift in our revenue mix. FiOS revenue in the quarter grew 29.2% year-over-year, and FiOS ARPU, which now exceeds $146 is up more than 6% over the third quarter last year.
On the enterprise side, we had our second consecutive quarter of sequential revenue improvement in growth and strategic services, which includes security, IP and other managed solutions, continues to transform the revenue mix. In global wholesale, revenues continue to be impacted by the effect of some international price changes on specific groups, which were introduced last quarter to better manage margins.
Let's take a closer look at the consumer and business markets starting on Slide 14. This time last year, FiOS made up about 40% of consumer revenue. At the end of the third quarter, it was up to 50%. The increasing scale of FiOS and the strength of the broadband and video product is driving positive revenue in ARPU growth and mitigating the secular and competitive pressures in this part of the business.
Consumer revenue in the quarter grew 1.1% versus last year. We continue to see strong growth in consumer ARPU, which increased to $86.55 this quarter, up 10.9% from a year ago. As I said earlier, we had strong sequential customer growth, adding about 19% more FiOS customers this quarter to our TV services, and about 17% more to our internet product compared to last quarter.
We ended the third quarter with a total of 3.3 million FiOS TV customers, adding 204,000 compared with the 172,000 in the second quarter. On the broadband side, we added 226,000 new FiOS internet customers, compared with the 193,000 last quarter bringing our total to 3.9 million.
Adding in high speed internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with a total of 8.3 million broadband connections.
Underlying the strong performance is the fact that our FiOS customer satisfaction is very high, and our churn rates are very low. So we're pleased with the progress we are making with FiOS, financially, operationally and competitively.
The good news about our success in penetration increases this quarter is that the improvements are evident throughout our entire FiOS footprint. Our focus has shifted from a geographic expansion mode to a focus on sales mode. Our goal is to increase FiOS penetration in markets where the service is already available and close the gap between homes passed and homes open for sale.
The launch of our nationwide, no contract required, Worry Free Guarantee has helped sales, particularly in the MDU market where apartment dwellers in large urban cities tend to be more (transient) and may be more hesitant to sign two year contracts. And we focused our marketing message to emphasize our product differentiation. This focus on sales and increasing penetration is paying off, and in our more mature FiOS markets we are still seeing consistent penetration gains. Penetration in some of these markets is in excess of 35%, and a few are in excess of 40% penetration.
As you would expect, in our less mature markets we have significantly more room to grow. So we're optimistic about our ability to further increase penetration and continue our growth path over the next several years.
Let's move next to our business markets on Slide 16, which shows our Global Enterprise and Global Wholesale revenue performance.
While revenues in the business market continue to be affected by macroeconomic pressures, we are seeing some signs of stability. Global enterprise revenue of $3.9 billion was up modestly on a sequential basis, and down 0.8% year-over-year, primarily due to foreign currency effects. And while the quarter once again included strong CPE sales, we also saw improvements in revenue from network and solutions-based services.
Strategic services, which now represent about 43% of global enterprise revenue, grew 6.9% year-over-year and 3.1% sequentially. Strategic networking, like Private IP and Ethernet services continue to show steady growth, as do strategic solutions. So again, we are seeing some signs of stabilization, but we are still cautious in our optimism as usage volumes and unemployment figures have not shown any significant change.
In Global Wholesale, revenues declined 10.2% year-over-year and 1.3% sequentially. Domestically, voice revenues continue to be impacted by secular pressures and lower usage volumes.
Internationally, we made a decision earlier this year to increase voice pricing in certain routes which has resulted in some loss of business in this highly competitive market. While the strategy has resulted in revenue declines, is having as a side effect as absolute margins on those routes have improved sequentially.
Let's cover wireline profitability next.
In the third quarter, EBITDA increased by $31 million resulting in a more that 20 basis point sequential improvement in our EBITDA margin to 21%. With total revenue remaining essentially flat sequentially, almost all of the improvement this quarter was once again driven by cost reductions, primarily wage-related savings and third party interconnection cost.
Our workforce reduction initiative is proceeding as planned. Wireline headcount was down 5,900 this quarter and has declined by about 10,500 over the past two quarters. As you know, a majority of these reductions relate to our voluntary separational effort in the East and Mid-Atlantic regions. With about another 1000 volunteers in other regions, we expect another 2000 to 3000 employees will leave our payroll by the end of the year.
In terms of workforce reductions in the third quarter, we estimate the savings to be about $80 million. Partially offsetting these cost savings this quarter were acquisition costs related to higher FiOS customer volumes and some typical seasonal increases, including higher energy cost.
Lastly, in terms of our other cost reduction initiatives, we are focused on capturing additional savings in real estate, network convergence, supply chain and inventory management. We have a well organized and realistic plan, and we are confident in our execution strategy.
To sum up, we had another very solid quarter across the entire business, resulting in improved earnings and solid momentum. To reiterate, we are on track to achieve our goal of growing earnings in the second half of this year by 5% to 10% from our first half adjusted days of $1.10 per share.
Our wireless results were solid across the board. We remain confident in our ability to grow the business by adding new customers, and driving higher smartphone adoption leading to higher postpaid ARPU and improved revenue growth. And with our demonstrated ability to manage our cost, we continue to grow profitably, sustaining a very strong service EBITDA margin even with higher volumes and more upgrades than last quarter.
In our wireline business, even though we're not getting any help from the economy, and we don't expect to for the rest of this year, our cost reduction programs have stabilized wireline profitability, and we are optimistic about our opportunities to expand margins going forward.
As always, we will continue to focus on maximizing free cash flow, maintaining a strong balance sheet and reducing debt. We are excited about our opportunities relating to a launch of 4G LTE services in wireless, and we are certainly very confident in the long term potential of the business.
With that, I'll turn it back to John so that we can get to your questions.

And you all have seen that I have had on these clauses, we believe there is a lot of upside ahead of us and we have great ability to grow postpaid ARPU because of the explosion in smartphones.
We've put a lot of energy, Lowell McAdam, John Stratton, Dan Mead, their team, on enhancing our smartphone portfolio. We've had great success over the last year with the DROID franchise and the Blackberry lineup and others, but we're in a much better position. But the good news here is only 23 % of our customers today have a smart phone. That's up from 20 last quarter.
So you think about this I don't know where it's going to end up, but personally I think we're going to look some day back and say 70% to 80% of your customers are going to have a smart phone.
So we think there is tremendous opportunity here. And you know better than I do, Jason, smart phone customers spend about double what a feature phone customer spends with you.
We also believe on the feature phone side, more and more customers will buy some data plans over time even before as they are getting used to data on the wireless side. That'll start with a plan on a feature phone. So we think there is tremendous opportunity here to grow topline in the wireless business. And you can see that coming through and accelerating revenue growth in the wireless business.
Fran, I'll turn to you on FiOS.

We have made a lot of moves, including the no contract. But we also made a move on the contract where we offer Worry Free Guarantee similar to the wireless side of the house. But if you're not totally satisfied, we will let you out of the contract with no early termination fee.
We also have launched a triple play in the MDU space, understanding that a lot of this space is the younger adult segment, which if you look at the triple play that we have launched is broadband, it's TV and it's wireless rather than a wireline connection. So we found that that's also stimulating some growth in the MDU segment.
When you expand that, the no contract definitely has had a very good growth prospective for us, but we have also launched something new in our enterprise space where we are going to our enterprise customers and very similar to what we do on the wireless side with employee liable accounts, we are signing up enterprise customers to promote our FiOS product within their employee base. So that has also stimulated some growth for us.
So to wrap this up, yes, we feel that this level of ads is where we want to continue to be.

We have not formally announced any change in data pricing, but we will be rolling out a data promotion next week focused on the fourth quarter.
As we think about data pricing here and just to give you a little things to think about as we position this for the future, our aim here is really at expanding the market opportunity. We think there is a huge opportunity to continue to grow. We have a $20 billion annual wireless data business, $5 billion a quarter. It's hard to describe that as early innings, but we still believe it's the early innings of the data explosion. We're very focused at looking at opportunities to expand this opportunity, bring more of our base into data plans.
The other thing to think about here is we believe we have built over time because of what we have done both with network investment, our advertising programs, is superior brand position that allows us to be unique in how we approach the marketplace from a data pricing, unique from what other companies do because of the brand position that we have built over time.
Our fourth quarter promotion that we will have will have really two key elements we will continue to have in unlimited plan, the $29 plan, the $30 plan effectively that is unlimited. But we'll also have a $15 plan. And with the $15 plan, you will be able to get 150 megabits of usage. But what we believe is that people who are new to category will probably buy the $15 plan. But over time, you will see much more migration to the higher end, because there will be a lot of usage that will drive above the 150 megabit. So we think we are in a very good position.
John, we are encouraged by tiered pricing. We like the concept of tiered pricing. You could interpret this a little bit as a move in that direction, although we had $9.99 plan before, but we will continue to look at this and we probably will have some pricing changes when we roll out 4G and 4G pricing. So there will be more to comment.
Fran will now talk about the wireline margin.

I would say that this is a two-pronged strategy.
One is obviously topline growth. And I think that it's important to know that we've reached an inflection point this quarter where FiOS is now 50% of our customer revenue. So as we continue to improve the consumer ARPU 10% this quarter year-over-year, that will drive bottomline growth. I think it's also important to state that on the enterprises side we're seeing stabilization; however, outside the United States, in our global markets, we are seeing double-digit especially in the Asia-Pac region and some other area parts of the world. So again, that is more topline.
But as we get into the cost and productivity and sustainability, as John has spoken in the past, we have an incentive offer for our associates. We had 12,000 associates accept that offer. About 80% of them have left the payroll to date. We will do more of that in the fourth quarter.
But it's also important to know that as we attack the cost side of the wireline business, it's more than just the headcount reductions. It's quarter-to-quarter improvement in our operating metrics, especially when you look at FiOS and our cost-to-connect prim and our cost-to-connect video. If you look at our COA, our COA alone year-over-year has gone down 19%. And with that reduction, we've increased our ad.
So it's a whole program of cost reduction. I believe it's sustainable. And while we are doing that, we're improving our productivity, so that when the economy in the enterprise restores and we continue on the track that we're in FiOS, we will continue to produce more margin.

Wish you all the best for your retirement. You touched on the LTE introduction. Could you help us understand what other impacts there might be in terms of expense recognition or interest capitalization and the things around that?
And as you roll out the LTE from $110 million into the sort of $200 million plus, are we at a steady state level here on Wireless CapEx where you're out of a run rate? Or could there be a reduction or a lower intensity in '11 as the heavylifting for the first 38 markets has already been done?

I talked to Tony Malone as recently as yesterday to get an update on status and all systems are go. The network will be in extremely good shape. From a normal customer acquisition in maintenance and those kinds of things, I think you're going to see the same kind of run rates looking ahead as you have seen, as we've gone through this year.
I don't think you're going to see a major delta at all. In fact, we would argue overtime that there will be more efficiency driven by LTE because the cost of the megabit served is much lower with LTE than it is with EVDO and other technologies. So we think that will position us well. There will be some impact, we have been capitalizing some interest, it's not a huge number. But we will see some impact as we go into 2011, may be a little bit in the fourth quarter, but not a major delta there.
From a CapEx perspective, what I would think about here is, on this call we've said we're going to come in at the low end of our range or slightly below. I think we have a good chance of being slightly below our guidance range on CapEx. You should think Wireless at probably at about the same level next year as it's running this year in that kind of a range.
When you look this year, all of the increase we've had has really been for the most part, both on LTE as well as capacity for data. There had been other offsets; things like synergy capital will be going down. So I think it will be a very controllable level of Wireless CapEx. The nice thing here is the CapEx to revenue ratio in the Wireless business runs quite a bit lower than the Wireline business. And there is a lot of efficiency from that capital. So I think our cash flow numbers should continue to be strong.

And then coming back on the Wireless side, I noticed the replacement rate was around 9.5%, and then smartphones become a larger part of your base, and then hence a larger percent of the replacement volumes.

But as I think about this, and certainly Fran will be talking about this in January. I think the direction of overall CapEx spending, and we've said this in the past, is down from where we are today. I'm not going to quantify that exactly, but if you think about Wireless continuing to run next year at about the same level, I think Wireline will come down. We are coming towards the end of the FiOS build out.
So directionally, I think overall CapEx spending will come down in 2011 from 2010. I think we've had tremendous disappointment within the business around all of our CapEx spending, not only on core network, but on systems and supporting infrastructure. And we've also gotten much more efficient. A portion of our CapEx is labor, it's not just material. And we've gotten more efficient with that. So I think we're in a good position to continue posting very strong cash numbers in free cash flow.
The upgrade level, we're very pleased with the upgrade level that 9.5% of our base upgraded in the quarter. Upgrades are a key focus for us. And as I think about it, upgrades right now are all good, and will be all good for quite a while to come, because a lot of times it's a feature phone customer going to a smartphone customer. I'm willing to take that equipment for us and that subsidy when I'm getting 2x the revenue.
So it's not an issue that we're concerned about, we see it much more as an opportunity in providing upside to us in terms of revenue growth and profitability.

But the message here is, I think we become more efficient with the capital spend, our cost per home passed has been very good. We're very pleased with that and I think overall, I think the direction of CapEx spend will be down as we go into next year.
From a margin perspective, we're very pleased with where we are. FiOS overall, we're very pleased with. We are up, income-positive here. We continue to grow that this quarter, because we ramped up and had more net adds than we had had in previous quarters. That had some impact in terms of the ability to expand the margin in this particular quarter. It is overall accretive to the margins of the overall business. We don't put out specific numbers and we're not going to do that right now, Dave.
But the good news here is, we accelerated penetration with the changes Fran has really led, putting in place. We feel we're in a better position from an acquisition standpoint.

So I guess sort of the question here is, what could cause your margins to take a step backwards as we continue to scale in the data world? Could it be an investment you'd be willing to make in a new device category? Is there something incremental you'd want to do on the network side that you haven't done yet or really sort of sketched out for us yet? Or do you think that you can continue to run at these record levels of EBITDA margins even as you see accelerated usage of your data services?

About the question going to sustainability of our margins in the wireless business, as you know, we're very pleased. Low McAdam whose new President and Chief Operating Officer likes to describe us as an 'and' company not an 'or' company. So it's both growth and profitability, and we've always said that.
The 47.2 is 157 basis points up year-on-year; it's comparable sequentially. We believe that really reflects the superior execution and scale of the ethics that our wireless team has built over several years. We've build tremendous scale in that particular business. We're able to absorb more subsidies and continue to do really a very strong job on margins.
Now a couple of points here I'd make is, this is not a one-trick pony result. If you look at revenue, we have a very nice improving revenue trend in the wireless business. Service revenue in the fourth quarter was up 5%, first quarter 5.8%, second quarter 6.3%, and third quarter 7.7%. And that's only with 23% of our customers having smartphones today.
So we believe as we go through the next several years and we go up that smart phone adoption, we're going to be able to grow revenue, grow profitability. We think our network is very well positioned for the growth in data traffic. We put tremendous time and focus on this, with Lowell and Dan Mead and Tony Malone on making sure we're well-equipped.
Our assumptions assume that our handset lineup that we think is very strong today, where we put all the emphasis on again the Droid franchise. And the Droid franchise is unique to Verizon. It positions us very well; in our handset lineup we'll get better over time. It's not going to take a step backwards; it will continue to be enhanced.
And is it possible we have a quarter where there's a knockout device that has some impact on margins? There's always a possibility of that happening; we've acknowledged that in the past. And that would be a good thing to have happened because of what you would do from a smart phone adoption in your overall ARPU.
Now the other part of this is our wireless team is not only focused on net adds and growth and ARPU, tremendous focus on driving efficiency in the business, they've been working on driving cost out of supply chain. You've seen the tremendous results they've had this year on lowering their inventory level.
At a time you have new product introductions focused on driving cost out of customer service, driving more online interactions, eliminating things like other charges and credit OCCs controlling them, retail store efficiency. So we think the scale we built in that business allows us to continue to have the lead in the industry on margins, and we not going to give that up.

So, Tim, generally, I absolutely think we can accelerate revenue growth from where we are today. I mean I think the wireless business on a service ARPU at 7% can get up in the high single digits and can touch 10% with data growth.
The wireline revenue picture looks a little worse this quarter than it really is. We posted in number of 3.6%, but a major driver on that going a little bit worse from last quarter was, we made some price changes in our International Wholesale business, because we had certain roots out in the world that really weren't driving profitability.
So when you look at our International Wholesale revenue, it was down year-over-year by 28%. If you strip that out, our Wireline revenue was only down 2.4% versus the 3.6% that we reported. And then as you cut under that, Consumer is growing at the rate of 1.1%; we saw a better performance on small business.
Our Enterprise revenue, while it was negative-0.8%. If you break FX out, it was flat. So the underlined trends, even in the Wireline business, are better than, we think the 3.6% number would show. And I think, we believe, we can get the Wireline business, over the next couple of years with some help from the economy, to flat, and may be to slightly growing. And if we do that, that would be very important for the business overall, because Fran talked about it no question.
We still have the lot of ability to drive more and more cost out. But we got to get that business growing again, and we're very focused on that and we think we can. But the Wireless business, there's going to be tremendous opportunity to continue to accelerate the revenue growth on that business.

We're in a very good position from that perspective.
We believe that Verizon dividend is extremely safe. There is not a major tax issue here that I'm worried about that's going to have some impact on this. So we think we are in a good position. Fran and his team has had a lot of focus on trying to make the Wireline business more free cash flow positive. We'll continue to work at that. But our cash flow margin is in a very good position, and you can see it from this quarter. Fran will comment on the FiOS question.

Yes, we continue to migrate some of our former DSL customers into the FiOS broadband. But if you look at our net ads, if you take the internet net ads form our FiOS product less our DSL, we're still on a positive take share perspective.
The other thing to consider too is, is that when you look at the penetration of our internet at 31 and our TV at 27, what we find is once we convert someone over to our FiOS internet product with the speed that we have and the amazement that they get from that, it's very easy for us to then walk in behind that and convert over the TV because we can bundle it and save them money.
So I think that we do have migration from DSL, but we are also taking share.

Thanks for joining us this morning, I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is John Killian, our Chief Financial Officer; and Fran Shammo , who will be assuming the CFO role on November 1.
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future result is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.
As I am sure you are aware, we published, reclassified historical financial information for the past six quarters with results associated with the Frontier transaction as well as the divested Wireless trust properties. In addition we have reclassified prior period Wireless results for the deferred revenue adjustment that we recognized in the second quarter of 2010. The financial and operating metrics included in our slides are therefore presented on a comparable basis. However, on the balance sheets and statements of cash flows, prior periods were not reclassified for the impact of the divested properties.
On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings of $0.31 per share in the third quarter. This quarterly results include a total of $0.25 of nonoperational charges, which are listed on Slide 4. The largest item is a non-cash charge of $0.19 per share relating to the recognition of pension settlement losses resulting from our workforce reduction and separation plan. Pension accounting rules require that settlement losses must be recorded once prescribed payment specials have been reached. In connection with the closing of the Frontier spin-off, we also incurred a charge of $0.04 per share for certain non-operational and transaction related costs. 
The last item is merger integration costs related to Alltel. During the third quarter, charges related to these activities amounted to $0.02 per share. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John Killian."

Before we get into the details, let me start with some comments on our overall performance and add some of my perspectives to our third quarter results. The business is performing extremely well. We had another solid quarter and we continue to execute well in our key focus areas. We had strong earnings performance in the quarter, showing sequential improvement. On our last conference call, I stated that our goal was to grow earnings in the second half of the year by 5% to 10% from our first half adjusted base of $1.01 per share. Our third quarter results indicate that we are on track to meet this goal and expect to be at the high-end of this guidance.
Wireless had a very good quarter with accelerating revenue growth driven by strong postpaid ARPU accretion. New customer additions and device upgrades once again resulted in higher smartphones sales and drove data revenue increases. And we sustained our Wireless EBITDA margin of 47.02% which remains by far the highest in the industry. In Wireline we continue to make steady progress. We had a very strong quarter of customer growth in FiOS with our third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement, adding more than 200,000 new customers in both TV and Internet, our highest net add totals since the second quarter of 2009.
Revenues in global enterprise were stable, showing modest sequential improvement and while the Wireline revenue picture is essentially unchanged, we were able to improve our EBITDA margin on a sequential basis, coming in more than 20 basis points higher than last quarter at 21%. We'll talk more about this in a few minutes but we feel confident that our workforce and other cost reduction efforts have stabilized Wireline profitability and we should continue to see these benefits in the fourth quarter.
In terms of cash generation, we had another outstanding quarter. Our improved business performance and tight controls on capital have resulted in significant increases in free cash flow for the first nine months of the year and our focus on reducing leverage has improved our key credit metrics and strength in the balance sheet. I'd also highlight that our Board of Directors approved a 2.6% dividend increase in September which on an annual basis is an increase from $1.90 to $1.95 a share. This marks the fourth consecutive year of dividend increases. So all in all we're pleased with our continued strong performance. 
Let's now move to our more detailed review of the quarter, starting with some financial highlights on Slide 4.
Reported earnings for the quarter were $0.31 per share. The non-operational charges amounted to $0.25 so you can see that gets us to a $0.56 and quarterly results. So we're building solid earnings momentum. I would point out that we saw about a $0.01 EPS benefit in the third quarter due to a lower effective tax rate close to the Frontier spin-off. For the full year 2010, absent any further significant tax law changes, you should expect that the adjusted effective tax rate attributable to Verizon will be in the 31% to 32% range. Consolidated top line growth accelerated to 2.1% year-over-year and drove an 8.3% increase in operating income. Our adjusted EBITDA margin also expanded 130 basis points to 33.4% and cash flow continues to be very strong.
One additional point on earnings. We are seeing sequential improvement. Slide 5 shows our quarterly earnings on a comparable basis, so our $0.56 per share this quarter is a 7.7% improvement over the second quarter. Let's spend a few more minutes on cash flow, dividends, capital spending and debt on Slide 6. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter totaled $8.3 billion and free cash flow was $4.2 billion. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations of $25.2 billion is up 9.1% and free cash flow of $13.4 billion is up $2.7 billion or 25.3%. 
In addition, we received $3.1 billion in cash from the Frontier transaction in early July that we used to reduce debt and a cash distribution of about $440 million from Omnitel this quarter. As I highlighted earlier, our Board approved a dividend increase for the fourth consecutive year demonstrating their confidence in the strength of our cash flow and balance sheet and our commitment to return cash to shareholders. In addition our shareholders received $1.85 per share and valued through the Frontier transaction in July. I can assure you that we have adequate dividend coverage based on our cash flow and our capital spending outlook. We had no material funding requirement for our qualified pension plans in 2010. And as is customary, we fund our other post-retirement benefit plans on a pay-as-you-go basis out of operating cash flows.
Looking at capital, we spent $4.2 billion during the third quarter, which was 4.5% less than a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, total CapEx was $11.8 billion, 4.9% below the first nine months of last year. During the year we have effectively reallocated capital between our operating segments reflecting growth opportunities. In Wireless, capital spending is higher than last year driven by four 4G LTE deployment and network capacity requirements. 
Wireless CapEx totaled $6.2 billion year-to-date, which is an increase of $1.1 billion or about 21%. In Wireline, capital spending is down reflecting lower FiOS deployment capital as planned and our type focus on spending to increase free cash flow. Wireline CapEx was $5.1 billion year-to-date, a decrease of $1.5 billion or 23%. Looking ahead, we expect that our total capital spending for the year will be at the low end or slightly below our targeted range of $16.8 billion to $17.2 billion for 2010. 
In terms of the balance sheet, a top priority has been to reduce leverage, we're doing very well here with net debt of $47.8 billion at the end of the third quarter, down $12.5 billion or 20.7% since the beginning of the year. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio has improved to about 1.4x and we expect to be even lower by the end of the year.
Let's take a look at our revenue trends which are on Slide 7. Our overall revenue performance is improving and we saw an acceleration of growth in the third quarter on a comparable basis. Consolidated quarterly revenues of $26.5 billion were up by $550 million or 2.1% from a year ago. Growth was driven by solid performance in all our strategic areas which comprised roughly 2/3 of our total revenue. We'll get into more detail at the segment level but we saw an uptick in Wireless service revenue growth driven, of course, by strong data performance. We had a very good quarter in FiOS with year-over-year revenue growth of more than 29% and growth in strategic enterprise services is accelerating up nearly 7%. With that high-level summary of revenues, let's move to the segments next starting Wireless on Slide 8.
Our Wireless business turned in another very good quarter, particularly with respect to revenue growth. Total revenue grew to $16.3 billion in the quarter, up $919 million or 6% year-over-year. And growth in total service revenue accelerated to 7.7% in the third quarter, our highest year-over-year growth rate since the second quarter of 2009. Our continued focus on expanding the market for mobile broadband grow data revenue to $5.1 billion this quarter, up 26.3% over the last year, that's more than $1 billion of growth in just one year. 
We continue to make excellent progress in terms of increasing our smartphone penetration with 23% of our retail postpaid base with these devices. We feel very good about our current portfolio of smart phones and we build great momentum in a short period of time with the Droid franchise. Our recent announcement to begin selling Apple iPads at our retail locations is designed to stimulate sales of our MiFi devices which have already become quite popular with customers. 
We are performing well in this very competitive marketplace but as confident as we are about our ability to compete today, we're even more excited about the future. Earlier this month at a CTIA event in San Francisco, Lowell McAdam announced Phase I 4G LTE launch locations. Our plan is to cover more than 110 million POPs in 38 major metropolitan areas and 62 airports by the end of this year. And the next phase will expand coverage to about 200 million POPs over the next 18 months. 
By the end of 2013, we'll have virtually the same nationwide coverage we have today on 3G. With Wireless data revenue exceeding $5 billion this quarter, it's hard to believe that we're still in the early earnings in terms of this revenue growth opportunity, but we are. We are very excited about mobile broadband and we believe the growing interest in smartphones, tablets and other devices signals a new wave of growth for the industry. With the commercial launch of LTE just around the corner, we are extremely well-positioned in this expanding market. We firmly believe that our network advantage will become even more of a differentiator for Verizon given the consistent and substantial investment in our Wireless network over many years.
Let's now turn to our customer and connections results on Slide 9.  We had a solid quarter of growth, adding about $1 million net new customers and about 250,000 of connections. In the retail postpaid market, we have 584,000 net adds and a strong quarter in terms of device sales. Retail postpaid gross adds in the quarter were up 9.8% sequentially and device upgrades were also higher. 
Our performance in the reseller channel was also very good, with 550,000 net adds this quarter. As we've said before the reseller market continues to be a low-cost channel for us and an effective way for us to attract incremental prepaid customers. We ended the quarter with $93.2 million total customers, with 88% of the base being retail postpaid, 5% retail prepaid and 7% reseller. In terms of other connections, we have a total of 7.9 million machine-to-machine connections which include vehicle tracking and telematics. 
Let's take a closer look at our retail performance on Slide 10.
As you know our key focus is on the retail postpaid market, where we continue to drive revenue growth by increasing data usage and driving higher smartphone penetration. Retail service revenues in the quarter grew 5% year-over-year. Retail postpaid ARPU increased 2% compared with a year ago, sharply higher than the year-over-year accretion we saw in each of the first two quarters of this year. As I mentioned a moment ago, we had another strong quarter of overall device sales of about 9.5% of our existing postpaid customers upgrading to a newer device. Our highest level since the fourth quarter last year. Our churn metrics, although a bit higher than the second quarter due to seasonality, were excellent once again this quarter. Retail postpaid churn was 1.07% and total churn was 1.36%.
In terms of smartphone sales, we now have 23% of our retail postpaid base with these devices, that's up substantially from last year and there's plenty of headroom left. About 43% of device sales from our direct channels this quarter were smartphones, taking into account both gross adds and upgrades. And 60% of our existing postpaid customers buying smartphones were new to the category. So this is significant in terms of incremental data revenue for us.
Revenue from Web and email services increased to more than $2.7 billion this quarter, up about 43% from a year ago. Messaging, which makes up about 36% of data revenue, is still showing good growth, up 11% on a year-over-year basis. And we've made rapid progress in a relatively short period of time adding 8.4 million smartphone customers, an increasing data ARPU by 17.6% in the past 12 months. We believe penetration and data ARPU growth could really explode over the next several years, particularly in light of the growth opportunities in front of us with LTE.
In terms of profitability, we had another excellent quarter, generating $6.7 billion of EBITDA, up 11.4% from a year ago. Our third quarter service EBITDA margin was 47.2%, driven by strong data revenues, churn improvement and the continued benefit of Alltel synergies. Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue achieving both growth and profitability with a focus on gaining share on the retail postpaid market and increasing the penetration of smart phones and other data devices, which will drive continued data revenue growth. 
Let's move to our Wireline segment on Slide 13.
On the consumer side, our of broadband and video products continue to drive a significant shift in our revenue mix. FiOS revenue at the quarter grew 29.2% year-over-year and FiOS ARPU, which now exceeds $146, is up more than 6% over the third quarter last year. On the enterprise side, we had a second consecutive quarter of sequential revenue improvement and growth and strategic services, which includes security, IP and other manage solutions, continues strength on the revenue mix. In global wholesale, revenues continue to be impacted by the effect of some international price changes on specific routes, which we're introduced last quarter to better manage margins.
Let's take a closer look at the consumer and business markets starting on Slide 14.
This time last year FiOS made up about 40% of consumer revenue. At the end of the third quarter it was up to 50%.  The increasing scales of FiOS and the strength of the broadband and video product is driving positive revenue and ARPU growth in mitigating the secular and competitive pressures in this part of the business. 
Consumer revenue in the quarter grew 1.1% versus last year, we continue to see strong growth in consumer ARPU, which increased to $86.55 this quarter, up 10.9% from a year ago. As I've said earlier we have strong sequential customer growth, adding about 19% more FiOS customers this quarter to our TV services and about 17% more to our Internet product compared with last quarter. We ended the third quarter with a total of 3.3 million FiOS TV customers, adding 204,000 compared with the 172,000 in the second quarter. 
On the broadband side, we added 226 sites of new FiOS that connect customers, compared with 193,000 last quarter, bringing our total to 23.9 million. Adding in a high-speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with a total of 8.3 million broadband connections.
Underlying the strong performance is the fact that our FiOS customer satisfaction is very high and our churn rates are very low, so we are pleased with the progress we're making with FiOS, financially, operationally and competitively.
The good news about our success in penetration increases this quarter is that the improvements are evident throughout our entire FiOS footprint. Our focus have shifted from a geographic expansion mode to a focus on sales mode. Our goal is to increase FiOS penetration in markets where the services are already available and close the gap between homes passed and homes open for sale. We went to by nationwide, no contract required, worry-free guarantee has helped sales particularly in the MDU market where our apartment dwellers in large urban cities tend to be more transient and maybe more hesitant to sign two-year contracts, and we focused on marketing message to emphasize our product differentiation. This focus on sales and increasing penetration is paying off. In our more mature FiOS market we're still seeing consistent penetration gains, penetration in some of these markets is an excess of 35% and a few are in excess of 40% penetration. As you expect, in our less mature markets, we have significantly more room to grow. So we're more optimistic about our ability to further increase penetration and continue our growth path over the next several years. 
Let's move next to our business markets on Slide 16 which shows our global enterprise and global wholesale revenue performance. While revenues in the business market continue to be affected by macro economic pressures, we are seeing some signs of. stability. Global enterprise revenue of $3.9 billion was up modestly on a sequential basis and down .8% year-over-year, primarily due to foreign currency effects and while the quarter once again included strong CPE sales, we also saw improvements in revenue from network and solutions-based services. 
Strategic services, which now represent about 43% of global enterprise revenue, grew 6.9% year-over-year and 3.1% sequentially. Strategic networking like Private IP and ethernet services continued to show steady growth as due strategic solutions. So again we are seeing some signs of stabilization but we're still cautious in our optimism as usage volumes and unemployment figures have not shown any significant change. 
In global wholesale revenues declined 10.2% year-over-year and 1.3% sequentially. Domestically voice revenues continue to be impacted by secular pressures and lower usage volumes. Internationally we made a decision earlier this year to increase voice pricing in certain roots which has resulted in some loss of business in the highly competitive market. While the strategy has resulted in revenue declines, it's having the desired effect of absolute margins on most routes have improved sequentially. 
Let's cover Wireline profitability next. In the third quarter, EBITDAR increased by $31 million resulting in a more than 20 basis points sequential improvement in our EBITDA margin to 21%. With total revenue remaining essentially flat sequentially, almost all of the improvement this quarter was once again driven by cost reductions primarily wage related savings and third-party interconnection costs. Our workforce reduction initiative is preceding as planned. Wireline headcount was down 5,900 this quarter and is declined by about 10,500 over the past two quarters. As you know a majority of these reductions relate to our voluntary separation effort in the east and middle Atlantic regions. With about another 1,000 volunteers in other regions, we expect another 2,000 to 3,000 employees will leave our payroll by the end of the year. 
In terms of workforce reductions in the third quarter, we estimate the savings to be about $80 million, partially offsetting these cost savings this quarter were acquisition costs related to higher FiOS customer volumes and some typical seasonal increases including higher energy costs.
Lastly in terms of our other cost reduction initiatives, we are focused on capturing additional savings of real estate, network convergence, supply chain and inventory management. We have a well-organized and realistic plan and we are confident in our execution strategy.
To sum up, we had another very solid quarter across the entire business resulting in improved earnings and solid momentum. To reiterate, we're on track to achieve our goal of growing earnings in the second half of this year by 5% to 10% from our first half adjusted base of $1.01 per share. Our Wireless results were solid across the Board. We remain confident in our ability to grow the business by adding new customers and driving higher smartphone adoption leading to higher postpaid ARPU and improved revenue growth. And with a demonstrated ability to manage our costs, we continue to grow profitably, sustaining a very strong service EBITDA margin, even with higher volumes and more upgrades than last quarter. In our Wireline business, even though we're not getting any help from the economy and we don't expect to for the rest of this year, our cost reduction programs have stabilized Wireline profitability and we are optimistic about our opportunities to expand margins going forward. 
As always, we will continue to focus on maximizing free cash flow, maintaining a strong balance sheet and reducing debt. We are excited about our opportunities relating to our launch of 4G LTE services and Wireless and we're certainly very confident in the long term potential of the business. With that I'll turn it back to John so that we can get to your questions."

We've made a lot of moves including the no contract but we also made a move on the contract where we offer a worry-free guarantee similar to the Wireless side of the house that if you're not totally satisfied, we will let you out of the contract with no early termination fee. We also have launched a what we call a triple play in the MDU space understanding that a lot of this space is the younger adults segment which if you look at the triple play that we've launched, its broadband, its TV and it's Wireless rather than a Wireline connection. So we found that's also stimulating some growth in the MDU segment. When you expand that, the no contract definitely has had a very good growth perspective for us but we've also launched something new in our enterprise space where we're going to our enterprise customers and very similar to what we do on the Wireless side with employee liable accounts, we are signing up enterprise customers to promote our FiOS product within their employee base, so that has also stimulated some growth for us. So to wrap this up, yes, we feel that this level of adds is where we want to continue to be."

Is that a part of your strategy to increase the penetration of smart phones? Is that pricing potentially subject to change once you move to 4G and you potentially see data volumes grow and then secondly on the Wireline margin, it seems like you may have arrested the decline and you starting to see some improvement, sounds like fourth quarter you see some sequential improvement and then is that something that we can see improve from here as we head out? Is there enough cost-cutting opportunity for us to see improvements in 2011?"

I think what you were referring to, John, is some of the blog reports and some of the newspaper stories, we have not formally announced any change in data pricing but we will be rolling out a data promotion next week focused on the fourth quarter. As we think about data pricing here, and just to give you little things to think about as we position this for the future, our aim here is really at expanding the market opportunity. We think there's a huge opportunity to continue to grow, we have a $20 billion annual Wireless data business, $5 billion a quarter. It's hard to describe that as early innings but we still believe it's the early innings of the data explosion. Also we are very focused at looking at opportunities to expand this opportunity, bring more of our base into data plans. The other thing to think about here is we believe we have built over time because of what we've done both with network investment, our advertising programs, a superior brand position that allows us to be unique in how we approach the market place from a data pricing, unique from what other companies do because of the brand position that we have built over time. Our fourth quarter promotion that we will have will have, really two key elements, we will continue to have unlimited plan, the $29 plan, the $30 plan, effectively, that is unlimited. So we'll also have a $15 plan and with the $15 plan you will be able to get 150 megabits of usage. But what we believe is that people who are new to category will probably buy the $15 plan but over time, you'll see much more migration to the higher end because there will be a lot of usage that will drive above the $150 megabits. So we think we're in a very good position. In the past, John, we're encouraged by tiered pricing, we liked the concept of tier pricing, you could interpret this a little bit as they move in that direction although we had the $9.99 plan before but we will continue to look at this and we probably will have some pricing changes when we roll out 4G and 4G pricing so there will be more to come then. And then we'll now talk about the Wireline margin."

We do believe that we can continue to expand the margin and Wireline business. I would say that this is a two-pronged strategy, one is obviously top line growth and I think that it's important to know that we reach an inflection point this quarter where FiOS is now 50% of our consumer revenues, so as we continue to improve the consumer ARPU 10% this quarter year-over-year, that will drive bottom-line growth. I think it's also important to state that on the enterprise side, we've seen stabilization. However, outside the United States, in our global markets we're seeing double-digit growth especially in the Asia Pac region and some other area parts of the world, so again that is more top line. But as we get into the cost and productivity and sustainability. As John has spoken in the past, we had an incentive offer for associates, we had 12,000 associates except that offer, about 80% of them have left the payroll to date. We will do more of that in the fourth quarter but it's also important to know that as we attack the cost side of the Wireline business , it's more than just the headcount reductions, it's quarter to quarter improvement and our operating metrics, especially when you look at FiOS and our cost to connect PRIM and our cost to connect video, if you look at our COA, our COA alone year-over-year has gone down 19% and with that reduction we've increased our adds. So it's a whole program of cost reduction. I believe it's sustainable and while we're doing that, we're improving our productivity so that when the economy and the enterprise restores and we continue on the track that we're in FiOS, we will continue to produce more margin."

We mentioned getting 110 million POPs by the end of this year, I've talked to Tony Malone as recently as yesterday to get an update on status and all systems are go. The network will be in extremely good shape. From a normal customer acquisition and maintenance and  those kinds of things I think you are going to see the same kind of run rates looking ahead as you have seen, as we go into this year. I don't think you are going to see a major delta at all, in fact, we would argue over time that there will be more efficiency driven by LTE because the cost of megabits served is much lower with LTE than it is with EVDO and other technology. So we think that will position us well. There will be some impact from -- we have been capitalizing some interest, it's not a huge number, but we will see some impact as we go into 2011. Maybe a little bit in the fourth quarter but not a major delta there. From a CapEx perspective, what I would think about here is, and on this call we've said we're going to come in at the low end of our range or slightly below, I think we have a good chance of being slightly in below our guidance range on CapEx. You should think Wireless probably at about the same level next year as its running this year, in that kind of a range, when you look this year all of increase we've had has really been for the most part both on LTE as well as capacity for data, there have been other offsets, things like synergy capital will be going down, So I think it'll be a very controllable level of Wireless CapEx. The nice thing here is the CapEx to revenue ratio in the Wireless business runs quite a bit lower than the Wireline business and there is a lot of efficiency from that capital. So I think our cash flow numbers should continue to be strong."

We're not in the position yet to give any guidance on CapEx for next year, but as I think about this, and certainly Fran will be talking about this in January, I think the direction of overall CapEx spending, and we've set this in the past, is down from where we are today. I'm not going to quantify that exactly but if you think about Wireless continuing to run next year at about the same level, I think Wireline will come down, we are coming towards the end of the FiOS buildout. Directionally, I think overall, CapEx spending will come down in 2011 from 2010. I think we had tremendous discipline within the business around all of our CapEx spending, not only on core network but on systems and supporting infrastructure and we've also gotten much more efficient. A portion of our CapEx is labor, its not just material and we've got more efficient with that. So I think we're in a good position to continue posting very strong cash numbers and free cash flow numbers. Now on the upgrade level, we are very pleased with the upgrade level that 9.5% of our base upgraded in the quarter. Upgrades are a key focus for us and as I think about it, upgrades right now are all good, and will be all good for quite a while to come because a lot of times that the feature phone customer go into a smartphone customer. I'm willing to take that equipment to us in that subsidy what I'm getting two extra revenue so it's not an issue that we are concerned about, we're see it much more as an opportunity in providing upside to us in terms of revenue growth and profitability."

The 47.2% is 157 basis points up year-on-year, it's comparable sequentially. We believe that it really reflects the superior execution and scale advantage that our Wireless team has built over several years. We've built tremendous scale in that particular business, we're able to absorb more subsidy and continue to do really a very strong job on margin. Now a couple of pointes here I'd make is, this is a not one trick pony result. If you look at revenue we have a very nice improving revenue trends in the Wireless business. Service revenue in the fourth quarter was up 5%, first quarter 5.8%, second quarter 6.3%, third quarter 7.7% and that's only with 23% of our customers having smartphones today. So we believe as we go through the next several years and we go up that smartphone adoption, we're going to be able to grow revenue, grow profitability. We think our network is very well-positioned for the growth in data traffic, we put tremendous time and focus on this with Llowell and Tony Malone on making sure we're well-equipped. Our assumptions assume that our handset lineup that we think it's very strong today, where we be put all the emphasis on, again the Droid franchise and the Droid franchise is unique to Verizon, positions us very well and our handset lineup will get better over time. It's not going to take a step backwards, it will continue to be enhanced and is it possible we have a quarter where there's a knockout device that has some impact on margins? There's always a possibility of that happening, we've acknowledged that in the past and that would be a good thing to have happened because what you would do from a smartphone adoption in your overall ARPU. Now the other part of this is, our Wireless team not only focused on net adds and growth in ARPU, tremendous focus on driving efficiency in the business. They've been working on driving costs out of supply chain, you've seen the tremendous results they've have this year on lowering their inventory level. At the time you have new product introductions focused on driving costs out of customer service, driving more online interactions, eliminating things like other charges in credits, OCCs controlling them, retail store efficiency. So we think that scale we built from that business allows us to continue to have the lead in the industry on margins and we're not going to give that up."

I think the Wireless business, on a service ARPU at 7% can get up into high single digits and can touch 10% with data growth. The Wireline revenue picture looks a little worse this quarter than it really is. We posted a number of 3.6% but the major driver on that, going a little bit worse from last quarter, was we made some price changes in our international wholesale business because we had certain routes out in the world that really weren't driving profitability. So when you look at our international wholesale revenue, it was down year-over-year by 28%. If you strip that out, our Wireline revenue was only down 2.4% versus the 3.6% that we reported and then as you cut under that, consumer is growing at the rate of 1.1%, we saw a better performance on small business, our enterprise revenue while it was negative .8%, if you break FX out, it was flat so the underlying trends even on the Wireline business are better than we think the 3.6% number would show and I think we believe we can get the Wireline business over the next couple of years with some help from the economy to flat and maybe to slightly growing and if we do that, that would be very important for the business overall because Fran's talked about, there's no question, we still have a lot of ability to drive more and more costs out but we have to get that business growing again and we're very focused on that and we think we can.

Thanks for joining us this morning, I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is John Killian, our Chief Financial Officer; and Fran Shammo, who will be assuming the CFO role on November 1.
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.
As I am sure you are aware, we published reclassified historical financial information for the past six quarters with results associated with the Frontier transaction as well as the divested Wireless trust properties. In addition we have reclassified prior period Wireless results for the deferred revenue adjustment that we recognized in the second quarter of 2010. The financial and operating metrics included in our slides are therefore presented on a comparable basis. However, on the balance sheets and statements of cash flows, prior periods were not reclassified for the impact of the divested properties.
On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings of $0.31 per share in the third quarter. These quarterly results include a total of $0.25 of nonoperational charges, which are listed on Slide 4. The largest item is a non-cash charge of $0.19 per share relating to the recognition of pension settlement losses resulting from our workforce reduction and separation plan. Pension accounting rules require that settlement losses must be recorded once prescribed payment thresholds have been reached. In connection with the closing of the Frontier spin-off, we also incurred a charge of $0.04 per share for certain non-operational and transaction related costs. 
The last item is merger integration costs related to Alltel. During the third quarter, charges related to these activities amounted to $0.02 per share. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John Killian."

Before we get into the details, let me start with some comments on our overall performance and add some of my perspective to our third quarter results. The business is performing extremely well. We had another solid quarter, and we continue to execute well in our key focus areas. We had strong earnings performance in the quarter, showing sequential improvement. On our last conference call, I stated that our goal was to grow earnings in the second half of the year by 5% to 10% from our first half adjusted base of $1.01 per share. Our third quarter results indicate that we are on track to meet this goal and expect to be at the high-end of this guidance.
Wireless had a very good quarter with accelerating revenue growth driven by strong postpaid ARPU accretion. New customer additions and device upgrades once again resulted in higher smartphone sales and drove data revenue increases. And we sustained our Wireless EBITDA margin of 47.2% which remains by far the highest in the industry. In Wireline, we continue to make steady progress. We had a very strong quarter of customer growth in FiOS with our third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement, adding more than 200,000 new customers in both TV and Internet, our highest net add totals since the second quarter of 2009.
Revenues in global enterprise were stable, showing modest sequential improvement and while the Wireline revenue picture is essentially unchanged, we were able to improve our EBITDA margin on a sequential basis, coming in more than 20 basis points higher than last quarter at 21%. We'll talk more about this in a few minutes, but we feel confident that our workforce and other cost reduction efforts have stabilized Wireline profitability, and we should continue to see these benefits in the fourth quarter.
In terms of cash generation, we had another outstanding quarter. Our improved business performance and tight controls on capital have resulted in significant increases in free cash flow for the first nine months of the year and our focus on reducing leverage has improved our key credit metrics and strength in the balance sheet. I'd also highlight that our Board of Directors approved a 2.6% dividend increase in September which on an annual basis is an increase from $1.90 to $1.95 a share. This marks the fourth consecutive year of dividend increases. So all in all we're pleased with our continued strong performance. 
Let's now move to our more detailed review of the quarter, starting with some financial highlights on Slide 4.
Reported earnings for the quarter were $0.31 per share. The non-operational charges amounted to $0.25 so you can see that gets us to a $0.56 quarterly result. So we're building solid earnings momentum. I would point out that we saw about a $0.01 EPS benefit in the third quarter due to a lower effective tax rate post the Frontier spin-off. For the full year 2010, absent any further significant tax law changes, you should expect that the adjusted effective tax rate attributable to Verizon will be in the 31% to 32% range. Consolidated top line growth accelerated to 2.1% year-over-year and drove an 8.3% increase in operating income. Our adjusted EBITDA margin also expanded 130 basis points to 33.4%, and cash flow continues to be very strong.
One additional point on earnings. We are seeing sequential improvement. Slide 5 shows our quarterly earnings on a comparable basis, so our $0.56 per share this quarter is a 7.7% improvement over the second quarter. Let's spend a few more minutes on cash flow, dividends, capital spending and debt on Slide 6. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter totaled $8.3 billion, and free cash flow was $4.2 billion. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations of $25.2 billion is up 9.1%, and free cash flow of $13.4 billion is up $2.7 billion or 25.3%. 
In addition, we received $3.1 billion in cash from the Frontier transaction in early July that we used to reduce debt and a cash distribution of about $440 million from Omnitel this quarter. As I highlighted earlier, our Board approved a dividend increase for the fourth consecutive year demonstrating their confidence in the strength of our cash flow and balance sheet and our commitment to return cash to shareholders. In addition, our shareholders received $1.85 per share in value through the Frontier transaction in July. I can assure you that we have adequate dividend coverage based on our cash flow and our capital spending outlook. We had no material funding requirement for our qualified pension plans in 2010. And as is customary, we fund our other post-retirement benefit plans on a pay-as-you-go basis out of operating cash flows.
Looking at capital, we spent $4.2 billion during the third quarter, which was 4.5% less than a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, total CapEx was $11.8 billion, 4.9% below the first nine months of last year. During the year we have effectively reallocated capital between our operating segments reflecting growth opportunities. In Wireless, capital spending is higher than last year driven by four 4G LTE deployment and network capacity requirements. 
Wireless CapEx totaled $6.2 billion year-to-date, which is an increase of $1.1 billion or about 21%. In Wireline, capital spending is down reflecting lower FiOS deployment capital as planned and our tight focus on spending to increase free cash flow. Wireline CapEx was $5.1 billion year-to-date, a decrease of $1.5 billion or 23%. Looking ahead, we expect that our total capital spending for the year will be at the low end or slightly below our targeted range of $16.8 billion to $17.2 billion for 2010. 
In terms of the balance sheet, a top priority has been to reduce leverage. We're doing very well here with net debt of $47.8 billion at the end of the third quarter, down $12.5 billion or 20.7% since the beginning of the year. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio has improved to about 1.4x, and we expect to be even lower by the end of the year.
Let's take a look at our revenue trends which are on Slide 7. Our overall revenue performance is improving, and we saw an acceleration of growth in the third quarter on a comparable basis. Consolidated quarterly revenues of $26.5 billion were up $550 million or 2.1% from a year ago. Growth was driven by solid performance in all our strategic areas which comprised roughly 2/3 of our total revenue. We'll get into more detail at the segment level, but we saw an uptick in Wireless service revenue growth driven, of course, by strong data performance. We had a very good quarter in FiOS with year-over-year revenue growth of more than 29% and growth in strategic enterprise services is accelerating, up nearly 7%. With that high-level summary of revenues, let's move to the segments next starting Wireless on Slide 8.
Our Wireless business turned in another very good quarter, particularly with respect to revenue growth. Total revenue grew to $16.3 billion in the quarter, up $919 million or 6% year-over-year. And growth in total service revenue accelerated to 7.7% in the third quarter, our highest year-over-year growth rate since the second quarter of 2009. Our continued focus on expanding the market for mobile broadband drove data revenue to $5.1 billion this quarter, up 26.3% over last year. That's more than $1 billion of growth in just one year. 
We continue to make excellent progress in terms of increasing our smartphone penetration with 23% of our retail postpaid base with these devices. We feel very good about our current portfolio of smart phones, and we built great momentum in a short period of time with the Droid franchise. Our recent announcement to begin selling Apple iPads at our retail locations is designed to stimulate sales of our MiFi devices which have already become quite popular with customers. 
We are performing well in this very competitive marketplace but as confident as we are about our ability to compete today, we're even more excited about the future. Earlier this month at a CTIA event in San Francisco, Lowell McAdam announced Phase I 4G LTE launch locations. Our plan is to cover more than 110 million POPs in 38 major metropolitan areas and 62 airports by the end of this year. And the next phase will expand coverage to about 200 million POPs over the next 18 months. 
By the end of 2013, we'll have virtually the same nationwide coverage we have today on 3G. With Wireless data revenue exceeding $5 billion this quarter, it's hard to believe that we're still in the early earnings in terms of this revenue growth opportunity, but we are. We are very excited about mobile broadband, and we believe the growing interest in smartphones, tablets and other devices signals a new wave of growth for the industry. With the commercial launch of LTE just around the corner, we are extremely well-positioned in this expanding market. We firmly believe that our network advantage will become even more of a differentiator for Verizon given the consistent and substantial investment in our Wireless network over many years.
Let's now turn to our customer and connections results on Slide 9.  We had a solid quarter of growth, adding about $1 million net new customers and about 250,000 other connections. In the retail postpaid market, we have 584,000 net adds and a strong quarter in terms of device sales. Retail postpaid gross adds in the quarter were up 9.8% sequentially, and device upgrades were also higher. 
Our performance in the reseller channel was also very good with 550,000 net adds this quarter. As we've said before, the reseller market continues to be a low-cost channel for us and an effective way for us to attract incremental prepaid customers. We ended the quarter with 93.2 million total customers, with 88% of the base being retail postpaid, 5% retail prepaid and 7% reseller. In terms of other connections, we have a total of 7.9 million machine-to-machine connections, which include vehicle tracking and telematics. 
Let's take a closer look at our retail performance on Slide 10.
As you know our key focus is on the retail postpaid market, where we continue to drive revenue growth by increasing data usage and driving higher smartphone penetration. Retail service revenues in the quarter grew 5% year-over-year. Retail postpaid ARPU increased 2% compared with a year ago, sharply higher than the year-over-year accretion we saw in each of the first two quarters of this year. As I mentioned a moment ago, we had another strong quarter of overall device sales of about 9.5% of our existing postpaid customers upgrading to a newer device. Our highest level since the fourth quarter last year. Our churn metrics, although a bit higher than the second quarter due to seasonality, were excellent once again this quarter. Retail postpaid churn was 1.07%, and total churn was 1.36%.
In terms of smartphone sales, we now have 23% of our retail postpaid base with these devices, that's up substantially from last year, and there's plenty of headroom left. About 43% of device sales from our direct channels this quarter were smartphones, taking into account both gross adds and upgrades. And 60% of our existing postpaid customers buying smartphones were new to the category. So this is significant in terms of incremental data revenue for us.
Revenue from Web and email services increased to more than $2.7 billion this quarter, up about 43% from a year ago. Messaging, which makes up about 36% of data revenue, is still showing good growth, up 11% on a year-over-year basis. And we've made rapid progress in a relatively short period of time adding 8.4 million smartphone customers and increasing data ARPU by 17.6% in the past 12 months. We believe penetration and data ARPU growth could really explode over the next several years, particularly in light of the growth opportunities in front of us with LTE.
In terms of profitability, we had another excellent quarter, generating $6.7 billion of EBITDA, up 11.4% from a year ago. Our third quarter service EBITDA margin was 47.2%, driven by strong data revenues, churn improvement and the continued benefit of Alltel synergies. Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue achieving both growth and profitability with a focus on gaining share on the retail postpaid market and increasing the penetration of smart phones and other data devices, which will drive continued data revenue growth. 
Let's move to our Wireline segment on Slide 13.
On the consumer side, our broadband and video products continue to drive a significant shift in our revenue mix. FiOS revenue at the quarter grew 29.2% year-over-year and FiOS ARPU, which now exceeds $146, is up more than 6% over the third quarter last year. On the enterprise side, we had our second consecutive quarter of sequential revenue improvement and growth and strategic services, which includes security, IP and other managed solutions, continues to transform the revenue mix. In global wholesale, revenues continue to be impacted by the effect of some international price changes on specific routes, which were introduced last quarter to better manage margins.
Let's take a closer look at the consumer and business markets starting on Slide 14.
This time last year FiOS made up about 40% of consumer revenue. At the end of the third quarter it was up to 50%.  The increasing scales of FiOS and the strength of the broadband and video product is driving positive revenue and ARPU growth in mitigating the secular and competitive pressures in this part of the business. 
Consumer revenue in the quarter grew 1.1% versus last year. We continue to see strong growth in consumer ARPU, which increased to $86.55 this quarter, up 10.9% from a year ago. As I've said earlier we have strong sequential customer growth, adding about 19% more FiOS customers this quarter to our TV services and about 17% more to our Internet product compared with last quarter. We ended the third quarter with a total of 3.3 million FiOS TV customers, adding 204,000 compared with the 172,000 in the second quarter. 
On the broadband side, we added 226,000 new FiOS Internet customers, compared with 193,000 last quarter, bringing our total to 3.9 million. Adding in high-speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with a total of 8.3 million broadband connections.
Underlying the strong performance is the fact that our FiOS customer satisfaction is very high and our churn rates are very low, so we are pleased with the progress we're making with FiOS, financially, operationally and competitively.
The good news about our success in penetration increases this quarter is that the improvements are evident throughout our entire FiOS footprint. Our focus has shifted from a geographic expansion mode to a focus on sales mode. Our goal is to increase FiOS penetration in markets where the services are already available and close the gap between homes passed and homes open for sale. The launch of our nationwide, no contract required, worry-free guarantee has helped sales particularly in the MDU market where apartment dwellers in large urban cities tend to be more transient and may be more hesitant to sign two-year contracts, and we focused on marketing message to emphasize our product differentiation. This focus on sales and increasing penetration is paying off. In our more mature FiOS market we're still seeing consistent penetration gains. Penetration in some of these markets is an excess of 35% and a few are in excess of 40% penetration. As you would expect, in our less mature markets, we have significantly more room to grow. So we're more optimistic about our ability to further increase penetration and continue our growth path over the next several years. 
Let's move next to our business markets on Slide 16, which shows our global enterprise and global wholesale revenue performance. While revenues in the business market continue to be affected by macro economic pressures, we are seeing some signs of stability. Global enterprise revenue of $3.9 billion was up modestly on a sequential basis and down 0.8% year-over-year, primarily due to foreign currency effects and while the quarter once again included strong CPE sales, we also saw improvements in revenue from network and solutions-based services. 
Strategic services, which now represent about 43% of global enterprise revenue, grew 6.9% year-over-year and 3.1% sequentially. Strategic networking like Private IP and ethernet services continue to show steady growth as do strategic solutions. So again we are seeing some signs of stabilization, but we're still cautious in our optimism as usage volumes and unemployment figures have not shown any significant change. 
In global wholesale revenues declined 10.2% year-over-year and 1.3% sequentially. Domestically voice revenues continue to be impacted by secular pressures and lower usage volumes. Internationally we made a decision earlier this year to increase voice pricing in certain roots which has resulted in some loss of business in the highly competitive market. While the strategy has resulted in revenue declines, it's having the desired effect as absolute margins on those routes have improved sequentially. 
Let's cover Wireline profitability next. In the third quarter, EBITDA increased by $31 million resulting in a more than 20 basis point sequential improvement in our EBITDA margin to 21%. With total revenue remaining essentially flat sequentially, almost all of the improvement this quarter was once again driven by cost reductions primarily wage related savings and third-party interconnection costs. Our workforce reduction initiative is proceeding as planned. Wireline headcount was down 5,900 this quarter and has declined by about 10,500 over the past two quarters. As you know a majority of these reductions relate to our voluntary separation offer in the east and middle Atlantic regions. With about another 1,000 volunteers in other regions, we expect another 2,000 to 3,000 employees will leave our payroll by the end of the year. 
In terms of workforce reductions in the third quarter, we estimate the savings to be about $80 million. Partially offsetting these cost savings this quarter were acquisition costs related to higher FiOS customer volumes and some typical seasonal increases including higher energy costs.
Lastly in terms of our other cost reduction initiatives, we are focused on capturing additional savings of real estate, network convergence, supply chain and inventory management. We have a well-organized and realistic plan, and we are confident in our execution strategy.
To sum up, we had another very solid quarter across the entire business resulting in improved earnings and solid momentum. To reiterate, we're on track to achieve our goal of growing earnings in the second half of this year by 5% to 10% from our first half adjusted base of $1.01 per share. Our Wireless results were solid across the Board. We remain confident in our ability to grow the business by adding new customers and driving higher smartphone adoption leading to higher postpaid ARPU and improved revenue growth. And with a demonstrated ability to manage our costs, we continue to grow profitably, sustaining a very strong service EBITDA margin, even with higher volumes and more upgrades than last quarter. In our Wireline business, even though we're not getting any help from the economy and we don't expect to for the rest of this year, our cost reduction programs have stabilized Wireline profitability, and we are optimistic about our opportunities to expand margins going forward. 
As always, we will continue to focus on maximizing free cash flow, maintaining a strong balance sheet and reducing debt. We are excited about our opportunities relating to our launch of 4G LTE services and Wireless, and we're certainly very confident in the long term potential of the business. With that I'll turn it back to John so that we can get to your questions."

So we think there is tremendous opportunity here, and you know better than I do, Jason, smartphone customers spend about double what a feature phone customer spends with you. We also believe even on the feature phone side, more and more customers will buy data plans over time even before, as they have gotten used to data on the Wireless side, they’ll start with a plan on a feature phones so we think there's tremendous opportunity here to grow top line in the Wireless business and you can see that coming through and accelerating revenue growth in the Wireless business. Fran, I'll turn it to you on FiOS."

If you look at some of the questions you asked, Jason, on the no contract, as John has spoken in the past in the MDU space, we were under penetrated there. We've made a lot of moves including the no contract but we also made a move on the contract where we offer a worry-free guarantee similar to the Wireless side of the house that if you're not totally satisfied, we will let you out of the contract with no early termination fee. We also have launched a what we call a triple play in the MDU space understanding that a lot of this space is the younger adults segment which if you look at the triple play that we've launched, it’s broadband, it’s TV and it's Wireless rather than a Wireline connection. So we found that's also stimulating some growth in the MDU segment. When you expand that, the no contract definitely has had a very good growth perspective for us, but we've also launched something new in our enterprise space where we're going to our enterprise customers and very similar to what we do on the Wireless side with employee liable accounts, we are signing up enterprise customers to promote our FiOS product within their employee base, so that has also stimulated some growth for us. So to wrap this up, yes, we feel that this level of adds is where we want to continue to be."

So I think what you were referring to, John, is some of the blog reports and some of the newspaper stories, we have not formally announced any change in data pricing but we will be rolling out a data promotion next week focused on the fourth quarter. As we think about data pricing here, and just to give you little things to think about as we position this for the future, our aim here is really at expanding the market opportunity. We think there's a huge opportunity to continue to grow, we have a $20 billion annual Wireless data business, $5 billion a quarter. It's hard to describe that as early innings but we still believe it's the early innings of the data explosion. Also we are very focused at looking at opportunities to expand this opportunity, bring more of our base into data plans. The other thing to think about here is we believe we have built over time because of what we've done both with network investment, our advertising programs, a superior brand position that allows us to be unique in how we approach the market place from a data pricing, unique from what other companies do because of the brand position that we have built over time. Our fourth quarter promotion that we will have will have, really, two key elements, we will continue to have an unlimited plan, the $29 plan, the $30 plan, effectively, that is unlimited. So we'll also have a $15 plan and with the $15 plan you will be able to get 150 megabits of usage. But what we believe is that people who are new to category will probably buy the $15 plan but over time, you'll see much more migration to the higher end because there will be a lot of usage that will drive above the $150 megabits. So we think we're in a very good position. In the past, John, we're encouraged by tiered pricing, we liked the concept of tiered pricing, you could interpret this a little bit as a move in that direction although we had the $9.99 plan before but we will continue to look at this and we probably will have some pricing changes when we roll out 4G and 4G pricing so there will be more to come then. And then we'll now talk about the Wireline margin."

We do believe that we can continue to expand the margin and Wireline business. I would say that this is a two-pronged strategy, one is obviously top line growth and I think that it's important to know that we reach an inflection point this quarter where FiOS is now 50% of our consumer revenues, so as we continue to improve the consumer ARPU 10% this quarter year-over-year, that will drive bottom-line growth. I think it's also important to state that on the enterprise side, we've seen stabilization. However, outside the United States, in our global markets we're seeing double-digit growth especially in the Asia Pac region and some other area parts of the world, so again that is more top line. But as we get into the cost and productivity and sustainability. As John has spoken in the past, we had an incentive offer for associates, we had 12,000 associates accept that offer. About 80% of them have left the payroll to date. We will do more of that in the fourth quarter but it's also important to know that as we attack the cost side of the Wireline business , it's more than just the headcount reductions, it's quarter to quarter improvement and our operating metrics, especially when you look at FiOS and our cost to connect PRIM and our cost to connect video, if you look at our COA, our COA alone year-over-year has gone down 19% and with that reduction we've increased our adds. So it's a whole program of cost reduction. I believe it's sustainable and while we're doing that, we're improving our productivity so that when the economy and the enterprise restores and we continue on the track that we're in FiOS, we will continue to produce more margin."

I've talked to Tony Melone as recently as yesterday to get an update on status and all systems are go. The network will be in extremely good shape. From a normal customer acquisition and maintenance and those kinds of things, I think you are going to see the same kind of run rates looking ahead as you have seen, as we’ve gone through this year. I don't think you are going to see a major delta at all, in fact, we would argue over time that there will be more efficiency driven by LTE because the cost of megabits served is much lower with LTE than it is with EVDO and other technology. So we think that will position us well. There will be some impact from -- we have been capitalizing some interest, it's not a huge number, but we will see some impact as we go into 2011. Maybe a little bit in the fourth quarter but not a major delta there. From a CapEx perspective, what I would think about here is, and on this call we've said we're going to come in at the low end of our range or slightly below, I think we have a good chance of being slightly below our guidance range on CapEx. You should think Wireless probably at about the same level next year as it’s running this year, in that kind of a range, when you look this year all of increase we've had has really been for the most part both on LTE as well as capacity for data. There have been other offsets. Things like synergy capital will be going down. So I think it'll be a very controllable level of Wireless CapEx. The nice thing here is the CapEx to revenue ratio in the Wireless business runs quite a bit lower than the Wireline business, and there is a lot of efficiency from that capital. So I think our cash flow numbers should continue to be strong."

We're not in the position yet to give any guidance on CapEx for next year, but as I think about this, and certainly Fran will be talking about this in January, I think the direction of overall CapEx spending, and we've said this in the past, is down from where we are today. I'm not going to quantify that exactly but if you think about Wireless continuing to run next year at about the same level, I think Wireline will come down. We are coming towards the end of the FiOS build-out. Directionally, I think overall, CapEx spending will come down in 2011 from 2010. I think we had tremendous discipline within the business around all of our CapEx spending, not only on core network but on systems and supporting infrastructure and we've also gotten much more efficient. A portion of our CapEx is labor. It’s not just material, and we've got more efficient with that. So I think we're in a good position to continue posting very strong cash numbers and free cash flow numbers. Now on the upgrade level, we are very pleased with the upgrade level that 9.5% of our base upgraded in the quarter. Upgrades are a key focus for us and as I think about it, upgrades right now are all good and will be all good for quite a while to come because a lot of times it’s a feature phone customer go into a smartphone customer. I'm willing to take that equipment cost and that subsidy what I'm getting 2x the revenue. So it's not an issue that we are concerned about.

The 47.2% is 157 basis points up year-on-year. It’s comparable sequentially. We believe that it really reflects the superior execution and scale advantage that our Wireless team has built over several years. We've built tremendous scale in that particular business. We're able to absorb more subsidy and continue to do really a very strong job on margin. Now a couple of points here I'd make is, this is a not one trick pony result. If you look at revenue we have a very nice improving revenue trends in the Wireless business. Service revenue in the fourth quarter was up 5%, first quarter 5.8%, second quarter 6.3%, third quarter 7.7% and that's only with 23% of our customers having smartphones today. So we believe as we go through the next several years and we go up that smartphone adoption, we're going to be able to grow revenue, grow profitability. We think our network is very well-positioned for the growth in data traffic. We put tremendous time and focus on this with Lowell and Dan Mead and Tony Melone on making sure we're well-equipped. Our assumptions assume that our handset lineup that we think is very strong today, where we be put all the emphasis on, again the Droid franchise and the Droid franchise is unique to Verizon, positions us very well and our handset lineup will get better over time. It's not going to take a step backwards. It will continue to be enhanced. And is it possible we have a quarter where there's a knockout device that has some impact on margins? There's always a possibility of that happening. We've acknowledged that in the past and that would be a good thing to have happened because what you would do from a smartphone adoption in your overall ARPU. Now the other part of this is, our Wireless team not only focused on net adds and growth in ARPU, tremendous focus on driving efficiency in the business. They've been working on driving costs out of supply chain. You've seen the tremendous results they've have this year on lowering their inventory level. At the time you have new product introductions focused on driving costs out of customer service, driving more online interactions, eliminating things like other charges in credits, OCCs controlling them, retail store efficiency. So we think that scale we built from that business allows us to continue to have the lead in the industry on margins, and we're not going to give that up."

I think the Wireless business, on a service ARPU at 7% can get up into high single digits and can touch 10% with data growth. The Wireline revenue picture looks a little worse this quarter than it really is. We posted a number of 3.6% but the major driver on that, going a little bit worse from last quarter, was we made some price changes in our international wholesale business because we had certain routes out in the world that really weren't driving profitability. So when you look at our international wholesale revenue, it was down year-over-year by 28%. If you strip that out, our Wireline revenue was only down 2.4% versus the 3.6% that we reported, and then as you cut under that, consumer is growing at the rate of 1.1%, we saw a better performance on small business, our enterprise revenue while it was negative 0.8%, if you break FX out, it was flat, so the underlying trends even on the Wireline business are better than we think the 3.6% number would show. And I think we believe we can get the Wireline business over the next couple of years with some help from the economy to flat and maybe to slightly growing, and if we do that, that would be very important for the business overall because Fran's talked about, there's no question, we still have a lot of ability to drive more and more costs out but we have to get that business growing again, and we're very focused on that, and we think we can.

If cable were to do that, is that something you guys would follow along with, that is a large increase or a material increase in your data pricing?"

Thanks for joining us this morning, I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is John Killian, our Chief Financial Officer; and Fran Shammo , who will be assuming the CFO role on November 1.
Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future result is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.
As I am sure you are aware, we published, reclassified historical financial information for the past six quarters with results associated with the Frontier transaction as well as the divested Wireless trust properties. In addition we have reclassified prior period Wireless results for the deferred revenue adjustment that we recognized in the second quarter of 2010. The financial and operating metrics included in our slides are therefore presented on a comparable basis. However, on the balance sheets and statements of cash flows, prior periods were not reclassified for the impact of the divested properties.
On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings of $0.31 per share in the third quarter. This quarterly results include a total of $0.25 of nonoperational charges, which are listed on Slide 4. The largest item is a non-cash charge of $0.19 per share relating to the recognition of pension settlement losses resulting from our workforce reduction and separation plan. Pension accounting rules require that settlement losses must be recorded once prescribed payment specials have been reached. In connection with the closing of the Frontier spin-off, we also incurred a charge of $0.04 per share for certain non-operational and transaction related costs. 
The last item is merger integration costs related to Alltel. During the third quarter, charges related to these activities amounted to $0.02 per share. With that, I'll now turn the call over to John Killian."

Before we get into the details, let me start with some comments on our overall performance and add some of my perspectives to our third quarter results. The business is performing extremely well. We had another solid quarter and we continue to execute well in our key focus areas. We had strong earnings performance in the quarter, showing sequential improvement. On our last conference call, I stated that our goal was to grow earnings in the second half of the year by 5% to 10% from our first half adjusted base of $1.01 per share. Our third quarter results indicate that we are on track to meet this goal and expect to be at the high-end of this guidance.
Wireless had a very good quarter with accelerating revenue growth driven by strong postpaid ARPU accretion. New customer additions and device upgrades once again resulted in higher smartphones sales and drove data revenue increases. And we sustained our Wireless EBITDA margin of 47.02% which remains by far the highest in the industry. In Wireline we continue to make steady progress. We had a very strong quarter of customer growth in FiOS with our third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement, adding more than 200,000 new customers in both TV and Internet, our highest net add totals since the second quarter of 2009.
Revenues in global enterprise were stable, showing modest sequential improvement and while the Wireline revenue picture is essentially unchanged, we were able to improve our EBITDA margin on a sequential basis, coming in more than 20 basis points higher than last quarter at 21%. We'll talk more about this in a few minutes but we feel confident that our workforce and other cost reduction efforts have stabilized Wireline profitability and we should continue to see these benefits in the fourth quarter.
In terms of cash generation, we had another outstanding quarter. Our improved business performance and tight controls on capital have resulted in significant increases in free cash flow for the first nine months of the year and our focus on reducing leverage has improved our key credit metrics and strength in the balance sheet. I'd also highlight that our Board of Directors approved a 2.6% dividend increase in September which on an annual basis is an increase from $1.90 to $1.95 a share. This marks the fourth consecutive year of dividend increases. So all in all we're pleased with our continued strong performance. 
Let's now move to our more detailed review of the quarter, starting with some financial highlights on Slide 4.
Reported earnings for the quarter were $0.31 per share. The non-operational charges amounted to $0.25 so you can see that gets us to a $0.56 and quarterly results. So we're building solid earnings momentum. I would point out that we saw about a $0.01 EPS benefit in the third quarter due to a lower effective tax rate close to the Frontier spin-off. For the full year 2010, absent any further significant tax law changes, you should expect that the adjusted effective tax rate attributable to Verizon will be in the 31% to 32% range. Consolidated top line growth accelerated to 2.1% year-over-year and drove an 8.3% increase in operating income. Our adjusted EBITDA margin also expanded 130 basis points to 33.4% and cash flow continues to be very strong.
One additional point on earnings. We are seeing sequential improvement. Slide 5 shows our quarterly earnings on a comparable basis, so our $0.56 per share this quarter is a 7.7% improvement over the second quarter. Let's spend a few more minutes on cash flow, dividends, capital spending and debt on Slide 6. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter totaled $8.3 billion and free cash flow was $4.2 billion. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations of $25.2 billion is up 9.1% and free cash flow of $13.4 billion is up $2.7 billion or 25.3%. 
In addition, we received $3.1 billion in cash from the Frontier transaction in early July that we used to reduce debt and a cash distribution of about $440 million from Omnitel this quarter. As I highlighted earlier, our Board approved a dividend increase for the fourth consecutive year demonstrating their confidence in the strength of our cash flow and balance sheet and our commitment to return cash to shareholders. In addition our shareholders received $1.85 per share and valued through the Frontier transaction in July. I can assure you that we have adequate dividend coverage based on our cash flow and our capital spending outlook. We had no material funding requirement for our qualified pension plans in 2010. And as is customary, we fund our other post-retirement benefit plans on a pay-as-you-go basis out of operating cash flows.
Looking at capital, we spent $4.2 billion during the third quarter, which was 4.5% less than a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, total CapEx was $11.8 billion, 4.9% below the first nine months of last year. During the year we have effectively reallocated capital between our operating segments reflecting growth opportunities. In Wireless, capital spending is higher than last year driven by four 4G LTE deployment and network capacity requirements. 
Wireless CapEx totaled $6.2 billion year-to-date, which is an increase of $1.1 billion or about 21%. In Wireline, capital spending is down reflecting lower FiOS deployment capital as planned and our type focus on spending to increase free cash flow. Wireline CapEx was $5.1 billion year-to-date, a decrease of $1.5 billion or 23%. Looking ahead, we expect that our total capital spending for the year will be at the low end or slightly below our targeted range of $16.8 billion to $17.2 billion for 2010. 
In terms of the balance sheet, a top priority has been to reduce leverage, we're doing very well here with net debt of $47.8 billion at the end of the third quarter, down $12.5 billion or 20.7% since the beginning of the year. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio has improved to about 1.4x and we expect to be even lower by the end of the year.
Let's take a look at our revenue trends which are on Slide 7. Our overall revenue performance is improving and we saw an acceleration of growth in the third quarter on a comparable basis. Consolidated quarterly revenues of $26.5 billion were up by $550 million or 2.1% from a year ago. Growth was driven by solid performance in all our strategic areas which comprised roughly 2/3 of our total revenue. We'll get into more detail at the segment level but we saw an uptick in Wireless service revenue growth driven, of course, by strong data performance. We had a very good quarter in FiOS with year-over-year revenue growth of more than 29% and growth in strategic enterprise services is accelerating up nearly 7%. With that high-level summary of revenues, let's move to the segments next starting Wireless on Slide 8.
Our Wireless business turned in another very good quarter, particularly with respect to revenue growth. Total revenue grew to $16.3 billion in the quarter, up $919 million or 6% year-over-year. And growth in total service revenue accelerated to 7.7% in the third quarter, our highest year-over-year growth rate since the second quarter of 2009. Our continued focus on expanding the market for mobile broadband grow data revenue to $5.1 billion this quarter, up 26.3% over the last year, that's more than $1 billion of growth in just one year. 
We continue to make excellent progress in terms of increasing our smartphone penetration with 23% of our retail postpaid base with these devices. We feel very good about our current portfolio of smart phones and we build great momentum in a short period of time with the Droid franchise. Our recent announcement to begin selling Apple iPads at our retail locations is designed to stimulate sales of our MiFi devices which have already become quite popular with customers. 
We are performing well in this very competitive marketplace but as confident as we are about our ability to compete today, we're even more excited about the future. Earlier this month at a CTIA event in San Francisco, Lowell McAdam announced Phase I 4G LTE launch locations. Our plan is to cover more than 110 million POPs in 38 major metropolitan areas and 62 airports by the end of this year. And the next phase will expand coverage to about 200 million POPs over the next 18 months. 
By the end of 2013, we'll have virtually the same nationwide coverage we have today on 3G. With Wireless data revenue exceeding $5 billion this quarter, it's hard to believe that we're still in the early earnings in terms of this revenue growth opportunity, but we are. We are very excited about mobile broadband and we believe the growing interest in smartphones, tablets and other devices signals a new wave of growth for the industry. With the commercial launch of LTE just around the corner, we are extremely well-positioned in this expanding market. We firmly believe that our network advantage will become even more of a differentiator for Verizon given the consistent and substantial investment in our Wireless network over many years.
Let's now turn to our customer and connections results on Slide 9.  We had a solid quarter of growth, adding about $1 million net new customers and about 250,000 of connections. In the retail postpaid market, we have 584,000 net adds and a strong quarter in terms of device sales. Retail postpaid gross adds in the quarter were up 9.8% sequentially and device upgrades were also higher. 
Our performance in the reseller channel was also very good, with 550,000 net adds this quarter. As we've said before the reseller market continues to be a low-cost channel for us and an effective way for us to attract incremental prepaid customers. We ended the quarter with $93.2 million total customers, with 88% of the base being retail postpaid, 5% retail prepaid and 7% reseller. In terms of other connections, we have a total of 7.9 million machine-to-machine connections which include vehicle tracking and telematics. 
Let's take a closer look at our retail performance on Slide 10.
As you know our key focus is on the retail postpaid market, where we continue to drive revenue growth by increasing data usage and driving higher smartphone penetration. Retail service revenues in the quarter grew 5% year-over-year. Retail postpaid ARPU increased 2% compared with a year ago, sharply higher than the year-over-year accretion we saw in each of the first two quarters of this year. As I mentioned a moment ago, we had another strong quarter of overall device sales of about 9.5% of our existing postpaid customers upgrading to a newer device. Our highest level since the fourth quarter last year. Our churn metrics, although a bit higher than the second quarter due to seasonality, were excellent once again this quarter. Retail postpaid churn was 1.07% and total churn was 1.36%.
In terms of smartphone sales, we now have 23% of our retail postpaid base with these devices, that's up substantially from last year and there's plenty of headroom left. About 43% of device sales from our direct channels this quarter were smartphones, taking into account both gross adds and upgrades. And 60% of our existing postpaid customers buying smartphones were new to the category. So this is significant in terms of incremental data revenue for us.
Revenue from Web and email services increased to more than $2.7 billion this quarter, up about 43% from a year ago. Messaging, which makes up about 36% of data revenue, is still showing good growth, up 11% on a year-over-year basis. And we've made rapid progress in a relatively short period of time adding 8.4 million smartphone customers, an increasing data ARPU by 17.6% in the past 12 months. We believe penetration and data ARPU growth could really explode over the next several years, particularly in light of the growth opportunities in front of us with LTE.
In terms of profitability, we had another excellent quarter, generating $6.7 billion of EBITDA, up 11.4% from a year ago. Our third quarter service EBITDA margin was 47.2%, driven by strong data revenues, churn improvement and the continued benefit of Alltel synergies. Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue achieving both growth and profitability with a focus on gaining share on the retail postpaid market and increasing the penetration of smart phones and other data devices, which will drive continued data revenue growth. 
Let's move to our Wireline segment on Slide 13.
On the consumer side, our of broadband and video products continue to drive a significant shift in our revenue mix. FiOS revenue at the quarter grew 29.2% year-over-year and FiOS ARPU, which now exceeds $146, is up more than 6% over the third quarter last year. On the enterprise side, we had a second consecutive quarter of sequential revenue improvement and growth and strategic services, which includes security, IP and other manage solutions, continues strength on the revenue mix. In global wholesale, revenues continue to be impacted by the effect of some international price changes on specific routes, which we're introduced last quarter to better manage margins.
Let's take a closer look at the consumer and business markets starting on Slide 14.
This time last year FiOS made up about 40% of consumer revenue. At the end of the third quarter it was up to 50%.  The increasing scales of FiOS and the strength of the broadband and video product is driving positive revenue and ARPU growth in mitigating the secular and competitive pressures in this part of the business. 
Consumer revenue in the quarter grew 1.1% versus last year, we continue to see strong growth in consumer ARPU, which increased to $86.55 this quarter, up 10.9% from a year ago. As I've said earlier we have strong sequential customer growth, adding about 19% more FiOS customers this quarter to our TV services and about 17% more to our Internet product compared with last quarter. We ended the third quarter with a total of 3.3 million FiOS TV customers, adding 204,000 compared with the 172,000 in the second quarter. 
On the broadband side, we added 226 sites of new FiOS that connect customers, compared with 193,000 last quarter, bringing our total to 23.9 million. Adding in a high-speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with a total of 8.3 million broadband connections.
Underlying the strong performance is the fact that our FiOS customer satisfaction is very high and our churn rates are very low, so we are pleased with the progress we're making with FiOS, financially, operationally and competitively.
The good news about our success in penetration increases this quarter is that the improvements are evident throughout our entire FiOS footprint. Our focus have shifted from a geographic expansion mode to a focus on sales mode. Our goal is to increase FiOS penetration in markets where the services are already available and close the gap between homes passed and homes open for sale. We went to by nationwide, no contract required, worry-free guarantee has helped sales particularly in the MDU market where our apartment dwellers in large urban cities tend to be more transient and maybe more hesitant to sign two-year contracts, and we focused on marketing message to emphasize our product differentiation. This focus on sales and increasing penetration is paying off. In our more mature FiOS market we're still seeing consistent penetration gains, penetration in some of these markets is an excess of 35% and a few are in excess of 40% penetration. As you expect, in our less mature markets, we have significantly more room to grow. So we're more optimistic about our ability to further increase penetration and continue our growth path over the next several years. 
Let's move next to our business markets on Slide 16 which shows our global enterprise and global wholesale revenue performance. While revenues in the business market continue to be affected by macro economic pressures, we are seeing some signs of. stability. Global enterprise revenue of $3.9 billion was up modestly on a sequential basis and down .8% year-over-year, primarily due to foreign currency effects and while the quarter once again included strong CPE sales, we also saw improvements in revenue from network and solutions-based services. 
Strategic services, which now represent about 43% of global enterprise revenue, grew 6.9% year-over-year and 3.1% sequentially. Strategic networking like Private IP and ethernet services continued to show steady growth as due strategic solutions. So again we are seeing some signs of stabilization but we're still cautious in our optimism as usage volumes and unemployment figures have not shown any significant change. 
In global wholesale revenues declined 10.2% year-over-year and 1.3% sequentially. Domestically voice revenues continue to be impacted by secular pressures and lower usage volumes. Internationally we made a decision earlier this year to increase voice pricing in certain roots which has resulted in some loss of business in the highly competitive market. While the strategy has resulted in revenue declines, it's having the desired effect of absolute margins on most routes have improved sequentially. 
Let's cover Wireline profitability next. In the third quarter, EBITDAR increased by $31 million resulting in a more than 20 basis points sequential improvement in our EBITDA margin to 21%. With total revenue remaining essentially flat sequentially, almost all of the improvement this quarter was once again driven by cost reductions primarily wage related savings and third-party interconnection costs. Our workforce reduction initiative is preceding as planned. Wireline headcount was down 5,900 this quarter and is declined by about 10,500 over the past two quarters. As you know a majority of these reductions relate to our voluntary separation effort in the east and middle Atlantic regions. With about another 1,000 volunteers in other regions, we expect another 2,000 to 3,000 employees will leave our payroll by the end of the year. 
In terms of workforce reductions in the third quarter, we estimate the savings to be about $80 million, partially offsetting these cost savings this quarter were acquisition costs related to higher FiOS customer volumes and some typical seasonal increases including higher energy costs.
Lastly in terms of our other cost reduction initiatives, we are focused on capturing additional savings of real estate, network convergence, supply chain and inventory management. We have a well-organized and realistic plan and we are confident in our execution strategy.
To sum up, we had another very solid quarter across the entire business resulting in improved earnings and solid momentum. To reiterate, we're on track to achieve our goal of growing earnings in the second half of this year by 5% to 10% from our first half adjusted base of $1.01 per share. Our Wireless results were solid across the Board. We remain confident in our ability to grow the business by adding new customers and driving higher smartphone adoption leading to higher postpaid ARPU and improved revenue growth. And with a demonstrated ability to manage our costs, we continue to grow profitably, sustaining a very strong service EBITDA margin, even with higher volumes and more upgrades than last quarter. In our Wireline business, even though we're not getting any help from the economy and we don't expect to for the rest of this year, our cost reduction programs have stabilized Wireline profitability and we are optimistic about our opportunities to expand margins going forward. 
As always, we will continue to focus on maximizing free cash flow, maintaining a strong balance sheet and reducing debt. We are excited about our opportunities relating to our launch of 4G LTE services and Wireless and we're certainly very confident in the long term potential of the business. With that I'll turn it back to John so that we can get to your questions."

When you look at our postpaid ARPU this quarter we were up 2% in the third quarter, if you look at the last four quarters, fourth quarter '09, we were flat, we went to .6%, in the first quarter we went to 1.5%. It may seem that I've had on these clauses, we believe there's a lot of upside ahead of us and we have great ability to grow postpaid ARPU because of the explosion in smartphones. We've put a lot of energy, Lowell McAdam, John Stratton, Denby and their team on enhancing our smartphone portfolio. We've had great success over the last year with the Droid franchise and the BlackBerry lineup and others but we are in a much better position. But the good news here is, only 23% of our customers today have a smartphone, that's up from 20 last quarter. So you think about this, I don't know where it's going to end up but personally I think, we're going to look someday back and say 70% to 80% of your customers are going to have smartphones. So we think there is tremendous opportunity here and you know better than I do, Jason, smartphone customers spend about double what a feature phone customer spends with you. We also believe even on the feature phone side, more and more customers will buy data plans over time even before, as they have gotten used to data on the Wireless side, so start with a plan on a feature phones so we think there's tremendous opportunity here to grow top line in the Wireless business and you can see that coming through an accelerating revenue growth in the Wireless business. Fran, I'll turn it to you on FiOS."

If you look at some of the questions you asked, Jason, on the no contract, as John has spoken in the past in the MDU space, we were under penetrated there. We've made a lot of moves including the no contract but we also made a move on the contract where we offer a worry-free guarantee similar to the Wireless side of the house that if you're not totally satisfied, we will let you out of the contract with no early termination fee. We also have launched a what we call a triple play in the MDU space understanding that a lot of this space is the younger adults segment which if you look at the triple play that we've launched, its broadband, its TV and it's Wireless rather than a Wireline connection. So we found that's also stimulating some growth in the MDU segment. When you expand that, the no contract definitely has had a very good growth perspective for us but we've also launched something new in our enterprise space where we're going to our enterprise customers and very similar to what we do on the Wireless side with employee liable accounts, we are signing up enterprise customers to promote our FiOS product within their employee base, so that has also stimulated some growth for us. So to wrap this up, yes, we feel that this level of adds is where we want to continue to be."

Is that a part of your strategy to increase the penetration of smart phones? Is that pricing potentially subject to change once you move to 4G and you potentially see data volumes grow and then secondly on the Wireline margin, it seems like you may have arrested the decline and you starting to see some improvement, sounds like fourth quarter you see some sequential improvement and then is that something that we can see improve from here as we head out? Is there enough cost-cutting opportunity for us to see improvements in 2011?"

I think what you were referring to, John, is some of the blog reports and some of the newspaper stories, we have not formally announced any change in data pricing but we will be rolling out a data promotion next week focused on the fourth quarter. As we think about data pricing here, and just to give you little things to think about as we position this for the future, our aim here is really at expanding the market opportunity. We think there's a huge opportunity to continue to grow, we have a $20 billion annual Wireless data business, $5 billion a quarter. It's hard to describe that as early innings but we still believe it's the early innings of the data explosion. Also we are very focused at looking at opportunities to expand this opportunity, bring more of our base into data plans. The other thing to think about here is we believe we have built over time because of what we've done both with network investment, our advertising programs, a superior brand position that allows us to be unique in how we approach the market place from a data pricing, unique from what other companies do because of the brand position that we have built over time. Our fourth quarter promotion that we will have will have, really two key elements, we will continue to have unlimited plan, the $29 plan, the $30 plan, effectively, that is unlimited. So we'll also have a $15 plan and with the $15 plan you will be able to get 150 megabits of usage. But what we believe is that people who are new to category will probably buy the $15 plan but over time, you'll see much more migration to the higher end because there will be a lot of usage that will drive above the $150 megabits. So we think we're in a very good position. In the past, John, we're encouraged by tiered pricing, we liked the concept of tier pricing, you could interpret this a little bit as they move in that direction although we had the $9.99 plan before but we will continue to look at this and we probably will have some pricing changes when we roll out 4G and 4G pricing so there will be more to come then. And then we'll now talk about the Wireline margin."

We do believe that we can continue to expand the margin and Wireline business. I would say that this is a two-pronged strategy, one is obviously top line growth and I think that it's important to know that we reach an inflection point this quarter where FiOS is now 50% of our consumer revenues, so as we continue to improve the consumer ARPU 10% this quarter year-over-year, that will drive bottom-line growth. I think it's also important to state that on the enterprise side, we've seen stabilization. However, outside the United States, in our global markets we're seeing double-digit growth especially in the Asia Pac region and some other area parts of the world, so again that is more top line. But as we get into the cost and productivity and sustainability. As John has spoken in the past, we had an incentive offer for associates, we had 12,000 associates except that offer, about 80% of them have left the payroll to date. We will do more of that in the fourth quarter but it's also important to know that as we attack the cost side of the Wireline business , it's more than just the headcount reductions, it's quarter to quarter improvement and our operating metrics, especially when you look at FiOS and our cost to connect PRIM and our cost to connect video, if you look at our COA, our COA alone year-over-year has gone down 19% and with that reduction we've increased our adds. So it's a whole program of cost reduction. I believe it's sustainable and while we're doing that, we're improving our productivity so that when the economy and the enterprise restores and we continue on the track that we're in FiOS, we will continue to produce more margin."

We mentioned getting 110 million POPs by the end of this year, I've talked to Tony Malone as recently as yesterday to get an update on status and all systems are go. The network will be in extremely good shape. From a normal customer acquisition and maintenance and  those kinds of things I think you are going to see the same kind of run rates looking ahead as you have seen, as we go into this year. I don't think you are going to see a major delta at all, in fact, we would argue over time that there will be more efficiency driven by LTE because the cost of megabits served is much lower with LTE than it is with EVDO and other technology. So we think that will position us well. There will be some impact from -- we have been capitalizing some interest, it's not a huge number, but we will see some impact as we go into 2011. Maybe a little bit in the fourth quarter but not a major delta there. From a CapEx perspective, what I would think about here is, and on this call we've said we're going to come in at the low end of our range or slightly below, I think we have a good chance of being slightly in below our guidance range on CapEx. You should think Wireless probably at about the same level next year as its running this year, in that kind of a range, when you look this year all of increase we've had has really been for the most part both on LTE as well as capacity for data, there have been other offsets, things like synergy capital will be going down, So I think it'll be a very controllable level of Wireless CapEx. The nice thing here is the CapEx to revenue ratio in the Wireless business runs quite a bit lower than the Wireline business and there is a lot of efficiency from that capital. So I think our cash flow numbers should continue to be strong."

We're not in the position yet to give any guidance on CapEx for next year, but as I think about this, and certainly Fran will be talking about this in January, I think the direction of overall CapEx spending, and we've set this in the past, is down from where we are today. I'm not going to quantify that exactly but if you think about Wireless continuing to run next year at about the same level, I think Wireline will come down, we are coming towards the end of the FiOS buildout. Directionally, I think overall, CapEx spending will come down in 2011 from 2010. I think we had tremendous discipline within the business around all of our CapEx spending, not only on core network but on systems and supporting infrastructure and we've also gotten much more efficient. A portion of our CapEx is labor, its not just material and we've got more efficient with that. So I think we're in a good position to continue posting very strong cash numbers and free cash flow numbers. Now on the upgrade level, we are very pleased with the upgrade level that 9.5% of our base upgraded in the quarter.

I'm willing to take that equipment to us in that subsidy what I'm getting two extra revenue so it's not an issue that we are concerned about, we're see it much more as an opportunity in providing upside to us in terms of revenue growth and profitability."

The 47.2% is 157 basis points up year-on-year, it's comparable sequentially. We believe that it really reflects the superior execution and scale advantage that our Wireless team has built over several years. We've built tremendous scale in that particular business, we're able to absorb more subsidy and continue to do really a very strong job on margin. Now a couple of pointes here I'd make is, this is a not one trick pony result. If you look at revenue we have a very nice improving revenue trends in the Wireless business. Service revenue in the fourth quarter was up 5%, first quarter 5.8%, second quarter 6.3%, third quarter 7.7% and that's only with 23% of our customers having smartphones today. So we believe as we go through the next several years and we go up that smartphone adoption, we're going to be able to grow revenue, grow profitability. We think our network is very well-positioned for the growth in data traffic, we put tremendous time and focus on this with Llowell and Tony Malone on making sure we're well-equipped. Our assumptions assume that our handset lineup that we think it's very strong today, where we be put all the emphasis on, again the Droid franchise and the Droid franchise is unique to Verizon, positions us very well and our handset lineup will get better over time. It's not going to take a step backwards, it will continue to be enhanced and is it possible we have a quarter where there's a knockout device that has some impact on margins? There's always a possibility of that happening, we've acknowledged that in the past and that would be a good thing to have happened because what you would do from a smartphone adoption in your overall ARPU. Now the other part of this is, our Wireless team not only focused on net adds and growth in ARPU, tremendous focus on driving efficiency in the business. They've been working on driving costs out of supply chain, you've seen the tremendous results they've have this year on lowering their inventory level. At the time you have new product introductions focused on driving costs out of customer service, driving more online interactions, eliminating things like other charges in credits, OCCs controlling them, retail store efficiency. So we think that scale we built from that business allows us to continue to have the lead in the industry on margins and we're not going to give that up."

I think the Wireless business, on a service ARPU at 7% can get up into high single digits and can touch 10% with data growth. The Wireline revenue picture looks a little worse this quarter than it really is. We posted a number of 3.6% but the major driver on that, going a little bit worse from last quarter, was we made some price changes in our international wholesale business because we had certain routes out in the world that really weren't driving profitability. So when you look at our international wholesale revenue, it was down year-over-year by 28%. If you strip that out, our Wireline revenue was only down 2.4% versus the 3.6% that we reported and then as you cut under that, consumer is growing at the rate of 1.1%, we saw a better performance on small business, our enterprise revenue while it was negative .8%, if you break FX out, it was flat so the underlying trends even on the Wireline business are better than we think the 3.6% number would show and I think we believe we can get the Wireline business over the next couple of years with some help from the economy to flat and maybe to slightly growing and if we do that, that would be very important for the business overall because Fran's talked about, there's no question, we still have a lot of ability to drive more and more costs out but we have to get that business growing again and we're very focused on that and we think we can. But the Wireless business is going to be tremendous opportunity to continue to accelerate revenue growth in that business."

We think we have a great device lineup. With the Droid franchise has gone from nothing a year ago to where it really has a buzz and a lot of momentum out in the marketplace right now, from a pricing perspective we think the brand that we have build puts us in a unique position from a pricing perspective. We've always been bit of the premium and we think the brand will allow us to continue to do that."

My question is really there's been a lot of back-and-forth there, have you begun to see anything so far in the fourth quarter that indicate the cable companies are getting more aggressive either on their video and their data pricing? And additionally, there were some comments made actually in the New York Post recently that are cables considering a massive increase or a material increase in their high-speed data prices to offset some of this over-the-top video that may be going on. If cable were to do that, is that something you guys would follow along with, that is a large increase or a material increase in your data pricing?"

I wouldn't say we've seen anything recently that changes the competitive landscape from an offer or a price perspective with the changes that Fran has led for us on the worry-free guarantee, the no contract, the focus on the MDU, we think we're in a very good position. We haven't planned any price changes here at this point in time, we would always continue to look at what's happening in the competitive landscape. We think our FiOS offering from based on the fiber end-to-end is a superior offering from a quality standpoint and we've been focused very much on acquisition and getting people to move, so we would continue to evaluate back end look at what the opportunity is to accelerate revenue growth."

The material portion in the past has been -- people being switched from DSL to FiOS is that continuing? And is the mix changing in terms of DSL switches versus people coming from cable? And secondly on the capital structure side, if you're looking at dividend in cash up from Verizon Wireless, how much of a buffer do you have in terms of realized and tax proportional profits of Verizon Communications that haven't actually represented cash dividend apart from Wireless, so in other words how much could dividend up from VZW before you start to actually have to pay tax, incremental tax on those payments?"

Yes, we continue to migrate some of our former DSL customers into the FiOS broadband but if you look at our net adds, if you take the Internet net adds from FiOS product less our DSL, we're still on a positive pay share perspective. The other thing to consider, too, is that when you look at the penetration of our Internet at 31 and our TV at 27, what we find is once we convert someone over to our FiOS Internet product with the speed that we have and the amazement that they get from that, it's very easy for us to then walk in behind that and convert over the TV because we can bundle it and save them money. So I think, we do have migration from DSL but we're also taking share."
