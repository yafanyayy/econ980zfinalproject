Please turn to Slide #3. For the quarter, sales decreased 1% versus prior year. This decline was primarily the result of significantly lower natural gas prices, which reduced our contractual pass-through of energy-related costs, lowering sales by 7%. Partially offsetting this was favorable currency translation, with the weaker dollar increasing sales by 4%. Underlying sales increased 2% year-on-year due to higher volumes in our Tonnage and Electronics and Performance Materials segments.Volume performance in our Merchant segment was mixed, with year-over-year gains in Asia being offset by slower economic recoveries in both the U.S. and Europe. Sequentially, sales increased 2% on higher cost pass-through. Underlying sales were down 1% on seasonality and lower Equipment and Energy sales. Operating income of $345 million increased 20% from prior year, primarily due to higher volumes, productivity and favorable currency and our operating margin of 15.9% improved by 280 basis points versus last year due to higher volumes and productivity. This significant improvement in margin in light of the modest underlying gains in sales represents of the hard work that our team has done in all aspects of our costs. We are delivering improved efficiencies in energy utilization, operating and maintenance costs and our selling and G&A costs. These are substantial savings that we can sustain and will continue to improve upon as volumes recover.For the quarter, net income increased 22% and diluted earnings per share increased by 20% each versus prior year. Return on capital employed improved sequentially. On an instantaneous basis, we have improved ROCE to 11.7%. Before I move on, just a couple of brief comments on some other items in our financial statements. Other income on our consolidated P&L was $8 million higher compared to last year, primarily due to large foreign exchange losses last year. And on the cash flow statement, our operating cash flow was impacted by $256 million in cash contributions to our pension plans. This shows up as a use of cash in payables and accrued liabilities this quarter, and is a timing issue which should even out through the rest of the fiscal year. For the entire year, we still anticipate making cash contributions of approximately $360 million. Now turning to Slide 4, for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share increased by $0.19. Higher volumes in Tonnage and Electronics and Performance Materials helped to increase earnings per share by $0.12 year on year. Pricing and energy in raw materials together were unfavorable subtracting $0.05. Cost were $0.06 favorable, reflecting our cost improvement efforts. The favorable impact to operating income from currency translation and foreign exchange was $0.07.Equity affiliated income was up $0.01. Interest expense declined on lower rates adding $0.02, a slightly higher tax rate this year cost us $0.01 and higher shares outstanding subtracted about $0.03. All in all, 20% earnings growth this quarter is a solid start to our new fiscal year despite a slow economic recovery. We are delivering the improvements we told you about from our new investments and our cost reduction efforts. Now I'll turn the call over to Nelson to review our business segment results. Nelson?"

Underlying sales declined 5%, with volumes down 5% and pricing flat. Currency increased sales by 6% versus prior quarter, sales were flat. Merchant Gases operating income of $190 million was up 11% versus prior year and up 14% sequentially.Segment operating margin of 20.3% was up 190 basis points versus prior year and 250 basis points sequentially, reflecting strong cost performance. We saw the benefits of our global cost actions from our workforce reduction, distribution efficiency and reduced plant operating costs, which in total, more than offset the decline in volume and grew margins. Loadings were flat in North America and Europe versus prior quarter and continued to improve in Asia. Signings are off to a good start in all regions. Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 6.In North America, sales fell 11% versus prior year. Sales in the first two months of the prior-year quarter were relatively strong and this yielded a tougher comparison this year. Volumes were down 9% versus prior year, with pricing down 2%. Pricing was impacted by lower surcharge activity and lower liquid hydrogen pricing, as a result of lower natural gas costs. In Europe, sales increased 6% versus prior year. Underlying sales declined 3% with volumes down 4% and pricing adding 1%. Currency increased sales by 9%. Sales were impacted by the weak manufacturing environment but continued to be helped by pricing and increased healthcare volumes. In Asia, Merchant sales were up 13% versus last year. Underlying sales increased 8% with volumes up 11% and pricing down 3%. Currency increased sales by 5%. Volumes continued to improve across Asia, driven by steel and electronics customers. China volumes in particular were up 30% versus prior year. The price decline in Asia is principally in Argonne where last year's prices were higher due to tight supply.Please turn to Slide 7, Tonnage Gases. Sales of $698 million decreased 6% compared to last year. Volumes were up 11%. Energy and raw material pass-through decreased sales by 21% and currency increased sales by 4%. The higher volumes reflect the continuing improvement in steel and chemical end markets, as well as new plant onstreams.Sequentially, sales were up 9%, mainly due to energy and raw material pass-through. Operating income of $100 million was down 8% versus prior year and 5% sequentially, primarily due to higher maintenance spending and lower operating efficiencies. Operating margin of 14.4% decreased versus prior year and sequentially, also due to higher maintenance spending. We announced new world scale hydrogen plants for our pipeline networks in Louisiana and Rotterdam and also announced the major upgrade and expansion of our La Porte, Texas air separation facility during the quarter.Please turn to Slide 8, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $433 million were up 7% compared to last year. Volumes increased 11%. Pricing reduced sales by 6% and currency was 2% higher. Electronic sales were down 2% compared to last year and were flat sequentially. Sales in the quarter were impacted by lower prices and lower services and equipment sales. Electronics specialty materials sales increased 8% versus prior year and 4% sequentially. Tonnage sales were unchanged versus prior year. Performance Materials sales increased 18% versus last year and were flat sequentially, reflecting stronger Asian sales and less seasonal decline than in previous years.Segment operating income of $48 million was up 97% versus prior year, which resulted in significant improvement in margins. Sequential margins were essentially flat, reflecting lower pricing and ongoing restructuring costs. We now expect millions of square inches of silicon to grow 20% to 25% in our fiscal year and still expect the Electronics Equipment business to rebound in the second half.Please turn to Slide 9, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $109 million decreased 9% versus last year. Operating income of $8 million increased versus prior year, due to lower energy development spending, which was partially offset by restructuring costs to close a European manufacturing facility. We just announced last night a major order for three LNG heat exchangers in support of the Gorgon project in Australia. Reflecting this order, our backlog in this segment improved to $327 million. We continue to work on other projects and expect additional award activity this year.Now, I'll turn the call back over to Paul."

Our guidance for Quarter 2 is for earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.20 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earning sequentially from the following areas. We expect the manufacturing economy globally to continue its gradual recovery. New plant onstreams, including a full quarter impact of our hydrogen plant to serve Marathon in Garyville, Louisiana, should contribute to next quarter's results. And in our Tonnage segment, we expect higher operating bonuses and lower maintenance costs. Partially offsetting these sequential improvements, in Asia, we expect some slowing around the lunar new year holidays. This will slow down some of the gains we've experienced in Electronics and Performance Materials and our Asian Merchant Gases business. In Equipment and Energy, we're forecasting higher development spending next quarter and finally, we expect our tax rate will be closer to 26% in Quarter 2.Please turn to Slide #11. With one quarter under our belt in fiscal 2010, we are raising our earnings per share guidance for the year to $4.75 to $4.95, anticipating growth of 17% to 22% versus prior year. We have tweaked the 2010 assumptions that we provided to you three months ago. The changes are highlighted in red on Slide #11. Overall, we expect that global manufacturing will still grow about 1% to 2% in our fiscal 2010. However, our regional forecast for Europe and Asia have changed slightly. We believe growth in Europe will be slower as manufacturing is hampered by weak consumer spending and also a strong euro. We believe these factors will yield around a 1% decline in Europe in our fiscal 2010. Asia on the other hand, is a bright spot, and we are now forecasting growth of 8% to 9% in our fiscal 2010. Demand in the electronics market has been strong, so we're increasing our estimate for silicon growth to 20% to 25% from 10% to 15%. Our capital spending guidance remains unchanged, as well as most of our other assumptions. We are increasing our guidance for fiscal 2010 because of our continued efforts and success in the area of productivity and margin improvement.Despite the slow nature of the recovery, we remain optimistic about our prospects for growth in the future. As we noted, 2010 should be a year of strong growth for us. As we look beyond 2010, we are excited by the opportunities we have to grow, driven by alternative fuels, the focus on improving energy efficiency, and the continued need for manufacturers to lower emissions and improve environmental performance. Now, let me wrap up.We made solid progress towards our goal of improving operating margins and returns this quarter. And we remain committed to our goals while pursuing a large number of growth opportunities. We believe that our goal to become a low-cost supplier versus our competitors will enable us to deliver greater growth and higher returns, resulting in significant increases in shareholder value. While the global economy is still sorting itself out in 2010, we are excited about the opportunities and challenges we face. Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Kim to take your questions."

However, what was really key for our merchant business in this quarter, really has been the long journey which we've been on, on cost here. And we had very solid results year on year in cost and really quarter to quarter, which drove this volume improvement. And these things are sustainable. Things like our variable cost, improving the power efficiency of our plant, improving the distribution efficiency of our plant. Lowering our fixed costs in SG&A and operation's overhead and stuff like that. And that's what drove it.

Part of this is it's a combination of the product mix, and it's a combination of the sizes of the various businesses that get us to the answer. If you look at some of the key products, if I start in North America, the main impact there was hydrogen, as we said earlier. All the products were probably flat to slightly up. And in Europe, we saw more stronger improvements. We have seen more significant energy increases over there. We've gone out more aggressively. And we have seen pretty much stronger pricing across the board, which is yielding the improvement. Realize, of course, in Europe, we also have a Packaged Gas business. And we have been very busy at price actions in the Packaged Gas business for the last couple of quarters, and that is showing some impact. In Asia, we have seen basically pressure from two sources; one, the Argonne, as I mentioned before. But then also, and this is partly the same answer, a fair amount of new capacity has come on stream in Asia in the last several months. These were projects that have been in execution for a number of years, and just coming on stream. And that, coupled with the lower demand, certainly has some pricing challenges out there. But all within what we've expected so far this year, Bob, nothing really unusual there. In terms of the cycle of this, we would expect that the surcharges that we have in place probably remain pretty steady for the next couple of quarters, even if it's hard to predict where diesel is going to be. But we've largely converted any energy base surcharges in the permanent price at this point. And so we continue to do that with some of the older surcharges for diesel fuel. With regards to quality of new signings, we have actually seen that stabilized, because demand has begun to pick up. And then one of the issues we saw the same a year ago quarter, is there weren't too many deals going down. Because everyone was sort of holding their decision  making, to see where the economy bottomed out. And so there were some less-than-desirable deals out there. We've seen that begin to reverse itself with the quality of signings actually picking up. And so at the end of the day, we think the pricing impact there, as that comes on stream, will be net positive. Although it's such a small fraction of the entire enterprise, it will be hard to see it."

So we had a positive impact of volumes on there than we had a negative impact on the maintenance costs.

Please turn to Slide #3. For the quarter, sales decreased 1% versus prior year. This decline was primarily the result of significantly lower natural gas prices, which reduced our contractual pass-through of energy-related costs, lowering sales by 7%. Partially offsetting this was favorable currency translation, with the weaker dollar increasing sales by 4%. Underlying sales increased 2% year-on-year due to higher volumes in our Tonnage and Electronics and Performance Materials segments.Volume performance in our Merchant segment was mixed, with year-over-year gains in Asia being offset by slower economic recoveries in both the U.S. and Europe. Sequentially, sales increased 2% on higher cost pass-through. Underlying sales were down 1% on seasonality and lower Equipment and Energy sales. Operating income of $345 million increased 20% from prior year, primarily due to higher volumes, productivity and favorable currency and our operating margin of 15.9% improved by 280 basis points versus last year due to higher volumes and productivity. This significant improvement in margin in light of the modest underlying gains in sales represents of the hard work that our team has done in all aspects of our costs. We are delivering improved efficiencies in energy utilization, operating and maintenance costs and our selling and G&A costs. These are substantial savings that we can sustain and will continue to improve upon as volumes recover.For the quarter, net income increased 22% and diluted earnings per share increased by 20% each versus prior year. Return on capital employed improved sequentially. On an instantaneous basis, we have improved ROCE to 11.7%. Before I move on, just a couple of brief comments on some other items in our financial statements. Other income on our consolidated P&L was $8 million higher compared to last year, primarily due to large foreign exchange losses last year. And on the cash flow statement, our operating cash flow was impacted by $256 million in cash contributions to our pension plans. This shows up as a use of cash in payables and accrued liabilities this quarter, and is a timing issue which should even out through the rest of the fiscal year. For the entire year, we still anticipate making cash contributions of approximately $360 million. Now turning to Slide 4, for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share increased by $0.19. Higher volumes in Tonnage and Electronics and Performance Materials helped to increase earnings per share by $0.12 year on year. Pricing and energy in raw materials together were unfavorable subtracting $0.05. Cost were $0.06 favorable, reflecting our cost improvement efforts. The favorable impact to operating income from currency translation and foreign exchange was $0.07.Equity affiliated income was up $0.01. Interest expense declined on lower rates adding $0.02, a slightly higher tax rate this year cost us $0.01 and higher shares outstanding subtracted about $0.03. All in all, 20% earnings growth this quarter is a solid start to our new fiscal year despite a slow economic recovery. We are delivering the improvements we told you about from our new investments and our cost reduction efforts. Now I'll turn the call over to Nelson to review our business segment results. Nelson?"

Underlying sales declined 5%, with volumes down 5% and pricing flat. Currency increased sales by 6% versus prior quarter, sales were flat. Merchant Gases operating income of $190 million was up 11% versus prior year and up 14% sequentially.Segment operating margin of 20.3% was up 190 basis points versus prior year and 250 basis points sequentially, reflecting strong cost performance. We saw the benefits of our global cost actions from our workforce reduction, distribution efficiency and reduced plant operating costs, which in total, more than offset the decline in volume and grew margins. Loadings were flat in North America and Europe versus prior quarter and continued to improve in Asia. Signings are off to a good start in all regions. Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 6.In North America, sales fell 11% versus prior year. Sales in the first two months of the prior-year quarter were relatively strong and this yielded a tougher comparison this year. Volumes were down 9% versus prior year, with pricing down 2%. Pricing was impacted by lower surcharge activity and lower liquid hydrogen pricing, as a result of lower natural gas costs. In Europe, sales increased 6% versus prior year. Underlying sales declined 3% with volumes down 4% and pricing adding 1%. Currency increased sales by 9%. Sales were impacted by the weak manufacturing environment but continued to be helped by pricing and increased healthcare volumes. In Asia, Merchant sales were up 13% versus last year. Underlying sales increased 8% with volumes up 11% and pricing down 3%. Currency increased sales by 5%. Volumes continued to improve across Asia, driven by steel and electronics customers. China volumes in particular were up 30% versus prior year. The price decline in Asia is principally in Argonne where last year's prices were higher due to tight supply.Please turn to Slide 7, Tonnage Gases. Sales of $698 million decreased 6% compared to last year. Volumes were up 11%. Energy and raw material pass-through decreased sales by 21% and currency increased sales by 4%. The higher volumes reflect the continuing improvement in steel and chemical end markets, as well as new plant onstreams.Sequentially, sales were up 9%, mainly due to energy and raw material pass-through. Operating income of $100 million was down 8% versus prior year and 5% sequentially, primarily due to higher maintenance spending and lower operating efficiencies. Operating margin of 14.4% decreased versus prior year and sequentially, also due to higher maintenance spending. We announced new world-scale hydrogen plants for our pipeline networks in Louisiana and Rotterdam and also announced the major upgrade and expansion of our La Porte, Texas air separation facility during the quarter.Please turn to Slide 8, Electronics & Performance Materials. Segment sales of $433 million were up 7% compared to last year. Volumes increased 11%. Pricing reduced sales by 6% and currency was 2% higher. Electronic sales were down 2% compared to last year and were flat sequentially. Sales in the quarter were impacted by lower prices and lower services and equipment sales. Electronics specialty materials sales increased 8% versus prior year and 4% sequentially. Tonnage sales were unchanged versus prior year. Performance Materials sales increased 18% versus last year and were flat sequentially, reflecting stronger Asian sales and less seasonal decline than in previous years.Segment operating income of $48 million was up 97% versus prior year, which resulted in significant improvement in margins. Sequential margins were essentially flat, reflecting lower pricing and ongoing restructuring costs. We now expect millions of square inches of silicon to grow 20% to 25% in our fiscal year and still expect the Electronics Equipment business to rebound in the second half.Please turn to Slide 9, Equipment & Energy. Sales of $109 million decreased 9% versus last year. Operating income of $8 million increased versus prior year, due to lower energy development spending, which was partially offset by restructuring costs to close a European manufacturing facility. We just announced last night a major order for three LNG heat exchangers in support of the Gorgon Project in Australia. Reflecting this order, our backlog in this segment improved to $327 million. We continue to work on other projects and expect additional award activity this year. Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul."

Now if you'll turn to Slide 10, I'd like to share my thoughts on our outlook for next quarter. Our guidance for quarter 2 is for earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.20 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see in",545,"Thanks, Nelson. Now if you'll turn to Slide 10, I'd like to share my thoughts on our outlook for next quarter. Our guidance for quarter 2 is for earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.20 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas. We expect the manufacturing economy globally to continue its gradual recovery. New plant onstreams, including a full quarter impact of our hydrogen plant to serve Marathon in Garyville, Louisiana, should contribute to next quarter's results. And in our Tonnage segment, we expect higher operating bonuses and lower maintenance costs. Partially offsetting these sequential improvements, in Asia, we expect some slowing around the lunar new year holidays. This will slow down some of the gains we've experienced in Electronics and Performance Materials and our Asian Merchant Gases business. In Equipment and Energy, we're forecasting higher development spending next quarter. And finally, we expect our tax rate will be closer to 26% in quarter 2.Please turn to Slide #11. With one quarter under our belt in fiscal 2010, we are raising our earnings per share guidance for the year to $4.75 to $4.95, anticipating growth of 17% to 22% versus prior year. We have tweaked the 2010 assumptions that we provided to you three months ago. The changes are highlighted in red on Slide #11. Overall, we expect that global manufacturing will still grow about 1% to 2% in our fiscal 2010. However, our regional forecast for Europe and Asia have changed slightly. We believe growth in Europe will be slower, as manufacturing is hampered by weak consumer spending and also a strong euro. We believe these factors will yield around a 1% decline in Europe in our fiscal 2010. Asia on the other hand, is a bright spot, and we are now forecasting growth of 8% to 9% in our fiscal 2010. Demand in the electronics market has been strong, so we're increasing our estimate for silicon growth to 20% to 25% from 10% to 15%. Our capital spending guidance remains unchanged, as well as most of our other assumptions. We are increasing our guidance for fiscal 2010 because of our continued efforts and success in the area of productivity and margin improvement.Despite the slow nature of the recovery, we remain optimistic about our prospects for growth in the future. As we noted, 2010 should be a year of strong growth for us. As we look beyond 2010, we are excited by the opportunities we have to grow, driven by alternative fuels, the focus on improving energy efficiency and the continued need for manufacturers to lower emissions and improve environmental performance. Now let me wrap up.We made solid progress towards our goal of improving operating margins and returns this quarter. And we remain committed to our goals while pursuing a large number of growth opportunities. We believe that our goal to become a low-cost supplier versus our competitors will enable us to deliver greater growth and higher returns, resulting in significant increases in shareholder value. While the global economy is still sorting itself out in 2010, we are excited about the opportunities and challenges we face. Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Kim to take your questions."

However, what was really key for our Merchant business in this quarter, really has been the long journey which we've been on, on cost here. And we had very solid results year on year in cost and really quarter to quarter, which drove this volume improvement. And these things are sustainable. Things like our variable cost, improving the power efficiency of our plant, improving the distribution efficiency of our plant, lowering our fixed costs in SG&A and operation's overhead and stuff like that. And that's what drove it. As far as the relative profitability of our Asian business, our Asian business, it has good profitability in it. It's not low profitability.

However, with the pricing of a barrel of oil pushing back into the 70s and the high-70s, we actually feel pretty comfortable that we won't see additional surcharge erosion for the rest of the year. And frankly, stand ready to do add more surcharges if the pricing of our feedstock, i.e. diesel, does go up going forward."

So in this quarter, we are pretty much in-line with it, and last year was the unusual quarter. And foreign exchange was the difference there."

Part of this is it's a combination of the product mix, and it's a combination of the sizes of the various businesses that get us to the answer. If you look at some of the key products, if I start in North America, the main impact there was hydrogen, as we said earlier. All the products were probably flat to slightly up. And in Europe, we saw more stronger improvements. We have seen more significant energy increases over there. We've gone out more aggressively. And we have seen pretty much stronger pricing across the board, which is yielding the improvement. Realize, of course, in Europe, we also have a Packaged Gas business. And we have been very busy at price actions in the Packaged Gas business for the last couple of quarters, and that is showing some impact. In Asia, we have seen basically pressure from two sources; one, the Argonne, as I mentioned before. But then also, and this is partly the same answer, a fair amount of new capacity has come on stream in Asia in the last several months. These were projects that have been in execution for a number of years, and just coming on stream. And that, coupled with the lower demand, certainly has some pricing challenges out there. But all within what we've expected so far this year, Bob, nothing really unusual there. In terms of the cycle of this, we would expect that the surcharges that we have in place probably remain pretty steady for the next couple of quarters, even if it's hard to predict where diesel is going to be. But we've largely converted any energy base surcharges in the permanent price at this point. And so we continue to do that with some of the older surcharges for diesel fuel. With regards to quality of new signings, we have actually seen that stabilized, because demand has begun to pick up. And then one of the issues we saw the same a year ago quarter, is there weren't too many deals going down. Because everyone was sort of holding their decision  making, to see where the economy bottomed out. And so there were some less-than-desirable deals out there. We've seen that begin to reverse itself with the quality of signings actually picking up. And so at the end of the day, we think the pricing impact there, as that comes on stream, will be net positive. Although it's such a small fraction of the entire enterprise, it will be hard to see it."

So we did not see our customers -- and shutting down. So the maintenance, which occurred, really corresponded to our customers taking downtime on the hydrogen area. And that's what you're seeing in this quarter. So that answers that question. When you look at the operating income decline, we had good gains in volumes for those things. So we had a positive impact of volumes on there than we had a negative impact on the maintenance costs. And then on the operating efficiencies, which we talked about, the thing which we have is we have a guarantee on the power and the gas consumption at our plants for converting into hydrogen or oxygen or whatever product we're making. We typically operate more efficiently than that. And we did this quarter. It's just that the price of gas is lower this quarter than it was a year ago.

With half of our fiscal year 2010 behind us, we are well on our way to delivering on our financial targets. Please turn to slide number four. This slide highlights some of the key financial metrics and the progress that we have made coming out of the recession. 
Just a bit of history; if you take a look at the left side of this slide, you’ll see the improvements that we have made as an organization, over the five-year period before the recession. We have moved our margin up a couple of 100 basis points, and we improved our return on capital by just short of 400 basis points. 
The other thing you can see on the right side of this slide is the impact of the global recession on the first half of our fiscal 2009. During that time we took a number of significant actions to position us appropriately coming out of the recession. Our results show the progress we have made since then, and the impact of those actions on our first half results, and the sequential improvement that we are continuing to make as an organization. 
Sales continued to improve as our underlying sales growth, which turn positive last quarter continued to recover. Year-to-date underlying sales growth is up 6%. Our operating margin in the first half has improved to 16%, and we remain on-track to deliver on our 17% goal in fiscal 2011. 
Earnings growth remains strong, and as you already seen in our press release this morning, we raised our full year earnings per share guidance again this quarter. We now expect earning per share growth to exceed 20% this fiscal year; and most importantly we continue to drive return on capital, and employ it higher, striving to keep our return on capital three to five points above our cost of capital across the cycle. This lower cost structure makes us even more competitive and well positioned, to grow faster with higher returns. 
Please turn to slide number five for a quick look at the current quarter. Sales increased 15% versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 9% year-on-year, due to higher volumes in our electronics and performance material segment, and our tonnage segment. Volume performance in our merchant segment continued to be mixed, with strength in Asia being offset by slower recovery in both the U.S. and Europe. 
Higher natural gas prices, which raised our contractual pass through of energy related costs increased sales by 2%. Additionally, favorable currency translation from a weaker dollar increased sales by 4%. Sequentially sales increased 3%, with underlying sales up 3% on volume growth across all business segments versus the prior quarter. 
Operating income of $364 million increased 40% from prior year, primarily due to higher volumes and better cost performance. As a result, our operating margin of 16.2% improved by 290 basis points versus last year. This improvement in margin can be sustained and should continue to improve as volumes recover. 
Looking forward we still have significant operating leverage available. For the quarter net income increased 41%, and diluted earnings per share increased by 38%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed improved 70 basis points sequentially, to 11.6% on an instantaneous or run rate basis. We have improved return on capital employed to 12.1%. 
Turning to slide six for a review of the factors that affected the quarters performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share increased by $0.34. Higher volumes in electronics and performance materials and tonnage helped to increase earnings per share by $0.29 year-on-year. Pricing energy and raw material all together were unfavorable subtracting $0.9. 
Costs were $0.12 favorable, reflecting our significant cost improvement efforts. The favorable impact to operating income from currency translation and foreign exchange was $0.05. Equity affiliate income was up $0.02; non-controlling interest was up lowering EPS by $0.02, and higher shares outstanding subtracted about $0.03. 
In summary, we generated solid financial results again this quarter. We are delivering on the improvements we told you about from our new investments and our cost reductions efforts. 
Now I’ll turn the call over to Nelson to review our business segment results. Nelson.

Underlying sales were flat with volumes up 1% and pricing down 1%. Currency increased sales by 6% versus prior quarter underlying sales were up modestly due to strong performance in Asia, and we are negatively impacted by currency. Merchant Gases operating income of $178 million was up 14% versus prior year, and down 6% sequentially. 
Segment operating margin of 19.3% was up 140 basis points versus prior year and down 100 basis points sequentially. Year-on-year income and margins benefited from higher volumes and improved cost performance. Sequential operating income and margins were impacted by poor weather conditions in Europe in January, as well as lunar New Year in Asia. Signings at the mid-year point are on track to meet our full year targets in all regions. 
Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to slide eight. In North America sales improved 2% versus prior year. Volumes led by stronger liquid argon and liquid hydrogen sales were up 5% versus prior year. Pricing continued to be impacted by lower surcharge activity, and lower liquid hydrogen pricing as a result of cost pass through of lower natural gas cost. LOXLIN loading remained in the mid-70s. 
In Europe, sales increased 6% versus the prior year. Underlying sales declined 2%, with volumes down 2% and pricing flat. Currency increased sales by 8%. Sales were impacted by the weak manufacturing environment in Southern Europe, but we are helped by increased health care volumes. LOXLIN loadings also remained in the mid-70s. 
In Asia, merchant sales were up 24% versus last year. Underlying sales increased 18%, with volumes up 22%, and pricing down 4%. Currency increased sales by 6%. Volumes continued to rebound significantly across the region, driven by steel, electronics and bulk hydrogen customers.
March was the best month in our history in the region and our volumes this quarter surpassed our 2008 peak. The price decline is primarily tied to lower liquid argon pricing, and supply has rebounded quicker than demand, as new piggyback sources have been brought on stream. 
Please turn to slide nine; tonnage gases. Sales of $757 million increased 21% compared to last year. Volumes were up 11%, energy and raw material pass through increased sales by 6%, and currency increased sales by 4%. The higher volumes reflect the continuing improvement in steel and chemical end markets, as well as new plant on streams. 
Sequentially sales were up 8% due to energy and raw material pass through. Operating income of $107 million was up 9% versus the prior year, and 7% sequentially, primarily due to higher base volumes and new plant start-ups. Operating margin of 14.2% decreased versus prior year due to higher energy and raw material pass through. Refinery hydrogen excluding new on-streams was flat versus prior year. 
We expect volumes to improve in the second half of the year, as the new facilities achieve higher operating rates and spot demand increases. Bidding on new projects remains active and we expect additional awards for new business this year. The segment will also see the benefit of several major start-ups in quarters three and four. Paul will have more to say about this in his outlook.
Please turn to slide 10; electronic and performance materials. Segment sales of $451 million were up 36% compared to last year. Volumes increased 38%, pricing reduced sales by 4% and currency was 2% higher. Each division saw sequential volume gains. Electronic sales were up 28% compared to last year and 4% sequentially. 
Sales in the quarter were up significantly versus the low point a year-ago, and were better than expected sequentially. Electronic specialty material sales increased 56% versus prior year and 1% sequentially. Tonnage sales were 10% higher versus prior year. In addition, we are seeing the expected pick up in orders for our equipment business, as new CapEx is growing once again. 
Performance material sales increased 45% versus last year and 4% sequentially, reflecting stronger volumes. The volume recovery in the segment was initially led by Asia, where we are now seeing improvement in both North America and Europe. Segment operating income of $57 million was up substantially versus prior year, which resulted in the significant improvement in margins. Sequential margins improved 140 basis points, reflecting stronger volumes and solid cost control.
Progress on the electronics restructuring efforts continued during the quarter. We will see a larger impact to margins in our third quarter as we incur costs to complete these efforts. We now expect millions in square inches of silicon to grow 30% in fiscal year. 
Please turn to slide 11; equipment and energy. Sales of $119 million decreased 7% versus last year on lower air separation unit sales. Operating income of $18 million increased versus prior year due to higher LNG activity. Our backlog is rising due to the previously announced Gorgon LNG order, and we will soon be formally announcing another major LNG order with Exxon mobile for the New Guinea project, which was received during the quarter. 
Now I will turn the call back over to Paul.

Now if you’ll please turn to slide 12. I’d like to share our thoughts on our outlook. Our guidance for quarter three is for earnings per share of $1.25 to $1.29, based on the following factors. On the positive side we expect to see in",940,"Thanks Nelson. Now if you’ll please turn to slide 12. I’d like to share our thoughts on our outlook. Our guidance for quarter three is for earnings per share of $1.25 to $1.29, based on the following factors. 
On the positive side we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas. We expect the manufacturing economy globally to continue it’s gradual recovery. This along with some seasonal boost should result in higher sequential volumes in the merchant gases and the electronics and performance material segments. New plan on-streams and supply contracts, including the full quarter impact of our new hydrogen plant in Corpus Christie, Texas, and our increased supply at Exxon mobile at Bay Town, Texas will contribute to next quarters tonnage results.
Partially offsetting these sequential improvements will be; in electronics we expect demand to continue to remain strong. As we’ve discussed with you in the past, we plan to finalize our restructuring efforts in quarter three, which will result in higher cost next quarter. While margins will dip in quarter three, we expect them to rebound in quarter four, and be on-track to meet our 2011 goal of 15%. 
In equipment and energy, we are forecasting higher energy development spending next quarter and planned maintenance outages at a number of plants. 
Looking at fiscal 2010 with half of the fiscal year behind us, we are raising our earnings per share guidance for the year. We were at $4.75 to $4.95, and are increasing our guidance to $4.90 to $5.00, anticipating earnings per share growth of 21% to 23% versus the prior year. Overall, our 2010 economic assumptions haven’t changed much. 
We expect that global manufacturing will still grow about 2% in our fiscal 2010. Regionally Europe remains the weakest and we still expect a 1% decline in our fiscal 2010. North America should be up about 1%, and Asia continues to be the strongest., and we are now forecasting growth of about 10% in our fiscal 2010. 
Demand in the electronics market has been strong, so we are modestly increasing our estimate for silicon growth to about 30%. Our capital spending guidance remains unchanged, as well as most of our other assumptions. Despite the gradual nature of the recovery, we remain optimistic about our prospects for the future. 
Turning to other growth initiatives; as you all know we, announced our offer for Airgas earlier this quarter. Let me give you a brief update on where that stands. We remain convinced of the strong industrial logic, and strong strategic rationale that underpin this deal. We also believe that we are the best company to do this deal, as our businesses are highly complimentary. 
Air Products has no existing US package gas business, which is 90% of Airgas. We remain confident in our ability to produce the substantial cost synergies we’ve identified, primarily relating to reductions in corporate overhead and part of the company costs, supply chain efficiencies, and better utilization of infrastructure. Coupled with the enhanced growth opportunities we see, this deal creates significant value for our shareholders. 
Despite the highly attractive nature of our all-cash, 38% premium offer, and our repeated attempts to engage the Airgas board in discussions, they have refused to engage with us; therefore we took the next step and commenced a tender offer, taking our offer directly to the Airgas shareholders. 
Our next step will be the submission of our shareholder proposals for consideration at Airgas’ 2010 annual meeting. These will include our alternative slate of directors and other proposals designed to allow Airgas’ shareholders to decide for themselves about our offer. 
We have also been in discussion with the Federal Trade Commission. We are working cooperatively with the FTC to answer their questions, and to provide information. Our regulatory approval strategy and shareholder actions are designed to ensure that Airgas shareholders have the opportunity to send a clear and unambiguous message to their board at the 2010 annual meeting, which Airgas has disclosed in recent SEC filings, will be held no later than September 17. We believe that our offer represents excellent value to the Airgas shareholders; well above the $0.43 and $0.53 price Airgas shares were trading at, on the day before the offer. 
I want to be clear that we will not overpay for Airgas. We are disciplined and we will remain disciplined as we bring this deal to a conclusion. We will not sacrifice the excellent growth prospects we have in our existing businesses. We will continue to fully fund and resource these many opportunities. 
Our cash generating capabilities and reinvestment opportunities remain very strong. Acquiring Airgas would not impact our growth, margin improvement, and earnings goals; it provides upside. In short, Air Products shareholders should understand that we have a very bright future with or without Airgas. At the right price, this is one of our many excellent growth opportunities. 
Now, let me wrap up. We continue to make solid progress towards our goal of improving operating margins and returns, and we remain focused on these goals. We believe that our goal to become a low cost supplier versus our competitors enables us to deliver greater growth and higher returns, resulting in significant increases in shareholder value. 
We are pursuing numerous growth opportunities around the world. As the economy recovers, we have significant operating leverage in our businesses. Regardless of the outcome of the Airgas offer, we are well positioned to continue to create shareholder value. The whole team in Air Products is excited and energized by the many opportunities we have. Thank you. 
Now I will turn the call over to Treka to take your questions.

From a pricing standpoint, we are essentially flat quarter-on-quarter. The argon was really just the impact of bringing some new capacity on stream, that basically took pricing down a little bit, but if I looked at LOXLIN in pretty much every region its flat to slightly off. 
We continue to get some pricing in China where we are trying to recover against energy increases, and so we are seeing the most impact again from the liquid argon in Asia. From liquid hydrogen in North America, because natural gas prices are lower and that’s a little bit of a lag on the price, but the underlying pricing story is still holding together pretty well.

We are bringing new capacity on-stream throughout Asia, which of course is planned and is in the sequence of doing that, but we should see volume pick up in the second half of the year; certainly in North America, continuing in Asia, and if anything flat to slightly up in Europe as we go forward.

Right now, as far as accusation activity, we continue to evaluate some. There is nothing really hot beyond Airgas, on buying a company.

The type of projects which we look for in that area are ones which are going to lead to grow up in the future. We bought the Corpus Christi plant in Texas is the reason why we were able to get a good deal on the plant, but then we also see more products being required in the further, so an opportunity to invest and build a franchise there.

With half of our fiscal year 2010 behind us, we are well on our way to delivering on our financial targets. Please turn to Slide #4. This slide highlights of some of the key financial metrics and the progress that we have made coming out of the recession. Just a bit of history, if you take a look at the left side of the slide, you'll see the improvements that we have made as an organization over the five-year period before the recession. We have moved our margin up a couple hundred basis points and we improved our return on capital by just short of 400 basis points. The other thing you can see on the right side of this slide is the impact of the global recession on the first half of our fiscal 2009. During that time, we took a number of significant actions to position us appropriately coming out of the recession. Our results show the progress we have made since then and the impact of those actions on our first half results and the sequential improvement that we're continuing to make as an organization. Sales continued to improve as our underlying sales growth, which turned positive last quarter continued to recover. Year-to-date, underlying sales growth is up 6%. Our operating margin in the first half has improved to 16% and we remain on track to deliver on our 17% goal in fiscal 2011.
Earnings growth remains strong and as you've already seen in our press release this morning, we raised our full-year earnings per share guidance again this quarter. We now expect earnings per share growth to exceed 20% this fiscal year. And most importantly, we continue to drive return on capital employed higher, striving to keep our return on capital three to five points above our cost of capital across this cycle. This lower cost structure makes us even more competitive and well positioned to grow faster with higher returns.
Please turn to Slide #5 for a quick look at the current quarter. Sales increased 15% versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 9% year on year due to higher volumes in our Electronics and Performance Materials segment and our Tonnage segment. Volume performance in our Merchant segment continue to be mixed, with strength in Asia being offset by slower recovery in both the U.S. and Europe. Higher natural gas prices, which raised our contractual pass through of energy-related costs, increased sales by 2%. Additionally, favorable currency translation from a weaker dollar increased sales by 4%. Sequentially, sales increased 3%, with underlying sales up 3% on volume growth across all business segments versus the prior quarter. Operating income of $364 million increased 40% from prior year, primarily due to higher volumes and better cost performance. As a result, our operating margin of 16.2% improved by 290 basis points versus last year. This improvement in margin can be sustained and should continue to improve as volumes recover.
Looking forward, we still have significant operating leverage available. For the quarter, net income increased 41% and diluted earnings per share increased by 38%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed improved 70 basis points sequentially to 11.6%. On an instantaneous or run rate basis, we have improved return on capital employed to 12.1%.
Turning to Slide 6 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earning per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share increased by $0.34. Higher volumes in Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage helped to increase earnings per share by $0.29 year on year. Pricing, energy and raw materials altogether were unfavorable, subtracting $0.09. Costs were $0.12 favorable, reflecting our significant cost improvement efforts. The favorable impact to operating income from currency translation and foreign exchange was $0.05. Equity affiliate income was up $0.02. Noncontrolling interest was up, lowering EPS by $0.02 and higher shares outstanding subtracted about $0.03. 
In summary, we generated solid financial results again this quarter. We are delivering on the improvements we told you about from our new investments and our cost reduction efforts. Now I'll turn the call over to Nelson to review our business segment results. Nelson?"

Underlying sales were flat, with volumes up 1% and pricing down 1%. Currency increased sales by 6%. Versus prior quarter, underlying sales were up modestly due to strong performance in Asia and were negatively impacted by currency. Merchant Gases operating income of $178 million was up 14% versus prior year and down 6% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 19.3% was up 140 basis points versus prior year and down 100 basis points sequentially. Year-on-year income and margins benefited from higher volumes and improved cost performance. Sequential operating income and margins were impacted by poor weather conditions in Europe in January, as well as Lunar New Year in Asia. Signings at the midyear point are on track to meet our full-year targets in all regions. Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 8.
In North America, sales improved 2% versus prior year. Volumes led by stronger liquid argon and liquid hydrogen sales were up 5% versus prior year. Pricing continued to be impacted by lower surcharge activity and lower liquid hydrogen pricing as a result of cost pass through of lower natural gas costs. Locks loading remained in the mid-70s. In Europe, sales increased 6% versus prior year. Underlying sales declined 2%, with volumes down 2% and pricing flat. Currency increased sales by 8%. Sales were impacted by the weak manufacturing environment in Southern Europe but were helped by increased healthcare volumes. LOX-LIN loadings also remain in the mid-70s. In Asia, merchant sales were up 24% versus last year. Underlying sales increased 18% with volumes up 22% and pricing down 4%. Currency increased sales by 6%. Volumes continued to rebound significantly across the region, driven by steel, electronics and bulk hydrogen customers. March was the best month in our history in the region and our volumes this quarter surpassed our 2008 peak. The price decline is primarily tied to lower liquid argon pricing as supply has rebounded quicker than demand as new piggyback sources have been brought on stream. 
Please turn to Slide 9, Tonnage Gases. Sales of $757 million increased 21% compared to last year. Volumes were up 11%. Energy and raw material pass through increased sales by 6% and currency increased sales by 4%. The higher volumes reflect the continuing improvement in steel and chemical end markets as well as new plant on-streams. Sequentially, sales were up 8% due to energy and raw material pass through. Operating income of $107 million was up 9% versus prior year and 7% sequentially, primarily due to higher base volumes and a new plant startups. Operating margin of 14.2% decreased versus prior year due to higher energy and raw material pass through. Refinery hydrogen, excluding new on-streams, was flat versus prior year. We expect volumes to improve in the second half of the year as the new facilities achieve higher operating rates and spot demand increases. Bidding on new projects remains active and we expect additional awards for new business this year. The segment will also see the benefit of several major startups in Quarters 3 and 4. Paul will have more to say about this in his outlook.
Please turn to Slide 10, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $451 million were up 36% compared to last year. Volumes increased 38%. Pricing reduced sales by 4% and currency was 2% higher. Each division saw sequential volume gains. Electronic sales were up 28% compared to last year and 4% sequentially. Sales in the quarter were up significantly versus the low point a year ago and were better than expected sequentially. Electronics Specialty Materials sales increased 56% versus prior year and 1% sequentially. Tonnage sales were 10% higher versus prior year. In addition, we are seeing the expected pick up in orders for our Equipment business as new fab CapEx is growing once again. Performance Materials sales increased 45% versus last year and 4% sequentially, reflecting stronger volumes. The volume recovery in the segment was initially led by Asia, but we are now seeing improvement in both North America and Europe. Segment operating income of $57 million was up substantially versus prior year, which resulted in a significant improvement in margins. Sequential margins improved 140 basis points, reflecting stronger volumes and solid cost control. Progress on the Electronics restructuring efforts continued during the quarter. We will see a larger impact to margins in our third quarter as we incur costs to complete these efforts. We now expect millions of square inches of silicon to grow by approximately 30% in our fiscal year.
Please turn to Slide 11, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $119 million decreased 7% versus last year on lower air separation unit sales. Operating income of $18 million increased versus prior year due to higher L&G activity. Our backlog is rising due to the previously announced Gorgon L&G order. And we will soon be formally announcing another major L&G order with ExxonMobil for their Papua New Guinea project, which was received during the quarter. Now I will turn the call back over to Paul."

Now if you'll please turn to Slide 12. I'd like to share our thoughts on our outlook. Our guidance for Quarter 3 is for earnings per share of $1.25 to $1.29 based on the following factors.

Our guidance for Quarter 3 is for earnings per share of $1.25 to $1.29 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas. We expect the manufacturing economy globally to continue its gradual recovery. This, along with some seasonal boost should result in higher sequential volumes in the Merchant Gases and the Electronics and Performance Materials segments. New plant on-streams and supply contracts, including the full quarter impact of our new hydrogen plant in Corpus Christi, Texas and our increased supply at ExxonMobil at Baytown, Texas will contribute to next quarter's Tonnage results. Partially offsetting these sequential improvements will be in Electronics, we expect demand to continue to remain strong. As we've discussed with you in the past, we plan to finalize our restructuring efforts in Quarter 3, which will result in higher cost next quarter. While margins will dip in Quarter 3, we expect them to rebound in Quarter 4 and be on track to meet our 2011 goal of 15%.
In Equipment and Energy, we're forecasting higher energy development spending next quarter and planted maintenance outages at a number of plants. Looking at fiscal 2010, with half of the fiscal year behind us, we are raising our earnings per share guidance for the year. We were at $4.75 to $4.95 and are increasing our guidance to $4.90 to $5, anticipating earnings per share growth of 21% to 23% versus prior year. Overall, our 2010 economic assumptions haven't changed much. We expect that global manufacturing will still grow about 2% in our fiscal 2010. Regionally, Europe remains the weakest and we still expect the 1% decline in our fiscal 2010. North America should be up about 1% and Asia continues to be the strongest and we are now forecasting growth of about 10% in our fiscal 2010.
Demand in the electronics market has been strong, so we're modestly increasing our estimate for silicon growth to about 30%. Our capital spending guidance remains unchanged as well as most of our other assumptions. Despite the gradual nature of the recovery, we remain optimistic about our prospects for the future. 
Turning to other growth initiatives, as you all know, we announced our offer for Airgas earlier this quarter. Let me give you a brief update on where that stands. We remain convinced of the strong industrial logic and strong strategic rationale that underpinned this deal. We also believe that we are the best company to do this deal as our businesses are highly complementary. Air Products has no existing U.S. packaged gas business, which is 90% of Airgas. We remain confident in our ability to produce the substantial cost synergies we've identified, primarily relating to reductions in corporate overhead and company costs, supply-chain efficiencies and better utilization of infrastructure. Coupled with the enhanced growth opportunities we see, this deal creates significant value for our shareholders. Despite the highly attractive nature of our all cash 38% premium offer and our repeated attempts to engage the Airgas board in discussions, they have refused to engage with us. Therefore, we took the next step and commenced a tender offer, taking our offer directly to the Airgas shareholders. Our next step will be the submission of our shareholder proposals for consideration at Airgas' 2010 annual meeting. This will include our alternative slate of directors and other proposals designed to allow Airgas' shareholders to decide for themselves about our offer. We have also been in discussions with the Federal Trade Commission. We are working cooperatively with the FTC to answer their questions and to provide information.
Our regulatory approval strategy and shareholder actions are designed to ensure that Airgas shareholders have the opportunity to send a clear and unambiguous message to their board at the 2010 annual meeting, which Airgas has disclosed in recent SEC filings will be held no later than September 17. We believe that our offer represents excellent value to the Airgas shareholders, well above the $43.53 price Airgas shares were trading at on the day before the offer. I want to be clear that we will not overpay for Airgas. We are disciplined and we will remain disciplined as we bring this deal to a conclusion. We will not sacrifice the excellent growth prospects we have in our existing businesses. We will continue to fully fund and resource these many opportunities. Our cash-generating capabilities and reinvestment opportunities remain very strong. Acquiring Airgas would not impact our growth, margin improvement and earnings goals. It provides upside.
In short, Air Products shareholders should understand that we have a very bright future with or without Airgas. At the right price, this is one of our many excellent growth opportunities. Now let me wrap up. We continue to make solid progress towards our goal of improving operating margins and returns and we remain focused on these goals. We believe that our goal to become a low-cost supplier versus our competitors enables us to deliver greater growth and higher returns, resulting in significant increases in shareholder value. We are pursuing numerous growth opportunities around the world. As the economy recovers, we have significant operating leverage in our businesses. Regardless of the outcome of the Airgas offer, we are well-positioned to continue to create shareholder value. The whole team in Air Products is excited and energized by the many opportunities we have. Thank you and now I'll turn the call over to Tricka to take your questions."

The argon was really just the impact of bringing some new capacity on stream that basically took pricing down a little bit. But if I look at LOX-LIN, in pretty much every region, it's flat to slightly up. We continue to get some pricing in China where we're trying to recover against energy increases. And so we're seeing the most impact again from the liquid argon in Asia. For liquid hydrogen in North America because natural gas prices are lower and that's a little bit of a lag effect on the price.

And we continue to make progress in that. The type of projects which we look for in that area are ones which are going to lead to growth in the future. We bought the Corpus Christi plant in the hydrogen in Texas reason why is because we were able to get a good deal on the plant plus and then we also see more product being required in the future so we saw an opportunity to invest and build the franchise there.

With half of our fiscal year 2010 behind us, we are well on our way to delivering on our financial targets. Please turn to Slide #4. This slide highlights of some of the key financial metrics and the progress that we have made coming out of the recession. Just a bit of history, if you take a look at the left side of the slide, you'll see the improvements that we have made as an organization over the five-year period before the recession. We have moved our margin up a couple hundred basis points and we improved our return on capital by just short of 400 basis points. The other thing you can see on the right side of this slide is the impact of the global recession on the first half of our fiscal 2009. During that time, we took a number of significant actions to position us appropriately coming out of the recession. Our results show the progress we have made since then and the impact of those actions on our first half results and the sequential improvement that we're continuing to make as an organization. Sales continued to improve as our underlying sales growth, which turned positive last quarter continued to recover. Year-to-date, underlying sales growth is up 6%. Our operating margin in the first half has improved to 16% and we remain on track to deliver on our 17% goal in fiscal 2011.
Earnings growth remains strong and as you've already seen in our press release this morning, we raised our full-year earnings per share guidance again this quarter. We now expect earnings per share growth to exceed 20% this fiscal year. And most importantly, we continue to drive return on capital employed higher, striving to keep our return on capital three to five points above our cost of capital across this cycle. This lower cost structure makes us even more competitive and well positioned to grow faster with higher returns.
Please turn to Slide #5 for a quick look at the current quarter. Sales increased 15% versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 9% year on year due to higher volumes in our Electronics and Performance Materials segment and our Tonnage segment. Volume performance in our Merchant segment continue to be mixed, with strength in Asia being offset by slower recovery in both the U.S. and Europe. Higher natural gas prices, which raised our contractual pass through of energy-related costs, increased sales by 2%. Additionally, favorable currency translation from a weaker dollar increased sales by 4%. Sequentially, sales increased 3%, with underlying sales up 3% on volume growth across all business segments versus the prior quarter. Operating income of $364 million increased 40% from prior year, primarily due to higher volumes and better cost performance. As a result, our operating margin of 16.2% improved by 290 basis points versus last year. This improvement in margin can be sustained and should continue to improve as volumes recover.
Looking forward, we still have significant operating leverage available. For the quarter, net income increased 41% and diluted earnings per share increased by 38%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed improved 70 basis points sequentially to 11.6%. On an instantaneous or run rate basis, we have improved return on capital employed to 12.1%.
Turning to Slide 6 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earning per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share increased by $0.34. Higher volumes in Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage helped to increase earnings per share by $0.29 year-on-year. Pricing, energy and raw materials altogether were unfavorable, subtracting $0.09. Costs were $0.12 favorable, reflecting our significant cost improvement efforts. The favorable impact to operating income from currency translation and foreign exchange was $0.05. Equity affiliate income was up $0.02. Noncontrolling interest was up, lowering EPS by $0.02 and higher shares outstanding subtracted about $0.03. 
In summary, we generated solid financial results again this quarter. We are delivering on the improvements we told you about from our new investments and our cost reduction efforts. Now I'll turn the call over to Nelson to review our business segment results. Nelson?"

Underlying sales were flat, with volumes up 1% and pricing down 1%. Currency increased sales by 6%. Versus prior quarter, underlying sales were up modestly due to strong performance in Asia and were negatively impacted by currency. Merchant Gases operating income of $178 million was up 14% versus prior year and down 6% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 19.3% was up 140 basis points versus prior year and down 100 basis points sequentially. Year-on-year income and margins benefited from higher volumes and improved cost performance. Sequential operating income and margins were impacted by poor weather conditions in Europe in January as well as Lunar New Year in Asia. Signings at the midyear point are on track to meet our full year targets in all regions. Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 8.
In North America, sales improved 2% versus prior year. Volumes led by stronger liquid argon and liquid hydrogen sales were up 5% versus prior year. Pricing continued to be impacted by lower surcharge activity and lower liquid hydrogen pricing as a result of cost pass-through of lower natural gas costs. LOX/LIN loading remained in the mid-70s. In Europe, sales increased 6% versus prior year. Underlying sales declined 2%, with volumes down 2% and pricing flat. Currency increased sales by 8%. Sales were impacted by the weak manufacturing environment in Southern Europe but were helped by increased healthcare volumes. LOX/LIN loadings also remain in the mid-70s. 
In Asia, merchant sales were up 24% versus last year. Underlying sales increased 18% with volumes up 22% and pricing down 4%. Currency increased sales by 6%. Volumes continued to rebound significantly across the region, driven by steel, electronics and bulk hydrogen customers. March was the best month in our history in the region and our volumes this quarter surpassed our 2008 peak. The price decline is primarily tied to lower liquid argon pricing as supply has rebounded quicker than demand as new piggyback sources have been brought onstream. 
Please turn to Slide 9, Tonnage Gases. Sales of $757 million increased 21% compared to last year. Volumes were up 11%. Energy and raw material pass through increased sales by 6% and currency increased sales by 4%. The higher volumes reflect the continuing improvement in steel and chemical end markets as well as new plant onstreams. Sequentially, sales were up 8% due to energy and raw material pass through. Operating income of $107 million was up 9% versus prior year and 7% sequentially, primarily due to higher base volumes and a new plant startups. Operating margin of 14.2% decreased versus prior year due to higher energy and raw material pass through. Refinery hydrogen, excluding new onstreams, was flat versus prior year. We expect volumes to improve in the second half of the year as the new facilities achieve higher operating rates and spot demand increases. Bidding on new projects remains active and we expect additional awards for new business this year. The segment will also see the benefit of several major startups in Quarters 3 and 4. Paul will have more to say about this in his outlook.
Please turn to Slide 10, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $451 million were up 36% compared to last year. Volumes increased 38%. Pricing reduced sales by 4% and currency was 2% higher. Each division saw sequential volume gains. Electronic sales were up 28% compared to last year and 4% sequentially. Sales in the quarter were up significantly versus the low point a year ago and were better than expected sequentially. Electronics Specialty Materials sales increased 56% versus prior year and 1% sequentially. Tonnage sales were 10% higher versus prior year. In addition, we are seeing the expected pick up in orders for our Equipment business as new fab CapEx is growing once again. Performance Materials sales increased 45% versus last year and 4% sequentially, reflecting stronger volumes. The volume recovery in the segment was initially led by Asia, but we are now seeing improvement in both North America and Europe. Segment operating income of $57 million was up substantially versus prior year, which resulted in a significant improvement in margins. Sequential margins improved 140 basis points, reflecting stronger volumes and solid cost control. Progress on the Electronics restructuring efforts continued during the quarter. We will see a larger impact to margins in our third quarter as we incur costs to complete these efforts. We now expect millions of square inches of silicon to grow by approximately 30% in our fiscal year.
Please turn to Slide 11, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $119 million decreased 7% versus last year on lower air separation unit sales. Operating income of $18 million increased versus prior year due to higher LNG activity. Our backlog is rising due to the previously announced Gorgon LNG order. And we will soon be formally announcing another major LNG order with ExxonMobil for their Papua New Guinea project, which was received during the quarter. Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul."

Now if you'll please turn to Slide 12. I'd like to share our thoughts on our outlook. Our guidance for quarter three is for earnings per share of $1.25 to $1.29 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increas",928,"Thanks, Nelson. Now if you'll please turn to Slide 12. I'd like to share our thoughts on our outlook. Our guidance for quarter three is for earnings per share of $1.25 to $1.29 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas. We expect the manufacturing economy globally to continue its gradual recovery. This, along with some seasonal boost, should result in higher sequential volumes in the Merchant Gases and the Electronics and Performance Materials segments. 
New plant onstreams and supply contracts, including the full quarter impact of our new hydrogen plant in Corpus Christi, Texas and our increased supply at ExxonMobil at Baytown, Texas will contribute to next quarter's Tonnage results. Partially offsetting these sequential improvements will be in Electronics, we expect demand to continue to remain strong. As we've discussed with you in the past, we plan to finalize our restructuring efforts in quarter three, which will result in higher cost next quarter. While margins will dip in quarter three, we expect them to rebound in quarter four and be on track to meet our 2011 goal of 15%.  In Equipment and Energy, we're forecasting higher energy development spending next quarter and planned maintenance outages at a number of plants. 
Looking at fiscal 2010 with half of the fiscal year behind us, we are raising our earnings per share guidance for the year. We were at $4.75 to $4.95 and are increasing our guidance to $4.90 to $5, anticipating earnings per share growth of 21% to 23% versus prior year. Overall, our 2010 economic assumptions haven't changed much. We expect that global manufacturing will still grow about 2% in our fiscal 2010. Regionally, Europe remains the weakest and we still expect the 1% decline in our fiscal 2010. North America should be up about 1% and Asia continues to be the strongest and we are now forecasting growth of about 10% in our fiscal 2010.
Demand in the electronics market has been strong, so we're modestly increasing our estimate for silicon growth to about 30%. Our capital spending guidance remains unchanged as well as most of our other assumptions. Despite the gradual nature of the recovery, we remain optimistic about our prospects for the future. 
Turning to other growth initiatives. As you all know, we announced our offer for Airgas earlier this quarter. Let me give you a brief update on where that stands. We remain convinced of the strong industrial logic and strong strategic rationale that underpinned this deal. We also believe that we are the best company to do this deal as our businesses are highly complementary. Air Products has no existing U.S. packaged gas business, which is 90% of Airgas. We remain confident in our ability to produce the substantial cost synergies we've identified, primarily relating to reductions in corporate overhead and company costs, supply-chain efficiencies and better utilization of infrastructure. Coupled with the enhanced growth opportunities we see, this deal creates significant value for our shareholders. Despite the highly attractive nature of our all cash 38% premium offer and our repeated attempts to engage the Airgas board in discussions, they have refused to engage with us. Therefore, we took the next step and commenced a tender offer, taking our offer directly to the Airgas shareholders. Our next step will be the submission of our shareholder proposals for consideration at Airgas' 2010 annual meeting. This will include our alternative slate of directors and other proposals designed to allow Airgas' shareholders to decide for themselves about our offer. We have also been in discussions with the Federal Trade Commission. We are working cooperatively with the FTC to answer their questions and to provide information.
Our regulatory approval strategy and shareholder actions are designed to ensure that Airgas shareholders have the opportunity to send a clear and unambiguous message to their board at the 2010 annual meeting, which Airgas has disclosed in recent SEC filings will be held no later than September 17. We believe that our offer represents excellent value to the Airgas shareholders, well above the $43.53 price Airgas shares were trading at on the day before the offer. I want to be clear that we will not overpay for Airgas. We are disciplined and we will remain disciplined as we bring this deal to a conclusion. We will not sacrifice the excellent growth prospects we have in our existing businesses. We will continue to fully fund and resource these many opportunities. Our cash-generating capabilities and reinvestment opportunities remain very strong. Acquiring Airgas would not impact our growth, margin improvement and earnings goals. It provides upside.
In short, Air Products shareholders should understand that we have a very bright future with or without Airgas. At the right price, this is one of our many excellent growth opportunities. Now let me wrap up. We continue to make solid progress towards our goal of improving operating margins and returns and we remain focused on these goals. We believe that our goal to become a low-cost supplier versus our competitors enables us to deliver greater growth and higher returns, resulting in significant increases in shareholder value. We are pursuing numerous growth opportunities around the world. As the economy recovers, we have significant operating leverage in our businesses. Regardless of the outcome of the Airgas offer, we are well-positioned to continue to create shareholder value. The whole team in Air Products is excited and energized by the many opportunities we have. Thank you and now I'll turn the call over to Tricka to take your questions."

So volumes continue the momentum into April. From a pricing standpoint, our costs were essentially flat quarter on quarter. The argon was really just the impact of bringing some new capacity onstream that basically took pricing down a little bit. But if I look at LOX-LIN, in pretty much every region, it's flat to slightly up. We continue to get some pricing in China where we're trying to recover against energy increases. And so we're seeing the most impact again from the liquid argon in Asia. For liquid hydrogen in North America because natural gas prices are lower and that's a little bit of a lag effect on the price.

And we continue to make progress in that. The type of projects which we look for in that area are ones which are going to lead to growth in the future. We bought the Corpus Christi plant in the hydrogen in Texas reason why is because we were able to get a good deal on the plant plus and then we also see more product being required in the future so we saw an opportunity to invest and build the franchise there. On the Xingtai Steel, we bought some plans but we also got an order for that to build the franchise in that area. And so it's those types of opportunities which we look at.

Once again, our quarterly results showed the benefits of our restructuring actions and our focus on continuous improvement as we continue to drive margins and returns higher. We are delivering operating leverage to the bottom line. 
Sales were 14% higher versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 12% year-on-year due to higher volumes in our Electronics and Performance Materials segment and our Tonnage and Merchant segments. The Merchant segment growth continued to be driven by strength in Asia. We are also seeing improvement in both our U.S. and European Liquid Bulk businesses. 
Sequentially, sales were flat. Underlying sales were up 4% on volume growth across the same three business segments. The 4% underlying volume growth was offset by currency and energy pass-through impacts. Operating income of $374 million increased 22% from prior year due to higher volumes. Operating income was up 3% sequentially on operating leverage across all segments. 
Our operating margin improved to 16.6%, up 100 basis points versus prior year and 40 basis points versus prior quarter, and we remain on track to deliver our 17% goal in fiscal 2011. Looking forward, this margin improvement is sustainable, and margins should continue to expand as volumes recover. We still have operating leverage available, and we remain committed to driving sustainable cost reduction. 
For the quarter, net income increased 23%, and diluted earnings per share increased by 22%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed improved to 12%. On an instantaneous or a run-rate basis, we have improved return on capital employed to 12.6%.
Turning to Slide 5 for a review of the factors that affected the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share, our adjusted continuing operation's earnings per share increased by $0.23. Higher volumes in Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage and Merchant helped to increase earnings per share by $0.36 year-on-year. 
Pricing, energy and raw materials together were unfavorable, subtracting $0.09. Costs were $0.01 unfavorable as higher year-over-year pension costs and the final Electronics restructuring actions offset our productivity gains. The unfavorable impact to operating income from currency translation and foreign exchange was $0.02. Higher equity affiliate income due to stronger volumes at a number of our joint ventures was offset by higher noncontrolling interest. 
Interest expense was $0.01 higher due to lower capitalized interest. Our effective tax rate for the quarter of 25% was within our full year guidance range and contributed $0.02, and higher shares outstanding subtracted about $0.02. 
In summary, we generated excellent financial results again this quarter. We are delivering on the improvements we told you about from our new investments and our cost reduction efforts. Now I'll turn the call over to Nelson to review our business segment results. Nelson?"

Underlying sales improved by 6%, with volumes up 7% and pricing down 1%. Currency reduced sales by 2%. 
Underlying sales were up versus prior year due to continued strong performance in Asia and improved volumes in North America and Europe. Sequential sales benefited from an improving economy and seasonally higher volumes, offset by a sharp decline in the euro.
Merchant Gases' operating income of $176 million was up 5% versus prior year and down 1% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 19.3% was up 20 basis points versus prior year and flat sequentially. Income and margins were higher than prior year with higher volumes particularly in Asia, partially offset by the impact of currency and higher power costs. 
New business signings through the first three quarters of fiscal 2010 are on track to meet our full year targets in all regions, which represent significant improvement versus prior year. 
Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 7. In North America, sales improved 4% versus prior year. Volumes, led again by stronger liquid argon and liquid hydrogen sales, were up 6% versus prior year. Pricing continued to be impacted by lower liquid hydrogen pricing as a result of pass-through of lower natural gas prices. LOX/LIN loadings increased slightly and remained in the mid-70s. 
In Europe, sales decreased 2% versus prior year. Underlying sales improved 3%, with volumes increasing by 4% and pricing down 1%. Currency decreased sales by 5%. Our Liquid Bulk volumes improved sequentially, which was expected. As a result of this increased volume, our LOX/LIN loading improved to the low 80s. 
In Asia, Merchant sales were up 27% versus last year. Underlying sales increased 23%, with volumes up 22% and pricing up 1%. Currency increased sales by 4%. Volumes continued to improve, driven by steel, electronics and bulk hydrogen with loadings reaching the high 80s. This was the highest revenue quarter ever in Asia.
We delivered real price improvement, particularly in China, responding to higher power costs by raising prices on oxygen and nitrogen. Sequentially, liquid argon pricing also improved. 
Please turn to Slide 8, Tonnage Gases. Sales of $725 million increased 28% compared to last year. Volumes were up 19%, and energy and raw material pass-through increased sales by 9%. The higher volumes reflect the continuing improvement in steel and chemical end markets as well as new plant on-streams. 
Sequentially, sales were down 4%, with volumes up 4% and energy, raw materials and currency reducing sales by 8%. Volumes were helped by new plant on-streams and the ongoing recovery.
Operating income of $120 million was up 37% versus prior year and 12% sequentially primarily due to higher volumes and new plant start-ups. Operating margin of 16.5% increase versus prior year due to higher volumes. Operating margins improved sequentially due to new on-streams and lower maintenance spending. 
Refinery hydrogen volumes, excluding new plant on-streams, were up slightly versus prior year. As we told you earlier in the quarter, we announced an agreement to build a steam methane reformer to produce hydrogen for PetroChina in Sichuan province. This represents the first major on-site for hydrogen at a state-owned refinery. 
Also, as we announced yesterday, Air Products has been selected by Pucheng Clean Energy Co. in Shaanxi province to build, own and operate three air separation plants producing over 8,200 tons per day of oxygen and 3,100 tons per day of nitrogen. We will also produce liquid products for the merchant market in the region. As you can see from these major awards, new project activity is proceeding well, and we expect additional awards this year. 
Please turn to Slide 9, Electronics and Performance Materials.  Segment sales of $497 million were up 21% compared to last year. Volumes increased 21%. Pricing reduced sales by 1%, and currency added 1%. Each division continued to see sequential volume gains, and we are now back to pre-recession levels in this business segment. 
Electronic sales were up 18% compared to last year and 11% sequentially. Electronic Specialty Materials sales increased 30% versus prior year and 9% sequentially. Tonnage sales were 14% higher versus prior year. 
Our Equipment business is up 36% versus prior year, reflecting the expected pickup in orders in support of improving new fab CapEx. Performance Materials sales increased 26% versus last year and 10% sequentially, reflecting stronger volumes across all regions. 
Segment operating income of $62 million was up 60% versus prior year, which resulted in continued significant improvement in margins. Sequential margins were flat, which was better-than-expected. As we told you previously, Electronics incurred significant restructuring costs in the quarter as we completed our remaining business repositioning activities. We were pleased to meet our goal of completing the restructuring in Q3. While this did impact margins in the quarter, it was offset by higher-than-expected volumes. We expect to get the full margin benefit of the restructuring starting in Q4.  We now expect millions of square inches of silicon to grow by more than 30% in our fiscal year. 
New business activity is heating up again in Electronics. Just yesterday, we announced two major orders from Samsung in Austin, Texas in support of their 300-millimeter fab expansion. We will double the existing on-site production of high-purity oxygen and nitrogen as well as provide a significant amount of specialty gas and chemical delivery equipment for the expansion.
Please turn to Slide 10, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $116 million were down slightly and reflect slower air separation unit sales. Operating income of $21 million increased versus prior year due to higher LNG activity and lower project costs. Our backlog versus prior year is higher due to the previously announced LNG orders. Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul."

Now if you'll please turn to Slide 11. I'd like to share our thoughts on our outlook. Our guidance for quarter four is for earnings per share of $1.27 to $1.33 based upon the following factors.

Our guidance for quarter four is for earnings per share of $1.27 to $1.33 based upon the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas. We expect the manufacturing economy globally to continue its gradual recovery. This should result in higher sequential volumes in Merchant Gases and the Electronics and Performance Materials segments.
In Electronics and Performance Materials, we expect demand to continue to remain strong. As Nelson mentioned, we finished our restructuring efforts in quarter three, which will result in higher margins next quarter. We are on track to meet our 2011 goal of 15% margin. 
Looking at fiscal 2010, we are now forecasting earnings per share of $4.94 to $5, up 22% to 23% versus prior year. We have raised the bottom end of our guidance range from $4.90 and maintain the top end despite a less favorable currency outlook relative to where we were a quarter ago. 
At current rates, compared to last quarter's guidance, currency is about a $0.05 headwind for us over the second half of the fiscal year. For the year, we are expecting our tax rate to be in the lower part of our previously announced range of 25% to 26%. 
Overall, our 2010 economic assumptions haven't changed much. Our fiscal 2010 capital spending guidance remains unchanged, and as we've been telling you, we still anticipate that our CapEx will grow 15% to 20% per year over the next few years. As Nelson commented on earlier, our recent PCEC [Pucheng Clean Energy Co.] and Samsung project announcements are further evidence of the strength of our capital backlog.
Now let me give everyone a brief update on our Airgas offer. Please turn to Slide #12. As you know, we raised our offer for Airgas on July 8 by $3.50 to $63.50. We remain convinced of the strong strategic rationale and sound industrial logic that underpin this transaction. 
As we have communicated before, this combination will create one of the world's leading, integrated, industrial gas companies. We remain confident in our ability to produce the substantial cost savings we have identified, primarily relating to reductions in corporate overhead and public company costs, supply chain efficiencies and better utilization of infrastructure. Coupled with the enhanced growth opportunities we see, this deal creates significant value for our shareholders. We believe that our offer represents excellent value to the Airgas shareholders, well above the $43.53 price Airgas shares closed at on February 4, the day before our initial offer. 
Despite the highly attractive nature of our all-cash offer and our repeated attempts to engage the Airgas board in discussions, they have continually refused to engage with us. As we have said previously, we have analyzed the regulatory issues thoroughly, and we are having productive discussions with the Federal Trade Commission. We are negotiating a Consent Decree, which we expect to sign in the next few weeks. That would be subject to approval by the Commission. The fundamentals of the consent are in line with our expectations. 
We are therefore focusing on the Airgas shareholders and asking them to send a strong message to the Airgas board to bring this process to a conclusion. If you are an Airgas shareholder, here is what we are asking you to do: Tender your shares by the August 13 deadline. Vote for our three highly-qualified, independent directors who we believe will better represent all shareholders' interests. Vote for our three bylaw amendments, which will ensure a fair and expedient process is conducted, and lastly, let the current Airgas directors know that you support Air Products on our offer. Now is the time for you to act. 
We are as confident as ever in being able to obtain regulatory approval and remain as committed as ever to this transaction. Our regulatory strategy and shareholder actions are designed to ensure that Airgas shareholders have the opportunity to send a clear and unambiguous message to their board at the 2010 Annual Meeting, which Airgas has disclosed in SEC filings will be held no later than September 17.
Now let me wrap up. We continue to make solid progress towards our goals of improving growth, margins and return on capital, and we remain focused on these goals. We believe that our goal to become a low-cost supplier versus our competitors enables us to deliver greater growth and higher returns, resulting in significant increases in shareholder value. You are seeing evidence of this in the results we delivered today and the projects wins we announced this week. 
We continue to pursue our many growth opportunities around the world, and we believe we are well-positioned to win. Also, we have significant operating leverage in our businesses. This will increase earnings as the global economy recovers. 
Finally, we have also made significant progress in our offer to acquire Airgas. To be clear, the whole team at Air Products is excited and energized by the many opportunities we have, which we believe will deliver even greater shareholder value in the future. Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Lauren to take your questions."

Before we look at this quarter's results, I would like to spend a few moments looking back over these past two years. They had been quite a journey.
This slide show the progress we have made at improving two key financial metrics, operating margin and return on capital, employed. 
If you take a look at the left side of this slide, you'll see the improvements that we made over the four-year period before the recession. We had moved our operating margin up by more than 1.5%, and we improved our after-tax return on capital to 13% by the end of 2008. In the middle of this slide, you can see the impact of the global recession on our fiscal 2009 results. During that time, we took a number of significant actions to lower our costs and position ourselves for success coming out of the recession. On the right-hand side of the slide, you could see our 2010 results, which showed the improvements we have made, the impact of the actions we took and the sequential progress we are continuing to make.
Our operating margin in this last quarter improved to 17.1% and to 16.5% for the full year, as we remain on track to deliver our fiscal 2011 goal of 17%. More importantly, we continued to drive our return on capital employed higher. We are already back to our prior peak despite operating rates being lower, and we have kept our return on capital well above our cost of capital across this last business cycle. Our focus on putting in place a low-cost structure makes us more competitive and positions us to grow faster with higher returns. 
Turning to Slide #5 for a review of fiscal year 2010. Sales of $9 billion increased 9%. Our underlying sales grew 8%, with volumes up 9%. We delivered strong volume growth as the economic environment improved. This was driven by a significant recovery in our Electronics and Performance Materials segments and new and contracts in our Tonnage Gasses segment. 
Operating income of $1.5 billion grew 25% on better performance across all business segments. Our operating margin for the year averaged 16.5%, an improvement of more than the 2%, reflecting solid productivity and strong operating leverage. This is the highest operating margin in more than a decade.
Looking forward, margins should continue to expand. We still have operating leverage available, and we remain committed to driving further cost reduction. For the year, earnings per share increased 24%, and our annual return on capital employed improved to 12.4%, almost 2% higher than last year. 
In summary, we delivered significant improvements in 2010, some examples are: We completed our global cost-reduction actions and the Electronics business platform renewal; we repositioned our manufacturing centers; continued to leverage SAP; and further utilized our shared services centers. All of these actions contributed to increased productivity to the bottom line. Finally, we increased our dividends for the 28th consecutive year, as we made significant improvements in both our operating and free cash flow this year. 
Please turn to Slide 6. For the quarter, sales of $2.4 billion were 10% higher versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 8% year-on-year due to higher volumes in our Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage Gases and Merchant Gases segments. Sequentially, sales grew 4%. Underlying sales were up 3% on volume growth across all business segments. 
Operating income of $402 million increased 22% from prior year due to higher volumes. Operating income was up 7% versus prior quarter, mainly due to improved Electronics and Performance Materials results. Our operating margin improved to 17.1%, up 170 basis points versus prior year and 50 basis points sequentially. We remain on track to deliver our 17% goal for fiscal 2011. For the quarter, net income increased 19% and diluted earnings per share increased 1%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed improved on an instantaneous or run rate basis to 13.2%, up almost 2%.
Turning to Slide 7 for a review of the factors that affected of the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share increased by $0.21. Higher volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments helped to increase earnings per share by $0.28 year-on-year. 
Pricing, energy and raw materials together were unfavorable, subtracting $0.06. Costs were $0.04 favorable, as our productivity gains more than offset fixed cost inflation. Currency translation and foreign exchange netted to a $0.01 unfavorable impact. Higher equity affiliate income was more than offset by higher non-controlling interest for a net decline of $0.01. Higher interest expense, taxes and shares outstanding each costed us $0.01. 
In summary, we generated excellent financial results again this quarter. We're delivering on the improvements we told you about from our new investments and our cost-reduction efforts. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?"

Underlying sales improved by 5% on increased volumes with stable pricing. Currency reduced sales by 3%. Sales were up versus prior year due to continued strong Asia growth and improving volumes in both North America and Europe. 
Sequentially, sales were up 4%, principally from a volume growth. Merchant Gases' operating income of $185 million was up 12% versus prior year and up 5% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 19.5% was up 170 basis points versus prior year and 20 basis points sequentially.
Income and margins were higher than prior year, driven by higher volumes, particularly in Asia, and improved productivity, partially offset by the impact of currency and higher power costs. New business signings for the year were up over last year and exceeded our targets across all regions. 
We recently announced the construction commenced on a new helium production facility in Wyoming, and we also just announced yesterday a further expansion of our Shanghai-based Asia Technology Center. This expansion will enhance our ability to develop Merchant Gas and Electronics Applications closely with our customers in this key growth region.
Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 9. In North America, sales improved 5% versus prior year. Volumes were up 5%, with consistent growth across all product lines. Pricing was flat overall, with higher liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen pricing offset by lower liquid hydrogen pricing as a result of the pass-through of lower natural gas prices. LOX/LIN plant loading increased slightly and remained in the mid-70s. 
In Europe, sales decreased 8% versus prior year, primarily due to currency. Underlying sales were flat, with volumes increasing by 1% and pricing down 1%. Currency decreased sales by 8%. Our LOX/LIN volumes improved, however, healthcare was flat and packaged gas volumes continued to lag. Our LOX/LIN plant loading remained in the low 80s. 
In Asia, sales were up 17% versus last year, underlying sales increased 14%, with volumes up 11% and pricing up 3%. Currency increased sales by 3%. Volumes continued to improve, driven by a strong growth across all products and markets. We did see some sequential moderation due to reduced liquid oxygen peaking demand for steel. Plant loadings remained in the high 80s. We delivered real price improvement responding to higher power costs by raising prices on oxygen and nitrogen across the region. 
Please turn to Slide 10, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $752 million increased 17% compared to last year. Volumes were up 4%, and the energy and raw material pass-through increased sales by 14%. Higher volumes were primarily driven by new plants and customers. Sequentially, sales were up 4%, with volumes up 2% and energy and raw material pass-through increasing sales by 2%. Volume growth was driven by loading existing assets. Operating income of $117 million was up 11% versus prior year, primarily due to higher volumes from new plant startups and down 2% sequentially due to operating bonus timing.
Operating margin of 15.6% decreased 80 basis points versus prior year due to the impact of higher natural gas cost pass-through. Sequentially, margins were lower due to volume mix. 
Earlier in the quarter, we announced plans to build a third air separation unit and expand our supply of oxygen, nitrogen and argon to ArcelorMittal's Gent, Belgium steel mill and increase our supply of Merchant Gases to the Northern European market. Last week, we announced plans to connect our Texas and Louisiana pipeline systems. This will create the world's largest hydrogen plants and pipeline system. The project will unite more than 20 plants with over 1 billion standard cubic feet a day of capacity and over 600 miles of pipeline. This will allow us to increase sales by better utilizing existing capacity, improve system efficiency by sourcing from our most efficient plants and better coordinating outage planning and improve customer supply reliability and flexibility.
Please turn to Slide 11, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $523 million were up 20% compared to last year. Volumes increased 21% and pricing reduced sales by 1%. Electronic sales were up 25% compared to last year and 9% sequentially, as all industry segments grew beyond previous production peaks. 
Electronics Specialty Materials sales increased 19% versus prior year and 4% sequentially. Tonnage sales were 9% higher versus prior year. And our Equipment business reported the best quarter in two years, reflecting the expected pickup in orders due to improving new fab CapEx. Performance Materials sales increased 15% versus last year and 1% sequentially, reflecting volume growth across all markets.
Segment operating income of $84 million was up 71% versus prior year and 35% sequentially due to volume leverage and the full benefit of the restructuring actions finalized in Q3. Margins improved 480 basis points from last year and 350 basis points sequentially. Q4 margin of 16.1% exceeded our 15% operating margin goal for FY '11 with the highest quarterly margins since we began reporting this segment four years ago.
New business activity continues to grow in Electronics. As you saw last week, we announced an agreement to build two ammonia on-site purification plants for Sanan OptoElectronics in Wuhu in China. This is the world's first on-site, large-scale specialty gas plant and supports the high-growth LED market. Earlier, we announced the turnkey contract to supply our SunSource Solutions gases, equipment and services to a new photovoltaic facility in Malacca, Malaysia. 
Please turn to Slide 12, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $128 million were up 5% versus prior year and 11% sequentially, reflecting increased LNG activity. Operating income of $20 million increased significantly versus prior year due to higher LNG activity and favorable project performance. Our backlog versus prior year is higher due to the previously announced LNG orders but reduced sequentially. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul."

For our fiscal 2011, we are projecting that gradual economic recovery continues. We expect that manufacturing will continue as the leading sector in the recovery. Fiscal year 2010 growth was somewhat stronger than expected, led by Asia. We anticipate that growth will moderate in fiscal year 2011, as inventory restocking ends and global stimulus programs expire. We expect that regional differences will continue, with stronger growth in Asia and more gradual recoveries in the U.S. and Europe.
Based on our global footprint, we are planning for worldwide manufacturing growth of 3% to 4% for our fiscal 2011. Our current forecast is that the U.S. will see positive growth of 3% to 4% in manufacturing. Europe should be up about 1% to 2%, and we expect Asia will continue to be the strongest region, growing 6% to 7%, led by China. 
Volume growth will be the key factor driving earnings improvement in 2011 for us. New plant on streams in 2010 and 2011 and loading our existing assets should each add $0.30 to $0.40 to EPS. Offsetting these volume gains, pension expense will be about a $0.10 headwind due to the drop in interest rates from September 2009 to September 2010 and lower asset returns. Based upon current rates, currency should not have a significant impact on earnings next year. 
Based on these factors and our economic outlook, we are forecasting our fiscal 2011 earnings from continuing operations to be between $5.50 and $5.70 per share, which represents a year-on-year earnings growth of 10% to 14%. 
Now turning to our outlook by business segment. In Merchant Gases, capacity utilization continues to improve globally. We continued to expand our merchant capacity in Asia. Last year, we delivered on our 1% operating margin improvement goal. For 2011, we are targeting to exceed our goal of 20%. 
In our Tonnage Gases segment, we will see the benefit from the full year loading of our fiscal year 2010 start-ups, along with a number of investments due to come onstream of this year. The major projects that will drive the improvement from fiscal year 2010 fiscal year 2011 are: Our new well scale SMR for ExxonMobil in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which came onstream towards the end of fiscal year 2010; a 2,000-ton-per-day oxygen plant for the Whiting Clean Energy gas fire is on target to start up towards the end of calendar year 2010; our new oxygen plant to supply Xingtai Iron and Steel should start up in March 2011; and our new pipeline near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada where we've added three new hydrogen customers to this franchise in the past year. 
On the new order front, we announced a significant number of new projects over the course of this past year, which will provide growth in 2012 and beyond. In Equipment and Energy, we expect results similar to last year's level. We do anticipate signing two or three LNG orders in this coming year. 
Within Electronics, we expect slow, steady growth next year, with newer segments like PV [photovolcaic] and LED growing at higher rates. And to the silicon prices, we've added nicely in 2010. 
As we look across industry forecast for fiscal 2011, we project the MSI index will grow in the range of 5% to 10%. In the Integrated Circuit segment, which accounts for about 75% to 80% of our Electronics business, we are well positioned with the industry leaders who are bringing on new fabs and expanded capacity. As expected, electronics' industry capital expenditures rebounded in 2010, and it is anticipated to continue to increase next year as well. So our Electronics Equipment business results in fiscal 2011 should grow accordingly. With the restructuring behind us, the benefits of our Electronics business' repositioning efforts have become more visible this quarter. 
Switching to Performance Materials, our growth expectations are solid, as we leverage our low-cost production facilities in Asia. And we continue to benefit from new product market and application successes. 
For the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, we continue to target improvement in our operating margins, with the goal of delivering 15% in 2011. Those are my thoughts on the business segments. 
Now shifting gears back to the total company. In an economic environment, cost control and cost reduction are important drivers of earnings, margin and return improvement. For 2011, we will remain diligent on discretionary spending, new programs and staffing. We will also continue to see the benefit of a number of structural cost reductions that we have made to reach our 2011 goals of a 17% operating margin. 
At this time, our tax rate guidance is for a rate similar to 2010, approximately 25% to 26%. We remain committed to delivering consistent, strong earnings growth, along with improved margins and returns throughout the economic cycle.
Turning to Slide #14. Our guidance for quarter one is for earnings per share of $1.31 to $1.35 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas: new plant onstreams, including our new SMR to serve ExxonMobil in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. We expect the manufacturing economy to continue its gradual recovery; finally, we expect a modest benefit from currency translation next quarter. 
Offsetting these sequential improvements are a few seasonal impacts in our businesses. In Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials, we will see lower seasonal demand. In Tonnage Gases, a number of customers have plant maintenance turnarounds on their facilities in this quarter. This will result in lower volumes in quarter one and higher maintenance spending on our part, as we time our maintenance to correspond with our customer shutdowns. And pension expenses previously mentioned will be a headwind. 
Please turn to Slide 15 for our capital spending outlook. Our capital spending for 2010 was $1.3 billion. For 2011, we expect our capital spending will be between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, excluding acquisitions. We continue to work on acquisition opportunities, including captive plants from customers, such as the MarkWest and Xingtai Steel projects. And we also continued to look for focused opportunities that complement our existing positions. The majority of our spending remains in the Tonnage area, with about $1 billion associated with new large plants and pipelines. When you look across all four business segments, about 75% of our growth CapEx is under long-term contracts.
Now let me give everyone a brief update on our Airgas offer. Please turn to Slide #16. 
As you all know, the Airgas shareholders voted to elect three independent board members nominated by Air Products and to support our three shareholder proposals at the September 15 meeting. We are pleased that the Delaware Chancellery Court rejected Airgas' challenge to the January meeting bylaw and upheld the validity of the shareholder vote. We will nominate another slate of independent directors for the 2011 meeting in January. We are disappointed that Airgas continues to oppose the will that its shareholders expressed at the 2010 Annual Meeting. As we have said before, Air Products stands ready to meet with Airgas, its directors and advisors to exchange information and to negotiate a mutually beneficial transaction. We remain convinced that such a meeting is in the best interest of both companies' shareholders.
If you are an Airgas shareholder, here is what we are asking you to do now: Continue to communicate to the Airgas board that the time is right to conclude a deal. Vote for the second group of highly qualified independent directors whom we will nominate for election at the January meeting. We need to continue to work together to drive this process to a successful conclusion for Airgas and Air Products.
Now let me wrap up. We had an excellent 2010, growing sales and earnings while making significant improvements in our operating margin and return on capital. As I just covered with you, we are well positioned to deliver further growth and improvements in 2011. The increase in capital spending we announced today along with the progress we have made on the Airgas transaction, gives us a number of excellent opportunities for the future beyond 2011. We remain committed to delivering a combination of growth, margin improvement and higher returns that will make us the best investment in the industry for our shareholders. Our whole team at Air Products is excited by the opportunities we have and are ready to deliver greater shareholder value in the future. 
Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to James to take your questions."

They had been quite a journey. This slid",832,"Thanks, Simon. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Please turn to Slide #4. Before we look at this quarter's results, I would like to spend a few moments looking back over these past two years. They had been quite a journey. This slide show the progress we have made at improving two key financial metrics, operating margin and return on capital, employed. 
If you take a look at the left side of this slide, you'll see the improvements that we made over the four-year period before the recession. We had moved our operating margin up by more than 1.5%, and we improved our after-tax return on capital to 13% by the end of 2008. In the middle of this slide, you can see the impact of the global recession on our fiscal 2009 results. During that time, we took a number of significant actions to lower our costs and position ourselves for success coming out of the recession. On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see our 2010 results, which show the improvements we have made, the impact of the actions we took and the sequential progress we are continuing to make.
Our operating margin in this last quarter improved to 17.1% and to 16.5% for the full year, as we remain on track to deliver our fiscal 2011 goal of 17%. More importantly, we continued to drive our return on capital employed higher. We are already back to our prior peak despite operating rates being lower, and we have kept our return on capital well above our cost of capital across this last business cycle. Our focus on putting in place a low-cost structure makes us more competitive and positions us to grow faster with higher returns. 
Turning to Slide #5 for a review of fiscal year 2010. Sales of $9 billion increased 9%. Our underlying sales grew 8%, with volumes up 9%. We delivered strong volume growth as the economic environment improved. This was driven by a significant recovery in our Electronics and Performance Materials segments and new investments and contracts in our Tonnage Gasses segment. 
Operating income of $1.5 billion grew 25% on better performance across all business segments. Our operating margin for the year averaged 16.5%, an improvement of more than the 2%, reflecting solid productivity and strong operating leverage. This is the highest operating margin in more than a decade.
Looking forward, margins should continue to expand. We still have operating leverage available, and we remain committed to driving further cost reduction. For the year, earnings per share increased 24%, and our annual return on capital employed improved to 12.4%, almost 2% higher than last year. 
In summary, we delivered significant improvements in 2010, some examples are: We completed our global cost-reduction actions and the Electronics business platform renewal; we repositioned our manufacturing centers; continued to leverage SAP; and further utilized our shared services centers. All of these actions contributed to increased productivity to the bottom line. Finally, we increased our dividends for the 28th consecutive year, as we made significant improvements in both our operating and free cash flow this year. 
Please turn to Slide 6. For the quarter, sales of $2.4 billion were 10% higher versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 8% year-on-year due to higher volumes in our Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage Gases and Merchant Gases segments. Sequentially, sales grew 4%. Underlying sales were up 3% on volume growth across all business segments. 
Operating income of $402 million increased 22% from prior year due to higher volumes. Operating income was up 7% versus prior quarter, mainly due to improved Electronics and Performance Materials results. Our operating margin improved to 17.1%, up 170 basis points versus prior year and 50 basis points sequentially. We remain on track to deliver our 17% goal for fiscal 2011. For the quarter, net income increased 19% and diluted earnings per share increased 18%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed improved on an instantaneous or run rate basis to 13.2%, up almost 2%.
Turning to Slide 7 for a review of the factors that affected of the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share increased by $0.21. Higher volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments helped to increase earnings per share by $0.28 year-on-year. 
Pricing, energy and raw materials together were unfavorable, subtracting $0.06. Costs were $0.04 favorable, as our productivity gains more than offset fixed cost inflation. Currency translation and foreign exchange netted to a $0.01 unfavorable impact. Higher equity affiliate income was more than offset by higher non-controlling interest for a net decline of $0.01. Higher interest expense, taxes and shares outstanding each cost us $0.01. 
In summary, we generated excellent financial results again this quarter. We're delivering on the improvements we told you about from our new investments and our cost-reduction efforts. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?"

Underlying sales improved by 5% on increased volumes with stable pricing. Currency reduced sales by 3%. Sales were up versus prior year due to continued strong Asia growth and improving volumes in both North America and Europe. 
Sequentially, sales were up 4%, principally from volume growth. Merchant Gases' operating income of $185 million was up 12% versus prior year and up 5% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 19.5% was up 170 basis points versus prior year and 20 basis points sequentially.
Income and margins were higher than prior year, driven by higher volumes, particularly in Asia, and improved productivity, partially offset by the impact of currency and higher power costs. New business signings for the year were up over last year and exceeded our targets across all regions. 
We recently announced the construction commenced on a new helium production facility in Wyoming, and we also just announced yesterday a further expansion of our Shanghai-based Asia Technology Center. This expansion will enhance our ability to develop Merchant Gas and Electronics Applications closely with our customers in this key growth region.
Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 9. In North America, sales improved 5% versus prior year. Volumes were up 5%, with consistent growth across all product lines. Pricing was flat overall, with higher liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen pricing offset by lower liquid hydrogen pricing as a result of the pass-through of lower natural gas prices. LOX/LIN plant loading increased slightly and remained in the mid-70s. 
In Europe, sales decreased 8% versus prior year, primarily due to currency. Underlying sales were flat, with volumes increasing by 1% and pricing down 1%. Currency decreased sales by 8%. Our LOX/LIN volumes improved, however, healthcare was flat and packaged gas volumes continued to lag. Our LOX/LIN plant loading remained in the low 80s. 
In Asia, sales were up 17% versus last year, underlying sales increased 14%, with volumes up 11% and pricing up 3%. Currency increased sales by 3%. Volumes continued to improve, driven by a strong growth across all products and markets. We did see some sequential moderation due to reduced liquid oxygen peaking demand for steel. Plant loadings remained in the high 80s. We delivered real price improvement responding to higher power costs by raising prices on oxygen and nitrogen across the region. 
Please turn to Slide 10, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $752 million increased 17% compared to last year. Volumes were up 4%, and the energy and raw material pass-through increased sales by 14%. Higher volumes were primarily driven by new plants and customers. Sequentially, sales were up 4%, with volumes up 2% and energy and raw material pass-through increasing sales by 2%. Volume growth was driven by loading existing assets. Operating income of $117 million was up 11% versus prior year, primarily due to higher volumes from new plant startups and down 2% sequentially due to operating bonus timing.
Operating margin of 15.6% decreased 80 basis points versus prior year due to the impact of higher natural gas cost pass-through. Sequentially, margins were lower due to volume mix. 
Earlier in the quarter, we announced plans to build a third air separation unit and expand our supply of oxygen, nitrogen and argon to ArcelorMittal's Gent, Belgium steel mill and increase our supply of Merchant Gases to the Northern European market. Last week, we announced plans to connect our Texas and Louisiana pipeline systems. This will create the world's largest hydrogen plant and pipeline system. The project will unite more than 20 plants with over 1 billion standard cubic feet a day of capacity and over 600 miles of pipeline. This will allow us to increase sales by better utilizing existing capacity, improve system efficiency by sourcing from our most efficient plants and better coordinating outage planning and improve customer supply reliability and flexibility.
Please turn to Slide 11, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $523 million were up 20% compared to last year. Volumes increased 21% and pricing reduced sales by 1%. Electronic sales were up 25% compared to last year and 9% sequentially, as all industry segments grew beyond previous production peaks. 
Electronics Specialty Materials sales increased 19% versus prior year and 4% sequentially. Tonnage sales were 9% higher versus prior year. And our Equipment business reported the best quarter in two years, reflecting the expected pickup in orders due to improving new fab CapEx. Performance Materials sales increased 15% versus last year and 1% sequentially, reflecting volume growth across all markets.
Segment operating income of $84 million was up 71% versus prior year and 35% sequentially due to volume leverage and the full benefit of the restructuring actions finalized in Q3. Margins improved 480 basis points from last year and 350 basis points sequentially. Q4 margin of 16.1% exceeded our 15% operating margin goal for FY '11 with the highest quarterly margins since we began reporting this segment four years ago.
New business activity continues to grow in Electronics. As you saw last week, we announced an agreement to build two ammonia on-site purification plants for Sanan OptoElectronics in Wuhu in China. This is the world's first on-site, large-scale specialty gas plant and supports the high-growth LED market. Earlier, we announced the turnkey contract to supply our SunSource Solutions gases, equipment and services to a new photovoltaic facility in Malacca, Malaysia. 
Please turn to Slide 12, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $128 million were up 5% versus prior year and 11% sequentially, reflecting increased LNG activity. Operating income of $20 million increased significantly versus prior year due to higher LNG activity and favorable project performance. Our backlog versus prior year is higher due to the previously announced LNG orders but reduced sequentially. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul."

For our fiscal 2011, we are projecting that gradual economic recovery continues. We expect that manufacturing will continue as the leading sector in the recovery. Fiscal year 2010 growth was somewhat stronger than expected, led by Asia. We anticipate that growth will moderate in fiscal year 2011, as inventory restocking ends and global stimulus programs expire. We expect that regional differences will continue, with stronger growth in Asia and more gradual recoveries in the U.S. and Europe.
Based on our global footprint, we are planning for worldwide manufacturing growth of 3% to 4% for our fiscal 2011. Our current forecast is that the U.S. will see positive growth of 3% to 4% in manufacturing. Europe should be up about 1% to 2%, and we expect Asia will continue to be the strongest region, growing 6% to 7%, led by China. 
Volume growth will be the key factor driving earnings improvement in 2011 for us. New plant on-streams in 2010 and 2011 and loading our existing assets should each add $0.30 to $0.40 to EPS. Offsetting these volume gains, pension expense will be about a $0.10 headwind due to the drop in interest rates from September 2009 to September 2010 and lower asset returns. Based upon current rates, currency should not have a significant impact on earnings next year. 
Based on these factors and our economic outlook, we are forecasting our fiscal 2011 earnings from continuing operations to be between $5.50 and $5.70 per share, which represents a year-on-year earnings growth of 10% to 14%. 
Now turning to our outlook by business segment. In Merchant Gases, capacity utilization continues to improve globally. We continued to expand our merchant capacity in Asia. Last year, we delivered on our 1% operating margin improvement goal. For 2011, we are targeting to exceed our goal of 20%. 
In our Tonnage Gases segment, we will see the benefit from the full year loading of our fiscal year 2010 start-ups, along with a number of investments due to come on-stream of this year. The major projects that will drive the improvement from fiscal year 2010 fiscal year 2011 are: Our new well scale SMR for ExxonMobil in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which came on-stream towards the end of fiscal year 2010; a 2,000-ton-per-day oxygen plant for the Whiting Clean Energy gas fire is on target to start up towards the end of calendar year 2010; our new oxygen plant to supply Xingtai Iron and Steel should start up in March 2011; and our new pipeline near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada where we've added three new hydrogen customers to this franchise in the past year. 
On the new order front, we announced a significant number of new projects over the course of this past year, which will provide growth in 2012 and beyond. In Equipment and Energy, we expect results similar to last year's level. We do anticipate signing two or three LNG orders in this coming year. 
Within Electronics, we expect slow, steady growth next year, with newer segments like PV [photovoltaic] and LED growing at higher rates. Each of those silicon processes rebounded nicely in 2010. 
As we look across industry forecast for fiscal 2011, we project the MSI index will grow in the range of 5% to 10%. In the Integrated Circuit segment, which accounts for about 75% to 80% of our Electronics business, we are well positioned with the industry leaders who are bringing on new fabs and expanding capacity. As expected, electronics industry capital expenditures rebounded in 2010, and it is anticipated to continue to increase next year as well. So our Electronics Equipment business results in fiscal 2011 should grow accordingly. With the restructuring behind us, the benefits of our Electronics business' repositioning efforts have become more visible this quarter. 
Switching to Performance Materials, our growth expectations are solid, as we leverage our low-cost production facilities in Asia. And we continue to benefit from new product market and application successes. 
For the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, we continue to target improvement in our operating margins, with the goal of delivering 15% in 2011. Those are my thoughts on the business segments. 
Now shifting gears back to the total company. In an economic environment, cost control and cost reduction are important drivers of earnings, margin and return improvement. For 2011, we will remain diligent on discretionary spending, new programs and staffing. We will also continue to see the benefit of a number of structural cost reductions that we have made to reach our 2011 goals of a 17% operating margin. 
At this time, our tax rate guidance is for a rate similar to 2010, approximately 25% to 26%. We remain committed to delivering consistent, strong earnings growth, along with improved margins and returns throughout the economic cycle.
Turning to Slide #14. Our guidance for quarter one is for earnings per share of $1.31 to $1.35 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas: new plant on-streams, including our new SMR to serve ExxonMobil in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. We expect the manufacturing economy to continue its gradual recovery; finally, we expect a modest benefit from currency translation next quarter. 
Offsetting these sequential improvements are a few seasonal impacts in our businesses. In Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials, we will see lower seasonal demand. In Tonnage Gases, a number of customers have plant maintenance turnarounds on their facilities in this quarter. This will result in lower volumes in quarter one and higher maintenance spending on our part, as we time our maintenance to correspond with our customer shutdowns. And pension expenses previously mentioned will be a headwind. 
Please turn to Slide 15 for our capital spending outlook. Our capital spending for 2010 was $1.3 billion. For 2011, we expect our capital spending will be between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, excluding acquisitions. We continue to work on acquisition opportunities, including captive plants from customers, such as the MarkWest and Xingtai Steel projects. And we also continue to look for focused opportunities that complement our existing positions. The majority of our spending remains in the Tonnage area, with about $1 billion associated with new large plants and pipelines. When you look across all four business segments, about 75% of our growth CapEx is under long-term contracts.
Now let me give everyone a brief update on our Airgas offer. Please turn to Slide #16. 
As you all know, the Airgas shareholders voted to elect three independent board members nominated by Air Products and to support our three shareholder proposals at the September 15 meeting. We are pleased that the Delaware Chancellery Court rejected Airgas' challenge to the January meeting bylaw and upheld the validity of the shareholder vote. We will nominate another slate of independent directors for the 2011 meeting in January. We are disappointed that Airgas continues to oppose the will that its shareholders expressed at the 2010 Annual Meeting. As we have said before, Air Products stands ready to meet with Airgas, its directors and advisors to exchange information and to negotiate a mutually beneficial transaction. We remain convinced that such a meeting is in the best interest of both companies' shareholders.
If you are an Airgas shareholder, here is what we are asking you to do now: Continue to communicate to the Airgas board that the time is right to conclude a deal. Vote for the second group of highly qualified independent directors whom we will nominate for election at the January meeting. We need to continue to work together to drive this process to a successful conclusion for Airgas and Air Products.
Now let me wrap up. We had an excellent 2010, growing sales and earnings while making significant improvements in our operating margin and return on capital. As I just covered with you, we are well positioned to deliver further growth and improvements in 2011. The increase in capital spending we announced today along with the progress we have made on the Airgas transaction, gives us a number of excellent opportunities for the future beyond 2011. We remain committed to delivering a combination of growth, margin improvement and higher returns that will make us the best investment in the industry for our shareholders. Our whole team at Air Products is excited by the opportunities we have and are ready to deliver greater shareholder value in the future.

Before we look at this quarter's results, I would like to spend a few moments looking back over these past two years. They had been quite a journey. This slide show the progress we have made at improving two key financial metrics, operating margin and return on capital, employed. 
If you take a look at the left side of this slide, you'll see the improvements that we made over the four-year period before the recession. We had moved our operating margin up by more than 1.5%, and we improved our after-tax return on capital to 13% by the end of 2008. In the middle of this slide, you can see the impact of the global recession on our fiscal 2009 results. During that time, we took a number of significant actions to lower our costs and position ourselves for success coming out of the recession. On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see our 2010 results, which show the improvements we have made, the impact of the actions we took and the sequential progress we are continuing to make.
Our operating margin in this last quarter improved to 17.1% and to 16.5% for the full year, as we remain on track to deliver our fiscal 2011 goal of 17%. More importantly, we continued to drive our return on capital employed higher. We are already back to our prior peak despite operating rates being lower, and we have kept our return on capital well above our cost of capital across this last business cycle. Our focus on putting in place a low-cost structure makes us more competitive and positions us to grow faster with higher returns. 
Turning to Slide #5 for a review of fiscal year 2010. Sales of $9 billion increased 9%. Our underlying sales grew 8%, with volumes up 9%. We delivered strong volume growth as the economic environment improved. This was driven by a significant recovery in our Electronics and Performance Materials segments and new investments and contracts in our Tonnage Gasses segment. 
Operating income of $1.5 billion grew 25% on better performance across all business segments. Our operating margin for the year averaged 16.5%, an improvement of more than the 2%, reflecting solid productivity and strong operating leverage. This is the highest operating margin in more than a decade.
Looking forward, margins should continue to expand. We still have operating leverage available, and we remain committed to driving further cost reduction. For the year, earnings per share increased 24%, and our annual return on capital employed improved to 12.4%, almost 2% higher than last year. 
In summary, we delivered significant improvements in 2010, some examples are: We completed our global cost-reduction actions and the Electronics business platform renewal; we repositioned our manufacturing centers; continued to leverage SAP; and further utilized our shared services centers. All of these actions contributed to increased productivity to the bottom line. Finally, we increased our dividends for the 28th consecutive year, as we made significant improvements in both our operating and free cash flow this year. 
Please turn to Slide 6. For the quarter, sales of $2.4 billion were 10% higher versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 8% year-on-year due to higher volumes in our Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage Gases and Merchant Gases segments. Sequentially, sales grew 4%. Underlying sales were up 3% on volume growth across all business segments. 
Operating income of $402 million increased 22% from prior year due to higher volumes. Operating income was up 7% versus prior quarter, mainly due to improved Electronics and Performance Materials results. Our operating margin improved to 17.1%, up 170 basis points versus prior year and 50 basis points sequentially. We remain on track to deliver our 17% goal for fiscal 2011. For the quarter, net income increased 19% and diluted earnings per share increased 18%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed improved on an instantaneous or run rate basis to 13.2%, up almost 2%.
Turning to Slide 7 for a review of the factors that affected of the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share increased by $0.21. Higher volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments helped to increase earnings per share by $0.28 year-on-year. 
Pricing, energy and raw materials together were unfavorable, subtracting $0.06. Costs were $0.04 favorable, as our productivity gains more than offset fixed cost inflation. Currency translation and foreign exchange netted to a $0.01 unfavorable impact. Higher equity affiliate income was more than offset by higher non-controlling interest for a net decline of $0.01. Higher interest expense, taxes and shares outstanding each cost us $0.01. 
In summary, we generated excellent financial results again this quarter. We're delivering on the improvements we told you about from our new investments and our cost-reduction efforts. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?

Underlying sales improved by 5% on increased volumes with stable pricing. Currency reduced sales by 3%. Sales were up versus prior year due to continued strong Asia growth and improving volumes in both North America and Europe. 
Sequentially, sales were up 4%, principally from volume growth. Merchant Gases' operating income of $185 million was up 12% versus prior year and up 5% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 19.5% was up 170 basis points versus prior year and 20 basis points sequentially.
Income and margins were higher than prior year, driven by higher volumes, particularly in Asia, and improved productivity, partially offset by the impact of currency and higher power costs. New business signings for the year were up over last year and exceeded our targets across all regions. 
We recently announced the construction commenced on a new helium production facility in Wyoming, and we also just announced yesterday a further expansion of our Shanghai-based Asia Technology Center. This expansion will enhance our ability to develop Merchant Gas and Electronics Applications closely with our customers in this key growth region.
Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 9. In North America, sales improved 5% versus prior year. Volumes were up 5%, with consistent growth across all product lines. Pricing was flat overall, with higher liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen pricing offset by lower liquid hydrogen pricing as a result of the pass-through of lower natural gas prices. LOX/LIN plant loading increased slightly and remained in the mid-70s. 
In Europe, sales decreased 8% versus prior year, primarily due to currency. Underlying sales were flat, with volumes increasing by 1% and pricing down 1%. Currency decreased sales by 8%. Our LOX/LIN volumes improved, however, healthcare was flat and packaged gas volumes continued to lag. Our LOX/LIN plant loading remained in the low 80s. 
In Asia, sales were up 17% versus last year, underlying sales increased 14%, with volumes up 11% and pricing up 3%. Currency increased sales by 3%. Volumes continued to improve, driven by a strong growth across all products and markets. We did see some sequential moderation due to reduced liquid oxygen peaking demand for steel. Plant loadings remained in the high 80s. We delivered real price improvement responding to higher power costs by raising prices on oxygen and nitrogen across the region. 
Please turn to Slide 10, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $752 million increased 17% compared to last year. Volumes were up 4%, and the energy and raw material pass-through increased sales by 14%. Higher volumes were primarily driven by new plants and customers. Sequentially, sales were up 4%, with volumes up 2% and energy and raw material pass-through increasing sales by 2%. Volume growth was driven by loading existing assets. Operating income of $117 million was up 11% versus prior year, primarily due to higher volumes from new plant startups and down 2% sequentially due to operating bonus timing.
Operating margin of 15.6% decreased 80 basis points versus prior year due to the impact of higher natural gas cost pass-through. Sequentially, margins were lower due to volume mix. 
Earlier in the quarter, we announced plans to build a third air separation unit and expand our supply of oxygen, nitrogen and argon to ArcelorMittal's Gent, Belgium steel mill and increase our supply of Merchant Gases to the Northern European market. Last week, we announced plans to connect our Texas and Louisiana pipeline systems. This will create the world's largest hydrogen plant and pipeline system. The project will unite more than 20 plants with over 1 billion standard cubic feet a day of capacity and over 600 miles of pipeline. This will allow us to increase sales by better utilizing existing capacity, improve system efficiency by sourcing from our most efficient plants and better coordinating outage planning and improve customer supply reliability and flexibility.
Please turn to Slide 11, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $523 million were up 20% compared to last year. Volumes increased 21% and pricing reduced sales by 1%. Electronic sales were up 25% compared to last year and 9% sequentially, as all industry segments grew beyond previous production peaks. 
Electronics Specialty Materials sales increased 19% versus prior year and 4% sequentially. Tonnage sales were 9% higher versus prior year. And our Equipment business reported the best quarter in two years, reflecting the expected pickup in orders due to improving new fab CapEx. Performance Materials sales increased 15% versus last year and 1% sequentially, reflecting volume growth across all markets.
Segment operating income of $84 million was up 71% versus prior year and 35% sequentially due to volume leverage and the full benefit of the restructuring actions finalized in Q3. Margins improved 480 basis points from last year and 350 basis points sequentially. Q4 margin of 16.1% exceeded our 15% operating margin goal for FY '11 with the highest quarterly margins since we began reporting this segment four years ago.
New business activity continues to grow in Electronics. As you saw last week, we announced an agreement to build two ammonia on-site purification plants for Sanan OptoElectronics in Wuhu in China. This is the world's first on-site, large-scale specialty gas plant and supports the high-growth LED market. Earlier, we announced the turnkey contract to supply our SunSource Solutions gases, equipment and services to a new photovoltaic facility in Malacca, Malaysia. 
Please turn to Slide 12, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $128 million were up 5% versus prior year and 11% sequentially, reflecting increased LNG activity. Operating income of $20 million increased significantly versus prior year due to higher LNG activity and favorable project performance. Our backlog versus prior year is higher due to the previously announced LNG orders but reduced sequentially. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul.

For our fiscal 2011, we are projecting that gradual economic recovery continues. We expect that manufacturing will continue as the leading sector in the recovery. Fiscal year 2010 growth was somewhat stronger than expected, led by Asia. We anticipate that growth will moderate in fiscal year 2011, as inventory restocking ends and global stimulus programs expire. We expect that regional differences will continue, with stronger growth in Asia and more gradual recoveries in the U.S. and Europe.
Based on our global footprint, we are planning for worldwide manufacturing growth of 3% to 4% for our fiscal 2011. Our current forecast is that the U.S. will see positive growth of 3% to 4% in manufacturing. Europe should be up about 1% to 2%, and we expect Asia will continue to be the strongest region, growing 6% to 7%, led by China. 
Volume growth will be the key factor driving earnings improvement in 2011 for us. New plant on-streams in 2010 and 2011 and loading our existing assets should each add $0.30 to $0.40 to EPS. Offsetting these volume gains, pension expense will be about a $0.10 headwind due to the drop in interest rates from September 2009 to September 2010 and lower asset returns. Based upon current rates, currency should not have a significant impact on earnings next year. 
Based on these factors and our economic outlook, we are forecasting our fiscal 2011 earnings from continuing operations to be between $5.50 and $5.70 per share, which represents a year-on-year earnings growth of 10% to 14%. 
Now turning to our outlook by business segment. In Merchant Gases, capacity utilization continues to improve globally. We continued to expand our merchant capacity in Asia. Last year, we delivered on our 1% operating margin improvement goal. For 2011, we are targeting to exceed our goal of 20%. 
In our Tonnage Gases segment, we will see the benefit from the full year loading of our fiscal year 2010 start-ups, along with a number of investments due to come on-stream of this year. The major projects that will drive the improvement from fiscal year 2010 fiscal year 2011 are: Our new well scale SMR for ExxonMobil in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which came on-stream towards the end of fiscal year 2010; a 2,000-ton-per-day oxygen plant for the Whiting Clean Energy gas fire is on target to start up towards the end of calendar year 2010; our new oxygen plant to supply Xingtai Iron and Steel should start up in March 2011; and our new pipeline near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada where we've added three new hydrogen customers to this franchise in the past year. 
On the new order front, we announced a significant number of new projects over the course of this past year, which will provide growth in 2012 and beyond. In Equipment and Energy, we expect results similar to last year's level. We do anticipate signing two or three LNG orders in this coming year. 
Within Electronics, we expect slow, steady growth next year, with newer segments like PV [photovoltaic] and LED growing at higher rates. Each of those silicon processes rebounded nicely in 2010. 
As we look across industry forecast for fiscal 2011, we project the MSI index will grow in the range of 5% to 10%. In the Integrated Circuit segment, which accounts for about 75% to 80% of our Electronics business, we are well positioned with the industry leaders who are bringing on new fabs and expanding capacity. As expected, electronics industry capital expenditures rebounded in 2010, and it is anticipated to continue to increase next year as well. So our Electronics Equipment business results in fiscal 2011 should grow accordingly. With the restructuring behind us, the benefits of our Electronics business' repositioning efforts have become more visible this quarter. 
Switching to Performance Materials, our growth expectations are solid, as we leverage our low-cost production facilities in Asia. And we continue to benefit from new product market and application successes. 
For the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, we continue to target improvement in our operating margins, with the goal of delivering 15% in 2011. Those are my thoughts on the business segments. 
Now shifting gears back to the total company. In an economic environment, cost control and cost reduction are important drivers of earnings, margin and return improvement. For 2011, we will remain diligent on discretionary spending, new programs and staffing. We will also continue to see the benefit of a number of structural cost reductions that we have made to reach our 2011 goals of a 17% operating margin. 
At this time, our tax rate guidance is for a rate similar to 2010, approximately 25% to 26%. We remain committed to delivering consistent, strong earnings growth, along with improved margins and returns throughout the economic cycle.
Turning to Slide #14. Our guidance for quarter one is for earnings per share of $1.31 to $1.35 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas: new plant on-streams, including our new SMR to serve ExxonMobil in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. We expect the manufacturing economy to continue its gradual recovery; finally, we expect a modest benefit from currency translation next quarter. 
Offsetting these sequential improvements are a few seasonal impacts in our businesses. In Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials, we will see lower seasonal demand. In Tonnage Gases, a number of customers have plant maintenance turnarounds on their facilities in this quarter. This will result in lower volumes in quarter one and higher maintenance spending on our part, as we time our maintenance to correspond with our customer shutdowns. And pension expenses previously mentioned will be a headwind. 
Please turn to Slide 15 for our capital spending outlook. Our capital spending for 2010 was $1.3 billion. For 2011, we expect our capital spending will be between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, excluding acquisitions. We continue to work on acquisition opportunities, including captive plants from customers, such as the MarkWest and Xingtai Steel projects. And we also continue to look for focused opportunities that complement our existing positions. The majority of our spending remains in the Tonnage area, with about $1 billion associated with new large plants and pipelines. When you look across all four business segments, about 75% of our growth CapEx is under long-term contracts.
Now let me give everyone a brief update on our Airgas offer. Please turn to Slide #16. 
As you all know, the Airgas shareholders voted to elect three independent board members nominated by Air Products and to support our three shareholder proposals at the September 15 meeting. We are pleased that the Delaware Chancellery Court rejected Airgas' challenge to the January meeting bylaw and upheld the validity of the shareholder vote. We will nominate another slate of independent directors for the 2011 meeting in January. We are disappointed that Airgas continues to oppose the will that its shareholders expressed at the 2010 Annual Meeting. As we have said before, Air Products stands ready to meet with Airgas, its directors and advisors to exchange information and to negotiate a mutually beneficial transaction. We remain convinced that such a meeting is in the best interest of both companies' shareholders.
If you are an Airgas shareholder, here is what we are asking you to do now: Continue to communicate to the Airgas board that the time is right to conclude a deal. Vote for the second group of highly qualified independent directors whom we will nominate for election at the January meeting. We need to continue to work together to drive this process to a successful conclusion for Airgas and Air Products.
Now let me wrap up. We had an excellent 2010, growing sales and earnings while making significant improvements in our operating margin and return on capital. As I just covered with you, we are well positioned to deliver further growth and improvements in 2011. The increase in capital spending we announced today along with the progress we have made on the Airgas transaction, gives us a number of excellent opportunities for the future beyond 2011. We remain committed to delivering a combination of growth, margin improvement and higher returns that will make us the best investment in the industry for our shareholders. Our whole team at Air Products is excited by the opportunities we have and are ready to deliver greater shareholder value in the future. 
Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to James to take your questions.

I'm sure everybody saw that for Apple, although their Mac sales on units were up 27% year-over-year, they still sold more iPads that last quarter than they sold Macs. So again, the concept that the hand-held devices are not necessarily replacing PC sales, but they are complementary in bringing in  additional demand. As another example, TSMC, the Taiwan foundry, announced the month-to-month sales increase in September. So just a little flavor to help you see what we're seeing there.

Before we look at this quarter's results, I would like to spend a few moments looking back over these past two years. They had been quite a journey. This slide show the progress we have made at improving two key financial metrics, operating margin and return on capital, employed. 
If you take a look at the left side of this slide, you'll see the improvements that we made over the four-year period before the recession. We had moved our operating margin up by more than 1.5%, and we improved our after-tax return on capital to 13% by the end of 2008. In the middle of this slide, you can see the impact of the global recession on our fiscal 2009 results. During that time, we took a number of significant actions to lower our costs and position ourselves for success coming out of the recession. On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see our 2010 results, which show the improvements we have made, the impact of the actions we took and the sequential progress we are continuing to make.
Our operating margin in this last quarter improved to 17.1% and to 16.5% for the full year, as we remain on track to deliver our fiscal 2011 goal of 17%. More importantly, we continued to drive our return on capital employed higher. We are already back to our prior peak despite operating rates being lower, and we have kept our return on capital well above our cost of capital across this last business cycle. Our focus on putting in place a low-cost structure makes us more competitive and positions us to grow faster with higher returns. 
Turning to Slide #5 for a review of fiscal year 2010. Sales of $9 billion increased 9%. Our underlying sales grew 8%, with volumes up 9%. We delivered strong volume growth as the economic environment improved. This was driven by a significant recovery in our Electronics and Performance Materials segments and new investments and contracts in our Tonnage Gasses segment. 
Operating income of $1.5 billion grew 25% on better performance across all business segments. Our operating margin for the year averaged 16.5%, an improvement of more than the 2%, reflecting solid productivity and strong operating leverage. This is the highest operating margin in more than a decade.
Looking forward, margins should continue to expand. We still have operating leverage available, and we remain committed to driving further cost reduction. For the year, earnings per share increased 24%, and our annual return on capital employed improved to 12.4%, almost 2% higher than last year. 
In summary, we delivered significant improvements in 2010, some examples are: We completed our global cost-reduction actions and the Electronics business platform renewal; we repositioned our manufacturing centers; continued to leverage SAP; and further utilized our shared services centers. All of these actions contributed to increased productivity to the bottom line. Finally, we increased our dividends for the 28th consecutive year, as we made significant improvements in both our operating and free cash flow this year. 
Please turn to Slide 6. For the quarter, sales of $2.4 billion were 10% higher versus prior year. Underlying sales increased 8% year-on-year due to higher volumes in our Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage Gases and Merchant Gases segments. Sequentially, sales grew 4%. Underlying sales were up 3% on volume growth across all business segments. 
Operating income of $402 million increased 22% from prior year due to higher volumes. Operating income was up 7% versus prior quarter, mainly due to improved Electronics and Performance Materials results. Our operating margin improved to 17.1%, up 170 basis points versus prior year and 50 basis points sequentially. We remain on track to deliver our 17% goal for fiscal 2011. For the quarter, net income increased 19% and diluted earnings per share increased 18%, each versus prior year. Return on capital employed improved on an instantaneous or run rate basis to 13.2%, up almost 2%.
Turning to Slide 7 for a review of the factors that affected of the quarter's performance in terms of earnings per share. Our adjusted continuing operations earnings per share increased by $0.21. Higher volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials, Tonnage and Merchant segments helped to increase earnings per share by $0.28 year-on-year. 
Pricing, energy and raw materials together were unfavorable, subtracting $0.06. Costs were $0.04 favorable, as our productivity gains more than offset fixed cost inflation. Currency translation and foreign exchange netted to a $0.01 unfavorable impact. Higher equity affiliate income was more than offset by higher non-controlling interest for a net decline of $0.01. Higher interest expense, taxes and shares outstanding each cost us $0.01. 
In summary, we generated excellent financial results again this quarter. We're delivering on the improvements we told you about from our new investments and our cost-reduction efforts. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Simon to review our business segment results. Simon?"

Underlying sales improved by 5% on increased volumes with stable pricing. Currency reduced sales by 3%. Sales were up versus prior year due to continued strong Asia growth and improving volumes in both North America and Europe. 
Sequentially, sales were up 4%, principally from volume growth. Merchant Gases' operating income of $185 million was up 12% versus prior year and up 5% sequentially. Segment operating margin of 19.5% was up 170 basis points versus prior year and 20 basis points sequentially.
Income and margins were higher than prior year, driven by higher volumes, particularly in Asia, and improved productivity, partially offset by the impact of currency and higher power costs. New business signings for the year were up over last year and exceeded our targets across all regions. 
We recently announced the construction commenced on a new helium production facility in Wyoming, and we also just announced yesterday a further expansion of our Shanghai-based Asia Technology Center. This expansion will enhance our ability to develop Merchant Gas and Electronics Applications closely with our customers in this key growth region.
Let me now provide a few additional comments by region. Please turn to Slide 9. In North America, sales improved 5% versus prior year. Volumes were up 5%, with consistent growth across all product lines. Pricing was flat overall, with higher liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen pricing offset by lower liquid hydrogen pricing as a result of the pass-through of lower natural gas prices. LOX/LIN plant loading increased slightly and remained in the mid-70s. 
In Europe, sales decreased 8% versus prior year, primarily due to currency. Underlying sales were flat, with volumes increasing by 1% and pricing down 1%. Currency decreased sales by 8%. Our LOX/LIN volumes improved, however, healthcare was flat and packaged gas volumes continued to lag. Our LOX/LIN plant loading remained in the low 80s. 
In Asia, sales were up 17% versus last year, underlying sales increased 14%, with volumes up 11% and pricing up 3%. Currency increased sales by 3%. Volumes continued to improve, driven by a strong growth across all products and markets. We did see some sequential moderation due to reduced liquid oxygen peaking demand for steel. Plant loadings remained in the high 80s. We delivered real price improvement responding to higher power costs by raising prices on oxygen and nitrogen across the region. 
Please turn to Slide 10, Tonnage Gases. Tonnage Gases sales of $752 million increased 17% compared to last year. Volumes were up 4%, and the energy and raw material pass-through increased sales by 14%. Higher volumes were primarily driven by new plants and customers. Sequentially, sales were up 4%, with volumes up 2% and energy and raw material pass-through increasing sales by 2%. Volume growth was driven by loading existing assets. Operating income of $117 million was up 11% versus prior year, primarily due to higher volumes from new plant startups and down 2% sequentially due to operating bonus timing.
Operating margin of 15.6% decreased 80 basis points versus prior year due to the impact of higher natural gas cost pass-through. Sequentially, margins were lower due to volume mix. 
Earlier in the quarter, we announced plans to build a third air separation unit and expand our supply of oxygen, nitrogen and argon to ArcelorMittal's Gent, Belgium steel mill and increase our supply of Merchant Gases to the Northern European market. Last week, we announced plans to connect our Texas and Louisiana pipeline systems. This will create the world's largest hydrogen plant and pipeline system. The project will unite more than 20 plants with over 1 billion standard cubic feet a day of capacity and over 600 miles of pipeline. This will allow us to increase sales by better utilizing existing capacity, improve system efficiency by sourcing from our most efficient plants and better coordinating outage planning and improve customer supply reliability and flexibility.
Please turn to Slide 11, Electronics and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $523 million were up 20% compared to last year. Volumes increased 21% and pricing reduced sales by 1%. Electronic sales were up 25% compared to last year and 9% sequentially, as all industry segments grew beyond previous production peaks. 
Electronics Specialty Materials sales increased 19% versus prior year and 4% sequentially. Tonnage sales were 9% higher versus prior year. And our Equipment business reported the best quarter in two years, reflecting the expected pickup in orders due to improving new fab CapEx. Performance Materials sales increased 15% versus last year and 1% sequentially, reflecting volume growth across all markets.
Segment operating income of $84 million was up 71% versus prior year and 35% sequentially due to volume leverage and the full benefit of the restructuring actions finalized in Q3. Margins improved 480 basis points from last year and 350 basis points sequentially. Q4 margin of 16.1% exceeded our 15% operating margin goal for FY '11 with the highest quarterly margins since we began reporting this segment four years ago.
New business activity continues to grow in Electronics. As you saw last week, we announced an agreement to build two ammonia on-site purification plants for Sanan OptoElectronics in Wuhu in China. This is the world's first on-site, large-scale specialty gas plant and supports the high-growth LED market. Earlier, we announced the turnkey contract to supply our SunSource Solutions gases, equipment and services to a new photovoltaic facility in Malacca, Malaysia. 
Please turn to Slide 12, Equipment and Energy. Sales of $128 million were up 5% versus prior year and 11% sequentially, reflecting increased LNG activity. Operating income of $20 million increased significantly versus prior year due to higher LNG activity and favorable project performance. Our backlog versus prior year is higher due to the previously announced LNG orders but reduced sequentially. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul."

For our fiscal 2011, we are projecting that gradual economic recovery continues. We expect that manufacturing will continue as the leading sector in the recovery. Fiscal year 2010 growth was somewhat stronger than expected, led by Asia. We anticipate that growth will moderate in fiscal year 2011, as inventory restocking ends and global stimulus programs expire. We expect that regional differences will continue, with stronger growth in Asia and more gradual recoveries in the U.S. and Europe.
Based on our global footprint, we are planning for worldwide manufacturing growth of 3% to 4% for our fiscal 2011. Our current forecast is that the U.S. will see positive growth of 3% to 4% in manufacturing. Europe should be up about 1% to 2%, and we expect Asia will continue to be the strongest region, growing 6% to 7%, led by China. 
Volume growth will be the key factor driving earnings improvement in 2011 for us. New plant on-streams in 2010 and 2011 and loading our existing assets should each add $0.30 to $0.40 to EPS. Offsetting these volume gains, pension expense will be about a $0.10 headwind due to the drop in interest rates from September 2009 to September 2010 and lower asset returns. Based upon current rates, currency should not have a significant impact on earnings next year. 
Based on these factors and our economic outlook, we are forecasting our fiscal 2011 earnings from continuing operations to be between $5.50 and $5.70 per share, which represents a year-on-year earnings growth of 10% to 14%. 
Now turning to our outlook by business segment. In Merchant Gases, capacity utilization continues to improve globally. We continued to expand our merchant capacity in Asia. Last year, we delivered on our 1% operating margin improvement goal. For 2011, we are targeting to exceed our goal of 20%. 
In our Tonnage Gases segment, we will see the benefit from the full year loading of our fiscal year 2010 start-ups, along with a number of investments due to come on-stream of this year. The major projects that will drive the improvement from fiscal year 2010 fiscal year 2011 are: Our new well scale SMR for ExxonMobil in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which came on-stream towards the end of fiscal year 2010; a 2,000-ton-per-day oxygen plant for the Whiting Clean Energy gas fire is on target to start up towards the end of calendar year 2010; our new oxygen plant to supply Xingtai Iron and Steel should start up in March 2011; and our new pipeline near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada where we've added three new hydrogen customers to this franchise in the past year. 
On the new order front, we announced a significant number of new projects over the course of this past year, which will provide growth in 2012 and beyond. In Equipment and Energy, we expect results similar to last year's level. We do anticipate signing two or three LNG orders in this coming year. 
Within Electronics, we expect slow, steady growth next year, with newer segments like PV [photovoltaic] and LED growing at higher rates. Each of those silicon processes rebounded nicely in 2010. 
As we look across industry forecast for fiscal 2011, we project the MSI index will grow in the range of 5% to 10%. In the Integrated Circuit segment, which accounts for about 75% to 80% of our Electronics business, we are well positioned with the industry leaders who are bringing on new fabs and expanding capacity. As expected, electronics industry capital expenditures rebounded in 2010, and it is anticipated to continue to increase next year as well. So our Electronics Equipment business results in fiscal 2011 should grow accordingly. With the restructuring behind us, the benefits of our Electronics business' repositioning efforts have become more visible this quarter. 
Switching to Performance Materials, our growth expectations are solid, as we leverage our low-cost production facilities in Asia. And we continue to benefit from new product market and application successes. 
For the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, we continue to target improvement in our operating margins, with the goal of delivering 15% in 2011. Those are my thoughts on the business segments. 
Now shifting gears back to the total company. In an economic environment, cost control and cost reduction are important drivers of earnings, margin and return improvement. For 2011, we will remain diligent on discretionary spending, new programs and staffing. We will also continue to see the benefit of a number of structural cost reductions that we have made to reach our 2011 goals of a 17% operating margin. 
At this time, our tax rate guidance is for a rate similar to 2010, approximately 25% to 26%. We remain committed to delivering consistent, strong earnings growth, along with improved margins and returns throughout the economic cycle.
Turning to Slide #14. Our guidance for quarter one is for earnings per share of $1.31 to $1.35 based on the following factors. On the positive side, we expect to see increased earnings sequentially from the following areas: new plant on-streams, including our new SMR to serve ExxonMobil in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. We expect the manufacturing economy to continue its gradual recovery; finally, we expect a modest benefit from currency translation next quarter. 
Offsetting these sequential improvements are a few seasonal impacts in our businesses. In Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials, we will see lower seasonal demand. In Tonnage Gases, a number of customers have plant maintenance turnarounds on their facilities in this quarter. This will result in lower volumes in quarter one and higher maintenance spending on our part, as we time our maintenance to correspond with our customer shutdowns. And pension expenses previously mentioned will be a headwind. 
Please turn to Slide 15 for our capital spending outlook. Our capital spending for 2010 was $1.3 billion. For 2011, we expect our capital spending will be between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, excluding acquisitions. We continue to work on acquisition opportunities, including captive plants from customers, such as the MarkWest and Xingtai Steel projects. And we also continue to look for focused opportunities that complement our existing positions. The majority of our spending remains in the Tonnage area, with about $1 billion associated with new large plants and pipelines. When you look across all four business segments, about 75% of our growth CapEx is under long-term contracts.
Now let me give everyone a brief update on our Airgas offer. Please turn to Slide #16. 
As you all know, the Airgas shareholders voted to elect three independent board members nominated by Air Products and to support our three shareholder proposals at the September 15 meeting. We are pleased that the Delaware Chancellery Court rejected Airgas' challenge to the January meeting bylaw and upheld the validity of the shareholder vote. We will nominate another slate of independent directors for the 2011 meeting in January. We are disappointed that Airgas continues to oppose the will that its shareholders expressed at the 2010 Annual Meeting. As we have said before, Air Products stands ready to meet with Airgas, its directors and advisors to exchange information and to negotiate a mutually beneficial transaction. We remain convinced that such a meeting is in the best interest of both companies' shareholders.
If you are an Airgas shareholder, here is what we are asking you to do now: Continue to communicate to the Airgas board that the time is right to conclude a deal. Vote for the second group of highly qualified independent directors whom we will nominate for election at the January meeting. We need to continue to work together to drive this process to a successful conclusion for Airgas and Air Products.
Now let me wrap up. We had an excellent 2010, growing sales and earnings while making significant improvements in our operating margin and return on capital. As I just covered with you, we are well positioned to deliver further growth and improvements in 2011. The increase in capital spending we announced today along with the progress we have made on the Airgas transaction, gives us a number of excellent opportunities for the future beyond 2011. We remain committed to delivering a combination of growth, margin improvement and higher returns that will make us the best investment in the industry for our shareholders. Our whole team at Air Products is excited by the opportunities we have and are ready to deliver greater shareholder value in the future. 
Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to James to take your questions."
