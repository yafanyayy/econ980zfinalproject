Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call of People's United Financial. I am Philip Sherringham, President and CEO, and I will be presenting our results this morning with Paul Burner, our CFO. Other mem",708,"Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call of People's United Financial. I am Philip Sherringham, President and CEO, and I will be presenting our results this morning with Paul Burner, our CFO. Other members of our management team are here with us, and may answer questions as appropriate. I will be speaking from our quarterly slide deck, which is available under Investor Relations at www.peoples.com.Before we move on to the presentation, I'd like to remind you all to be sure to read our forward-looking statements on Slide 1. Now I'd like to start with a few comments about the current banking sector landscape prior to discussing the quarter's results. Against the backdrop of a painful multi-year global deleveraging process, the banking industry continues to be under pressure and additional consolidation can be expected. The reasons for this are clear and as follows.As we all know, of the approximately 8,500 banks in the United States, only 11 have total assets greater than $100 billion. The approximately 300 banks with asset between $1 billion and $100 billion generally share the following characteristics: assets consists primarily of loan and securities; approximately 70% of the loan book is secured by real estates and amidst of a long deleveraging cycle, housing remained depressed despite unprecedented government intervention and commercial real estate problems are just now beginning. Consumer loans represent approximately 11% of the average portfolio and commercial loans, on average, 19%. Today, both of the asset classes are generally impacted by higher credit costs, as well as reduced demand for credits.Borrowings represent 15% of liabilities on average. Non-interest revenue is just 23% of operating revenue, and capital-market activities are light to non-existent. Securities portfolio make up 25% of total assets on average and as the weakness of the economy persists, total returns will come under pressure. And last but not least, the return on average equity for the group in the third quarter of 2009 was a negative 14%.In the context of this environment, our earnings remained stable this quarter. Nonetheless, we're continuing to grow our commercial footings, while actively managing risk. Add to this mixture, a much-more-active regulatory environment, a forecast for hundreds of additional bank failures, along with increased willingness on the part of management teams of healthier banks to consider the merits of combinations and more M&A activity seems likely. Again as I noted earlier, consolidation within the bank industry is clearly necessary. The survivors will benefit from their low-cost deposit funding basis, and ability to write loans that are repaid. We continue to believe that we are well positioned for this once-in-a-generation opportunity.And so now on to Slide 2, operating net income for the fourth quarter was $28 million or $0.08 a share, excluding $4.5 million pretax or $0.01 after-tax of  non-recurring charges related to systems conversions and acquisition-related expenses. The quarter's results reflect continued growth in our core loan portfolios and deposits, despite a challenging environment. The margin held steady at $3.19 compared to the third quarter, which was up seven basis points from the second quarter of 2009. We'll speak to that in greater detail a bit later.Net loan charge-offs for the quarter decreased to 38 basis points for average loans on an annualized basis from 44 basis points in the third quarter of 2009, and were only 29 basis points for the full year. Our ratio of NPAs to loans, REO and repossessed assets moderately increased to 1.44% from 1.35% in the third quarter. I would note again, that our asset quality has held up remarkably well on both a relative and absolute basis through this most recent recessionary cycle, as we continue to enjoy limited lost content in our loan portfolio, and that most of the bad news is substantially behind us. We're pleased that our industry-leading tangible equity ratio remains strong at 18.2%. Pro forma for the pending acquisition of Financial Federal, this will increase again to 18.6%. And of course, we announced during the fourth quarter our acquisition of Financial Federal, a very attractive transaction that is immediately accretive, and which we expect to close on February 19. With that, I'll hand it over to Paul to provide you with the details of the quarter. Paul?"

Our net interest margin remained stable in the fourth quarter at 3.19%. Improvement in the spread was offset by growth in deposits. Our interests spread increased by three basis points, as liability costs decreased by more than the yield on earning assets. Higher average deposits of $236 million were invested in FED funds, which increased assets and offset the increase in spread, causing the margin to remain unchanged. We had a slight increase in non-performing assets in the quarter. NPAs increased nine basis points to 1.44%. Our experience is much better than others and in fact, our fourth quarter NPAs are roughly a third of those of our peers in the top 50 banks as of the third quarter. We continue to feel comfortable with our asset quality in the current environment because the strength of our initial underwriting, as well as our monitoring, resolution and loss control practices.Slide 5, provides a deeper dive into our C&I asset quality where the level of non-performers decreased somewhat during the quarter. So we saw an increase in charge-offs for the quarter. The portfolio is well diversified and continues to focus on core middle-market customers where we are able to provide better service than larger banks. Additionally, PCLC, our Equipment Finance business, finances mission-critical equipment that maintains value, coupled with our workout and resolution processes, we've been able to limit losses in this portfolio. By the way, this loss are being shared by Financial Federal as well.On Slide 6, you can see a breakout of our commercial real estate credit performance. NPA has dropped by 15 basis points to 1.34%, which is about 1/3 of the top 50 banks. And net charge-offs dropped back down to 12 basis points for the quarter. We remain comfortable with the overall quality of commercial real estate portfolio.The next slide shows a slight increase in NPAs for our mortgage portfolio to 2.7%, though charge-offs have dropped by 50% in the fourth quarter. Of the $52.7 million in mortgage NPLs, around 70% have current LTVs of less than 90%, suggesting minimal loss content for the overall portfolio. Our practice is to obtain updated appraisals at 90 days past due.  Generally, we had low average loan-to-values at origination and current FICO scores of 724. And again, I'd remind you that we stopped the portfolio in residential loans at the end of 2006.Slide 8, illustrates the credit quality trends for home equity for the fourth quarter of 2009, which remained flat compared to the third quarter. As you can see on the left of the page, the fourth quarter is 29 basis points of NPAs for us. Compares very favorably to the top 50 in our peer banks last quarter. Our net charge-offs swell up in the quarter, about 15% of the level of the top 50, and 20% of our peer group. Utilization rates are relatively steady at 48%. And we remain comfortable with this portfolio, which is an important part of our retail-customer relationships.The next slide reflects our charge-off experience over the past few years. Our loss ratio had dropped to 38 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2009 from 44 in the third. This is about 20% of both the top 50 banks in our peer group as of last quarter. We're also happy to point out that our full year charge-offs were 29 basis points. Due to our strong underwriting, we expect to continue to see minimal lost content, overall. On Slide 10, we take a look at our Texas ratio. And if you look at us relative to the industry, there continues to be no comparison. And now I'll hand it back to Philip."

We expect Financial Federal or FIF to close on Fe",753,"Thanks, Paul. As we've done traditionally in January, we want to provide you with some thoughts on what we expect in the coming year, taking into account, of course, the FIF, Financial Federal acquisition. We expect Financial Federal or FIF to close on February 19, 2010, which is three days after the special shareholder meeting. We're looking for core incremental-commercial and consumer-loan growth of $1 billion in the year, which will be offset by an estimated $100 million of Shared National Credit run-off, an additional $430 million of residential loan amortization. Adding FIF will not significantly change our earning asset total, as those loans will be funded with what is currently cash or investments.On the deposit front, we've had strong trends at the end of 2009 with growth exceeding our expectations. For 2010, we feel we'll retain these balances. So looking at period-end over period-end, growth will be modest. But full year average growth is expected to be approximately 4%. Additionally, we expect to see a continued slight reduction in our cost of deposits during the course of the year.Now to the margin. As we've mentioned, we expect a flat rate environment for the year. However, there should be some modest benefit for the net repricing of both assets and deposits, as well as significant benefit from the addition of FIF to the loan mix. Overall, we'd expect the margin for the year to increase in this scenario by about 45 basis points. But if we're wrong and rates do rise at some point, we are very well-positioned to reap further benefits. For every 100 basis points increase in the FED funds, our net interest income would increase by $50 million on an annualized basis.Regarding asset quality, we feel our current allowance level is appropriate for the portfolio, and that we will continue to cover our charge-offs with the provision. With the close of our Financial Federal acquisition, that portfolio will come over with a full-purchase accounting mark and should not incur therefore, any additional losses.Incremental growth in FIF's portfolio, post-closing, will incur provision expense in line with our existing methodology. We would expect our covered ratio to remain approximately at 120 [ph] on the legacy portfolio. Now please keep in mind that when we announced first quarter earnings, the entire FIF portfolio, that had been marked under FAS 141(R), so this ratio will mathematically decline for the combined portfolios. Overall, fee income further increased about 2.5% with bank service charges down $7.5 million due to the headwinds associated with low overdraft fee income, offset with growth in wealth management fees and then FIF contribution.On the expense front, of course, we've continue to limit expenditures where possible, but there'll be some incremental expenses as we complete our core systems conversion to Metavante, add the operations of FIF and incur contractual occupancy and annual compensation increases. As you may know, the legacy People's United franchise, had effectively, no data processing expense beyond personnel cost, as we own our now antiquated core system. The old treatment in Franchise is on an outsourced system, which will lead to some cost savings by transitioning the entire company to Metavante. However, on a net basis, there'll still be up approximately $8 million of incremental operating expense in 2010, and approximately $15 million of one-time non-operating conversion expenses in the year. Adding in the operation of FIF, quarterly operating expenses in 2010 are likely to average about $185 million. And finally, the tax rate for 2010 is expected to be approximately 33%.So to conclude on Slide 12, I'd like again to briefly highlight a continues strength of our position. We have a very strong balance sheet with an enviable 19% tangible capital ratio and no wholesale borrowings. We have exception asset quality with a low level of non-performing loans and a very low loss content within that portfolio. We have a low-cost stable deposit base and loyal, satisfied customers. We have excellent growth opportunities ahead of us, both organically and through acquisitions. To that point, we continue to focus on seeking acquisitions within the highly-desirable Northeast region from Maine to Washington DC. We are, however, also opened the possibility of transactions in other geographies, particularly FDIC transactions to the extent, so they may now be available in the Northeast. In addition, given our asset sensitivity, we are poised to leverage earnings growth when the economy recovers and as interest rates begin to increase. That concludes our presentation. And now, we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have."

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call of People's United Financial. I am Philip Sherringham, President and CEO, and I will be presenting our results this morning with Paul Burner, our CFO. Other mem",712,"Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call of People's United Financial. I am Philip Sherringham, President and CEO, and I will be presenting our results this morning with Paul Burner, our CFO. Other members of our management team are here with us, and may answer questions as appropriate. I will be speaking from our quarterly slide deck, which is available under Investor Relations at www.peoples.com.Before we move on to the presentation, I'd like to remind you all to be sure to read our forward-looking statements on Slide 1. Now I'd like to start with a few comments about the current banking sector landscape prior to discussing the quarter's results. Against the backdrop of a painful multi-year global deleveraging process, the banking industry continues to be under pressure and additional consolidation can be expected. The reasons for this are clear and as follows.As we all know, of the approximately 8,500 banks in the United States, only 11 have total assets greater than $100 billion. The approximately 300 banks with asset between $1 billion and $100 billion generally share the following characteristics: assets consists primarily of loan and securities; approximately 70% of the loan book is secured by real estates and amidst of a long deleveraging cycle, housing remained depressed despite unprecedented government intervention and commercial real estate problems are just now beginning. Consumer loans represent approximately 11% of the average portfolio and commercial loans, on average, 19%. Today, both of the asset classes are generally impacted by higher credit costs, as well as reduced demand for credits.Borrowings represent 15% of liabilities on average. Non-interest revenue is just 23% of operating revenue, and capital-market activities are light to non-existent. Securities portfolio make up 25% of total assets on average and as the weakness of the economy persists, total returns will come under pressure. And last but not least, the return on average equity for the group in the third quarter of 2009 was a negative 14%.In the context of this environment, our earnings remained stable this quarter. Nonetheless, we're continuing to grow our commercial footings, while actively managing risk. Add to this mixture, a much-more-active regulatory environment, a forecast for hundreds of additional bank failures, along with increased willingness on the part of management teams of healthier banks to consider the merits of combinations and more M&A activity seems likely. Again as I noted earlier, consolidation within the bank industry is clearly necessary. The survivors will benefit from their low-cost deposit funding basis, and ability to write loans that are repaid. We continue to believe that we are well positioned for this once in a [ph] generation opportunity.And so now on to Slide 2, operating net income for the fourth quarter was $28 million or $0.08 a share, excluding $4.5 million pretax or $0.01 after-tax of  non-recurring charges related to systems conversions and acquisition-related expenses. The quarter's results reflect continued growth in our core loan portfolios and deposits, despite a challenging environment. The margin held steady at $3.19 compared to the third quarter, which was up seven basis points from the second quarter of 2009. We'll speak to that in greater detail a bit later.Net loan charge-offs for the quarter decreased to 38 basis points for average loans on an annualized basis from 44 basis points in the third quarter of 2009, and were only 29 basis points for the full year. Our ratio of NPAs to loans, REO and repossessed assets moderately increased to 1.44% from 1.35% in the third quarter. I would note again, that our asset quality has held up remarkably well on both a relative and absolute basis through this most recent recessionary cycle, as we continue to enjoy limited lost content in our loan portfolio, and that most of the bad news is substantially behind us. We're pleased that our industry-leading tangible equity ratio remains strong at 18.2%. Pro forma for the pending acquisition of Financial Federal, this will increase again to 18.6%. And of course, we announced during the fourth quarter our acquisition of Financial Federal, a very attractive transaction that is immediately accretive, and which we expect to close on February 19. With that, I'll hand it over to Paul to provide you with the details of the quarter. Paul?"

Our net interest margin remained stable in the fourth quarter at 3.19%. Improvement in the spread was offset by growth in deposits. Our interests spread increased by three basis points, as liability costs decreased by more than the yield on earning assets. Higher average deposits of $236 million were invested in Fed funds, which increased assets and offset the increase in spread, causing the margin to remain unchanged. We had a slight increase in non-performing assets in the quarter. NPAs increased nine basis points to 1.44%. Our experience is much better than others and in fact, our fourth quarter NPAs are roughly a third of those of our peers in the top 50 banks as of the third quarter. We continue to feel comfortable with our asset quality in the current environment because the strength of our initial underwriting, as well as our monitoring, resolution and loss control practices.Slide 5, provides a deeper dive into our C&I asset quality where the level of non-performers decreased somewhat during the quarter, though we saw an increase in charge-offs for the quarter. The portfolio is well diversified and continues to focus on core middle-market customers where we are able to provide better service than larger banks. Additionally, PCLC, our Equipment Finance business, finances mission-critical equipment that maintains value, coupled with our workout and resolution processes, we've been able to limit losses in this portfolio. By the way, this loss are being shared by Financial Federal as well.On Slide 6, you can see a breakout of our commercial real estate credit performance. NPA has dropped by 15 basis points to 1.34%, which is about 1/3 of the top 50 banks. And net charge-offs dropped back down to 12 basis points for the quarter. We remain comfortable with the overall quality of our commercial real estate portfolio.The next slide shows a slight increase in NPAs for our mortgage portfolio to 2.07%, though charge-offs have dropped by 50% in the fourth quarter. Of the $52.7 million in mortgage NPLs, around 70% have current LTVs of less than 90%, suggesting minimal loss content for the overall portfolio. Our practice is to obtain updated appraisals at 90 days past due.  Generally, we had low average loan-to-values at origination and current FICO scores of 724. And again, I'd remind you that we stopped the portfolio in residential loans at the end of 2006.Slide 8, illustrates the credit quality trends for home equity for the fourth quarter of 2009, which remained flat compared to the third quarter. As you can see on the left of the page, the fourth quarter is 29 basis points of NPAs for us. Compares very favorably to the top 50 in our peer banks last quarter. Our net charge-offs swell up in the quarter, about 15% of the level of the top 50, and 20% of our peer group. Utilization rates are relatively steady at 48%. And we remain comfortable with this portfolio, which is an important part of our retail-customer relationships.The next slide reflects our charge-off experience over the past few years. Our loss ratio dropped to 38 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2009 from 44 in the third. This is about 20% of both the top 50 banks in our peer group as of last quarter. We're also happy to point out that our full year charge-offs were 29 basis points. Due to our strong underwriting, we expect to continue to see minimal lost content, overall. On Slide 10, we take a look at our Texas ratio. And if you look at us relative to the industry, there continues to be no comparison. And now I'll hand it back to Philip."

As we've done traditionally in January, we want to provide you with some thoughts on what we expect in the coming year, taking into account, of course, the FIF, Financial Federal acquisition. We expect Financial Federal or FIF to close on February 19, 2010, which is three days after the special shareholder meeting. We're looking for core incremental-commercial and consumer-loan growth of $1 billion in the year, which will be offset by an estimated $100 million of Shared National Credit run-off, an additional $430 million of residential loan amortization. Adding FIF will not significantly change our earning asset total, as those loans will be funded with what is currently cash or investments.On the deposit front, we've had strong trends at the end of 2009 with growth exceeding our expectations. For 2010, we feel we'll retain these balances. So looking at period-end over period-end, growth will be modest. But full year average growth is expected to be approximately 4%. Additionally, we expect to see a continued slight reduction in our cost of deposits during the course of the year.Now to the margin. As we've mentioned, we expect a flat rate environment for the year. However, there should be some modest benefit for the net repricing of both assets and deposits, as well as significant benefit from the addition of FIF to the loan mix. Overall, we'd expect the margin for the year to increase in this scenario by about 45 basis points. But if we're wrong and rates do rise at some point, we are very well-positioned to reap further benefits. For every 100 basis points increase in the FED funds, our net interest income would increase by $50 million on an annualized basis.Regarding asset quality, we feel our current allowance level is appropriate for the portfolio, and that we will continue to cover our charge-offs with the provision. With the close of our Financial Federal acquisition, that portfolio will come over with a full-purchase accounting mark and should not incur therefore, any additional losses.Incremental growth in FIF's portfolio, post-closing, will incur provision expense in line with our existing methodology. We would expect our covered ratio to remain approximately at 120 [ph] on the legacy portfolio. Now please keep in mind that when we announced first quarter earnings, the entire FIF portfolio, that had been marked under FAS 141(R), so this ratio will mathematically decline for the combined portfolios. Overall, fee income further increased about 2.5% with bank service charges down $7.5 million due to the headwinds associated with low overdraft fee income, offset with growth in wealth management fees and then FIF contribution.On the expense front, of course, we've continue to limit expenditures where possible, but there'll be some incremental expenses as we complete our core systems conversion to Metavante, add the operations of FIF and incur contractual occupancy and annual compensation increases. As you may know, the legacy People's United franchise, had effectively, no data processing expense beyond personnel cost, as we own our now antiquated core system. The old thread [ph]  Franchise is on an outsourced system, which will lead to some cost savings by transitioning the entire company to Metavante. However, on a net basis, there'll still be up approximately $8 million of incremental operating expense in 2010, and approximately $15 million of one-time non-operating conversion expenses in the year. Adding in the operation of FIF, quarterly operating expenses in 2010 are likely to average about $185 million. And finally, the tax rate for 2010 is expected to be approximately 33%.So to conclude on Slide 12, I'd like again to briefly highlight a continues strength of our position. We have a very strong balance sheet with an enviable 19% tangible capital ratio and no wholesale borrowings. We have exception asset quality with a low level of non-performing loans and a very low loss content within that portfolio. We have a low-cost stable deposit base and loyal, satisfied customers. We have excellent growth opportunities ahead of us, both organically and through acquisitions. To that point, we continue to focus on seeking acquisitions within the highly-desirable Northeast region from Maine to Washington DC. We are, however, also opened the possibility of transactions in other geographies, particularly FDIC transactions to the extent, so they may now be available in the Northeast. In addition, given our asset sensitivity, we are poised to leverage earnings growth when the economy recovers and as interest rates begin to increase. That concludes our presentation. And now, we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome, of course, to the First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call of People's United Financial. Again, I'm Philip Sherringham, President and CEO, and I will be presenting our results today with Paul Burner,",591,"Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome, of course, to the First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call of People's United Financial. Again, I'm Philip Sherringham, President and CEO, and I will be presenting our results today with Paul Burner, our CFO. Other members of our management team are here with us and may answer questions as appropriate. I will be speaking from our quarterly slide deck, which is available under Investor Relations at www.peoples.com.
As you all have seen in our earnings release, we're pleased to report that People's United continues to benefit from its fortress balance sheet characterized by a strong capital position and ongoing solid asset quality. We continue to grow our Commercial portfolio during the quarter while managing risk. 
Other highlights of the quarter include the closing and integration of Financial Federal. This integration, which is substantially complete, has so far progressed very smoothly, and the operations immediately began adding to the bottom line.
Second, the successful conversion of our Southern New England franchise onto a new FIS Metavante core systems platform, reflecting a tremendous amount of time and effort by employees toward the bank. This is something our investors don't see on a day-to-day basis, but it's a very important component of our growth strategy. It provide significant operating efficiencies and allows us to continue to offer the award-winning customer service for which we're known. We're looking forward to the conversion of our Northern New England franchise in July. After which time, our entire franchise will be on one core system.
Finally, a continued active due diligence process on both open banks and FDIC opportunities. We remain convinced that the best deployment of our excess capital is an FDIC assisted and whole-bank acquisitions in attractive markets with high population density. While it's difficult to predict with certainty, we are pursuing a number of opportunities and feel confident that we'll have an announcement in the near future. Before we move on to the presentation, I'd like to remind you please to all be sure to read our forward-looking statements on Slide 1. 
And now on to Slide 2. Operating net income for the first quarter was $29.2 million or $0.08 a share, excluding $23.4 million pretax or $0.04 a share after tax of non-recurring charges related to system conversion and acquisition-related expenses. The quarter's results reflect continued growth in our core Loan portfolios and deposits despite the challenging environment.
Our margin benefited from the Financial Federal acquisition, increasing to 3.47%, compared to fourth quarter's 3.19%. We'll speak to that in greater detail a bit later. Net Loan charge-offs for the quarter decreased to 26 basis points of average loans on an annualized basis from 38 basis points in the fourth quarter 2009, which was our second consecutive quarterly decline in net charge-offs. On the other hand, due to continued economic weakness in our markets, our ratio of NPAs to originated loans, REO and repossessed assets did increase to 1.74% from 1.44% in the fourth quarter. 
I would note again that our asset quality has held up remarkably well on both a relative and absolute basis through this most recent recession that we continue to enjoy limited loss content in our Loan portfolio and that most of the bad news is substantially behind us. We're pleased that our industry-leading tangible equity ratio remained strong at 18.6%, and actually increased 40 basis points as a result of the addition of Financial Federal. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Paul to provide you with details on the quarter. Paul?"
295774,100503658,56402,"People's United Financial Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2010",2010-04-16,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Philip, and good morning, everyone. As Philip mentioned, our overall net interest margin increased to 3.47%, up 28 basis points from the 3.19% in the fourth quarter. Improvement in the spread was primarily due to higher yields in our Loan portf",985,"Thank you, Philip, and good morning, everyone. As Philip mentioned, our overall net interest margin increased to 3.47%, up 28 basis points from the 3.19% in the fourth quarter. Improvement in the spread was primarily due to higher yields in our Loan portfolio due to the acquisition of Financial Federal, as well as the reduction in deposit costs. Deposit costs of 78 basis points in the first quarter were down 16 basis points from the 94 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2009. For the month of March, our margin was 3.76%, which reflected the benefit of Financial Federal for the whole month. Therefore, we expect further improvement in the margin for the second quarter.
Moving on to Slide 4, as unemployment remains high and the economy remains weak, we saw an additional increase in non-performing assets in the quarter. NPAs increased to 1.74% from 1.44% of Loans and REO. As you can see in the footnote, due to the acquisition of Fin Fed and the 141(r) credit mark on their portfolio, we're presenting this information as a ratio of NPAs to originated loans. However, the NPAs do include acquired repossessed assets from Fin Fed. Our experience remains much better than others as you can see. And because of the strength of our original underwriting, as well as our monitoring resolution and loss control practices, we continue to feel comfortable with our asset quality in the current environment. 
As we've done in the past, Slide 5 provides a deeper dive into our Commercial and Equipment Financing asset quality. Again, due to the credit mark, the loans acquired from Fin Fed are fully marked. However, going forward, new loans originated since the acquisition will be included here in NPLs as warranted. While NPLs increased in the quarter, you can see that our losses decreased and remained very manageable at 15 basis points, annualized for the quarter. The portfolio is well diversified and continues to focus on core middle-market customers, where we're able to provide better service than larger banks. Additionally, our Equipment Financing business has financed mission-critical equipment that maintains value. Coupled with our work-out and resolution processes, we've been able to limit losses in this portfolio.
On Slide 6, you can see a breakout of our Commercial Real Estate credit performance. NPLs continue to decline for the second consecutive quarter to 1.21%, while net charge-offs increased to 43 basis points annualized, reflecting $4.3 million of higher charge-offs. We expect that there continue to be some choppiness as we've seen in the past few quarters to this ratio given the size of Commercial Real Estate loans. Construction loan balances continue to decline and are now about 5% of total loans.
Residential loans continue to run off. And as this portfolio declines, we would anticipate NPLs as a percentage to increase. However, actual loss content remains very low. This quarter, while NPLs rose to $66.7 million or 2.7% of Residential loans, net charge-offs were only one basis point. Looking at the group of NPLs, approximately 70% have current loan-to-values less than 90%, which is consistent with last quarter and suggests to our continued low loss content in the portfolio. Generally, we had low average loan-to-values at origination and current FICO scores of 721. I would also remind you that we stopped portfolioing Residential loans at the end of 2006.
Slide 8 illustrates credit quality trends for Home Equity for the first quarter of 2010, which remained similar compared to the fourth quarter. As you can see on the left of the page, the first quarter's 35 basis points of NPLs for us compares very favorably to both the Top 50 and our peer banks last quarter. Our net charge-offs declined in the quarter and are less than 10% of the level of the Top 50 and of our peer group. Utilization rates are steady at 48%. While growth in this portfolio has moderated due to customer preference over the past few quarters, we continue to feel this is an important part of our retail customer relationships.
We're especially proud of the data on the next slide, which reflects our charge-off experience over the past few years. As you know, banking is about managing risks, and I think this shows that we do that very well. Our loss ratio dropped to 26 basis points in the first quarter of 2010 from 38 in the fourth, and this is about 10% of the Top 50 banks and 13% of our peer group as of last quarter. Due to our strong underwriting, we expect to continue to see minimal loss content overall.
Slide 10, we take a look at our taxes ratio. As you know, this is a measure of credit compared to capital, both very important items to our bank. If you look at us relative to the industry, there continues to be no comparison.
Moving on to Slide 11, we want to take a brief moment to highlight our asset-sensitive position. We remain one of if not the most asset-sensitive bank in the country. This has been a burden as we live through this period of very low rates, but will be a benefit to us as rates begin to rise at some point in the future. Some have tried to discount this by arguing that our asset sensitivity derives solely from our excess capital. And once it's deployed, the benefit will evaporate. Well, while half of our asset sensitivity is indeed due to the excess capital of approximately $2.5 million, the other half is due to the structure of our balance sheet, which has not changed. Any rate increase will flow to the bottom line, increasing earnings whether that capital is deployed or not. So as you all look out and ponder a higher rate environment, don't forget that we will stand to win in such an environment. And now I'll hand it back to Philip."

We feel that our time has come, and we will be rewarded for this patience and discipline as we progress to 2010. 
To conclude on Slide 12, I'd like to briefly highlight the continued strength of our position. We have a very strong balance sheet with an enviable 19% tangible capital ratio and no wholesale borrowings. We have exceptional asset quality with a low level of non-performing loans, and a very low loss content within that portfolio. We have a low-cost, stable deposit base and loyal satisfied customers. We have excellent growth opportunities ahead of us, both organically and through acquisitions. To that point, we continue to focus on seeking acquisitions within geographies that are both wealth and population density. We feel these transactions could be in the form of open-bank transactions, as well as FDIC-assisted deals. In addition, as Paul just pointed out, our asset sensitivity provides significant earnings and operating leverage as interest rates begin to increase.
This concludes our presentation. And now we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome, of course, to the First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call of People's United Financial. Again, I'm Philip Sherringham, President and CEO, and I will be presenting our results today with Paul Burner, our CFO. Other members of our management team are here with us and may answer questions as appropriate. I will be speaking from our quarterly slide deck, which is available under Investor Relations at www.peoples.com.
As you all have seen in our earnings release, we're pleased to report that People's United continues to benefit from its fortress balance sheet characterized by a strong capital position and ongoing solid asset quality. We continue to grow our Commercial portfolio during the quarter while managing risk. 
Other highlights of the quarter include the closing and integration of Financial Federal. This integration, which is substantially complete, has so far progressed very smoothly, and the operations immediately began adding to the bottom line.
Second, the successful conversion of our Southern New England franchise onto a new FIS Metavante core systems platform, reflecting a tremendous amount of time and effort by employees toward the bank. This is something our investors don't see on a day-to-day basis, but it's a very important component of our growth strategy. It provide significant operating efficiencies and allows us to continue to offer the award-winning customer service for which we're known. We're looking forward to the conversion of our Northern New England franchise in July. After which time, our entire franchise will be on one core system.
Finally, a continued active due diligence process on both open banks and FDIC opportunities. We remain convinced that the best deployment of our excess capital is an FDIC assisted and whole-bank acquisitions in attractive markets with high population density. While it's difficult to predict with certainty, we are pursuing a number of opportunities and feel confident that we'll have an announcement in the near future. Before we move on to the presentation, I'd like to remind you please to all be sure to read our forward-looking statements on Slide 1. 
And now on to Slide 2. Operating net income for the first quarter was $29.2 million or $0.08 a share, excluding $23.4 million pretax or $0.04 a share after tax of non-recurring charges related to system conversion and acquisition-related expenses. The quarter's results reflect continued growth in our core Loan portfolios and deposits despite the challenging environment.
Our margin benefited from the Financial Federal acquisition, increasing to 3.47%, compared to fourth quarter's 3.19%. We'll speak to that in greater detail a bit later. Net Loan charge-offs for the quarter decreased to 26 basis points of average loans on an annualized basis from 38 basis points in the fourth quarter 2009, which was our second consecutive quarterly decline in net charge-offs. On the other hand, due to continued economic weakness in our markets, our ratio of NPAs to originated loans, REO and repossessed assets did increase to 1.74% from 1.44% in the fourth quarter. 
I would note again that our asset quality has held up remarkably well on both a relative and absolute basis through this most recent recession that we continue to enjoy limited loss content in our Loan portfolio and that most of the bad news is substantially behind us. We're pleased that our industry-leading tangible equity ratio remained strong at 18.6%, and actually increased 40 basis points as a result of the addition of Financial Federal. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Paul to provide you with details on the quarter. Paul?"
295774,100503658,56473,"People's United Financial Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 16, 2010",2010-04-16,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Philip, and good morning, everyone. As Philip mentioned, our overall net interest margin increased to 3.47%, up 28 basis points from the 3.19% in the fourth quarter. Improvement in the spread was primarily due to higher yields in our Loan portf",983,"Thank you, Philip, and good morning, everyone. As Philip mentioned, our overall net interest margin increased to 3.47%, up 28 basis points from the 3.19% in the fourth quarter. Improvement in the spread was primarily due to higher yields in our Loan portfolio due to the acquisition of Financial Federal, as well as the reduction in deposit costs. Deposit costs of 78 basis points in the first quarter were down 16 basis points from the 94 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2009. For the month of March, our margin was 3.76%, which reflected the benefit of Financial Federal for the whole month. Therefore, we expect further improvement in the margin for the second quarter.
Moving on to Slide 4, as unemployment remains high and the economy remains weak, we saw an additional increase in non-performing assets in the quarter. NPAs increased to 1.74% from 1.44% of Loans and REO. As you can see in the footnote, due to the acquisition of Fin Fed and the 141(r) credit mark on their portfolio, we're presenting this information as a ratio of NPAs to originated loans. However, the NPAs do include acquired repossessed assets from Fin Fed. Our experience remains much better than others as you can see. And because of the strength of our original underwriting, as well as our monitoring resolution and loss control practices, we continue to feel comfortable with our asset quality in the current environment. 
As we've done in the past, Slide 5 provides a deeper dive into our Commercial and Equipment Financing asset quality. Again, due to the credit mark, the loans acquired from Fin Fed are fully marked. However, going forward, new loans originated since the acquisition will be included here in NPLs as warranted. While NPLs increased in the quarter, you can see that our losses decreased and remained very manageable at 15 basis points, annualized for the quarter. The portfolio is well diversified and continues to focus on core middle-market customers, where we're able to provide better service than larger banks. Additionally, our Equipment Financing business has financed mission-critical equipment that maintains value. Coupled with our workout and resolution processes, we've been able to limit losses in this portfolio.
On Slide 6, you can see a breakout of our Commercial Real Estate credit performance. NPLs continue to decline for the second consecutive quarter to 1.21%, while net charge-offs increased to 43 basis points annualized, reflecting $4.3 million of higher charge-offs. We expect that there continue to be some choppiness as we've seen in the past few quarters to this ratio given the size of Commercial Real Estate loans. Construction loan balances continue to decline and are now about 5% of total loans.
Residential loans continue to run off. And as this portfolio declines, we would anticipate NPLs as a percentage to increase. However, actual loss content remains very low. This quarter, while NPLs rose to $66.7 million or 2.7% of Residential loans, net charge-offs were only one basis point. Looking at the group of NPLs, approximately 70% have current loan-to-values less than 90%, which is consistent with last quarter and suggests continued low loss content in the portfolio. Generally, we had low average loan-to-values at origination and current FICO scores of 721. I would also remind you that we stopped portfolio-ing residential loans at the end of 2006.
Slide 8 illustrates credit quality trends for home equity for the first quarter of 2010, which remained similar compared to the fourth quarter. As you can see on the left of the page, the first quarter's 35 basis points of NPLs for us compares very favorably to both the Top 50 and our peer banks last quarter. Our net charge-offs declined in the quarter and are less than 10% of the level of the Top 50 and of our peer group. Utilization rates are steady at 48%. While growth in this portfolio has moderated due to customer preference over the past few quarters, we continue to feel this is an important part of our retail customer relationships.
We're especially proud of the data on the next slide, which reflects our charge-off experience over the past few years. As you know, banking is about managing risks, and I think this shows that we do that very well. Our loss ratio dropped to 26 basis points in the first quarter of 2010 from 38 in the fourth, and this is about 10% of the Top 50 banks and 13% of our peer group as of last quarter. Due to our strong underwriting, we expect to continue to see minimal loss content overall.
Slide 10, we take a look at our taxes ratio. As you know, this is a measure of credit compared to capital, both very important items to a bank. If you look at us relative to the industry, there continues to be no comparison.
Moving on to Slide 11. We want to take a brief moment to highlight our asset-sensitive position. We remain one of, if not the most asset-sensitive bank in the country. This has been a burden as we’ve lived through this period of very low rates but will be a benefit to us as rates begin to rise at some point in the future. Some have tried to discount this by arguing that our asset sensitivity derives solely from our excess capital. And once it's deployed, the benefit will evaporate. Well, while half of our asset sensitivity is indeed due to the excess capital of approximately $2.5 billion, the other half is due to the structure of our balance sheet, which has not changed. Any rate increase will flow to the bottom line, increasing earnings whether that capital is deployed or not. So as you all look out and ponder a higher rate environment, don't forget that we will stand to win in such an environment. And now I'll hand it back to Philip."

As we look at this conclusion slide, I want to point out that while these conclusions are familiar to most of you, they do reflect our patience and discipline, which remain hallmarks of how we are managing this institution. We feel that our time has come, and we will be rewarded for this patience and discipline as we progress to 2010. 
To conclude on Slide 12, I'd like to briefly highlight the continued strength of our position. We have a very strong balance sheet with an enviable 19% tangible capital ratio and no wholesale borrowings. We have exceptional asset quality with a low level of non-performing loans and very low loss contents within that portfolio. We have a low-cost, stable deposit base and loyal satisfied customers. We have excellent growth opportunities ahead of us, both organically and through acquisitions. To that point, we continue to focus on seeking acquisitions within geographies that are both wealth and population density. We feel these transactions could be in the form of open-bank transactions, as well as FDIC-assisted deals. In addition, as Paul just pointed out, our asset sensitivity provides significant earnings and operating leverage as interest rates begin to increase.
This concludes our presentation. And now we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have."

We think that a prudential regulator should supervise the consumer financial protection agency in whatever form it ends up existing, I guess. So that's worry number one. Worry number two sort of equals worry number one, by the way, is the preemption issue.

Because in part most likely now that those multiples have recovered, some banks are going to ask themselves a question, where does the next leg come from in terms of earnings, how are they grow earnings going forward, and wouldn't it take more sense to associate with a larger, stronger company such as ourselves.

Good morning again and welcome to the People’s United Financial Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. 
As you can see on slide two, this call has a dual purpose, both to outline our second quarter 2010 results and to provide detail on our two acquisitions announced yesterday.
On slide three, we provide an overview of our second quarter results. Operating net income for the quarter was $31.8 million or the $0.09 per share, excluding $23.2 million pre-tax or $0.05 per share of one time cost related to the former CEO’s separation agreement, merger related and system’s convergence cost. 
The quarter’s results reflect continued growth in our core loan portfolios and deposits despite continued economic challenges.
The margin increased to 3.68% compared to 3.47% in the first quarter, primarily due to the full quarter benefit of the financial federal acquisition. Net charge-off increased to $17.8 million or 46 basis points from 26 basis points in the prior quarter. Both non-interest income and non-interest expense are higher primarily as a result of the acquisition of Financial Federal and Butler Bank.
On slide four, during the second quarter, we made significant progress in our systems conversion project. In fact this weekend, we will complete our core systems conversions including our customers in Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine markets. 
At the same time, we will be re-branding our branches in those markets to People’s United Bank. We are pleased to have reached this milestone which will provide instant recognition of the People’s United brand from Maine to New York.
Additionally, we continue to focus on organic growth with two new locations expected to be open in downtown Boston before year-end. These branches will provide an important extension of our growing footprints in the Greater Boston area. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased $52 million of our common stock equal to 3.7 million shares at an average price of $13.98. The repurchase program was affected through open market purchases. We will continue to evaluate the returns available to us, by our share repurchases, relative to the rest of our capital deployment opportunities.
Finally, we have maintained our focus on becoming a preferred acquirer in the North East. We were pleased to announce yesterday our acquisition of Smithtown Bancorp and LSB Corp. which we will discuss in greater detail later in this call.
With that, I’ll hand it over to Paul to provide with you details on the quarter. Paul?

As Jack mentioned, our overall net interest margin increased to 3.68%, up 21 basis points from the 3.47% in the fourth quarter. The core margin improvement was primarily due to the acquisition of Financial Federal as well as lower deposit costs. As a reminder, Financial Federal closed on February 19. 
Respectively, we see additional opportunity for improvement. You’ll notice on our June 30th balance sheet, an increase in the available for sale securities, we are now more willing to temporarily deploy excess capital in short-term investments yielding more than the fed funds rate than we previously have. This moderate change is in recognition that fund rates will likely remain low well into 2011. Investments to date have been concentrated in short-term agency debentures yielding approximately 90 basis points.
Moving on to slide six is unemployment remains high and the economy remains weak. We saw an additional increase in non-performing assets in the quarter. NPAs increased to 2.01% from 174 of loans in REO. 
Compared to the first quarter average of our peer group in the top 50 banks however, our ratio remains extraordinarily healthy and less than half their levels and we continue to feel comfortable with our asset quality in the current environment. The acquisition of Financial Federal and Butler Bank served to increase the NPAs to loan ratio over the last couple of quarters as the ratio includes their REO and repos.
Slide seven. Net charge-offs in the commercial and equipment financing segment increased to 92 basis points annualized for the quarter from 15 basis points last quarter. The difference is $8.4 million which consisted of one CNI charge-off of $6 million and one equipment financing charge off of $2.4 million which are larger than normal individual charge-offs for those businesses.
On slide 8, you can see a breakout of our commercial real estate credit performance, our NPAs continue to hold steady at 1.23% while our net charge-offs dropped to 35 basis points annualized. Our portfolio is well diversified and we believe we will continue to see strong portfolio growth opportunities.
Slide 9 illustrates our residential loan credit performance. As you can see our NPLs have increased to 3.4%, non-performing residential mortgage resolution is taking much longer than previously as a result of a much lower foreclosure process in the chorus. As you can see in the bottom chart, our loss content has been low and we believe it will continue to be low because we have (both) loan-to-values at origination and because approximately 83% of our non-performing loans have loan-to-value ratios less than 90%. This just leaves 14 million of non-performing loans, with loan-to-values greater than 90%. Given attractive spreads we have again began holding some residential mortgages in portfolio.
On slide 10, you can see our home equity NPLs continue to be low, our net charge-offs declined again in the quarter to three basis points and utilizations rates are steady at 48%. We continue to feel this is an important part of our retail customer relationships.
Slide 11, reflects our charge off experience over the past few years. We believe that the range over the last three to four quarters is consistent with the current weak economic environment.
And slide 12 speaks to our competitive advantage rather to the industry with charge above asset quality and capital. With that I would now handed back to Jack to describe the acquisitions we announced yesterday.

I’m pleased to talk about these two transactions. Slide 14, illustrates the maps which show that Smithtown Bancorp and LSB acquisitions announced yesterday support our stated acquisition strategy of growth and contiguous and near contiguous markets.
Smithtown Bancorp is based on Long Island with $2.4 billion in assets in 30 branches. It operates as Bank of Smithtown and is the largest commercial bank headquartered on Long Island. We are excited about the attractive branch network situated in high traffic locations and equipped in most cases with multilane drivers. We have also learned that Bank of Smithtown employee’s quality of training and commitment to their customers is very similar to our award-winning customer service experience.
In total, Smithtown represents a natural extension of our brand within the New York City metro area and is an excellent compliment to our existing commitment to convenience and customer service.
LSB Corp with $800 million in assets and seven branches operates as RiverBank, a commercial bank headquartered in North Andover. We’ve been impressed with the team at LSB and look forward to working with them as we grow the combined franchise. LSB Corp is an excellent extension of our commitment to the Greater Boston and Massachusetts markets in a logical next step forward in our Butler Bank acquisition which closed in April.
With respect to Butler, you should know that after three months we are pleased to have retained 97% of our customer deposits well ahead of our expectations despite aggressive competitive efforts. We expect LSB and Butler in combination to be further supported by the opening of our two branches later this year in downtown Boston. The seven-day branch location in the Prudential Center and a large branch in the heart of financial district which will contain wealth management and commercial banking personnel. 
As the largest bank headquarter in New England, its only natural for us to be actively growing in the largest city in New England. 
Slide 15 provides some detail that we’ve just discussed and slide 16 summarizes our rational for expansion into these attractive contiguous markets, most importantly both field exceed our internal financial hurdles. We expect a greater than 15% internal return of rate and significant EPS accretion, in addition we expect tangible book value delusion to be earned back period of approximately five years. 
On slide 17, you see an overview of both bank loan portfolios. As of March 31, Smithtown Bancorp had a loan balance of $2 billion. NPAs made up 10.3% of loans and over the previous 12 months they charge off 1.8% of loans. We believe the 10.4% is the conservative estimate of our cumulative future loan losses. For the same period end LSB Corp had a loan balance of approximately $500 million, NPAs made up 2% of loans and over the previous 12 months they charged off 18 basis points of loans. We believe 3% is conservative estimate of cumulative future loan losses. 
In slide 18, Smithtown Bancorp has deposit balances of 1.9 billion at a cost of 1.7% and 58% of deposits are in checking, savings and money market accounts. LSB Corp has deposit balance of approximately 500 million at a cost of 1.8% and 55% of deposits are in checking, savings and money market accounts. Given our strong retail and commercial banking model we believe we will be able to significantly lower these deposit costs over time.
Slide 19 provides a summary of key terms of the transactions. Smithtown Bancorp and LSB Corp shareholder approval and regulatory approval is needed. I would note that People’s United shareholder approval is not needed for either of these transactions. We intend to repurchase the shares being issued in conjunction with the Smithtown transaction and we expect both of these transactions to close in the fourth quarter of this year.
Slide 20 outlines key metrics and assumptions. We believe this is conservative pricing as we are paying 0.5% times changeable book for Smithtown and 1.5 changeable book for LSB. You will note we are assuming a very achievable 15% cost savings for Smithtown and 30% for LSB.
On slide 21 you can see the pro forma impact. These transactions increase our assets by $3 billion and deposits by 2.5 billion and add 37 branches to our network. We also expect earnings accretion of approximately $0.10 per share and as stated earlier, we expect to earn the tangible book value dilution back within five years.
In summary on slide 22, we are confident in how we are positioned. We have a strong balance sheet with a pro-forma tangible capital ratio of 15%. Moreover, we are beginning to execute on a strong opportunity set. We closed Financial Federal and Butler in the first half of 2010, announced the acquisitions of Smithtown Bancorp and LSB Corp, and our acquisition pipeline remains robust. We continue to drive growth and profitability improvements within our core businesses and are integrating our closed and recently announced acquisitions. In addition we constantly evaluate the returns available by our share repurchases and dividend payout.
This concludes our presentation. And now, we will be happy to answer any of the questions you may have.

Good morning, again, and welcome to the People's United Financial Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. As you can see on Slide 2, this call has a dual purpose: Both to outline our second quarter 2010 results and to provide detail on our two acquisitions announced yesterday. 
On Slide 3, we provide an overview of our second quarter results. Operating net income for the quarter was $31.8 million or $0.09 per share, excluding $23.2 million pretax or $0.05 per share of one-time costs related to the former CEO's separation agreement, merger-related and systems conversion costs. The quarter's results reflect continued growth in our core loan portfolios and deposits despite continued economic challenges. 
The margin increased to 3.68% compared to 3.47% in the first quarter, primarily due to the full quarter benefit of the Financial Federal acquisition. Net charge offs increased to $17.8 million or 46 basis points from 26 basis points in the prior quarter. Both non-interest income and non-interest expense are higher, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Financial Federal and Butler Bank.
On Slide 4, during the second quarter, we made significant progress in our systems conversion project. In fact, this weekend, we will complete our core systems conversion, including our customers in Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine markets. At the same time, we will be rebranding our branches in those markets to People's United Bank. We are pleased to have reached this milestone, which will provide instant recognition of the People's United brand from Maine to New York. 
Additionally, we continue to focus on organic growth, with two new locations expected to be opened in downtown Boston before year end. These branches will provide an important extension of our growing footprint in the greater Boston area. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased $52 million of our common stock, equal to 3.7 million shares, at an average price of $13.98. The repurchase program was affected through open market purchases. We will continue to evaluate the returns available to us via share repurchases, relative to the rest of our capital deployment opportunities. 
Finally, we have maintained our focus on becoming a preferred acquirer in the Northeast. We were pleased to announce yesterday our acquisitions of Smithtown Bancorp and LSB Corp., which we will discuss in greater detail later in this call. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Paul to provide you with details on the quarter. Paul?"
295774,109059137,67619,"People's United Financial Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2010",2010-07-16,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jack, and good morning to you all. As Jack mentioned, our overall net interest margin increased to 3.68%, up 21 basis points from the 3.47% in the fourth quarter. The core margin improvement was primarily due to the acquisition of Financial F",577,"Thank you, Jack, and good morning to you all. As Jack mentioned, our overall net interest margin increased to 3.68%, up 21 basis points from the 3.47% in the fourth quarter. 
The core margin improvement was primarily due to the acquisition of Financial Federal, as well as lower deposit costs. As a reminder, Financial Federal closed on February 19. Respectively, we see additional opportunity for improvement. You'll notice on our June 30 balance sheet an increase in the available for sale securities, we are now more willing to temporarily deploy excess capital and short-term investments, yielding more than the Fed Funds rate than we previously have. This moderate change is in recognition that Fed Funds rate will likely remain low well into 2011. Investments to date have been concentrated in short-term agency debentures yielding approximately 90 basis points.
Moving on to Slide 6, as unemployment remains high and the economy remains weak, we saw an additional increase in nonperforming assets in the quarter. NPAs increased to 2.01% from 1.74% of loans in REO. Compared to the first quarter average of our peer group and the top 50 banks, however, our ratio remains extraordinarily healthy and less than half their levels, and we continue to feel comfortable with our asset quality in the current environment. The acquisition of Financial Federal and Butler Bank, served to increase the NPAs to loan ratio over the last couple of quarters, is the ratio, includes their REO and repos.
Slide 7. Net charge-offs in the Commercial and Equipment Financing segment increased to 92 basis points annualized for the quarter from 15 basis points last quarter. The difference is $8.4 million, which consisted of one C&I charge-off of $6 million and one equipment financing charge-off of $2.4 million, which are larger than normal individual charge-offs for these businesses.
On Slide 8, you can see a break out of our commercial real estate credit performance. Our NPAs continue to hold steady at 1.23%, while our net charge-offs dropped to 35 basis points annualized. Our portfolio is well diversified, and we believe we will continue to see strong portfolio growth opportunities.
Slide 9 illustrates our residential loan credit performance. As you can see, our NPOs have increased to 3.4%. Nonperforming residential mortgage resolution is taking much longer than previously, as a result of a much slower foreclosure process in the course. 
As you can see in the bottom chart, our loss content has been low, and we believe it'll continue to be low because we have low loan-to-values at origination. And because approximately 83% of our nonperforming loans have loan-to-value ratios less than 90%, this just leaves $14 million of nonperforming loans for loan-to-values greater than 90%. Given attractive spreads, we have again begun holding some residential mortgages in portfolio.
On Slide 10, you can see our home equity NPLs continue to be low. Our net charge-offs declined again in the quarter to 3 basis points and utilization rates are steady at 48%. We continue to feel this is an important part of our retail customer relationships.
Slide 11 reflects our charge-off experience over the past few years. We believe that the range over the last three to four quarters is consistent with the current weak economic environment. And Slide 12 speaks to our competitive advantage relative to the industry with the chart of both asset quality and capital.
With that, I'll now hand it back to Jack to describe the acquisitions we announced yesterday."

I'm pleased to talk about these two transactions.

I'm pleased to talk about these two transactions. Slide 14 illustrates maps, which show that Smithtown Bancorp and LSB acquisitions announced yesterday, support our stated acquisition strategy for growth in continuous and near-contiguous markets. 
Smithtown Bancorp is based on Long Island, with $2.4 billion in assets and 30 branches. It operates as Bank of Smithtown, and is the largest commercial bank headquartered on Long Island. We're excited about the attractive branch network situated in high-traffic locations and equipped in most cases with multi-lane drive-ups. We've also learned that Bank of Smithtown employees' quality of training and commitment to their customers is very similar to our award-winning customer service experience. In total, Smithtown represents the natural extension of our brand within the New York City metro area and is an excellent complement to our existing commitment to convenience and customer service.
LSB Corp., with $800 million in assets and seven branches, operates as RiverBank, a commercial bank headquartered in North Andover, Mass. We've been impressed with the team at LSB and look forward to working with them as we grow the combined franchise. LSB Corp. is an excellent extension of our commitment to the greater Boston and Massachusetts markets and a logical next-step forward in our Butler Bank acquisition, which closed in April.
With respect to Butler, you should note that after three months, we are pleased to have retained 97% of our customer deposits, well ahead of our expectations, despite aggressive competitive efforts. We expect LSB and Butler, in combination, to be further supported by the opening of our two branches later this year in downtown Boston. The seven-day branch location in the Prudential Center and a large branch in the heart of the financial district, which will contain wealth management and commercial banking personnel. As the largest bank headquartered in New England, it's only natural for us to be actively growing in the largest city in New England.
Slide 15 provides some detail that we've just discussed. Slide 16 summarizes our rationale for expansion into these attractive contiguous markets. Most importantly, both deals exceed our internal financial hurdles. We expect a greater than 15% internal rate of return and significant EPS accretion. In addition, we expect tangible book value dilution to be earned back period of approximately five years.
On Slide 17, you see an overview of both banks' loan portfolios. As of March 31, Smithtown Bancorp had a loan balance of $2 billion. NPAs made up 10.3% of loans and over the previous 12 months, they charged off 1.8% of loans. We believe the 10.4% is a conservative estimate of our cumulative future loan losses.
For the same period end, LSB Corp. had a loan balance of approximately $500 million. NPAs made up 2% of loans and over the previous 12 months, they charged off 18 basis points of loans. We believe 3% is a conservative estimate of cumulative future loan losses.
In Slide 18, Smithtown Bancorp has deposit balances of $1.9 billion at a cost of 1.7%, and 58% of deposits are in checking, savings and money market accounts. LSB Corp. has deposit balance of approximately $500 million at a cost of 1.8%, and 55% of deposits are in checking, savings and money market accounts. Given our strong retail and commercial banking model, we believe we will be able to significantly lower these deposit costs over time.
Slide 19 provides a summary of key terms of the transactions. Smithtown Bancorp and LSB Corp. shareholder approval and regulatory approval is needed. I would note that People's United shareholder approval is not needed for either of these transactions. We intend to repurchase the shares being issued in conjunction with the Smithtown transaction, and we expect both of these transactions to close in the fourth quarter of this year.
Slide 20 outlines key metrics and assumptions. We believe this is conservative pricing as we are paying 0.5% times tangible book for Smithtown and 1.5% tangible book for LSB. You will note we are assuming a very achievable 15% cost savings for Smithtown and 30% for LSB.
On Slide 21, you can see the pro forma impact. These transactions increased our assets by $3 billion and deposits by $2.5 billion and add 37 branches to our network. We also expect earnings accretion of approximately $0.10 per share and as stated earlier, we expect to earn the tangible book value dilution back within five years.
In summary, on Slide 22, we are confident in how we are positioned. We have a strong balance sheet with a pro forma tangible capital ratio of 15%. Moreover, we are beginning to execute on a strong opportunity set. We closed Financial Federal and Butler in the first half of 2010, announced the acquisitions of Smithtown Bancorp and LSB Corp. and our acquisition pipeline remains robust. We continue to drive growth and profitability improvements within our core businesses and are integrating our closed and recently announced acquisitions. In addition, we constantly evaluate the returns available via share repurchases and dividend payouts. 
This concludes our presentation. And now, we'll be happy to answer any of the questions you may have."

I'd say overall, we feel very confident in our reserving level, sort of where we are with regards to the economic cycle, sort of be surprised at this stage if we need to do any building. I might just add, I mean, the credits we took, we actually had specific reserves against the credit. It's just in this economic environment, it doesn't seem like the right thing to do would be to pull down reserves by taking charges against the specific reserves. So we still got plenty of concern about the economic environment, and we are, like everyone else, hopeful that we get into a growth environment and, be it slow, but that said, we're very cautious about the outlook. So we will maintain our historic approach to that."

We're most concerned about the impact on the interchange income that we enjoy from the debit card activity. In other fronts, we are concerned about how the consumer protection agency develops and what that might mean to the our expense and our ability to deal with new regulation. But for now, so much of it needs to be defined and the rules developed by the regulators that it's very hard to anticipate beyond that. There are certain things that don't impact us in any way. So those are the two key areas that we've been focused on."

Good morning, again, and welcome to the People's United Financial Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. As you can see on Slide 2, this call has a dual purpose: Both to outline our second quarter 2010 results and to provide detail on our two acquisitions announced yesterday. 
On Slide 3, we provide an overview of our second quarter results. Operating net income for the quarter was $31.8 million or $0.09 per share, excluding $23.2 million pretax or $0.05 per share of one-time costs related to the former CEO's separation agreement, merger-related and systems conversion costs. The quarter's results reflect continued growth in our core loan portfolios and deposits despite continued economic challenges. 
The margin increased to 3.68% compared to 3.47% in the first quarter, primarily due to the full quarter benefit of the Financial Federal acquisition. Net charge offs increased to $17.8 million or 46 basis points from 26 basis points in the prior quarter. Both non-interest income and non-interest expense are higher, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Financial Federal and Butler Bank.
On Slide 4, during the second quarter, we made significant progress in our systems conversion project. In fact, this weekend, we will complete our core systems conversion, including our customers in Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine markets. At the same time, we will be rebranding our branches in those markets to People's United Bank. We are pleased to have reached this milestone, which will provide instant recognition of the People's United brand from Maine to New York. 
Additionally, we continue to focus on organic growth, with two new locations expected to be opened in downtown Boston before year end. These branches will provide an important extension of our growing footprint in the greater Boston area. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased $52 million of our common stock, equal to 3.7 million shares, at an average price of $13.98. The repurchase program was affected through open market purchases. We will continue to evaluate the returns available to us via share repurchases, relative to the rest of our capital deployment opportunities. 
Finally, we have maintained our focus on becoming a preferred acquirer in the Northeast. We were pleased to announce yesterday our acquisitions of Smithtown Bancorp and LSB Corp., which we will discuss in greater detail later in this call. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Paul to provide you with details on the quarter. Paul?"
295774,109059137,67635,"People's United Financial Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 16, 2010",2010-07-16,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jack, and good morning to you all. As Jack mentioned, our overall net interest margin increased to 3.68%, up 21 basis points from the 3.47% in the fourth quarter. The core margin improvement was primarily due to the acquisition of Financial F",577,"Thank you, Jack, and good morning to you all. As Jack mentioned, our overall net interest margin increased to 3.68%, up 21 basis points from the 3.47% in the fourth quarter. 
The core margin improvement was primarily due to the acquisition of Financial Federal, as well as lower deposit costs. As a reminder, Financial Federal closed on February 19. Respectively, we see additional opportunity for improvement. You'll notice on our June 30 balance sheet an increase in the available for sale securities, we are now more willing to temporarily deploy excess capital and short-term investments, yielding more than the Fed Funds rate than we previously have. This moderate change is in recognition that Fed Funds rate will likely remain low well into 2011. Investments to date have been concentrated in short-term agency debentures yielding approximately 90 basis points.
Moving on to Slide 6, as unemployment remains high and the economy remains weak, we saw an additional increase in nonperforming assets in the quarter. NPAs increased to 2.01% from 1.74% of loans in REO. Compared to the first quarter average of our peer group and the top 50 banks, however, our ratio remains extraordinarily healthy and less than half their levels, and we continue to feel comfortable with our asset quality in the current environment. The acquisition of Financial Federal and Butler Bank, served to increase the NPAs to loan ratio over the last couple of quarters, is the ratio, includes their REO and repos.
Slide 7. Net charge-offs in the Commercial and Equipment Financing segment increased to 92 basis points annualized for the quarter from 15 basis points last quarter. The difference is $8.4 million, which consisted of one C&I charge-off of $6 million and one equipment financing charge-off of $2.4 million, which are larger than normal individual charge-offs for these businesses.
On Slide 8, you can see a break out of our commercial real estate credit performance. Our NPAs continue to hold steady at 1.23%, while our net charge-offs dropped to 35 basis points annualized. Our portfolio is well diversified, and we believe we will continue to see strong portfolio growth opportunities.
Slide 9 illustrates our residential loan credit performance. As you can see, our NPOs have increased to 3.4%. Nonperforming residential mortgage resolution is taking much longer than previously, as a result of a much slower foreclosure process in the course. 
As you can see in the bottom chart, our loss content has been low, and we believe it'll continue to be low because we have low loan-to-values at origination. And because approximately 83% of our nonperforming loans have loan-to-value ratios less than 90%, this just leaves $14 million of nonperforming loans for loan-to-values greater than 90%. Given attractive spreads, we have again begun holding some residential mortgages in portfolio.
On Slide 10, you can see our home equity NPLs continue to be low. Our net charge-offs declined again in the quarter to 3 basis points and utilization rates are steady at 48%. We continue to feel this is an important part of our retail customer relationships.
Slide 11 reflects our charge-off experience over the past few years. We believe that the range over the last three to four quarters is consistent with the current weak economic environment. And Slide 12 speaks to our competitive advantage relative to the industry with the chart of both asset quality and capital.
With that, I'll now hand it back to Jack to describe the acquisitions we announced yesterday."

I'm pleased to talk about these two transactions. Slide 14 illustrates maps, which show that Smithtown Bancorp and LSB acquisitions announced yesterday, support our stated acquisition strategy for growth in continuous and near-contiguous",855,"Thank you, Paul. I'm pleased to talk about these two transactions. Slide 14 illustrates maps, which show that Smithtown Bancorp and LSB acquisitions announced yesterday, support our stated acquisition strategy for growth in continuous and near-contiguous markets. 
Smithtown Bancorp is based on Long Island, with $2.4 billion in assets and 30 branches. It operates as Bank of Smithtown, and is the largest commercial bank headquartered on Long Island. We're excited about the attractive branch network situated in high-traffic locations and equipped in most cases with multi-lane drive-ups. We've also learned that Bank of Smithtown employees' quality of training and commitment to their customers is very similar to our award-winning customer service experience. In total, Smithtown represents the natural extension of our brand within the New York City metro area and is an excellent complement to our existing commitment to convenience and customer service.
LSB Corp., with $800 million in assets and seven branches, operates as RiverBank, a commercial bank headquartered in North Andover, Mass. We've been impressed with the team at LSB and look forward to working with them as we grow the combined franchise. LSB Corp. is an excellent extension of our commitment to the greater Boston and Massachusetts markets and a logical next-step forward in our Butler Bank acquisition, which closed in April.
With respect to Butler, you should note that after three months, we are pleased to have retained 97% of our customer deposits, well ahead of our expectations, despite aggressive competitive efforts. We expect LSB and Butler, in combination, to be further supported by the opening of our two branches later this year in downtown Boston. The seven-day branch location in the Prudential Center and a large branch in the heart of the financial district, which will contain wealth management and commercial banking personnel. As the largest bank headquartered in New England, it's only natural for us to be actively growing in the largest city in New England.
Slide 15 provides some detail that we've just discussed. Slide 16 summarizes our rationale for expansion into these attractive contiguous markets. Most importantly, both deals exceed our internal financial hurdles. We expect a greater than 15% internal rate of return and significant EPS accretion. In addition, we expect tangible book value dilution to be earned back period of approximately five years.
On Slide 17, you see an overview of both banks' loan portfolios. As of March 31, Smithtown Bancorp had a loan balance of $2 billion. NPAs made up 10.3% of loans and over the previous 12 months, they charged off 1.8% of loans. We believe the 10.4% is a conservative estimate of our cumulative future loan losses.
For the same period end, LSB Corp. had a loan balance of approximately $500 million. NPAs made up 2% of loans and over the previous 12 months, they charged off 18 basis points of loans. We believe 3% is a conservative estimate of cumulative future loan losses.
In Slide 18, Smithtown Bancorp has deposit balances of $1.9 billion at a cost of 1.7%, and 58% of deposits are in checking, savings and money market accounts. LSB Corp. has a deposit balance of approximately $500 million at a cost of 1.8%, and 55% of deposits are in checking, savings and money market accounts. Given our strong retail and commercial banking model, we believe we will be able to significantly lower these deposit costs over time.
Slide 19 provides a summary of key terms of the transactions. Smithtown Bancorp and LSB Corp. shareholder approval and regulatory approval is needed. I would note that People's United shareholder approval is not needed for either of these transactions. We intend to repurchase the shares being issued in conjunction with the Smithtown transaction, and we expect both of these transactions to close in the fourth quarter of this year.
Slide 20 outlines key metrics and assumptions. We believe this is conservative pricing as we are paying 0.5%x tangible book for Smithtown and 1.5% tangible book for LSB. You will note we are assuming a very achievable 15% cost savings for Smithtown and 30% for LSB.
On Slide 21, you can see the pro forma impact. These transactions increased our assets by $3 billion and deposits by $2.5 billion and add 37 branches to our network. We also expect earnings accretion of approximately $0.10 per share and as stated earlier, we expect to earn the tangible book value dilution back within five years.
In summary, on Slide 22, we are confident in how we are positioned. We have a strong balance sheet with a pro forma tangible capital ratio of 15%. Moreover, we are beginning to execute on a strong opportunity set. We closed Financial Federal and Butler in the first half of 2010, announced the acquisitions of Smithtown Bancorp and LSB Corp. and our acquisition pipeline remains robust. We continue to drive growth and profitability improvements within our core businesses and are integrating our closed and recently announced acquisitions. In addition, we constantly evaluate the returns available via share repurchases and dividend payouts. 
This concludes our presentation. And now, we'll be happy to answer any of the questions you may have."

We've had a long history of being very successful there. We've got some emphasis and new programs going on there. And as Brian indicated earlier, that is challenging in this economic environment, but we have such a strong customer base in that area that we want to leverage that. We continued to do some club deals, and as Brian mentioned, the activity is encouraging, as of late, with high-quality opportunities. But really, all of those things we have done in the past, and I would say always trying to advance our success in the efforts that we put into being successful, and that's ongoing."

Good morning, again, and welcome to the People's United Financial Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. As you can see on Slide 2, this call has a dual purpose: Both to outline our second quarter 2010 results and to provide detail on our two acquisitions announced yesterday. 
On Slide 3, we provide an overview of our second quarter results. Operating net income for the quarter was $31.8 million or $0.09 per share, excluding $23.2 million pretax or $0.05 per share of one-time costs related to the former CEO's separation agreement, merger-related and systems conversion costs. The quarter's results reflect continued growth in our core loan portfolios and deposits despite continued economic challenges. 
The margin increased to 3.68% compared to 3.47% in the first quarter, primarily due to the full quarter benefit of the Financial Federal acquisition. Net charge offs increased to $17.8 million or 46 basis points from 26 basis points in the prior quarter. Both non-interest income and non-interest expense are higher, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Financial Federal and Butler Bank.
On Slide 4, during the second quarter, we made significant progress in our systems conversion project. In fact, this weekend, we will complete our core systems conversion, including our customers in Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine markets. At the same time, we will be rebranding our branches in those markets to People's United Bank. We are pleased to have reached this milestone, which will provide instant recognition of the People's United brand from Maine to New York. 
Additionally, we continue to focus on organic growth, with two new locations expected to be opened in downtown Boston before year end. These branches will provide an important extension of our growing footprint in the greater Boston area. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased $52 million of our common stock, equal to 3.7 million shares, at an average price of $13.98. The repurchase program was affected through open market purchases. We will continue to evaluate the returns available to us via share repurchases, relative to the rest of our capital deployment opportunities. 
Finally, we have maintained our focus on becoming a preferred acquirer in the Northeast. We were pleased to announce yesterday our acquisitions of Smithtown Bancorp and LSB Corp., which we will discuss in greater detail later in this call. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Paul to provide you with details on the quarter. Paul?"

As Jack mentioned, our overall net interest margin increased to 3.68%, up 21 basis points from the 3.47% in the fourth quarter. The core margin improvement was primarily due to the acquisition of Financial F",577,"Thank you, Jack, and good morning to you all. As Jack mentioned, our overall net interest margin increased to 3.68%, up 21 basis points from the 3.47% in the fourth quarter. 
The core margin improvement was primarily due to the acquisition of Financial Federal, as well as lower deposit costs. As a reminder, Financial Federal closed on February 19. Respectively, we see additional opportunity for improvement. You'll notice on our June 30 balance sheet an increase in the available for sale securities, we are now more willing to temporarily deploy excess capital and short-term investments, yielding more than the Fed Funds rate than we previously have. This moderate change is in recognition that Fed Funds rate will likely remain low well into 2011. Investments to date have been concentrated in short-term agency debentures yielding approximately 90 basis points.
Moving on to Slide 6, as unemployment remains high and the economy remains weak, we saw an additional increase in nonperforming assets in the quarter. NPAs increased to 2.01% from 1.74% of loans in REO. Compared to the first quarter average of our peer group and the top 50 banks, however, our ratio remains extraordinarily healthy and less than half their levels, and we continue to feel comfortable with our asset quality in the current environment. The acquisition of Financial Federal and Butler Bank, served to increase the NPAs to loan ratio over the last couple of quarters, is the ratio, includes their REO and repos.
Slide 7. Net charge-offs in the Commercial and Equipment Financing segment increased to 92 basis points annualized for the quarter from 15 basis points last quarter. The difference is $8.4 million, which consisted of one C&I charge-off of $6 million and one equipment financing charge-off of $2.4 million, which are larger than normal individual charge-offs for these businesses.
On Slide 8, you can see a break out of our commercial real estate credit performance. Our NPAs continue to hold steady at 1.23%, while our net charge-offs dropped to 35 basis points annualized. Our portfolio is well diversified, and we believe we will continue to see strong portfolio growth opportunities.
Slide 9 illustrates our residential loan credit performance. As you can see, our NPOs have increased to 3.4%. Nonperforming residential mortgage resolution is taking much longer than previously, as a result of a much slower foreclosure process in the course. 
As you can see in the bottom chart, our loss content has been low, and we believe it'll continue to be low because we have low loan-to-values at origination. And because approximately 83% of our nonperforming loans have loan-to-value ratios less than 90%, this just leaves $14 million of nonperforming loans for loan-to-values greater than 90%. Given attractive spreads, we have again begun holding some residential mortgages in portfolio.
On Slide 10, you can see our home equity NPLs continue to be low. Our net charge-offs declined again in the quarter to 3 basis points and utilization rates are steady at 48%. We continue to feel this is an important part of our retail customer relationships.
Slide 11 reflects our charge-off experience over the past few years. We believe that the range over the last three to four quarters is consistent with the current weak economic environment. And Slide 12 speaks to our competitive advantage relative to the industry with the chart of both asset quality and capital.
With that, I'll now hand it back to Jack to describe the acquisitions we announced yesterday."

I'm pleased to talk about these two transactions. Slide 14 illustrates maps, which show that Smithtown Bancorp and LSB acquisitions announced yesterday, support our stated acquisition strategy for growth in continuous and near-contiguous markets. 
Smithtown Bancorp is based on Long Island, with $2.4 billion in assets and 30 branches. It operates as Bank of Smithtown, and is the largest commercial bank headquartered on Long Island. We're excited about the attractive branch network situated in high-traffic locations and equipped in most cases with multi-lane drive-ups. We've also learned that Bank of Smithtown employees' quality of training and commitment to their customers is very similar to our award-winning customer service experience. In total, Smithtown represents the natural extension of our brand within the New York City metro area and is an excellent complement to our existing commitment to convenience and customer service.
LSB Corp., with $800 million in assets and seven branches, operates as RiverBank, a commercial bank headquartered in North Andover, Mass. We've been impressed with the team at LSB and look forward to working with them as we grow the combined franchise. LSB Corp. is an excellent extension of our commitment to the greater Boston and Massachusetts markets and a logical next-step forward in our Butler Bank acquisition, which closed in April.
With respect to Butler, you should note that after three months, we are pleased to have retained 97% of our customer deposits, well ahead of our expectations, despite aggressive competitive efforts. We expect LSB and Butler, in combination, to be further supported by the opening of our two branches later this year in downtown Boston. The seven-day branch location in the Prudential Center and a large branch in the heart of the financial district, which will contain wealth management and commercial banking personnel. As the largest bank headquartered in New England, it's only natural for us to be actively growing in the largest city in New England.
Slide 15 provides some detail that we've just discussed. Slide 16 summarizes our rationale for expansion into these attractive contiguous markets. Most importantly, both deals exceed our internal financial hurdles. We expect a greater than 15% internal rate of return and significant EPS accretion. In addition, we expect tangible book value dilution to be earned back period of approximately five years.
On Slide 17, you see an overview of both banks' loan portfolios. As of March 31, Smithtown Bancorp had a loan balance of $2 billion. NPAs made up 10.3% of loans and over the previous 12 months, they charged off 1.8% of loans. We believe the 10.4% is a conservative estimate of our cumulative future loan losses.
For the same period end, LSB Corp. had a loan balance of approximately $500 million. NPAs made up 2% of loans and over the previous 12 months, they charged off 18 basis points of loans. We believe 3% is a conservative estimate of cumulative future loan losses.
In Slide 18, Smithtown Bancorp has deposit balances of $1.9 billion at a cost of 1.7%, and 58% of deposits are in checking, savings and money market accounts. LSB Corp. has a deposit balance of approximately $500 million at a cost of 1.8%, and 55% of deposits are in checking, savings and money market accounts. Given our strong retail and commercial banking model, we believe we will be able to significantly lower these deposit costs over time.
Slide 19 provides a summary of key terms of the transactions. Smithtown Bancorp and LSB Corp. shareholder approval and regulatory approval is needed. I would note that People's United shareholder approval is not needed for either of these transactions. We intend to repurchase the shares being issued in conjunction with the Smithtown transaction, and we expect both of these transactions to close in the fourth quarter of this year.
Slide 20 outlines key metrics and assumptions. We believe this is conservative pricing as we are paying 0.5%x tangible book for Smithtown and 1.5% tangible book for LSB. You will note we are assuming a very achievable 15% cost savings for Smithtown and 30% for LSB.
On Slide 21, you can see the pro forma impact. These transactions increased our assets by $3 billion and deposits by $2.5 billion and add 37 branches to our network. We also expect earnings accretion of approximately $0.10 per share and as stated earlier, we expect to earn the tangible book value dilution back within five years.
In summary, on Slide 22, we are confident in how we are positioned. We have a strong balance sheet with a pro forma tangible capital ratio of 15%. Moreover, we are beginning to execute on a strong opportunity set. We closed Financial Federal and Butler in the first half of 2010, announced the acquisitions of Smithtown Bancorp and LSB Corp. and our acquisition pipeline remains robust. We continue to drive growth and profitability improvements within our core businesses and are integrating our closed and recently announced acquisitions. In addition, we constantly evaluate the returns available via share repurchases and dividend payouts. 
This concludes our presentation. And now, we'll be happy to answer any of the questions you may have."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us for today’s call. Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Paul Burner, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of our management team are gathered for the call.     Before we get started, please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide one of our presentation, which is posted on our website, www.peoples.com under Investor Relations. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Jack.     John Barnes</TAG>
Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you know, today, we’ll be reviewing our earnings for the third quarter and we look forward to your questions after our comments are complete.
Before we go through these slides, I’d like to share with you some of my perspective on our two primary strategic objectives. First, to optimize the existing business and second, to sufficiently deploy our excess capital.
With regard to optimizing our business, we believe we have a more robust opportunities set relative to many in the industry. We continue to work towards additional revenue synergies made available from completed acquisitions over the last several years. We have active initiatives currently underway relative to these opportunities in all of our business lines.
Certainly, the acquisitions of Bank of Smithtown and RiverBank and our branch openings in Boston all of which we expect to close by year end will create additional opportunity to enhance revenue going forward.
On the capital deployment front, we have an organized acquisition plan and a targeted effort is underway. Our management team has continued to build relationships within the industry, which we believe will lead to attractive combinations. The challenge, of course, has always relates to different views on price.
Today, we feel sellers are becoming more realistic with respect to price as a result of challenges facing the industry. The value of the synergies from consolidation relative to the value available following an independent path should add momentum to these conversations.
On Slide three, we’ve provided an overview of our third quarter results.
Operating net income for the quarter was $27.7 million or $0.08 per share, excluding $5.3 million or $0.01 per share for one-time cost related to the system conversion and mergers. Net interest margin exceeded - excuse me, expanded by five basis points from 3.8% in the second quarter to 3.73% in the third quarter as a result of a higher investment yield and lower deposit cost.
Asset quality remains strong. However, net charge-offs grew to 57 basis points versus 46 basis points in the prior quarter. As we discussed in the press release, two construction projects represent 45% of the quarter’s net charge-offs. These credits did have specific reserves against them.
Given the increase in NPAs and the climate of persistently high unemployment and weak economics, we felt it was prudent to cover our net charge-offs.
Importantly, we continue to feel comfortable that our asset quality metrics will remain at low levels.
Finally, while growth and commercial banking portfolio was offset by declines in our residential mortgage and consumer lending, we are pleased by our strong pipeline for commercial and residential mortgages as we move into the fourth quarter.
Slide four addresses our current initiatives. Our system conversion is complete and we are now operating as single scalable platform. The rebranding of our branches in the Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine markets is also effectively complete.
Our acquisitions of Smithtown Bancorp and LSB Corp. are both expected to close next month - providing, of course, that all the necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals take place.
Additionally, we are set to open our Boston branches in the Prudential Center and on Financial Street before year ends.
During the third quarter, we repurchased $25 million of our common stock equal to 1.9 million shares and an average price of $13.29. This was limited because of the stock component of our pending Bank of Smithtown transactions. The repurchase program was affected through open market purchases.
We will continue to evaluate the returns available to us via the share repurchases relative to the rest of our capital deployment opportunities.
With that, I’ll hand it over to Paul to provide you with details on the quarter. Paul?     Paul Burner</TAG>
Thank you, Jack, and good morning to you all. As Jack mentioned, our overall net interest margin expanded to 3.73%, up five basis points from the second quarter driven by higher investment yields and lower deposit cost. In the third quarter, we had $800 million more on securities on average than in the second quarter.
We made investments of $500 million in callable agencies at the holding company and an additional $300 million of 15-year agency mortgage-backed pass-through at the bank.
The duration of the securities portfolio declined slightly to 2.36 years. Despite the investments, we remained highly assets sensitive; such the earnings will increase by $40 million for every 100 basis point increase in the Fed Funds rate.
Moving on to Slide six, NPAs increased to 2.18% from 2.01% of loans in REO. Compared to the second quarter average of our peer group and the top 50 banks, however, our ratio is less than half their levels. We continue to feel comfortable with our asset quality in the current environment.
  On Slide seven, in the Commercial and Equipment Financing segment, while NPLs increased 10 basis points, net charge-offs in the Commercial and Equipment Financing segment dropped to 37 basis points annualized for the quarter from 92 basis points last quarter. This equates to $4.7 million in the third quarter versus $11.7 million in the second quarter for a $7 million decline.     This is actually a good moment to reflect on the lumpiness we discussed last quarter given our low level of charge-offs as a starting point, a single creditor too can cause the annualized charge-offs in any one quarter to move meaningfully. Last quarter, that movement in this category was up. And this quarter in this category that movement was down.     Page 13 of the press release itemizes charge-off levels by loan category. And you’ll notice that within the Equipment Finance subsegment, charge-offs declined to $1.6 million this quarter from $3.7 million in the second quarter.     On Slide 8, you can see a breakout of our commercial real estate by their performance. And NPAs were 1.55%, compared to 1.23% in the second quarter, while NCOs rose to 98 basis points from 35 basis points is a result of the two construction projects. This equates to $13.5 million in the third quarter versus $4.8 million in the second quarter for on $8.7 million increase.
It’s worth noting that only 99% of the commercial real estate charge-offs in this quarter were construction related. And in fact, year-to-date, 94% of commercial real estate charge-offs have been in construction. Our portfolio remains well diversified and we believe we’ll continue to see strong portfolio growth opportunities.     Slide 9 illustrates our residential loan credit performance. As you can see, our NPLs have increased to 3.67%. Unfortunately, non-performing residential mortgage resolution continues to take much longer than previously as a result of a much lower foreclosure process in the courts.     Our loss content has been low as you can see in the bottom chart and we believe it will continue to be at low levels because we have low loan to value at originations, and because approximately 85% of our non-performing loans have current loan to values of less than 90%. We feel good about the residential mortgage pipeline of originations.     On Slide 10, you can see our Home Equity non-performing loans continue at low levels comparable to those in the second quarter. Our net charge-offs were up a bit at 26 basis points, but still significantly below industry levels. Utilization rates remain stable at 49%. We continue to feel that Home Equity offering is an important part of our retail customer relationships.     Slide 11 reflects our charge-off experience over the past few years. We believe that the range of over the last three to four quarters is consistent with the current weak economic environment. And year-to-date, our charge-offs have averaged 43 basis points.     Slide 12 speaks to our competitive advantage relative to the industry with regard to asset quality and capital. And with that, I’ll now hand it back to Jack to wrap it up before we open it up for your questions     John Barnes</TAG>
Thanks, Paul.
In summary on Slide 13, we believe we continue to offer a compelling investment opportunity. We operate from a position of competitive strength and intend to enhance this position by continuing to focus on improving our operating performance. We’ll continue to pursue capital deployments through well-priced acquisitions, while maintaining a strong dividend and evaluating the returns available from share repurchases.
Further, given the multiyear deleveraging process and the increased regulatory pressures in the sector, we believe potential partners are becoming more interested in combination discussions.     Finally, we are significantly more asset sensitive than our peers. So, when rates finally do rise, we will have a disproportionate positive impact on our interest income.
This concludes our presentation, and I will be happy to answer any questions you might have.

John Barnes</TAG>
Well, I guess the first part of the question, as we look forward and think about the impact of the acquisitions on our margin, we feel like it will be with the purchase accounting that transition should be billing neutral. And based on our overall view of existing portfolio, cost of funds, et cetera, we’re feeling pretty good about being able to maintain in this range.
And I’ll let Paul address the investment portfolio. As you can tell, we’ve been working to try to make good progress there and we’ll continue to work it while we avoid going too far out in the duration.     Paul Burner</TAG>
Yes, I guess I wanted to add, Mark, is our overall assets despite the investing that we’ve done on our overall asset sensitivity has really remained pretty constant. As we look forward and look at sort of the legacy business, putting aside the acquisitions for a moment, we actually see a moderate upward bias with regard to the net interest margin. And I would say it’s really sort of moderate.
So, I think as Jack said, we feel very good about the maintenance there. And we want to keep our powder dry with regard to asset sensitivity so that we do benefit, we felt the pain of lower earnings through the lower rate cycle and we look forward to earnings growing as rates eventually increase. In the interim, with our pricing actions, we think we can continue to deliver the net interest margin we have and seek a little bit of improvement there.     Mark Fitzgibbon - Sandler O’Neill</TAG>
And should we be expecting the provision to roughly match charge-offs do you think in coming quarters?     John Barnes</TAG>
Well, no. This gets us into this - what we realized this quarter was given the fact that we did have a couple of credits that we needed to recognize and that NPAs increased, we felt it was the right move. I would expect, and our comments about expecting asset quality to remain at lower levels would mean that we’ll find the right balance there as we go forward, but I wouldn’t want to predict that we’ll absolutely match or not in future quarters.     Mark Fitzgibbon - Sandler O’Neill</TAG>
Okay. And then lastly, you said the pipeline was strong in residential and commercial. Could you may be share some numbers with us, give us a sense on roughly how big those pipelines are?     John Barnes</TAG>
Sure, I think we’ve talked about giving you all a flavor for that and may be I’d ask Brian to speak to some of the activity we see right now in the commercial side first. Can you do that one?    Brian Dreyer</TAG>
Brian Dreyer. I’m not going to give you specific numbers because we don’t disclose those, but I will give you some color.
First, you have to look at our individual businesses because things are different depending upon which business you’re talking about. But our biggest business is our Commercial Real Estate Finance business, and that’s been strong and it remains strong and the pipelines are very good. It’s interesting; almost everything is a refinance opportunity. Many, many of those, not most, are credit great tenants.
There’s almost no new construction and the vast majority of the deals are in office and retail. It’s across the footprint but we have definite concentrations in Fairfield County, and inside 128 in the Boston market, and also, in New York and New Jersey.
As far as C&I is concerned, I would say that’s reasonably strong. Again, concentrated in Connecticut, some in New York, particularly in Brooklyn and Westchester. Although we just committed and we’re in the process of closing a $50 million deal, that’s 5-0 in Vermont, will be the agent, that’s probably the biggest deal in Vermont this year and may be in a couple of years, I’m not really sure.
The problem in C&I is our utilization rates and our lines of credit are running about 45% and that’s about flat from last year. We really seen no increase and whereas the normal rate in our portfolios generally is around 65%. So, there’s a lot of demand that is just not there right now compared to what our commitments are.
In terms of what you’re going to see in the future, we are about to deploy new C&I teams inside 128 as soon as those Boston branches open, and we have high expectations for what they might be able to achieve. And we’re also ready to put teams on the ground as soon as the Smithtown acquisition closes to really start calling aggressively in Long Island and in the New York City.
As far as the Equipment Finance businesses are concerned, the PCLC business is reasonably strong. And it’s mostly in the direct channel, direct sales channel and it’s across the board in most of our business lines. It’s not what it’s been in past years, but I still would say reasonably strong.
As opposed to Financial Federal, which is now just changed its name to People’s United Equipment Finance, the business is very slow there. There is a big construction concentration and I don’t think it’s a surprise to anybody that the construction industry is very slow. So, there just aren’t a lot of business opportunities and there still shrinkage in that portfolio.
So, as we go forward, we’re seeing and we’re going to see, decent increases, modest increases in some portfolios, stronger increases in others. But overall, I feel pretty good considering the economy that we’re all facing.

Thank you. I was hoping if you could site just a little bit about buybacks. First, may be just remind all of us what the restrictions are that you currently have right now. Because obviously, you have buyback some shares but not a lot, and what are your plans after Smithtown closes?
And then how do you view buybacks broadly speaking in relation to the fact that you mentioned you’ve actually use shares at some point or maybe you won’t to actually do an acquisition? Thanks.    Paul Burner</TAG>
Hi, Ken. It’s Paul. With regard to restrictions, we actually have been blocked out for some time now because we’re using our stock as a portion of the consideration for the Smithtown acquisition. And we will remain blocked out until after the Shareholders’ Meeting, which is November 19th or 20th. So, we do have to remain out of the market until then, and then could resume.
With regard to our overall posture, I’ll pass it back to you, Jack.     John Barnes</TAG>
So, if I would suggest to all of you that the posture that we’ve portrayed in the last several quarters remains intact, if you will. With shares value dropping to levels where we think it’s attractive versus our future earnings expectations and valuations, then we’ll move into the market and continue to buy under the approved plan. We are talking about it regularly, internally and with the Board, and we’re evaluating the size of our repurchase plan and also our activity, and it’s really an ongoing process and that’s about it.     Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley</TAG>
Okay. No, that makes sense. And then maybe just a related question, when you think about the cash that you’re putting into agencies, I understand it’s fairly short duration. May be talk about your ability to pull that out if you do find a sizable acquisition? Are those securities, I guess, monetizable in a very short manner without taking any losses?     Paul Burner</TAG>
Well, they are. Unfortunately, as rates have continued downward, actually, we take a gain. But I guess the philosophy is we’re just putting a portion of the excess capital that’s what the holding company or investing a term or keeping a portion in cash. And we’re keeping the durations such that you know even - I mean as with the River and Smithtown acquisition, there’s unfortunately, a few month period between deal announcement and the closing.
But I guess the way we look at it as if the market moved around a little and we wanted the $500 million to fund an acquisition a little earlier and we have to take $0.5 million charge that would really be de minimis. Meanwhile, we don’t think we’ll be using it. So, we prefer to get income back up. Clearly, it’s not money we put into 30-year mortgages.

Well, I’d go back to my kind of opening remarks. We’re very comfortable that our asset quality and metrics are going to remain at low levels. And I go back to our track record and our confidence in our underwriting, and actually also, our confidence in our customers, we’re very pleased with how our customers have navigated through this economic downturn and the length of it, and we remain very solidly comfortable with both aspects of that.

Okay. Can you talk a little bit what drove the commercial real estate increase for non-performers that was up to $85 million this quarter from $67 million last quarter?     John Barnes</TAG>
So, my recollection, generally, as we look at that increase, it really came in a very granular way. I think the largest edition was $2 million. And then below that there were some - just reminding me on - I’m thinking of the C&I. So, in the C&I, the largest was $2 million and then there was a lot of other smaller loans roughly $15 million or so that were added.
In the commercial real estate, we did have an $8 million deal that was added and then three others that were a variety of projects in kind of $2 million to $3 million range.     Damon DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.</TAG>

Okay. And then, this is kind of goes back to when Brian was giving color on prospects for loan growth. You mentioned a large deal in Vermont of $50 million. Is that a size of a credit that you guys would keep or is that something that you would maybe you partial out to some other banks as well?     Brian Dreyer</TAG>
This is Brian, again. We’re going to age into credit we’ve already arranged for People to take pieces.

Hi, thanks for taking my call. The comments on the slow loan growth at federal, should we interpret this in terms of the accretion from that acquisition as tracking below expectations?     Paul Burner</TAG>
No.     Christopher Nolan - CRT Capital Group LLC</TAG>
Yes?     Paul Burner</TAG>
No. We’ve actually seen some - we’ve seen some improvement margin over and above what we had, and we’ve also seen some reduction in expenses, and we’ve been very also very comfortable with the credit, the credits performing very well. So, overall, we’re very pleased and we are looking forward to our eventual rebound and in growth.     Christopher Nolan - CRT Capital Group LLC</TAG>
Okay. And then should we look forward to any sort of expense savings once given that the system conversion is completed? And if so, is there any way you can quantify that?     John Barnes</TAG>
Yes, we’ve talked about that in the past and we have moved through a number of stages through the project, if you will, in the last year to address our expense savings that we expected. We talked about savings in the range on an analyzed operating basis of $10 million, and we continue to believe that we will achieve those goals.     Christopher Nolan - CRT Capital Group LLC</TAG>
Should we expect the savings to begin immediately or is that something that’s sort of [inaudible]?     John Barnes</TAG>
Well, it’s actually - some of it began to impact - following first quarter in the event in Connecticut in February, and then some kicked in after the July event in New England, and we continue to work on settling the conversion and getting things moved out and adjusting our overhead and enjoying a different cost structure in the services that we get related to the core. And all of that well, as is and will continue to be phasing in through the end of the year.     Christopher Nolan - CRT Capital Group LLC</TAG>
Great. And then just turning to the efficiency ratio, it’s pretty high compared to similar-sized institutions. Is there is any sort of initiatives or plans to improve operating leverage?     John Barnes</TAG>
Well, I’d say two things there. First, it is very high compared to our peers and we recognize that. If you kind of either look at giving the excess capital a fair normalized rate, if you will, of return, and you put that revenue into the equation, you’d see that we’re kind of in line, I would call it, with our peers. I think we calculated generally in the high 50s.
But that said, we recognized also that initiatives around expense savings and being an efficiently run company is important. And things like the core conversion initiative and moving through that are critical and we’re constantly working on initiatives to improve our operating performance, and that includes becoming more efficient and getting an efficiency level that we’ll be pleased with, and it will be somewhere in that mid-50 range.     Christopher Nolan - CRT Capital Group LLC</TAG>
Any timing on that?     John Barnes</TAG>
Well, it really will depend a lot on capital deployment.

If we do a pro forma today given the asset sensitivity I mentioned, each 1% increase in the Fed Funds rate adding $40 million, if we just sort of do a fast forward to a 5% Fed Funds rate with our exact same balance sheet, that’s where our efficiency ratio would actually drop too - because our revenue increase associated with 5% Fed Funds rate.

Well, there’s a lot of specific dynamics in that. But I think as you could hear Brian describing, we’ve got some long-term employees from various markets where we are operating moving in to Boston. And then we have folks on the ground that will be relocating from different offices around Boston into the Boston office. We will undoubtedly add a few new people, but we don’t think there’s any kind of a size or material impact there on comp with those programs.     Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.</TAG>

Well, I can’t say that I have something that’s clear in my mind what that will play out.

But just give a little bit more color, if you could on why you still - I guess I could ask it differently. Why are you not more rigid and saying, “We will be buying bank our stock more aggressively,” assuming that the stock is at this level?     John Barnes</TAG>
Well, because I think I don’t want to come out and say will, “We will be doing it,” because that we are continually discussing it with the management group and the board, and it’s not - we don’t have a clear definitive position that we’re going to march forward with. There’s a lot of dynamics around that, as you know, and if whether we have capital deployed in other ways, that might change our position in 30 days or whether we have a change in the stock price, et cetera. That position could change.
So, that’s why, I guess I articulated the way I do. And I think it is something that we’re going to evaluate on an ongoing basis. We’ve clearly demonstrated now that with the price at these levels, we believe it’s an appropriate investment for us. And it certainly, you can interpret from the last two quarters that with the stock at these levels, we believe it’s an appropriate action the way to deploy the capital.

As you look at the market, do you see kind of larger deals coming down the pipe? I mean, how do we think about or how do you guys think about kind of where you’re going to get the best return on may be a size of acquisition?     Paul Burner</TAG>
Well, I think just first of all, if we could get an appropriate - an acquisition at a larger size, we’d deploy capital, more capital more quickly. And so, you can assume that that would be more attractive to us. Let’s say, given equivalent return views on a large and a small deal, for sure, and we are working hard to make some progress there.
But we also kind of go back to our discussion over the last few quarters; we’ve clearly opened our lens, so to speak, and are looking at deals of $1 billion or up to say $5 billion or larger. And if it’s strategically valuable to us, if the franchise that we’re looking is very attractive because of location or other reasons, then we’re going to look at it.
So, we don’t want to be locked into just doing sizable deals and getting ourselves in a spot where we don’t make progress, and we continue to have that view. So, large is better and we’re working on it.

Yes. No, I understand. You guys know I respect the strategy that you’ve been employing. It’s just - I guess looking for maybe a little bit more nimbleness within that strategy considering the environment that we sit in and the fear that this environment is prolonged for a longer period, and that’s all.
Just shifting gears quickly and I’ll let somebody else hop in. On mortgage banking, can you just offer your view on mortgage banking? It’s not been a huge business for you all. Is it something that you would to want to expand into? Is it that the restructure - I mean not in place to higher volumes. I mean we’re just seeing a lot of banks really posting some sizable growth this quarter, and just kind of want to get your philosophy on that.     John Barnes</TAG>
Well, I would say that we have been very committed to mortgage banking for a long time, and we continue to be and actually have high expectations there. We’ve had a strong retail origination for us throughout our footprint for really a quite some time. And we’ve also worked hard to develop our initiative to originate and take applications through the branches and we continue to make progress there.
And so, if you’re - I think may be if you’re looking at numbers that seem on a relative basis, smaller, it may be because while we’re taking the gains in the secondary sales with the 30-year production, we’re also starting to book …

Yes, hi. I just wanted to clarify on the securities purchases. You guys said you did $800 million in the third quarter. What are you anticipating in the fourth quarter in terms of dollar amount of purchases or is it done in terms of the large-scale purchases?     John Barnes</TAG>
Now, we - toward the end, really what I said, Matthew, is we owned $800 million more in securities on average in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter. We did purchase at the end of the third quarter some additional securities with a shorter duration in the pass-through and that was within the bank. And so we - next quarter, we’ll see probably an increase of about $400 million quarter-over-quarter.     Matthew Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.</TAG>
Okay, got you. In terms of the securities to asset ratio, I mean that’ll get you kind of the mid-teens. Is that that way you want to be or?     Paul Burner</TAG>
I think there’s not really a specific target per se there. I think it’s much more about - I think sort of going back to Collyn’s point, a moment ago or wanting to be a bit nimble and increase yield a little bit, but maintaining an eye on the duration. And we expect rates to stay low over short of the next year, but not wanting to extend ourselves too much.     Matthew Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.</TAG>
Okay. Then a question for Brian, I wonder if you could give us a little bit of commentary on current rates in the third quarter or origination rates in the third quarter versus where they those rates are now on office and retail type collateral [inaudible] or originating kind of A class, B class or rate and yield deal commentary for the third quarter and then where those are now?     Brian Dreyer</TAG>
Beginning in the third quarter, the spreads would’ve been higher. When you say rates, I’m assuming you’re talking about spreads.

All right, got you. Okay. Another question, just looking at the current earnings run rate. I mean you guys are earning $0.08 or $0.09 a quarter, annualized 32%, 36%. And then Smithtown and Lawrence, at $0.10, get you in the low to mid-40s. Current consensus sitting out there right now at, I think it’s like $0.59. I mean it implies a lot of organic growth.
What do you think the combined organic growth rate is once Smithtown and Lawrence are integrated?     John Barnes</TAG>
Right. I think it implies some organic growth and it also implies some capital deployment and an expectation that we would follow up with more acquisitions. So, in terms of organic growth, we are what I would call, expecting, let’s say, somewhere in that 5% to 10% growth rate depending on the business, and all of them we view differently. But what I would call rational growth rates and especially in this environment.     Matthew Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.</TAG>

I guess generally speaking, the past few years, People’s has been a story of sitting on excess capital waiting for the right deals. But we know the Board has changed leadership at the bank, where they brought you in to accelerate this pace of capital deployment.
So far, you’ve done a good job, a couple of deals, bought back some stock. Curious as when you look at 2011, can you help us think about your view as well as maybe the Board’s view on what is an acceptable pace of capital deployment? And if deals do not materialize, is there a minimum amount of capital that you’re planning to use via share buyback or other tools?     John Barnes</TAG>
So, I think basically, there is no specific timeframe that the Board has laid out in front of me or the management group, as it relates to capital deployment pace. I think whenever I think of this subject, I think of our investors and the Board message, which is the last thing we want to do is allow the deal and do something just to force something for the wrong reason, and that always remains in the front of all of our minds. So, I think that’s kind of an important starting point.
As it relates to whether deals materialize in a reasonable timeframe, if they don’t, and will we considered changes in our posture to buybacks or special dividend or other alternatives, the answer is absolutely, yes. And when I talk about us regularly re-examining our posture and alternatives there, those conversations certainly do come up. But we definitely remain primarily focused on deploying the capital through acquisitions, and realizing on our strategic plan to deploy the capital and grow the franchise and realize on that capital in that fashion.     Steven Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co.</TAG>
Jack, is it safe for us to assume that if these deals do not materialize, though, that a portion of this capital would’ve been used for share buyback, which was not the case over say the past two years?     John Barnes</TAG>

Okay. And maybe I’ll follow-up with Paul. When you model out deal opportunities out there, are there many that are better risk adjusted return than buying back your stock today here in the $0.12 range?     Paul Burner</TAG>
Hi. Yes, I mean I obviously it depends upon the assumptions that go into the IRR model, but that’s the very reason that we’re retaining the capital. I mean that’s our first priority is to deploy it and you know have an internal rate of return exceeding 15% through growing the franchise and adding to the franchise. But that really is preferable other things being equal to a share repurchase.     Steven Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co.</TAG>
Okay. And maybe just one final one, are you able guys able to do due diligence in acquisitions today before you - are you in a stage with Smithtown and LSB where you could do that or do we need to have these close or the system conversions take place?     John Barnes</TAG>
No, no, absolutely. We’re more than able to do that.

Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. As you know, today, we'll be reviewing our earnings for the third quarter and we look forward to your questions after our comments are complete. Before we go through the slide",625,"Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. As you know, today, we'll be reviewing our earnings for the third quarter and we look forward to your questions after our comments are complete. 
Before we go through the slides, I'd like to share with you some of my perspective on our two primary strategic objectives. First, to optimize the existing business, and second, to sufficiently deploy our excess capital. With regard to optimizing our business, we believe we have a more robust opportunity set relative to many in the industry. We continue to work towards additional revenue synergies made available from completed acquisitions over the last several years. We have active initiatives currently underway relative to these opportunities in all of our business lines. Certainly, the acquisitions of Bank of Smithtown and RiverBank and our branch openings in Boston, all of which, we expect to close by year end, will create additional opportunity to enhance revenue going forward. 
On the capital deployment front, we have an organized acquisition plan and a targeted effort is underway. Our management team has continued to build relationships within the industry, which we believe will lead to attractive combinations. The challenge, of course, is always related to differing views on price. Today, we feel sellers are becoming more realistic with respect to price as a result of challenges facing the industry. The value of the synergies from consolidation relative to the value available following an independent path should add momentum to these conversations. 
On Slide 3, we provide an overview of our third quarter results. Operating net income for the quarter was $27.7 million or $0.08 per share, excluding $5.3 million or $0.01 per share for one-time costs related to the system conversion and mergers. Net interest margin expanded by five basis points from 3.68% in the second quarter to 3.73% in the third quarter as a result of the higher investment yields and lower deposit costs. 
Asset quality remained strong. However, net charge-offs grew to 57 basis points versus 46 basis points in the prior quarter. As we discussed in the press release, two construction projects represent 45% of the quarter's net charge-offs. These credits did have specific reserves against them. Given the increase in NPAs and the climate of persistently high unemployment and weak economics, we felt it was prudent to cover our net charge-offs. Importantly, we continue to feel comfortable that our asset quality metrics will remain at low levels. 
Finally, while growth in commercial banking portfolio was offset by declines in our residential mortgage and consumer lending, we are pleased by our strong pipeline for commercial and residential mortgages as we move into the fourth quarter. Slide 4 addresses our current initiatives. 
Our system conversion is complete, and we are now operating a single scalable platform. The rebranding of our branches in the Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine markets is also effectively complete. Our acquisitions of Smithtown Bancorp and LSB Corp are both expected to close next month, providing, of course, that all the necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals take place. 
Additionally, we are set to open our Boston branches in the Prudential Center and on Financial Street [ph] before year ends. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased $25 million of our common stock, equal to 1.9 million shares at an average price of $13.29. This was limited because of the stock component of our pending Bank of Smithtown transaction. The repurchase program was affected through open market purchases. We will continue to evaluate the returns available to our us via the share repurchases relative to the rest of our capital deployment opportunities. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Paul to provide you with details on the quarter. Paul?"
295774,113941794,81284,"People's United Financial Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2010",2010-10-22,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jack, and good morning to you all. As Jack mentioned, our overall debt interest margin expanded to 3.73%, up five basis points from the second quarter, driven by higher investment yields and lower deposit costs. In the third quarter, we had $80",687,"Thank you, Jack, and good morning to you all. As Jack mentioned, our overall debt interest margin expanded to 3.73%, up five basis points from the second quarter, driven by higher investment yields and lower deposit costs. In the third quarter, we had $800 million more in securities on average than in the second quarter. 
We made investments of $500 million in callable agencies at the holding company and an additional $300 million of 15-year agency mortgage-backed pass-throughs at the bank. The duration of the securities portfolio declined slightly to 2.36 years. 
Despite the investments, we remained highly asset-sensitive such that earnings will increase by $40 million annually for every 100 basis point increase in the fed funds rate. 
Moving on to Slide 6. NPAs increased to 2.18% from 2.01% of loans in REO. Compared to the second quarter average of our peer group in Top 50 banks, however, our ratio is less than half their levels. We continue to feel comfortable with our asset quality in the current environment. 
On Slide 7, in the Commercial and Equipment Financing segment, while NPLs increased 10 basis points, net charge-offs in the Commercial and Equipment Financing segment dropped to 37 basis points annualized for the quarter from 92 basis points last quarter. This equates to $4.7 million in the third quarter versus $11.7 million in the second quarter for a $7 million decline. 
This is actually a good moment to reflect on the lumpiness we discussed last quarter given our low level of charge-offs as a starting point, a single creditor too can cause the annualized charge-offs in any one quarter to move meaningfully. Last quarter, that movement in this category was up. And this quarter in this category, that movement was down. 
Page 13 of the press release itemizes charge-off levels by loan category. And you'll notice that within the Equipment Finance subsegment, charge-offs declined to $1.6 million this quarter from $3.7 million in the second quarter. 
On Slide 8, you can see a breakout of our commercial real estate by their performance. And NPAs were 1.55%, compared to 1.23% in the second quarter, while NCOs rose to 98 basis points from 35 basis points as a result of the two construction projects. This equates to $13.5 million in the third quarter versus $4.8 million in the second quarter for an $8.7 million increase. It's worth noting that only 99% of the commercial real estate charge-offs in this quarter were construction related. And in fact, year-to-date, 94% of commercial real estate charge-offs have been in construction. Our portfolio remains well diversified and we believe we'll continue to see strong portfolio growth opportunities. 
Slide 9 illustrates our residential loan credit performance. As you can see, our NPLs have increased to 3.67%. Unfortunately, non-performing residential mortgage resolution continues to take much longer than previously as a result of a much slower foreclosure process in the courts. 
Our loss content has been low. As you can see in the bottom chart, and we believe it will continue to be at low levels because we have low loan to value at originations, and because approximately 85% of our non-performing loans have current loan to values of less than 90%. We feel good about the residential mortgage pipeline of originations. 
On Slide 10, you can see our Home Equity non-performing loans continue at low levels comparable to those in the second quarter. Our net charge-offs were up a bit at 26 basis points, but still significantly below industry levels. Utilization rates remain stable at 49%.  We continue to feel the Home Equity offering is an important part of our retail customer relationships. 
Slide 11 reflects our charge-off experience over the past few years. We believe that the range of over the last three to four quarters is consistent with the current weak economic environment. And year-to-date, our charge-offs have averaged 43 basis points. 
Slide 12 speaks to our competitive advantage relative to the industry with regard to asset quality and capital. And with that, I'll now hand it back to Jack to wrap it up before we open it up for your questions."

Further, given the multiyear deleveraging process and the increased regulatory pressures in the sector, we believe potential partners are becoming more interested in combination discussions.

As we look forward and look at sort of legacy business, putting aside the acquisitions for a moment, we actually see a moderate upward bias with regard to the net interest margin. And I would say, it's really sort of moderate. So I think as Jack said, we feel very good about the maintenance there. And we want to keep our powder dry with regard to asset sensitivity so that we do benefit. We felt the pain of lower earnings through the lower rate cycle, and we look forward to earnings growing as rates eventually increase. In the interim, with our pricing actions, we think we can continue to deliver the net interest margin we have, and seek a little bit of improvement."

I'm not going to give you specific numbers, because we don't disclose those. But I will give you some color. First, and you have to look at our individual businesses, because things are different depending upon, which business you're talking about. But our biggest business is our Commercial Real Estate Finance business, and that's been strong, and it remains strong, and the pipelines are very good. It's interesting, almost everything is a refinance opportunity. Many, many of those, if not most, are credit-grade tenants. There's almost no new construction, and the vast majority of the deals are in office and retail. It's across the footprint, but we have definite concentrations in Fairfield County, and inside 128 in the Boston market, and also, in New York and New Jersey. As far as C&I is concerned, I would say, that's reasonably strong. Again, concentrating in Connecticut, some in New York, particularly, in Brooklyn and Westchester. Although, we just committed and we're in the process of closing a $50 million deal, that's 5-0 in Vermont, we'll be the agent. That's probably the biggest deal in Vermont this year and maybe in a couple of years, I'm not really sure. The problem in C&I is our utilization rates and our lines of credit are running about 45%, and that's about flat from last year, we've really seen no increase. And the normal rate in our portfolios generally is around 65%. So there's a lot of demand that is just not there right now compared to what our commitments are. In terms of what you're going to see in the future, we are about to deploy new C&I teams inside 128 as soon as those Boston branches open, and we have high expectations for what they might be able to achieve. And we're also ready to put teams on the ground as soon as the Smithtown acquisition closes, to really start calling aggressively in Long Island and into New York City. As far as the Equipment Finance businesses are concerned, the PCLC business is reasonably strong. And its mostly in the direct channel, direct sales channel and it's across the board in most of our business lines. It's not what it's been in past years, but I still feel it's reasonably strong. As opposed to Financial Federal, which is now just changed its name to People's United Equipment Finance, the business is very slow there. There's a big construction concentration, and I don't think it's a surprise to anybody that the construction industry is very slow. So there just aren't a lot of new business opportunities and there's still shrinkage in that portfolio. So as we go forward, we're seeing, and we're going to see, decent increases, modest increases in some portfolios, stronger increases in others. But overall, I feel pretty good, considering the economy that we're all facing."

Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. As you know, today, we'll be reviewing our earnings for the third quarter, and we look forward to your questions after our comments are complete. Before we go through the slid",622,"Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. As you know, today, we'll be reviewing our earnings for the third quarter, and we look forward to your questions after our comments are complete. 
Before we go through the slides, I'd like to share with you some of my perspective on our two primary strategic objectives: First, to optimize the existing business, and second, to sufficiently deploy our excess capital. With regard to optimizing our business, we believe we have a more robust opportunity set relative to many in the industry. We continue to work towards additional revenue synergies made available from completed acquisitions over the last several years. We have active initiatives currently underway relative to these opportunities in all of our business lines. Certainly, the acquisitions of Bank of Smithtown and RiverBank and our branch openings in Boston, all of which we expect to close by year end, will create additional opportunity to enhance revenue going forward. 
On the capital deployment front, we have an organized acquisition plan and a targeted effort is underway. Our management team has continued to build relationships within the industry, which we believe will lead to attractive combinations. The challenge, of course, as always, relates to differing views on price. Today, we feel sellers are becoming more realistic with respect to price as a result of challenges facing the industry. The value of the synergies from consolidation relative to the value available following an independent path should add momentum to these conversations. 
On Slide 3, we provide an overview of our third quarter results. Operating net income for the quarter was $27.7 million or $0.08 per share, excluding $5.3 million or $0.01 per share for onetime costs related to the system conversion and mergers. Net interest margin expanded by five basis points from 3.68% in the second quarter to 3.73% in the third quarter as a result of higher investment yields and lower deposit costs. 
Asset quality remained strong. However, net charge-offs grew to 57 basis points versus 46 basis points in the prior quarter. As we discussed in the press release, two construction projects represent 45% of the quarter's net charge-offs. These credits did have specific reserves against them. Given the increase in NPAs and the climate of persistently high unemployment and weak economics, we felt it was prudent to cover our net charge-offs. Importantly, we continue to feel comfortable that our asset quality metrics will remain at low levels. 
Finally, while growth in commercial banking portfolio was offset by declines in our residential mortgage and consumer lending, we are pleased by our strong pipeline for commercial and residential mortgages as we move into the fourth quarter. Slide 4 addresses our current initiatives. 
Our system conversion is complete, and we are now operating a single scalable platform. The rebranding of our branches in the Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine markets is also effectively complete. Our acquisitions of Smithtown Bancorp and LSB Corp. are both expected to close next month, providing, of course, that all the necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals take place. 
Additionally, we are set to open our Boston branches in the Prudential Center and on Milk Street before year end. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased $25 million of our common stock, equal to 1.9 million shares at an average price of $13.29. This was limited because of the stock component of our pending Bank of Smithtown transaction. The repurchase program was effected through open market purchases. We will continue to evaluate the returns available to us via the share repurchases relative to the rest of our capital deployment opportunities. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Paul to provide you with details on the quarter. Paul?"
295774,113941794,81324,"People's United Financial Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 22, 2010",2010-10-22,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jack, and good morning to you all. As Jack mentioned, our overall debt interest margin expanded to 3.73%, up five basis points from the second quarter, driven by higher investment yields and lower deposit costs. In the third quarter, we had $80",684,"Thank you, Jack, and good morning to you all. As Jack mentioned, our overall debt interest margin expanded to 3.73%, up five basis points from the second quarter, driven by higher investment yields and lower deposit costs. In the third quarter, we had $800 million more in securities on average than in the second quarter. 
We made investments of $500 million in callable agencies at the holding company and an additional $300 million of 15-year agency mortgage-backed pass-throughs at the bank. The duration of the securities portfolio declined slightly to 2.36 years. 
Despite the investments, we remained highly asset-sensitive such that earnings will increase by $40 million annually for every 100 basis point increase in the fed funds rate. 
Moving on to Slide 6. NPAs increased to 2.18% from 2.01% of loans in REO. Compared to the second quarter average of our peer group in Top 50 banks, however, our ratio is less than half their levels. We continue to feel comfortable with our asset quality in the current environment. 
On Slide 7, in the Commercial and Equipment Financing segment, while NPLs increased 10 basis points, net charge-offs in the Commercial and Equipment Financing segment dropped to 37 basis points annualized for the quarter from 92 basis points last quarter. This equates to $4.7 million in the third quarter versus $11.7 million in the second quarter for a $7 million decline. 
This is actually a good moment to reflect on the lumpiness we discussed last quarter. Given our low level of charge-offs as a starting point, a single creditor too can cause the annualized charge-offs in any one quarter to move meaningfully. Last quarter, that movement in this category was up. And this quarter in this category, the movement was down. 
Page 13 of the press release itemizes charge-off levels by loan category. And you'll notice that within the Equipment Finance subsegment, charge-offs declined to $1.6 million this quarter from $3.7 million in the second quarter. 
On Slide 8, you can see a breakout of our commercial real estate credit performance. And NPAs were 1.55%, compared to 1.23% in the second quarter, while NCOs rose to 98 basis points from 35 basis points as a result of the two construction projects. This equates to $13.5 million in the third quarter versus $4.8 million in the second quarter for an $8.7 million increase. It's worth noting that fully 99% of the commercial real estate charge-offs in this quarter were construction related. And in fact, year-to-date, 94% of commercial real estate charge-offs have been in construction. Our portfolio remains well diversified, and we believe we'll continue to see strong portfolio growth opportunities. 
Slide 9 illustrates our residential loan credit performance. As you can see, our NPLs have increased to 3.67%. Unfortunately, nonperforming residential mortgage resolution continues to take much longer than previously as a result of a much slower foreclosure process in the courts. 
Our loss content has been low, as you can see in the bottom chart, and we believe it’ll continue to be at low levels because we have low loan to value at originations, and because approximately 85% of our nonperforming loans have current loan to values of less than 90%. We feel good about the residential mortgage pipeline of originations. 
On Slide 10, you can see our Home Equity nonperforming loans continue at low levels comparable to those in the second quarter. Our net charge-offs were up a bit at 26 basis points, but still significantly below industry levels. Utilization rates remain stable at 49%.  We continue to feel the Home Equity offering is an important part of our retail customer relationships. 
Slide 11 reflects our charge-off experience over the past few years. We believe that the range over the last three to four quarters is consistent with the current weak economic environment. And year-to-date, our charge-offs have averaged 43 basis points. 
Slide 12 speaks to our competitive advantage relative to the industry with regard to asset quality and capital. And with that, I'll now hand it back to Jack to wrap it up before we open it up for your questions."

In summary on Slide 13, we believe we continue to offer a compelling investment opportunity. We operate from a position of competitive strength and intend to enhance this position by continuing to focus on improving our operating performance. We'll continue to pursue capital deployment through well-priced acquisitions, while maintaining a strong dividend and evaluating the returns available from share repurchases.  Further, given the multiyear deleveraging process and the increased regulatory pressures in the sector, we believe potential partners are becoming more interested in combination discussions. 
Finally, we are significantly more asset-sensitive than our peers. So when rates finally do rise, we will have a disproportionate positive impact on our interest income. This concludes our presentation, and now we'll be happy to answer any questions you might have."

As we look forward and look at sort of legacy business, putting aside the acquisitions for a moment, we actually see a moderate upward bias with regard to the net interest margin. And I would say, it's really sort of moderate. So I think, as Jack said, we feel very good about the maintenance there. And we want to keep our powder dry with regard to asset sensitivity so that we do benefit. We felt the pain of lower earnings through the lower rate cycle, and we look forward to earnings growing as rates eventually increase. In the interim, with our pricing actions, we think we can continue to deliver the net interest margin we have, and seek a little bit of improvement."

I'm not going to give you specific numbers, because we don't disclose those. But I will give you some color. First, and you have to look at our individual businesses, because things are different depending upon which business you're talking about. But our biggest business is our Commercial Real Estate Finance business, and that's been strong, and it remains strong, and the pipelines are very good. It's interesting, almost everything is a refinance opportunity. Many, many of those, if not most, are credit-grade tenants. There's almost no new construction, and the vast majority of the deals are in office and retail. It's across the footprint, but we have definite concentrations in Fairfield County, and inside 128 in the Boston market, and also in New York and New Jersey. As far as C&I is concerned, I would say, that's reasonably strong. Again, concentrating in Connecticut, some in New York, particularly in Brooklyn and Westchester. Although we just committed and we're in the process of closing a $50 million deal, that's 5-0, in Vermont, we'll be the agent. That's probably the biggest deal in Vermont this year and maybe in a couple of years. I'm not really sure. The problem in C&I is our utilization rates and our lines of credit are running about 45%, and that's about flat from last year. We've really seen no increase. And whereas the normal rate in our portfolios generally is around 65%. So there's a lot of demand that is just not there right now compared to what our commitments are. In terms of what you're going to see in the future, we are about to deploy new C&I teams inside 128 as soon as those Boston branches open, and we have high expectations for what they might be able to achieve. And we're also ready to put teams on the ground as soon as the Smithtown acquisition closes, to really start calling aggressively in Long Island and into New York City. Now as far as the Equipment Finance businesses are concerned, the PCLC business is reasonably strong. And it’s mostly in the direct channel, direct sales channel, and it's across the board in most of our business lines. It's not what it's been in past years, but I still would say reasonably strong. As opposed to Financial Federal, which has now just changed its name to People's United Equipment Finance, the business is very slow there. There's a big construction concentration, and I don't think it's a surprise to anybody that the construction industry is very slow. So there just aren't a lot of new business opportunities and there's still shrinkage in that portfolio. So as we go forward, we're seeing, and we're going to see, decent increases, modest increases in some portfolios, stronger increases in others. But overall, I feel pretty good, considering the economy that we're all facing."

Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today.

Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. As you know, today, we'll be reviewing our earnings for the third quarter, and we look forward to your questions after our comments are complete. 
Before we go through the slides, I'd like to share with you some of my perspective on our two primary strategic objectives: First, to optimize the existing business, and second, to sufficiently deploy our excess capital. With regard to optimizing our business, we believe we have a more robust opportunity set relative to many in the industry. We continue to work towards additional revenue synergies made available from completed acquisitions over the last several years. We have active initiatives currently underway relative to these opportunities in all of our business lines. Certainly, the acquisitions of Bank of Smithtown and RiverBank and our branch openings in Boston, all of which we expect to close by year end, will create additional opportunity to enhance revenue going forward. 
On the capital deployment front, we have an organized acquisition plan and a targeted effort is underway. Our management team has continued to build relationships within the industry, which we believe will lead to attractive combinations. The challenge, of course, as always, relates to differing views on price. Today, we feel sellers are becoming more realistic with respect to price as a result of challenges facing the industry. The value of the synergies from consolidation relative to the value available following an independent path should add momentum to these conversations. 
On Slide 3, we provide an overview of our third quarter results. Operating net income for the quarter was $27.7 million or $0.08 per share, excluding $5.3 million or $0.01 per share for onetime costs related to the system conversion and mergers. Net interest margin expanded by five basis points from 3.68% in the second quarter to 3.73% in the third quarter as a result of higher investment yields and lower deposit costs. 
Asset quality remained strong. However, net charge-offs grew to 57 basis points versus 46 basis points in the prior quarter. As we discussed in the press release, two construction projects represent 45% of the quarter's net charge-offs. These credits did have specific reserves against them. Given the increase in NPAs and the climate of persistently high unemployment and weak economics, we felt it was prudent to cover our net charge-offs. Importantly, we continue to feel comfortable that our asset quality metrics will remain at low levels. 
Finally, while growth in commercial banking portfolio was offset by declines in our residential mortgage and consumer lending, we are pleased by our strong pipeline for commercial and residential mortgages as we move into the fourth quarter. Slide 4 addresses our current initiatives. 
Our system conversion is complete, and we are now operating a single scalable platform. The rebranding of our branches in the Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine markets is also effectively complete. Our acquisitions of Smithtown Bancorp and LSB Corp. are both expected to close next month, providing, of course, that all the necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals take place. 
Additionally, we are set to open our Boston branches in the Prudential Center and on Milk Street before year end. 
During the third quarter, we repurchased $25 million of our common stock, equal to 1.9 million shares at an average price of $13.29. This was limited because of the stock component of our pending Bank of Smithtown transaction. The repurchase program was effected through open market purchases. We will continue to evaluate the returns available to us via the share repurchases relative to the rest of our capital deployment opportunities. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Paul to provide you with details on the quarter. Paul?"

We made investments of $500 million in callable agencies at the holding company and an additional $300 million of 15-year agency mortgage-backed pass-throughs at the bank. The duration of the securities portfolio declined slightly to 2.36 years. 
Despite the investments, we remained highly asset-sensitive such that earnings will increase by $40 million annually for every 100 basis point increase in the fed funds rate. 
Moving on to Slide 6. NPAs increased to 2.18% from 2.01% of loans in REO. Compared to the second quarter average of our peer group in Top 50 banks, however, our ratio is less than half their levels. We continue to feel comfortable with our asset quality in the current environment. 
On Slide 7, in the Commercial and Equipment Financing segment, while NPLs increased 10 basis points, net charge-offs in the Commercial and Equipment Financing segment dropped to 37 basis points annualized for the quarter from 92 basis points last quarter. This equates to $4.7 million in the third quarter versus $11.7 million in the second quarter for a $7 million decline. 
This is actually a good moment to reflect on the lumpiness we discussed last quarter. Given our low level of charge-offs as a starting point, a single creditor too can cause the annualized charge-offs in any one quarter to move meaningfully. Last quarter, that movement in this category was up. And this quarter in this category, the movement was down. 
Page 13 of the press release itemizes charge-off levels by loan category. And you'll notice that within the Equipment Finance subsegment, charge-offs declined to $1.6 million this quarter from $3.7 million in the second quarter. 
On Slide 8, you can see a breakout of our commercial real estate credit performance. And NPAs were 1.55%, compared to 1.23% in the second quarter, while NCOs rose to 98 basis points from 35 basis points as a result of the two construction projects. This equates to $13.5 million in the third quarter versus $4.8 million in the second quarter for an $8.7 million increase. It's worth noting that fully 99% of the commercial real estate charge-offs in this quarter were construction related. And in fact, year-to-date, 94% of commercial real estate charge-offs have been in construction. Our portfolio remains well diversified, and we believe we'll continue to see strong portfolio growth opportunities. 
Slide 9 illustrates our residential loan credit performance. As you can see, our NPLs have increased to 3.67%. Unfortunately, nonperforming residential mortgage resolution continues to take much longer than previously as a result of a much slower foreclosure process in the courts. 
Our loss content has been low, as you can see in the bottom chart, and we believe it’ll continue to be at low levels because we have low loan to value at originations, and because approximately 85% of our nonperforming loans have current loan to values of less than 90%. We feel good about the residential mortgage pipeline of originations. 
On Slide 10, you can see our Home Equity nonperforming loans continue at low levels comparable to those in the second quarter. Our net charge-offs were up a bit at 26 basis points, but still significantly below industry levels. Utilization rates remain stable at 49%.  We continue to feel the Home Equity offering is an important part of our retail customer relationships. 
Slide 11 reflects our charge-off experience over the past few years. We believe that the range over the last three to four quarters is consistent with the current weak economic environment. And year-to-date, our charge-offs have averaged 43 basis points. 
Slide 12 speaks to our competitive advantage relative to the industry with regard to asset quality and capital. And with that, I'll now hand it back to Jack to wrap it up before we open it up for your questions."

We'll continue to pursue capital deployment through well-priced acquisitions, while maintaining a strong dividend and evaluating the returns available from share repurchases.  Further, given the multiyear deleveraging process and the increased regulatory pressures in the sector, we believe potential partners are becoming more interested in combination discussions. 
Finally, we are significantly more asset-sensitive than our peers. So when rates finally do rise, we will have a disproportionate positive impact on our interest income. This concludes our presentation, and now we'll be happy to answer any questions you might have."

As we look forward and look at sort of legacy business, putting aside the acquisitions for a moment, we actually see a moderate upward bias with regard to the net interest margin. And I would say, it's really sort of moderate. So I think, as Jack said, we feel very good about the maintenance there. And we want to keep our powder dry with regard to asset sensitivity so that we do benefit. We felt the pain of lower earnings through the lower rate cycle, and we look forward to earnings growing as rates eventually increase. In the interim, with our pricing actions, we think we can continue to deliver the net interest margin we have, and seek a little bit of improvement."

I'm not going to give you specific numbers, because we don't disclose those. But I will give you some color. First, and you have to look at our individual businesses, because things are different depending upon which business you're talking about. But our biggest business is our Commercial Real Estate Finance business, and that's been strong, and it remains strong, and the pipelines are very good. It's interesting, almost everything is a refinance opportunity. Many, many of those, if not most, are credit-grade tenants. There's almost no new construction, and the vast majority of the deals are in office and retail. It's across the footprint, but we have definite concentrations in Fairfield County, and inside 128 in the Boston market, and also in New York and New Jersey. As far as C&I is concerned, I would say, that's reasonably strong. Again, concentrating in Connecticut, some in New York, particularly in Brooklyn and Westchester. Although we just committed and we're in the process of closing a $50 million deal, that's 5-0, in Vermont, we'll be the agent. That's probably the biggest deal in Vermont this year and maybe in a couple of years. I'm not really sure. The problem in C&I is our utilization rates and our lines of credit are running about 45%, and that's about flat from last year. We've really seen no increase. And whereas the normal rate in our portfolios generally is around 65%. So there's a lot of demand that is just not there right now compared to what our commitments are. In terms of what you're going to see in the future, we are about to deploy new C&I teams inside 128 as soon as those Boston branches open, and we have high expectations for what they might be able to achieve. And we're also ready to put teams on the ground as soon as the Smithtown acquisition closes, to really start calling aggressively in Long Island and into New York City. Now as far as the Equipment Finance businesses are concerned, the PCLC business is reasonably strong. And it’s mostly in the direct channel, direct sales channel, and it's across the board in most of our business lines. It's not what it's been in past years, but I still would say reasonably strong. As opposed to Financial Federal, which has now just changed its name to People's United Equipment Finance, the business is very slow there. There's a big construction concentration, and I don't think it's a surprise to anybody that the construction industry is very slow. So there just aren't a lot of new business opportunities and there's still shrinkage in that portfolio. So as we go forward, we're seeing, and we're going to see, decent increases, modest increases in some portfolios, stronger increases in others. But overall, I feel pretty good, considering the economy that we're all facing."

But we also kind of go back to our discussion over the last few quarters. We've clearly opened our lens, so to speak, and are looking at deals of $1 billion or up to say, $5 billion or larger. And if it's strategically valuable to us, if the franchise that we're looking at is very attractive because of location or other reasons, then we're going to look at it. So we don't want to be locked into just doing sizable deals and getting ourselves in a spot where we don't make progress, and we continue to have that view.
