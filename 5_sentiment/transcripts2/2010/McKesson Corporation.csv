I'm pleased with the solid execution and continued momentum in our business. For the third quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $28.3 billion, a net income of $326 million or $1.19 per diluted share.Considering the challenges we faced coming into the year, we have performed better than we had anticipated and I'm proud of what we've accomplished so far. Some of our success was one-time in nature such as the benefit from the Securities Litigation settlement proceeds distributed to our 401(k) plan. But our strong performance also stems from operational excellence, diligent cost management and being ideally situated to benefit from opportunities such as the increased demand related to this year's flu season. Let me take a moment to talk about the flu season now since it impacts several different areas of the company.In the third quarter, we experienced a positive impact from higher demand for flu-related products across several of our businesses. Certainly, the single largest contribution has come from our expanded relationship with the standards for Disease Control and Prevention to handle the centralized delivery of the H1N1 flu vaccine and ancillary medical supplies. On our last conference call in October, there was some uncertainty because it was difficult to predict how many doses of the vaccine will ultimately be delivered, and because we had not finalized the necessary modifications to our existing agreement with the CDC to encompass this program. Since then, we finalized the agreement and have managed well in excess of 100 million doses of the vaccine and ancillary supplies, and we have done so in a safe and efficient manner.In addition to delivery of the vaccine, we experienced increased demand for flu-related medications that are distributed through our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Flu test kits and other supplies that are shipped through Medical-Surgical and calls to our nurse hotlines that are part of our Health Solutions business. Typically, flu related demand is relatively stable from year-to-year. This year, we had a significant increase in demand due to the H1N1 virus and it was heavily weighted to the December quarter.Moving on to some specifics for the third quarter. Distribution Solutions performed well with solid contributions from all of our businesses. Revenue growth of 4% was in line with our expectation given the continued impact from the loss of two customer buying groups in U.S. pharmaceutical in late fiscal 2009. These customer losses will impact us for the remainder of our fiscal year.The other dynamic in U.S. pharmaceutical is that our cell site margin is down as a result of events that we experienced the last fiscal year. Consistent with comments we made in the fourth quarter last year, it will take us the full year to lap the impact.Our generics programs continue to lead the market while OneStop sales are still impacted by last year's loss of an independent buying group customer, the team was able to grow generic gross profit in the quarter with continued focus on better compliance within our existing customer base.Included in our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution and services results are the results of our Specialty Care Solutions business. This business is performing well, benefiting from both its long-standing relationship with the CDC and the launch of the Generic last quarter.Turning to our other businesses and Distribution Solutions. Our Medical-Surgical business had a solid contribution to the overall success of Distribution Solutions. Medical-Surgical's revenues grew significantly reflecting increased demand related to flu and aided by acquisitions made in late fiscal 2009. Then [ph] aside the strength from flu, the business has demonstrated solid execution. I'm pleased with our progress in Medical-Surgical, particularly the continued focus on expense control measures and global sourcing of McKesson branded products.Lastly, we had a very strong performance in our Canadian Distribution business with revenues on a constant currency basis of 8%. During the quarter, we sold our 50% equity interest in McKesson Logistic Solutions. We started the third party logistics business organically in 1994 and merged it with company named ALS [Associated Logistics Solutions]in 2004, to form a 50-50 joint venture, which grew to 55 manufacturing customers by the time it was sold. Although successful, it was not core to our Canadian Distribution business, so we took the opportunity to monetize our investments, when we were able to ensure the realization of a nice profit.We remain excited about our business in Canada, many of our programs and solutions that are available to our U.S. pharmaceutical customers are also available in Canada, which clearly differentiates the value of our offering. While we're best known as a leader in pharmaceutical distribution, McKesson Canada does more than order fulfillment and logistics. We've automated 2,500 retail pharmacies and every year, over 100 million doses are dispensed during McKesson's hospital automation solutions. The strength of our distribution customer relationships has provided a great platform for the growth of our technology footprint in Canada.Recently, we signed a contract to the province in Qu√©bec to install our PACS technology in 43 hospitals, and we are connecting a network of 95 sites that will be sharing medical images. In addition, our PACS business and secured contracts for the largest clinical organization in the country, Canadian Medical Laboratories, serving 120 ambulatory radiology clinics across Canada with additional interest in U.S. clinics.I'm extremely pleased with our year-to-date performance in Distribution Solutions. We have achieved strong results despite the challenges we face coming into the year, and we expect our momentum to continue. Turning now to Technology Solutions. In the third quarter, our performance was steady with topline growth driven by services revenues. Over time, we've built a stable business models throughout the Technology Solutions segment. Much of our revenue comes from predictable, recurring strains. We believe the steady nature and complete solutions set of our technology businesses, fit well within the larger McKesson offering.The stimulus package created the incentive for healthcare providers to improve care by implementing clinical Technology Solutions such as the electronic health record. Last month, the federal government released proposed an interim final rules that healthcare providers and vendors will need to meet under the HITECH Act portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. We have worked closely with ONC's [Office of the National Coordinator]federal advisory committees both the HIT Policy Committee and HIT Standards Committee over the past eight months, so there really were no surprises for us in the receipt of the proposed rules.The proposed criteria for meaningful use and certification, both of which are necessary requirements to qualify for stimulus monies are generally comparable to the objectives previously published, as recommended by the committees. And our electronic health record systems for hospitals and physicians are well-positioned to meet these objectives.The official certification process has not been fully delineated, so no technology company has had their products certified. But we are on track to submit our EHR products for initial certification, as soon as we have a clear indication of the process. And we are eager to see the process finalized, so that we can continue to move our customers through the deployment process.We just announced a strategic partnership with HP to accelerate electronic health record adoption at independent physician practices across the country. McKesson and HP will offer physicians McKesson's EHR practice management systems, bundled with HP office hardware and pre-configured for easy installation. The two companies are working together toward the common goal of simplifying physician EHR adoption, so physicians can meet the stimulus deadlines. We expect our technology business will benefit from the clinical wave, that has been created by the stimulus and we can also provide the connectivity features that allow rapid movement of clinical and financial information to the entire network of healthcare.Not only are we helping customers serve their near-term clinical requirements, we will have ongoing opportunities when hospitals turn to us to help them re-architect their financial systems to provide improved cash flow and connectivity and improve relationships with patients.We'll be able to accomplish this with solutions such as Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management, which is the complete reinvention of the financial tools that hospitals use to manage the financial and administrative side of the Enterprise, combined with the technology necessary to connect with payors and patients. We mentioned this last quarter, but it's important to emphasize that the Horizon ERM [Enterprise Revenue Management] was designed with an architecture, similar to our clinical systems. And therefore, the integration and inter-workings of these two solutions are compatible. And the system incorporates other McKesson software and solutions such as Interpol clinical content and RelayHealth connectivity tools.None of our competitors has an offering of services the entire healthcare system the way that McKesson does. Our ability to understand the interaction that take place in this fragmented healthcare system, increase solutions from that knowledge, benefits our customers and provides the opportunity for us. Increasingly, our connectivity solutions through RelayHealth and our solutions for the fair market through our Health Solutions business are becoming larger components of Technology Solutions. In McKesson Health Solutions our footprint is unparalleled, and we uniquely combine expert technology with evidence based clinical information to enable payors to manage their administrative and medical costs. In our RelayHealth business, we facilitate the exchange of information among almost every player in the healthcare system. Including health systems, pharmacies, payors, physicians government agencies and consumers. We are expanding our health information exchange footprint with strategic wins at health systems that are choosing RelayHealth to exchange health information among various constituents. With more than 1 million patients enrolled in our system, McKesson is the only major player that has the patient, actively participating in HIV connectivity, really helped us play in a significant role in helping customers achieve meaningful use, by supporting interoperability and data exchange requirements for hospitals and physician practices using both McKesson and non-McKesson solutions.I am pleased with the work that has been done by the team to help our customers identify the information technology they need to design adoption roadmaps, to help them reach their objectives for meaningful use. Year-to-date, our Technology Solutions results our tracking with what we expected as we entered the year, with steady revenue growth and solid operating margin expansion. Our customers are buying and installing clinical solutions and we are ramping up our business to match the momentum created by the stimulus.Our intention is to invest more heavily in the back half of this fiscal year, because we are committed to successfully implementing our customers' clinical solutions. But we are also building the business for the next decade which is why our offering includes the latest financial solutions for hospitals that I've discussed previously, as well as the connectivity that will be necessary to exchange information throughout the network.Now before I turn it over to Jeff, I want to leave you with a few more general thoughts. This really is a very fortunate time to be in healthcare and I believe McKesson is perfectly positioned. Everything we see in our future is generally supportive of continued growth in our businesses. We are ideally situated in an environment where the use of pharmaceuticals to do nothing but expand given the aging population and the evidence and proof that pharmaceuticals are the lowest cost alternative from a healthcare perspective. Our diversified technology platform is at the center of much of what is going on in healthcare today. The current clinical way, the growing focus on connectivity and the enterprise-wide financial systems that will be required to pull it all together. All of our businesses are producing sound operating results with very positive cash flow. We have demonstrated our ability to deploy cash with the portfolio approach that over time, has created significant value for our shareholders.Over the past seven fiscal years, we have deployed more than $4 billion for 33 acquisitions which have paid off a strategic value for the company and good financial results. Over that same time period, we've deployed more than $4 billion to repurchase 83 million shares and doubled our dividend. You might find us building cash at times, but I would remind you that our capital deployment is balanced when you view it over years, as opposed to quarters. We do not manage decisions around share repurchases, acquisitions and the dividend on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Instead, we are patient and take a longer term view, with the intent of consistently exceeding our shareholders expectations for the use of our cash flow --In summary, I'm confident in the earnings potential of the company and pleased that we are raising our full year guidance and now expect earnings per diluted share of $4.55 to $4.70 for fiscal 2010, excluding the favorable second quarter litigation credit. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff and will return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?"

As you just heard, McKesson is built upon the momentum achieved in the first half of our fiscal year, to deliver solid third quarter results. Before I begin reviewing our financial performance, let me point out t",1617,"Thanks, John and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard, McKesson is built upon the momentum achieved in the first half of our fiscal year, to deliver solid third quarter results. Before I begin reviewing our financial performance, let me point out that my discussion will exclude for comparison purposes the impact of the prior year's third quarter AWP litigation charge.As usual, I'll begin by discussing our consolidated results, then I'll provide additional color when I discuss each segment in more detail, and I'll close with an update on our full year outlook. Revenues for the quarter were $28.3 billion representing 4% growth. Our gross profit for the quarter increased 8% to $1.5 billion. This leverage of the gross profit line is driven by Distribution Solutions. Total operating expenses for the quarter increased 5% to $946 million, due to higher employee compensation costs, foreign exchange rate movements and higher legal expenses and legal settlement charges.While we continue to see some benefit from the cost containment initiatives we put in place beginning mid-fiscal 2009, we have begun to lap these efforts. Operating income for the quarter grew 16% to $509 million.Moving below operating income. Other income was $25 million compared to $17 million in the prior year. As discussed in our October earnings call, the current year benefited from the sale of our equity interest in McKesson Logistics Solutions which resulted in a pretax gain of $17 million, or approximately $0.05 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of this sale, the decline in other income was primarily due to lower interest income resulting from lower prevailing interest rates. Interest expense for the quarter of $47 million increased due to the $700 million in debt we issued last February. Moving to taxes. Our full year run rate remains at the 32% we have been using all year. Higher third quarter effective tax rate of 33.1% includes a $0.03 impact from unfavorable tax discrete items. This compares to 31.2% in the prior year as the prior year included $0.03 of favorable tax discrete items.Net income was $326 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.19. To wrap up our consolidated results, this year's EPS number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases, which lowered our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 1% year-over-year to 274 million shares.Let's now move on to Distribution Solutions results. In this segment, we are pleased with overall, revenue growth of 4% compared to the same quarter last year. Total U.S. pharmaceutical distribution and services revenue increased 2%, primarily reflecting market growth, partially offset by the fiscal 2009 customer losses that we've previously discussed.As you've seen for several quarters now, we continue to show a shift from warehouse purchases to direct store delivery by our large customer. This was substantially completed this quarter.Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis grew 8% for the quarter primarily due to market growth. Including a favorable currency impact of 15%, Canadian revenues grew 23% for the quarter.Medical-Surgical distribution revenues were up 11% for the quarter to $758 million. Gross profit for this segment grew 12% to $1.1 billion, up from $1 billion a year ago. The increased demand related to the flu season which I'll come back to in a few minutes and to a lesser extent, increased margins from the sale of generic drugs, helped to drive an improved mix of higher margin products across our distribution businesses. These events drove a significantly expanded gross profit margin rate. Partially offsetting these benefits, our sell margin was negatively impacted by customer renewals and the loss of customers that occurred late in our fiscal 2009, as well as lower compensation from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers due to timing.Our Distribution Solutions operating expenses increased to 2% for the quarter to $568 million, which is below the 4% increase in revenues highlighting our continued ability to achieve expense leverage in this business.Operating profits for the quarter was $558 million, compared to $439 million in the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, the current year benefited from the sale of our equity interest in McKesson Logistics Solutions. In summary, and before I move on to Technology Solutions, we're very pleased with all the efforts of our Distribution Solutions team, to mitigate the challenges we face at the beginning of this fiscal year.In Technology Solutions, total revenues grew 3% for the quarter to $771 million. This brings year-to-date growth for Technology Solutions to 2%, which is roughly in line with our full year assumption to remain at levels similar to fiscal 2009.Services revenues increased 6% in the quarter to $610 million, reflecting the more stable nature of these service revenues. Software and software systems revenues of $138 million declined 2% from the prior year, hardware revenues of $23 million in the quarter were down 32% from the prior year, reflecting lower rates at which hardware is attached, is part of system implementations and overall, reduced hardware component cost.Technology Solutions gross profit declined by 1% to $351 million, driven primarily by a higher software deferral rate and additional amortization and costs related to Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management. When Horizon ERM became generally available in the second quarter, it triggered incremental amortization expense of $7.5 million per quarter.Technology Solutions operating expenses increased 2% in the quarter to $271 million. New higher expenses are primarily due to increased R&D spending, and a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the prior year.We continue to innovate and invest in R&D to maintain our leadership position. For the quarter, Technology Solutions had total gross R&D spending of $104 million, compared to $99 million in the prior year. Of these amounts, we capitalized just 14% compared to 19% a year ago.Our operating profit in our Technology Solutions segment this quarter was $81 million, down 11% from the $91 million we recorded a year ago. Our operating margin in this segment was 10.51% for the quarter, compared to 12.12% in the prior year.We'll leave our segment performance now and turn briefly to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. Our receivables are $8.3 billion which is up from December 31, 2008 balance of $7.6 billion. Our days sales outstanding remain flat at 23 days after adjusting the prior year, for the $350 million utilization of our AR sales facility.Moving onto inventories. Through continued careful inventory management and as a result of timing, our 30 days sales and inventory again showed a nice improvement three days compared to last year. Our inventories were $8.8 billion on December 31, a 6% decrease over the prior year.For the second quarter in a row, we have shown a modest sequential improvement for DSI from what we posted at the end of the previous quarters. Our payables increased 6% to $13 billion from a year ago, and days sales and payables increased to 44 days from 43 days last year.These working capital improvements have resulted in $1.7 billion in operating cash flow year-to-date. These results include the impact of the $350 million AWP settlement payment that was released from escrow in our December quarter just ended. Based on our continued progress, we feel very comfortable in our ability to generate in a range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion of operating cash for the full year fiscal 2010. This strong cash flow generation has led to a cash balance, $3.4 billion at December 31.As our share repurchase activity has slowed during the year, we now expect our full year average share count to come in a bit above the original guidance we provided of 272 million shares outstanding. Our capital spending continues to trend as expected, at $350 million to $400 million for the year. Now I'll turn to our outlook.As John mentioned earlier, we are raising our guidance on diluted EPS, excluding the favorable second quarter litigation credits from $4.45 to $4.60, to a new range of $4.55 to $4.70. As we've had a number of updates to our guidance range during the year, I think it's worthwhile to review some of the key changes impacting our EPS range from the beginning of the fiscal year to now. As a reminder, we started the year providing an EPS range of $3.90 to $4.5. Since then, a couple of things have happened.First, we had a favorable legal settlement impacting the company's 401(k) plan, which drove approximately $0.15 of upside, spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Second, we had a $0.05 benefit related to the third quarter sale of our 50% stake in the Canadian joint venture McKesson Logistics Solutions.Third, we've seen increased demand from the flu that is incremental to last year's flu performance. We now expect that incremental demand for this flu season will contribute $0.35 to $0.40 to our full year EPS, a little more than 2/3 of which came in our December quarter. Looking to next year on the flu, our goal will be to find business opportunities that allow us to sustain this level of incremental profit. We're unlikely to sustain at all at this year's level.So if you were to adjust for this three items, the favorable 401(k) legal settlement, the McKesson Logistic Solutions sale and the incremental flu, you get to an EPS range that is $0.05 to $0.10 above our original guidance for the year.In closing, we are pleased with our ability to our rise to the challenges we have faced so far this year and we believe our solid execution to date will propel us to a strong finish in fiscal 2010. Thanks and with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. I would ask that you limit your questions to just one per person to allow others an opportunity to participate.

But stepping it up just a level, I would say that our technology business overall has seen that our customers are buying at a rate that is at or above what our expectations were coming into the year. The challenge for us now as we look at the rest of this year and into next year is the implementation time for some of these relationships that have expanded beyond what would have been a perhaps a more let's put this in as we go kind of philosophy to -- we want a contract for a complete solution to get ready for stimulus. So what we might have normally have installed in this quarter and recognized this quarter from a software perspective and realizing the revenues is not so much related to what we sell is -- that really have booked. It's what we recognize as revenue. What we recognize as revenue is both mix related but also a time to implementation and complexity related. So I think our tone in center of this should be positive albeit somewhat extended as it relates to getting actual P&L results from what our customers are asking us to do. And you also assess somewhat unrelated to the software thing. Our comments about margins, are still in line with what we expected but we are investing as we suggest the last quarter more heavily in the back half of this year which will continue through our fourth quarter. And this is all in the spirit of how do we get these implementations done more quickly for our customers and in time for the stimulus. So it's really a combination of more complex contracts and a longer time to implement and then we added a burden of expenses in advance of those implementations on which are offsetting what you don't see which are positive trends from a booking perspective."

So albeit, we try to move our margins up year-over-year. Our Distribution Solutions segment margin rate increases and we expect to experience that again this year as we guided to at the beginning of the year, we still see seasonality in our business. And that is a completely different discussion than customer contract renewals. And I don't really think there's seasonality necessarily in that context customer renewals. If you lose one by surprise or something negative happens, it just happens. And it doesn't have anything to do with the way our season on our quarters work."

Our confidence on buying shares and buying or paying dividends is the fact that we appreciate that we need to have a portfolio approach and sometimes the capital is better deployed in that way. I guess the message in this quarter is that we don't feel it necessarily a big rush to deploy the capital.

So I think you would find that we will look to the businesses that we're in today and we bring some knowledge, we bring some synergy.

And of course we always have quarterly volatility, so you know we encourage people to think about the margin on a full year basis. But if you look at the operating margin for the December quarter, if you take out the year-over-year change in the flu profits, the operating profit margin is relatively flat. And that's because of a change this year and the timing of some of our compensation from the branded manufacturers. If you look at the full year, though for our FY '10 versus FY '09, our expectation is, if you strip out in both year's flu profits, you would see a basis at least the 10 basis point improvement year-over-year in the operating margin rates for Distribution Solutions. Let me just come to your gross margin comments. So it gets a little bit more judgmental the way we adjust at the gross margin level frankly for the flu, but you'd see a pretty similar pattern. So for the December quarter, your gross margin would be down a little bit but for the full year, your gross margin is going to be up. And once you strip the flu out, the overwhelming driver of that year-over-year gross margin improvement are the improved profits on generics. Because of the loss of the retail independents GPO we experienced last year, the real driver of the increased profits on generics this year comes from a combination of better compliance, better penetration amongst our existing customer base, better sourcing, combined with a pretty good launch schedule this year, although I would point out that this year's launch schedule is not quite as good as last year's."

So 90 days ago, Larry, when we had our last earnings call, it was still very early on in the flu season. And in fact, as you recall, in our September quarter, our profits year-over-year related to the flu were pretty flat. So we were just entering the period of getting a sense of what kind of incremental demand we were going to see for everything from generic, drugs related to the flu, to flow test kits in our Medical-Surgical business, the seasonal flu vaccines and then of course, we, at that point, had not finalized our contracts for the amendment to our existing contract with the CDC. And there was tremendous uncertainty I think it's fair to say 90 days ago about just exactly how the federal government's efforts to deliver H1N1 vaccines across the country would play out. So 90 days later, we've not only finalized that CDC contract, we have a very clear grasp now of likely shipment volumes. We think that we've been through the peak of things like demand for flu test kits and I don't know I suppose we could be surprised in the next 60 days. And so it's a combination of all those things that has taken us from what was a very rough estimate 90 days ago to today when I think is a pretty strong read on the incremental benefit this year from all of those things we do related to the flu versus last year. So that is a long way of answering your question in how we got from sort of up to $0.20 which is what we said 90 days ago all the way up to the range of $0.35 to $0.40 now."

And so we put in several majors to try to counteract that and clearly tight expense controls and optimizing our performance with our existing customers and suppliers to improve our returns on those pieces of business, and basically looking everywhere for opportunities. And clearly, we are well positioned I think to take advantage of the opportunity presented with the flu season. We are in very good businesses that participate in flu but we also had a business that had  a current track record of performance with the CDC and we're able to build out those six distribution centers in a matter of weeks to service this unprecedented requirement. So clearly, I'm pleased with what we did this year to fill the hole. Larry, I would hope that as we come back and we start fiscal '11, we don't have a similar kind of customer hole to dig our way out of as we start the year that will give us sort of the typical momentum that you expect from McKesson year on year. And then secondly, to Jeff's comments and my comments relative to trying to find additional opportunities to help cover the year-on-year lap of the flu event, it's still not clear to us what demands might be on us next year, or what kind of flu season we might have. There's discussion about H1N1 coming back in a more virulent way. And clearly, I think we've demonstrated our ability to help in this emergency need that the country and hope that this six facilities that we've established will not all be turned off and set aside. Clearly, anything we can do to work through that with the CDC or others in terms of utilizing those assets will be nothing but upside given that we have anticipated that they will be put out of commission as the season draws to an end. So there would be an opportunity depending on your view of what might happen in the future from a vaccination perspective and how our vaccine business, overall, might continue to evolve, given our import now to the country relative to things like standard flu and other vaccinations that take place like we started with the children's health vaccine program. So I think the point of our discussion is to highlight the fact that the $0.35 to $0.40 we believe is unusual. And also highlight the fact that we are working hard to find other opportunities that will help us cover some of that year-on-year comparison."

But if you can set all of that aside, you should assume that our teams are working as they think about next year, not only in how do we grow off of the $3.90 to $4.05 plus $0.05 to $0.10 that you guys are talking about, but also think about what is that number really going to be as we focus to next year.

What I can say is that the reason I spent time on this in this call was that our team has not only been involved in helping to set the requirements but we're not surprised by them and I believe they believe that we have what it takes to get these products certified and through the process on behalf of our customers. Said in a more frank way, I don't know how we'd have a clinical business if they weren't certified. And so I think it's almost impossible to believe that we would not achieve certification. And if our competitors certainly can achieve certification, if that's what you're looking at, we certainly can, because there's no technical reason that we see why that can't happen. As to the investment, we have made investments in our clinical products, quite significant investments over the last six to 12 months and we continue to make investments. But our heaviest investments right now really focused on making sure that we can install this products at a timeframe for our customers and there's a significant ramp in front of us with customers that might have been in the three-year plan to install clinicals that are saying, ""Gee, we'd like to move that to 18 months."" As you might imagine, that puts tremendous strain on our implementation teams and in our customers to get ready for stimulus. So we are actually hiring now pretty aggressively because we have to train these people before they're deployed in the hospital and that expense is falling in this quarter and next quarter, it will fall into next year as well as we start those implementations. And as I mentioned, an answer to an earlier question, part of our revenue and earnings outlook on this business is predicated in our ability to successfully deploy and install these products. Not so much that our contractual obligations have changed with our customers but just from a percentage of completion accounting methodology perspective, if we have a large contract that contained multiple products, our recognition of the entire contract is put off until the final product is installed. So if a customer is going to take 18 months to get  a product or a series of products or contracts installed, it will be the 18th month when we finally put the last product in that we will realize the earnings out of it, even though we might have invested 18 months worth of expense to get that product or that contract, I should say, complete for that customer. So I'm less concerned about our ability to get our products certified than I am about our customers to be ready for meaningful use based on the fact that at least 50% of the work is necessary is going to be done by them and their staffs as opposed to what we try to do from the industry side. There's a lot of work to be done. But this is all good for us and it's all going to deliver increased revenues and increased margins."

I'd say, Lisa, really the biggest uncertainty that's a little tricky to forecast is still the demand around the flu. And so that's probably the biggest thing that would either nudge us towards the higher end of our range or nudge us towards the lower end of the range. The second comment I would make is there's always a little bit of volatility for the modest portion of our compensation from branded manufacturers that comes through price increases. And while that's modest, it's still enough to be noticed in the quarter. Interestingly enough, the year-to-date for our mix of products through 12/31, price increases are actually down slightly although not by a material amount. Based on what we've seen so far in January, I think we'll be right in line with our guidance for the year of having price increases be pretty similar the last year. There's always a little bit of uncertainty from that. So those are probably the two biggest things I'd say at this point in time that could drive us up or down a little bit as we go through the March quarter. As to your second question, although the real biggest change on the depreciation and amortization side is that this quarter is the first quarter that we begun to amortize the costs or the capitalized costs associated with our Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management product. And so that was almost $8 million in the quarter. You'll see now that $8 million every quarter for the next three years which means that for half of this year and half of next year, you're going to see that as an increase. But the rest of the year-over-year change and depreciation and amortization is really just the normal increase, I guess, it's another $12 million or so the normal increase that comes from spending $350 million to $400 million on various kinds of capital spending each year."

I would say that my comments were primarily related to the industry's requirements relative to IT suppliers to get our products certifiable. You are absolutely right that there's a big requirement on the provider side in terms of what they have to do. And frankly, the providers are probably better positioned to speak for that and represent themselves in Washington. However, that said, we clearly are focused on helping our customers be more successful and we have been working to make all of these regulations slightly more lenient. For example, one of the earlier drafts require that every physician for every order use electronic orders. And that's just not feasible, it's not practical. So things like that we've been able to change over time and I think we've been able to affect legislation. So I'm guardedly optimistic that through the comment period, we'll get some additional interpretation or perhaps relaxation on some of this and that will help our hospital customers and physician customers get there successfully."

The question one was how the flu had impacted our guidance change versus 90 days ago, and question two is a question on flu revenue. So assuming that's right, if you think about the $0.10 increase in our guidance, I would really say that's two things: It's the fact that we're $0.15 to $0.20 more optimistic on the flu than we were 90 days ago. And that's partially offset by the fact that we were a little surprised this quarter by some legal costs we incurred, most of which have to do frankly with some things related to the old HBOC acquisition and amazingly enough, some things related to McKesson Chemical,, which I believe the company sold off in 1987 and we're still dealing with some of the environmental cases. So those things along with some tax discrete items that went against this quarter offset a little bit of that flu upside. That explains the guidance change of where we were 90 days ago to today. In terms of the flu's impact on revenues, that's a very good question. Because the impact on the revenue is pretty immaterial to the company. Almost everything we do with regard to the flu is much higher margin from a flu test kit to a generic drug that's flu related to importantly, the CDC contract which is a third-party logistics contract, where we are not taking the value of the product into our inventory. So of course, a third-party logistics contract always has a much higher margin than our normal distribution sort of arrangement."

I'm pleased with the solid execution and continued momentum in our business. For the third quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $28.3 billion, a net income of $326 million or $1.19 per diluted share.Considering the challenges we faced coming into the year, we have performed better than we had anticipated and I'm proud of what we've accomplished so far. Some of our success was one-time in nature such as the benefit from the Securities Litigation settlement proceeds distributed to our 401(k) plan. But our strong performance also stems from operational excellence, diligent cost management and being ideally situated to benefit from opportunities such as the increased demand related to this year's flu season. Let me take a moment to talk about the flu season now since it impacts several different areas of the company.In the third quarter, we experienced a positive impact from higher demand for flu-related products across several of our businesses. Certainly, the single largest contribution has come from our expanded relationship with the standards for Disease Control and Prevention to handle the centralized delivery of the H1N1 flu vaccine and ancillary medical supplies. On our last conference call in October, there was some uncertainty because it was difficult to predict how many doses of the vaccine will ultimately be delivered, and because we had not finalized the necessary modifications to our existing agreement with the CDC to encompass this program. Since then, we finalized the agreement and have managed well in excess of 100 million doses of the vaccine and ancillary supplies, and we have done so in a safe and efficient manner.In addition to delivery of the vaccine, we experienced increased demand for flu-related medications that are distributed through our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Flu test kits and other supplies that are shipped through Medical-Surgical and calls to our nurse hotlines that are part of our Health Solutions business. Typically, flu related demand is relatively stable from year-to-year. This year, we had a significant increase in demand due to the H1N1 virus and it was heavily weighted to the December quarter.Moving on to some specifics for the third quarter. Distribution Solutions performed well with solid contributions from all of our businesses. Revenue growth of 4% was in line with our expectation given the continued impact from the loss of two customer buying groups in U.S. pharmaceutical in late fiscal 2009. These customer losses will impact us for the remainder of our fiscal year.The other dynamic in U.S. pharmaceutical is that our cell site margin is down as a result of events that we experienced the last fiscal year. Consistent with comments we made in the fourth quarter last year, it will take us the full year to lap the impact.Our generics programs continue to lead the market while OneStop sales are still impacted by last year's loss of an independent buying group customer, the team was able to grow generic gross profit in the quarter with continued focus on better compliance within our existing customer base.Included in our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution and services results are the results of our Specialty Care Solutions business. This business is performing well, benefiting from both its long-standing relationship with the CDC and the launch of the Generic last quarter.Turning to our other businesses and Distribution Solutions. Our Medical-Surgical business had a solid contribution to the overall success of Distribution Solutions. Medical-Surgical's revenues grew significantly reflecting increased demand related to flu and aided by acquisitions made in late fiscal 2009. Then [ph] aside the strength from flu, the business has demonstrated solid execution. I'm pleased with our progress in Medical-Surgical, particularly the continued focus on expense control measures and global sourcing of McKesson branded products.Lastly, we had a very strong performance in our Canadian Distribution business with revenues on a constant currency basis of 8%. During the quarter, we sold our 50% equity interest in McKesson Logistic Solutions. We started the third party logistics business organically in 1994 and merged it with company named ALS [Associated Logistics Solutions]in 2004, to form a 50-50 joint venture, which grew to 55 manufacturing customers by the time it was sold. Although successful, it was not core to our Canadian Distribution business, so we took the opportunity to monetize our investments, when we were able to ensure the realization of a nice profit.We remain excited about our business in Canada, many of our programs and solutions that are available to our U.S. pharmaceutical customers are also available in Canada, which clearly differentiates the value of our offering. While we're best known as a leader in pharmaceutical distribution, McKesson Canada does more than order fulfillment and logistics. We've automated 2,500 retail pharmacies and every year, over 100 million doses are dispensed during McKesson's hospital automation solutions. The strength of our distribution customer relationships has provided a great platform for the growth of our technology footprint in Canada.Recently, we signed a contract to the province in Qu√©bec to install our PACS technology in 43 hospitals, and we are connecting a network of 95 sites that will be sharing medical images. In addition, our PACS business and secured contracts for the largest clinical organization in the country, Canadian Medical Laboratories, serving 120 ambulatory radiology clinics across Canada with additional interest in U.S. clinics.I'm extremely pleased with our year-to-date performance in Distribution Solutions. We have achieved strong results despite the challenges we face coming into the year, and we expect our momentum to continue. Turning now to Technology Solutions. In the third quarter, our performance was steady with topline growth driven by services revenues. Over time, we've built a stable business models throughout the Technology Solutions segment. Much of our revenue comes from predictable, recurring strains. We believe the steady nature and complete solutions set of our technology businesses, fit well within the larger McKesson offering.The stimulus package created the incentive for healthcare providers to improve care by implementing clinical Technology Solutions such as the electronic health record. Last month, the federal government released proposed an interim final rules that healthcare providers and vendors will need to meet under the HITECH Act portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. We have worked closely with ONC's [Office of the National Coordinator]federal advisory committees both the HIT Policy Committee and HIT Standards Committee over the past eight months, so there really were no surprises for us in the receipt of the proposed rules.The proposed criteria for meaningful use and certification, both of which are necessary requirements to qualify for stimulus monies are generally comparable to the objectives previously published, as recommended by the committees. And our electronic health record systems for hospitals and physicians are well-positioned to meet these objectives.The official certification process has not been fully delineated, so no technology company has had their products certified. But we are on track to submit our EHR products for initial certification, as soon as we have a clear indication of the process. And we are eager to see the process finalized, so that we can continue to move our customers through the deployment process.We just announced a strategic partnership with HP to accelerate electronic health record adoption at independent physician practices across the country. McKesson and HP will offer physicians McKesson's EHR practice management systems, bundled with HP office hardware and pre-configured for easy installation. The two companies are working together toward the common goal of simplifying physician EHR adoption, so physicians can meet the stimulus deadlines. We expect our technology business will benefit from the clinical wave, that has been created by the stimulus and we can also provide the connectivity features that allow rapid movement of clinical and financial information to the entire network of healthcare.Not only are we helping customers serve their near-term clinical requirements, we will have ongoing opportunities when hospitals turn to us to help them re-architect their financial systems to provide improved cash flow and connectivity and improve relationships with patients.We'll be able to accomplish this with solutions such as Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management, which is the complete reinvention of the financial tools that hospitals use to manage the financial and administrative side of the Enterprise, combined with the technology necessary to connect with payors and patients. We mentioned this last quarter, but it's important to emphasize that the Horizon ERM [Enterprise Revenue Management] was designed with an architecture, similar to our clinical systems. And therefore, the integration and inter-workings of these two solutions are compatible. And the system incorporates other McKesson software and solutions such as Interpol clinical content and RelayHealth connectivity tools.None of our competitors has an offering of services the entire healthcare system the way that McKesson does. Our ability to understand the interaction that take place in this fragmented healthcare system, increase solutions from that knowledge, benefits our customers and provides the opportunity for us. Increasingly, our connectivity solutions through RelayHealth and our solutions for the fair market through our Health Solutions business are becoming larger components of Technology Solutions. In McKesson Health Solutions our footprint is unparalleled, and we uniquely combine expert technology with evidence based clinical information to enable payors to manage their administrative and medical costs. In our RelayHealth business, we facilitate the exchange of information among almost every player in the healthcare system. Including health systems, pharmacies, payors, physicians government agencies and consumers. We are expanding our health information exchange footprint with strategic wins at health systems that are choosing RelayHealth to exchange health information among various constituents. With more than 1 million patients enrolled in our system, McKesson is the only major player that has the patient, actively participating in HIV connectivity, really helped us play in a significant role in helping customers achieve meaningful use, by supporting interoperability and data exchange requirements for hospitals and physician practices using both McKesson and non-McKesson solutions.I am pleased with the work that has been done by the team to help our customers identify the information technology they need to design adoption roadmaps, to help them reach their objectives for meaningful use. Year-to-date, our Technology Solutions results our tracking with what we expected as we entered the year, with steady revenue growth and solid operating margin expansion. Our customers are buying and installing clinical solutions and we are ramping up our business to match the momentum created by the stimulus.Our intention is to invest more heavily in the back half of this fiscal year, because we are committed to successfully implementing our customers' clinical solutions. But we are also building the business for the next decade which is why our offering includes the latest financial solutions for hospitals that I've discussed previously, as well as the connectivity that will be necessary to exchange information throughout the network.Now before I turn it over to Jeff, I want to leave you with a few more general thoughts. This really is a very fortunate time to be in healthcare and I believe McKesson is perfectly positioned. Everything we see in our future is generally supportive of continued growth in our businesses. We are ideally situated in an environment where the use of pharmaceuticals to do nothing but expand given the aging population and the evidence and proof that pharmaceuticals are the lowest cost alternative from a healthcare perspective. Our diversified technology platform is at the center of much of what is going on in healthcare today. The current clinical way, the growing focus on connectivity and the enterprise-wide financial systems that will be required to pull it all together. All of our businesses are producing sound operating results with very positive cash flow. We have demonstrated our ability to deploy cash with the portfolio approach that over time, has created significant value for our shareholders.Over the past seven fiscal years, we have deployed more than $4 billion for 33 acquisitions which have paid off a strategic value for the company and good financial results. Over that same time period, we've deployed more than $4 billion to repurchase 83 million shares and doubled our dividend. You might find us building cash at times, but I would remind you that our capital deployment is balanced when you view it over years, as opposed to quarters. We do not manage decisions around share repurchases, acquisitions and the dividend on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Instead, we are patient and take a longer term view, with the intent of consistently exceeding our shareholders expectations for the use of our cash flow --In summary, I'm confident in the earnings potential of the company and pleased that we are raising our full year guidance and now expect earnings per diluted share of $4.55 to $4.70 for fiscal 2010, excluding the favorable second quarter litigation credit. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff and will return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?"

As you just heard, McKesson is built upon the momentum achieved in the first half of our fiscal year, to deliver solid third quarter results. Before I begin reviewing our financial performance, let me point out t",1617,"Thanks, John and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard, McKesson is built upon the momentum achieved in the first half of our fiscal year, to deliver solid third quarter results. Before I begin reviewing our financial performance, let me point out that my discussion will exclude for comparison purposes the impact of the prior year's third quarter AWP litigation charge.As usual, I'll begin by discussing our consolidated results, then I'll provide additional color when I discuss each segment in more detail, and I'll close with an update on our full year outlook. Revenues for the quarter were $28.3 billion representing 4% growth. Our gross profit for the quarter increased 8% to $1.5 billion. This leverage of the gross profit line is driven by Distribution Solutions. Total operating expenses for the quarter increased 5% to $946 million, due to higher employee compensation costs, foreign exchange rate movements and higher legal expenses and legal settlement charges.While we continue to see some benefit from the cost containment initiatives we put in place beginning mid-fiscal 2009, we have begun to lap these efforts. Operating income for the quarter grew 16% to $509 million.Moving below operating income. Other income was $25 million compared to $17 million in the prior year. As discussed in our October earnings call, the current year benefited from the sale of our equity interest in McKesson Logistics Solutions which resulted in a pretax gain of $17 million, or approximately $0.05 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of this sale, the decline in other income was primarily due to lower interest income resulting from lower prevailing interest rates. Interest expense for the quarter of $47 million increased due to the $700 million in debt we issued last February. Moving to taxes. Our full year run rate remains at the 32% we have been using all year. Higher third quarter effective tax rate of 33.1% includes a $0.03 impact from unfavorable tax discrete items. This compares to 31.2% in the prior year as the prior year included $0.03 of favorable tax discrete items.Net income was $326 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.19. To wrap up our consolidated results, this year's EPS number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases, which lowered our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 1% year-over-year to 274 million shares.Let's now move on to Distribution Solutions results. In this segment, we are pleased with overall, revenue growth of 4% compared to the same quarter last year. Total U.S. pharmaceutical distribution and services revenue increased 2%, primarily reflecting market growth, partially offset by the fiscal 2009 customer losses that we've previously discussed.As you've seen for several quarters now, we continue to show a shift from warehouse purchases to direct store delivery by our large customer. This was substantially completed this quarter.Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis grew 8% for the quarter primarily due to market growth. Including a favorable currency impact of 15%, Canadian revenues grew 23% for the quarter.Medical-Surgical distribution revenues were up 11% for the quarter to $758 million. Gross profit for this segment grew 12% to $1.1 billion, up from $1 billion a year ago. The increased demand related to the flu season which I'll come back to in a few minutes and to a lesser extent, increased margins from the sale of generic drugs, helped to drive an improved mix of higher margin products across our distribution businesses. These events drove a significantly expanded gross profit margin rate. Partially offsetting these benefits, our sell margin was negatively impacted by customer renewals and the loss of customers that occurred late in our fiscal 2009, as well as lower compensation from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers due to timing.Our Distribution Solutions operating expenses increased to 2% for the quarter to $568 million, which is below the 4% increase in revenues highlighting our continued ability to achieve expense leverage in this business.Operating profits for the quarter was $558 million, compared to $439 million in the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, the current year benefited from the sale of our equity interest in McKesson Logistics Solutions. In summary, and before I move on to Technology Solutions, we're very pleased with all the efforts of our Distribution Solutions team, to mitigate the challenges we face at the beginning of this fiscal year.In Technology Solutions, total revenues grew 3% for the quarter to $771 million. This brings year-to-date growth for Technology Solutions to 2%, which is roughly in line with our full year assumption to remain at levels similar to fiscal 2009.Services revenues increased 6% in the quarter to $610 million, reflecting the more stable nature of these service revenues. Software and software systems revenues of $138 million declined 2% from the prior year, hardware revenues of $23 million in the quarter were down 32% from the prior year, reflecting lower rates at which hardware is attached, is part of system implementations and overall, reduced hardware component cost.Technology Solutions gross profit declined by 1% to $351 million, driven primarily by a higher software deferral rate and additional amortization and costs related to Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management. When Horizon ERM became generally available in the second quarter, it triggered incremental amortization expense of $7.5 million per quarter.Technology Solutions operating expenses increased 2% in the quarter to $271 million. New higher expenses are primarily due to increased R&D spending, and a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the prior year.We continue to innovate and invest in R&D to maintain our leadership position. For the quarter, Technology Solutions had total gross R&D spending of $104 million, compared to $99 million in the prior year. Of these amounts, we capitalized just 14% compared to 19% a year ago.Our operating profit in our Technology Solutions segment this quarter was $81 million, down 11% from the $91 million we recorded a year ago. Our operating margin in this segment was 10.51% for the quarter, compared to 12.12% in the prior year.We'll leave our segment performance now and turn briefly to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. Our receivables are $8.3 billion which is up from December 31, 2008 balance of $7.6 billion. Our days sales outstanding remain flat at 23 days after adjusting the prior year, for the $350 million utilization of our AR sales facility.Moving onto inventories. Through continued careful inventory management and as a result of timing, our 30 days sales and inventory again showed a nice improvement three days compared to last year. Our inventories were $8.8 billion on December 31, a 6% decrease over the prior year.For the second quarter in a row, we have shown a modest sequential improvement for DSI from what we posted at the end of the previous quarters. Our payables increased 6% to $13 billion from a year ago, and days sales and payables increased to 44 days from 43 days last year.These working capital improvements have resulted in $1.7 billion in operating cash flow year-to-date. These results include the impact of the $350 million AWP settlement payment that was released from escrow in our December quarter just ended. Based on our continued progress, we feel very comfortable in our ability to generate in a range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion of operating cash for the full year fiscal 2010. This strong cash flow generation has led to a cash balance, $3.4 billion at December 31.As our share repurchase activity has slowed during the year, we now expect our full year average share count to come in a bit above the original guidance we provided of 272 million shares outstanding. Our capital spending continues to trend as expected, at $350 million to $400 million for the year. Now I'll turn to our outlook.As John mentioned earlier, we are raising our guidance on diluted EPS, excluding the favorable second quarter litigation credits from $4.45 to $4.60, to a new range of $4.55 to $4.70. As we've had a number of updates to our guidance range during the year, I think it's worthwhile to review some of the key changes impacting our EPS range from the beginning of the fiscal year to now. As a reminder, we started the year providing an EPS range of $3.90 to $4.5. Since then, a couple of things have happened.First, we had a favorable legal settlement impacting the company's 401(k) plan, which drove approximately $0.15 of upside, spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Second, we had a $0.05 benefit related to the third quarter sale of our 50% stake in the Canadian joint venture McKesson Logistics Solutions.Third, we've seen increased demand from the flu that is incremental to last year's flu performance. We now expect that incremental demand for this flu season will contribute $0.35 to $0.40 to our full year EPS, a little more than 2/3 of which came in our December quarter. Looking to next year on the flu, our goal will be to find business opportunities that allow us to sustain this level of incremental profit. We're unlikely to sustain at all at this year's level.So if you were to adjust for this three items, the favorable 401(k) legal settlement, the McKesson Logistic Solutions sale and the incremental flu, you get to an EPS range that is $0.05 to $0.10 above our original guidance for the year.In closing, we are pleased with our ability to our rise to the challenges we have faced so far this year and we believe our solid execution to date will propel us to a strong finish in fiscal 2010. Thanks and with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. I would ask that you limit your questions to just one per person to allow others an opportunity to participate.

But stepping it up just a level, I would say that our technology business overall has seen that our customers are buying at a rate that is at or above what our expectations were coming into the year. The challenge for us now as we look at the rest of this year and into next year is the implementation time for some of these relationships that have expanded beyond what would have been a perhaps a more let's put this in as we go kind of philosophy to -- we want a contract for a complete solution to get ready for stimulus. So what we might have normally have installed in this quarter and recognized this quarter from a software perspective and realizing the revenues is not so much related to what we sell is -- that really have booked. It's what we recognize as revenue. What we recognize as revenue is both mix related but also a time to implementation and complexity related. So I think our tone in center of this should be positive albeit somewhat extended as it relates to getting actual P&L results from what our customers are asking us to do. And you also assess somewhat unrelated to the software thing. Our comments about margins, are still in line with what we expected but we are investing as we suggest the last quarter more heavily in the back half of this year which will continue through our fourth quarter. And this is all in the spirit of how do we get these implementations done more quickly for our customers and in time for the stimulus. So it's really a combination of more complex contracts and a longer time to implement and then we added a burden of expenses in advance of those implementations on which are offsetting what you don't see which are positive trends from a booking perspective."

So albeit, we try to move our margins up year-over-year. Our Distribution Solutions segment margin rate increases and we expect to experience that again this year as we guided to at the beginning of the year, we still see seasonality in our business.

But I think the most important take away from this discussion should be that we've built a track record and that if we choose to deploy any of our capital and acquisitions and we hope to do so intelligently and in a way that creates more value than share repurchase would create for us. So I think you would find that we will look to the businesses that we're in today and we bring some knowledge, we bring some synergy.

And of course we always have quarterly volatility, so you know we encourage people to think about the margin on a full year basis. But if you look at the operating margin for the December quarter, if you take out the year-over-year change in the flu profits, the operating profit margin is relatively flat. And that's because of a change this year and the timing of some of our compensation from the branded manufacturers. If you look at the full year, though for our FY '10 versus FY '09, our expectation is, if you strip out in both year's flu profits, you would see a basis at least the 10 basis point improvement year-over-year in the operating margin rates for Distribution Solutions. Let me just come to your gross margin comments. So it gets a little bit more judgmental the way we adjust at the gross margin level frankly for the flu, but you'd see a pretty similar pattern. So for the December quarter, your gross margin would be down a little bit but for the full year, your gross margin is going to be up. And once you strip the flu out, the overwhelming driver of that year-over-year gross margin improvement are the improved profits on generics. Because of the loss of the retail independents GPO we experienced last year, the real driver of the increased profits on generics this year comes from a combination of better compliance, better penetration amongst our existing customer base, better sourcing, combined with a pretty good launch schedule this year, although I would point out that this year's launch schedule is not quite as good as last year's."

So 90 days ago, Larry, when we had our last earnings call, it was still very early on in the flu season. And in fact, as you recall, in our September quarter, our profits year-over-year related to the flu were pretty flat. So we were just entering the period of getting a sense of what kind of incremental demand we were going to see for everything from generic, drugs related to the flu, to flow test kits in our Medical-Surgical business, the seasonal flu vaccines and then of course, we, at that point, had not finalized our contracts for the amendment to our existing contract with the CDC. And there was tremendous uncertainty I think it's fair to say 90 days ago about just exactly how the federal government's efforts to deliver H1N1 vaccines across the country would play out. So 90 days later, we've not only finalized that CDC contract, we have a very clear grasp now of likely shipment volumes. We think that we've been through the peak of things like demand for flu test kits and I don't know I suppose we could be surprised in the next 60 days. And so it's a combination of all those things that has taken us from what was a very rough estimate 90 days ago to today when I think is a pretty strong read on the incremental benefit this year from all of those things we do related to the flu versus last year. So that is a long way of answering your question in how we got from sort of up to $0.20 which is what we said 90 days ago all the way up to the range of $0.35 to $0.40 now."

And so we put in several majors to try to counteract that and clearly tight expense controls and optimizing our performance with our existing customers and suppliers to improve our returns on those pieces of business, and basically looking everywhere for opportunities. And clearly, we are well positioned I think to take advantage of the opportunity presented with the flu season. We are in very good businesses that participate in flu but we also had a business that had  a current track record of performance with the CDC and we're able to build out those six distribution centers in a matter of weeks to service this unprecedented requirement. So clearly, I'm pleased with what we did this year to fill the hole. Larry, I would hope that as we come back and we start fiscal '11, we don't have a similar kind of customer hole to dig our way out of as we start the year that will give us sort of the typical momentum that you expect from McKesson year on year. And then secondly, to Jeff's comments and my comments relative to trying to find additional opportunities to help cover the year-on-year lap of the flu event, it's still not clear to us what demands might be on us next year, or what kind of flu season we might have. There's discussion about H1N1 coming back in a more virulent way. And clearly, I think we've demonstrated our ability to help in this emergency need that the country and hope that this six facilities that we've established will not all be turned off and set aside. Clearly, anything we can do to work through that with the CDC or others in terms of utilizing those assets will be nothing but upside given that we have anticipated that they will be put out of commission as the season draws to an end. So there would be an opportunity depending on your view of what might happen in the future from a vaccination perspective and how our vaccine business, overall, might continue to evolve, given our import now to the country relative to things like standard flu and other vaccinations that take place like we started with the children's health vaccine program. So I think the point of our discussion is to highlight the fact that the $0.35 to $0.40 we believe is unusual. And also highlight the fact that we are working hard to find other opportunities that will help us cover some of that year-on-year comparison."

And if our competitors certainly can achieve certification, if that's what you're looking at, we certainly can, because there's no technical reason that we see why that can't happen. As to the investment, we have made investments in our clinical products, quite significant investments over the last six to 12 months and we continue to make investments. But our heaviest investments right now really focused on making sure that we can install this products at a timeframe for our customers and there's a significant ramp in front of us with customers that might have been in the three-year plan to install clinicals that are saying, ""Gee, we'd like to move that to 18 months."" As you might imagine, that puts tremendous strain on our implementation teams and in our customers to get ready for stimulus. So we are actually hiring now pretty aggressively because we have to train these people before they're deployed in the hospital and that expense is falling in this quarter and next quarter, it will fall into next year as well as we start those implementations. And as I mentioned, an answer to an earlier question, part of our revenue and earnings outlook on this business is predicated in our ability to successfully deploy and install these products. Not so much that our contractual obligations have changed with our customers but just from a percentage of completion accounting methodology perspective, if we have a large contract that contained multiple products, our recognition of the entire contract is put off until the final product is installed. So if a customer is going to take 18 months to get  a product or a series of products or contracts installed, it will be the 18th month when we finally put the last product in that we will realize the earnings out of it, even though we might have invested 18 months worth of expense to get that product or that contract, I should say, complete for that customer. So I'm less concerned about our ability to get our products certified than I am about our customers to be ready for meaningful use based on the fact that at least 50% of the work is necessary is going to be done by them and their staffs as opposed to what we try to do from the industry side. There's a lot of work to be done. But this is all good for us and it's all going to deliver increased revenues and increased margins."

I'd say, Lisa, really the biggest uncertainty that's a little tricky to forecast is still the demand around the flu. And so that's probably the biggest thing that would either nudge us towards the higher end of our range",326,"Let me start with the Q4 question. I'd say, Lisa, really the biggest uncertainty that's a little tricky to forecast is still the demand around the flu. And so that's probably the biggest thing that would either nudge us towards the higher end of our range or nudge us towards the lower end of the range. The second comment I would make is there's always a little bit of volatility for the modest portion of our compensation from branded manufacturers that comes through price increases. And while that's modest, it's still enough to be noticed in the quarter. Interestingly enough, the year-to-date for our mix of products through 12/31, price increases are actually down slightly although not by a material amount. Based on what we've seen so far in January, I think we'll be right in line with our guidance for the year of having price increases be pretty similar the last year. There's always a little bit of uncertainty from that. So those are probably the two biggest things I'd say at this point in time that could drive us up or down a little bit as we go through the March quarter. As to your second question, although the real biggest change on the depreciation and amortization side is that this quarter is the first quarter that we begun to amortize the costs or the capitalized costs associated with our Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management product. And so that was almost $8 million in the quarter. You'll see now that $8 million every quarter for the next three years which means that for half of this year and half of next year, you're going to see that as an increase. But the rest of the year-over-year change and depreciation and amortization is really just the normal increase, I guess, it's another $12 million or so the normal increase that comes from spending $350 million to $400 million on various kinds of capital spending each year."

Our branded sell side margin is down because of the repricing with some loss of a couple of customers that we've experienced last year. Our compensation from branded manufacturers is similar to up a tad year-over-year then you've got some operating expense leverage. So those are really the four components.

You are absolutely right that there's a big requirement on the provider side in terms of what they have to do. And frankly, the providers are probably better positioned to speak for that and represent themselves in Washington. However, that said, we clearly are focused on helping our customers be more successful and we have been working to make all of these regulations slightly more lenient. For example, one of the earlier drafts require that every physician for every order use electronic orders. And that's just not feasible, it's not practical. So things like that we've been able to change over time and I think we've been able to affect legislation. So I'm guardedly optimistic that through the comment period, we'll get some additional interpretation or perhaps relaxation on some of this and that will help our hospital customers and physician customers get there successfully."

The question one was how the flu had impacted our guidance change versus 90 days ago, and question two is a question on flu revenue. So assuming that's right, if you think about the $0.10 increase in our guidance, I would really say that's two things: It's the fact that we're $0.15 to $0.20 more optimistic on the flu than we were 90 days ago. And that's partially offset by the fact that we were a little surprised this quarter by some legal costs we incurred, most of which have to do frankly with some things related to the old HBOC acquisition and amazingly enough, some things related to McKesson Chemical,, which I believe the company sold off in 1987 and we're still dealing with some of the environmental cases. So those things along with some tax discrete items that went against this quarter offset a little bit of that flu upside. That explains the guidance change of where we were 90 days ago to today. In terms of the flu's impact on revenues, that's a very good question. Because the impact on the revenue is pretty immaterial to the company. Almost everything we do with regard to the flu is much higher margin from a flu test kit to a generic drug that's flu related to importantly, the CDC contract which is a third-party logistics contract, where we are not taking the value of the product into our inventory. So of course, a third-party logistics contract always has a much higher margin than our normal distribution sort of arrangement."

I'm pleased with the solid execution and continued momentum in our business. For the third quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $28.3 billion, a net income of $326 million or $1.19 per diluted share.Considering the challenges we faced coming into the year, we have performed better than we had anticipated and I'm proud of what we've accomplished so far. Some of our success was one-time in nature such as the benefit from the Securities Litigation settlement proceeds distributed to our 401(k) plan. But our strong performance also stems from operational excellence, diligent cost management and being ideally situated to benefit from opportunities such as the increased demand related to this year's flu season. Let me take a moment to talk about the flu season now since it impacts several different areas of the company.In the third quarter, we experienced a positive impact from higher demand for flu-related products across several of our businesses. Certainly, the single largest contribution has come from our expanded relationship with the standards for Disease Control and Prevention to handle the centralized delivery of the H1N1 flu vaccine and ancillary medical supplies. On our last conference call in October, there was some uncertainty because it was difficult to predict how many doses of the vaccine will ultimately be delivered, and because we had not finalized the necessary modifications to our existing agreement with the CDC to encompass this program. Since then, we finalized the agreement and have managed well in excess of 100 million doses of the vaccine and ancillary supplies, and we have done so in a safe and efficient manner.In addition to delivery of the vaccine, we experienced increased demand for flu-related medications that are distributed through our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Flu test kits and other supplies that are shipped through Medical-Surgical and calls to our nurse hotlines that are part of our Health Solutions business. Typically, flu related demand is relatively stable from year-to-year. This year, we had a significant increase in demand due to the H1N1 virus and it was heavily weighted to the December quarter.Moving on to some specifics for the third quarter. Distribution Solutions performed well with solid contributions from all of our businesses. Revenue growth of 4% was in line with our expectation given the continued impact from the loss of two customer buying groups in U.S. pharmaceutical in late fiscal 2009. These customer losses will impact us for the remainder of our fiscal year.The other dynamic in U.S. pharmaceutical is that our cell site margin is down as a result of events that we experienced the last fiscal year. Consistent with comments we made in the fourth quarter last year, it will take us the full year to lap the impact.Our generics programs continue to lead the market while OneStop sales are still impacted by last year's loss of an independent buying group customer, the team was able to grow generic gross profit in the quarter with continued focus on better compliance within our existing customer base.Included in our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution and services results are the results of our Specialty Care Solutions business. This business is performing well, benefiting from both its long-standing relationship with the CDC and the launch of the Generic last quarter.Turning to our other businesses and Distribution Solutions. Our Medical-Surgical business had a solid contribution to the overall success of Distribution Solutions. Medical-Surgical's revenues grew significantly reflecting increased demand related to flu and aided by acquisitions made in late fiscal 2009. Then [ph] aside the strength from flu, the business has demonstrated solid execution. I'm pleased with our progress in Medical-Surgical, particularly the continued focus on expense control measures and global sourcing of McKesson branded products.Lastly, we had a very strong performance in our Canadian Distribution business with revenues on a constant currency basis of 8%. During the quarter, we sold our 50% equity interest in McKesson Logistic Solutions. We started the third party logistics business organically in 1994 and merged it with company named ALS [Associated Logistics Solutions]in 2004, to form a 50-50 joint venture, which grew to 55 manufacturing customers by the time it was sold. Although successful, it was not core to our Canadian Distribution business, so we took the opportunity to monetize our investments, when we were able to ensure the realization of a nice profit.We remain excited about our business in Canada, many of our programs and solutions that are available to our U.S. pharmaceutical customers are also available in Canada, which clearly differentiates the value of our offering. While we're best known as a leader in pharmaceutical distribution, McKesson Canada does more than order fulfillment and logistics. We've automated 2,500 retail pharmacies and every year, over 100 million doses are dispensed during McKesson's hospital automation solutions. The strength of our distribution customer relationships has provided a great platform for the growth of our technology footprint in Canada.Recently, we signed a contract to the province in Qu√©bec to install our PACS technology in 43 hospitals, and we are connecting a network of 95 sites that will be sharing medical images. In addition, our PACS business and secured contracts for the largest clinical organization in the country, Canadian Medical Laboratories, serving 120 ambulatory radiology clinics across Canada with additional interest in U.S. clinics.I'm extremely pleased with our year-to-date performance in Distribution Solutions. We have achieved strong results despite the challenges we face coming into the year, and we expect our momentum to continue. Turning now to Technology Solutions. In the third quarter, our performance was steady with topline growth driven by services revenues. Over time, we've built a stable business models throughout the Technology Solutions segment. Much of our revenue comes from predictable, recurring strains. We believe the steady nature and complete solutions set of our technology businesses, fit well within the larger McKesson offering.The stimulus package created the incentive for healthcare providers to improve care by implementing clinical Technology Solutions such as the electronic health record. Last month, the federal government released proposed an interim final rules that healthcare providers and vendors will need to meet under the HITECH Act portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. We have worked closely with ONC's [Office of the National Coordinator] federal advisory committees both the HIT Policy Committee and HIT Standards Committee over the past eight months, so there really were no surprises for us in the receipt of the proposed rules.The proposed criteria for meaningful use and certification, both of which are necessary requirements to qualify for stimulus monies are generally comparable to the objectives previously published, as recommended by the committees. And our electronic health record systems for hospitals and physicians are well-positioned to meet these objectives.The official certification process has not been fully delineated, so no technology company has had their products certified. But we are on track to submit our EHR products for initial certification, as soon as we have a clear indication of the process. And we are eager to see the process finalized, so that we can continue to move our customers through the deployment process.We just announced a strategic partnership with HP to accelerate electronic health record adoption at independent physician practices across the country. McKesson and HP will offer physicians McKesson's EHR practice management systems, bundled with HP office hardware and pre-configured for easy installation. The two companies are working together toward the common goal of simplifying physician EHR adoption, so physicians can meet the stimulus deadlines. We expect our technology business will benefit from the clinical wave, that has been created by the stimulus and we can also provide the connectivity features that allow rapid movement of clinical and financial information to the entire network of healthcare.Not only are we helping customers serve their near-term clinical requirements, we will have ongoing opportunities when hospitals turn to us to help them re-architect their financial systems to provide improved cash flow and connectivity and improve relationships with patients.We'll be able to accomplish this with solutions such as Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management, which is the complete reinvention of the financial tools that hospitals use to manage the financial and administrative side of the Enterprise, combined with the technology necessary to connect with payors and patients. We mentioned this last quarter, but it's important to emphasize that the Horizon ERM [Enterprise Revenue Management] was designed with an architecture, similar to our clinical systems. And therefore, the integration and inter-workings of these two solutions are compatible. And the system incorporates other McKesson software and solutions such as Interpol clinical content and RelayHealth connectivity tools.None of our competitors has an offering of services the entire healthcare system the way that McKesson does. Our ability to understand the interaction that take place in this fragmented healthcare system, increase solutions from that knowledge, benefits our customers and provides the opportunity for us. Increasingly, our connectivity solutions through RelayHealth and our solutions for the fair market through our Health Solutions business are becoming larger components of Technology Solutions. In McKesson Health Solutions our footprint is unparalleled, and we uniquely combine expert technology with evidence based clinical information to enable payors to manage their administrative and medical costs. In our RelayHealth business, we facilitate the exchange of information among almost every player in the healthcare system. Including health systems, pharmacies, payors, physicians government agencies and consumers. We are expanding our health information exchange footprint with strategic wins at health systems that are choosing RelayHealth to exchange health information among various constituents. With more than 1 million patients enrolled in our system, McKesson is the only major player that has the patient, actively participating in HIV connectivity, really helped us play in a significant role in helping customers achieve meaningful use, by supporting interoperability and data exchange requirements for hospitals and physician practices using both McKesson and non-McKesson solutions.I am pleased with the work that has been done by the team to help our customers identify the information technology they need to design adoption roadmaps, to help them reach their objectives for meaningful use. Year-to-date, our Technology Solutions results our tracking with what we expected as we entered the year, with steady revenue growth and solid operating margin expansion. Our customers are buying and installing clinical solutions and we are ramping up our business to match the momentum created by the stimulus.Our intention is to invest more heavily in the back half of this fiscal year, because we are committed to successfully implementing our customers' clinical solutions. But we are also building the business for the next decade which is why our offering includes the latest financial solutions for hospitals that I've discussed previously, as well as the connectivity that will be necessary to exchange information throughout the network.Now before I turn it over to Jeff, I want to leave you with a few more general thoughts. This really is a very fortunate time to be in healthcare and I believe McKesson is perfectly positioned. Everything we see in our future is generally supportive of continued growth in our businesses. We are ideally situated in an environment where the use of pharmaceuticals to do nothing but expand given the aging population and the evidence and proof that pharmaceuticals are the lowest cost alternative from a healthcare perspective. Our diversified technology platform is at the center of much of what is going on in healthcare today. The current clinical way, the growing focus on connectivity and the enterprise-wide financial systems that will be required to pull it all together. All of our businesses are producing sound operating results with very positive cash flow. We have demonstrated our ability to deploy cash with the portfolio approach that over time, has created significant value for our shareholders.Over the past seven fiscal years, we have deployed more than $4 billion for 33 acquisitions which have paid off a strategic value for the company and good financial results. Over that same time period, we've deployed more than $4 billion to repurchase 83 million shares and doubled our dividend. You might find us building cash at times, but I would remind you that our capital deployment is balanced when you view it over years, as opposed to quarters. We do not manage decisions around share repurchases, acquisitions and the dividend on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Instead, we are patient and take a longer term view, with the intent of consistently exceeding our shareholders expectations for the use of our cash flow --In summary, I'm confident in the earnings potential of the company and pleased that we are raising our full year guidance and now expect earnings per diluted share of $4.55 to $4.70 for fiscal 2010, excluding the favorable second quarter litigation credit. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff and will return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?"
288195,84205177,47019,"McKesson Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jan-26-2010",2010-01-26,"Earnings Calls","McKesson Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John and good afternoon, everyone.

Before I begin reviewing our financial performance, let me point out t",1617,"Thanks, John and good afternoon, everyone. As you just heard, McKesson is built upon the momentum achieved in the first half of our fiscal year, to deliver solid third quarter results. Before I begin reviewing our financial performance, let me point out that my discussion will exclude for comparison purposes the impact of the prior year's third quarter AWP litigation charge.As usual, I'll begin by discussing our consolidated results, then I'll provide additional color when I discuss each segment in more detail, and I'll close with an update on our full year outlook. Revenues for the quarter were $28.3 billion representing 4% growth. Our gross profit for the quarter increased 8% to $1.5 billion. This leverage of the gross profit line is driven by Distribution Solutions. Total operating expenses for the quarter increased 5% to $946 million, due to higher employee compensation costs, foreign exchange rate movements and higher legal expenses and legal settlement charges.While we continue to see some benefit from the cost containment initiatives we put in place beginning mid-fiscal 2009, we have begun to lap these efforts. Operating income for the quarter grew 16% to $509 million.Moving below operating income. Other income was $25 million compared to $17 million in the prior year. As discussed in our October earnings call, the current year benefited from the sale of our equity interest in McKesson Logistics Solutions which resulted in a pretax gain of $17 million, or approximately $0.05 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of this sale, the decline in other income was primarily due to lower interest income resulting from lower prevailing interest rates. Interest expense for the quarter of $47 million increased due to the $700 million in debt we issued last February. Moving to taxes. Our full year run rate remains at the 32% we have been using all year. Higher third quarter effective tax rate of 33.1% includes a $0.03 impact from unfavorable tax discrete items. This compares to 31.2% in the prior year as the prior year included $0.03 of favorable tax discrete items.Net income was $326 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.19. To wrap up our consolidated results, this year's EPS number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases, which lowered our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 1% year-over-year to 274 million shares.Let's now move on to Distribution Solutions results. In this segment, we are pleased with overall, revenue growth of 4% compared to the same quarter last year. Total U.S. pharmaceutical distribution and services revenue increased 2%, primarily reflecting market growth, partially offset by the fiscal 2009 customer losses that we've previously discussed.As you've seen for several quarters now, we continue to show a shift from warehouse purchases to direct store delivery by our large customer. This was substantially completed this quarter.Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis grew 8% for the quarter primarily due to market growth. Including a favorable currency impact of 15%, Canadian revenues grew 23% for the quarter.Medical-Surgical distribution revenues were up 11% for the quarter to $758 million. Gross profit for this segment grew 12% to $1.1 billion, up from $1 billion a year ago. The increased demand related to the flu season which I'll come back to in a few minutes and to a lesser extent, increased margins from the sale of generic drugs, helped to drive an improved mix of higher margin products across our distribution businesses. These events drove a significantly expanded gross profit margin rate. Partially offsetting these benefits, our sell margin was negatively impacted by customer renewals and the loss of customers that occurred late in our fiscal 2009, as well as lower compensation from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers due to timing.Our Distribution Solutions operating expenses increased to 2% for the quarter to $568 million, which is below the 4% increase in revenues highlighting our continued ability to achieve expense leverage in this business.Operating profits for the quarter was $558 million, compared to $439 million in the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, the current year benefited from the sale of our equity interest in McKesson Logistics Solutions. In summary, and before I move on to Technology Solutions, we're very pleased with all the efforts of our Distribution Solutions team, to mitigate the challenges we face at the beginning of this fiscal year.In Technology Solutions, total revenues grew 3% for the quarter to $771 million. This brings year-to-date growth for Technology Solutions to 2%, which is roughly in line with our full year assumption to remain at levels similar to fiscal 2009.Services revenues increased 6% in the quarter to $610 million, reflecting the more stable nature of these service revenues. Software and software systems revenues of $138 million declined 2% from the prior year, hardware revenues of $23 million in the quarter were down 32% from the prior year, reflecting lower rates at which hardware is attached, is part of system implementations and overall, reduced hardware component cost.Technology Solutions gross profit declined by 1% to $351 million, driven primarily by a higher software deferral rate and additional amortization and costs related to Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management. When Horizon ERM became generally available in the second quarter, it triggered incremental amortization expense of $7.5 million per quarter.Technology Solutions operating expenses increased 2% in the quarter to $271 million. New higher expenses are primarily due to increased R&D spending, and a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the prior year.We continue to innovate and invest in R&D to maintain our leadership position. For the quarter, Technology Solutions had total gross R&D spending of $104 million, compared to $99 million in the prior year. Of these amounts, we capitalized just 14% compared to 19% a year ago.Our operating profit in our Technology Solutions segment this quarter was $81 million, down 11% from the $91 million we recorded a year ago. Our operating margin in this segment was 10.51% for the quarter, compared to 12.12% in the prior year.We'll leave our segment performance now and turn briefly to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. Our receivables are $8.3 billion which is up from December 31, 2008 balance of $7.6 billion. Our days sales outstanding remain flat at 23 days after adjusting the prior year, for the $350 million utilization of our AR sales facility.Moving onto inventories. Through continued careful inventory management and as a result of timing, our 30 days sales and inventory again showed a nice improvement three days compared to last year. Our inventories were $8.8 billion on December 31, a 6% decrease over the prior year.For the second quarter in a row, we have shown a modest sequential improvement for DSI from what we posted at the end of the previous quarters. Our payables increased 6% to $13 billion from a year ago, and days sales and payables increased to 44 days from 43 days last year.These working capital improvements have resulted in $1.7 billion in operating cash flow year-to-date. These results include the impact of the $350 million AWP settlement payment that was released from escrow in our December quarter just ended. Based on our continued progress, we feel very comfortable in our ability to generate in a range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion of operating cash for the full year fiscal 2010. This strong cash flow generation has led to a cash balance, $3.4 billion at December 31.As our share repurchase activity has slowed during the year, we now expect our full year average share count to come in a bit above the original guidance we provided of 272 million shares outstanding. Our capital spending continues to trend as expected, at $350 million to $400 million for the year. Now I'll turn to our outlook.As John mentioned earlier, we are raising our guidance on diluted EPS, excluding the favorable second quarter litigation credits from $4.45 to $4.60, to a new range of $4.55 to $4.70. As we've had a number of updates to our guidance range during the year, I think it's worthwhile to review some of the key changes impacting our EPS range from the beginning of the fiscal year to now. As a reminder, we started the year providing an EPS range of $3.90 to $4.5. Since then, a couple of things have happened.First, we had a favorable legal settlement impacting the company's 401(k) plan, which drove approximately $0.15 of upside, spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Second, we had a $0.05 benefit related to the third quarter sale of our 50% stake in the Canadian joint venture McKesson Logistics Solutions.Third, we've seen increased demand from the flu that is incremental to last year's flu performance. We now expect that incremental demand for this flu season will contribute $0.35 to $0.40 to our full year EPS, a little more than 2/3 of which came in our December quarter. Looking to next year on the flu, our goal will be to find business opportunities that allow us to sustain this level of incremental profit. We're unlikely to sustain at all at this year's level.So if you were to adjust for this three items, the favorable 401(k) legal settlement, the McKesson Logistic Solutions sale and the incremental flu, you get to an EPS range that is $0.05 to $0.10 above our original guidance for the year.In closing, we are pleased with our ability to our rise to the challenges we have faced so far this year and we believe our solid execution to date will propel us to a strong finish in fiscal 2010. Thanks and with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. I would ask that you limit your questions to just one per person to allow others an opportunity to participate.

But stepping it up just a level, I would say that our technology business overall has seen that our customers are buying at a rate that is at or above what our expectations were coming into the year. The challenge for us now as we look at the rest of this year and into next year is the implementation time for some of these relationships that have expanded beyond what would have been a perhaps a more let's put this in as we go kind of philosophy to -- we want a contract for a complete solution to get ready for stimulus. So what we might have normally have installed in this quarter and recognized this quarter from a software perspective and realizing the revenues is not so much related to what we sell is -- that really have booked. It's what we recognize as revenue. What we recognize as revenue is both mix related but also a time to implementation and complexity related. So I think our tone in center of this should be positive albeit somewhat extended as it relates to getting actual P&L results from what our customers are asking us to do. And you also assess somewhat unrelated to the software thing. Our comments about margins, are still in line with what we expected but we are investing as we suggest the last quarter more heavily in the back half of this year which will continue through our fourth quarter. And this is all in the spirit of how do we get these implementations done more quickly for our customers and in time for the stimulus. So it's really a combination of more complex contracts and a longer time to implement and then we added a burden of expenses in advance of those implementations on which are offsetting what you don't see which are positive trends from a booking perspective."

I think the significant partnership of Rite Aid and -- it relies on great integration of both sides of the relationship to deliver great value for both of us.

So albeit, we try to move our margins up year-over-year. Our Distribution Solutions segment margin rate increases and we expect to experience that again this year as we guided to at the beginning of the year, we still see seasonality in our business. And that is a completely different discussion than customer contract renewals. And I don't really think there's seasonality necessarily in that context customer renewals.

And of course we always have quarterly volatility, so you know we encourage people to think about the margin on a full year basis. But if you look at the operating margin for the December quarter, if you take out the year-over-year change in the flu profits, the operating profit margin is relatively flat. And that's because of a change this year and the timing of some of our compensation from the branded manufacturers. If you look at the full year, though for our FY '10 versus FY '09, our expectation is, if you strip out in both year's flu profits, you would see a basis at least the 10 basis point improvement year-over-year in the operating margin rates for Distribution Solutions. Let me just come to your gross margin comments. So it gets a little bit more judgmental the way we adjust at the gross margin level frankly for the flu, but you'd see a pretty similar pattern. So for the December quarter, your gross margin would be down a little bit but for the full year, your gross margin is going to be up. And once you strip the flu out, the overwhelming driver of that year-over-year gross margin improvement are the improved profits on generics. Because of the loss of the retail independents GPO we experienced last year, the real driver of the increased profits on generics this year comes from a combination of better compliance, better penetration amongst our existing customer base, better sourcing, combined with a pretty good launch schedule this year, although I would point out that this year's launch schedule is not quite as good as last year's."

So 90 days ago, Larry, when we had our last earnings call, it was still very early on in the flu season. And in fact, as you recall, in our September quarter, our profits year-over-year related to the flu were pretty flat. So we were just entering the period of getting a sense of what kind of incremental demand we were going to see for everything from generic, drugs related to the flu, to flow test kits in our Medical-Surgical business, the seasonal flu vaccines and then of course, we, at that point, had not finalized our contracts for the amendment to our existing contract with the CDC. And there was tremendous uncertainty I think it's fair to say 90 days ago about just exactly how the federal government's efforts to deliver H1N1 vaccines across the country would play out. So 90 days later, we've not only finalized that CDC contract, we have a very clear grasp now of likely shipment volumes. We think that we've been through the peak of things like demand for flu test kits and I don't know I suppose we could be surprised in the next 60 days. And so it's a combination of all those things that has taken us from what was a very rough estimate 90 days ago to today when I think is a pretty strong read on the incremental benefit this year from all of those things we do related to the flu versus last year. So that is a long way of answering your question in how we got from sort of up to $0.20 which is what we said 90 days ago all the way up to the range of $0.35 to $0.40 now."

And so we put in several majors to try to counteract that and clearly tight expense controls and optimizing our performance with our existing customers and suppliers to improve our returns on those pieces of business, and basically looking everywhere for opportunities. And clearly, we are well positioned I think to take advantage of the opportunity presented with the flu season. We are in very good businesses that participate in flu but we also had a business that had  a current track record of performance with the CDC and we're able to build out those six distribution centers in a matter of weeks to service this unprecedented requirement. So clearly, I'm pleased with what we did this year to fill the hole. Larry, I would hope that as we come back and we start fiscal '11, we don't have a similar kind of customer hole to dig our way out of as we start the year that will give us sort of the typical momentum that you expect from McKesson year on year. And then secondly, to Jeff's comments and my comments relative to trying to find additional opportunities to help cover the year-on-year lap of the flu event, it's still not clear to us what demands might be on us next year, or what kind of flu season we might have. There's discussion about H1N1 coming back in a more virulent way. And clearly, I think we've demonstrated our ability to help in this emergency need that the country and hope that this six facilities that we've established will not all be turned off and set aside. Clearly, anything we can do to work through that with the CDC or others in terms of utilizing those assets will be nothing but upside given that we have anticipated that they will be put out of commission as the season draws to an end. So there would be an opportunity depending on your view of what might happen in the future from a vaccination perspective and how our vaccine business, overall, might continue to evolve, given our import now to the country relative to things like standard flu and other vaccinations that take place like we started with the children's health vaccine program. So I think the point of our discussion is to highlight the fact that the $0.35 to $0.40 we believe is unusual. And also highlight the fact that we are working hard to find other opportunities that will help us cover some of that year-on-year comparison."

I can't speak for the federal government or a medical community in terms of what desires they might have for this kind of a program. What I can say, though is that vaccines are used in many ways in this country and there might be other ways we can assist the distribution of specialty products like vaccines that are highly regulated and need to be refrigerated, et cetera, through this distribution capability. But if you can set all of that aside, you should assume that our teams are working as they think about next year, not only in how do we grow off of the $3.90 to $4.05 plus $0.05 to $0.10 that you guys are talking about, but also think about what is that number really going to be as we focus to next year. So as we finish the fourth quarter, we'll be prepared to give you guys better insight.

What I can say is that the reason I spent time on this in this call was that our team has not only been involved in helping to set the requirements but we're not surprised by them and I believe they believe that we have what it takes to get these products certified and through the process on behalf of our customers. Said in a more frank way, I don't know how we'd have a clinical business if they weren't certified. And so I think it's almost impossible to believe that we would not achieve certification. And if our competitors certainly can achieve certification, if that's what you're looking at, we certainly can, because there's no technical reason that we see why that can't happen. As to the investment, we have made investments in our clinical products, quite significant investments over the last six to 12 months and we continue to make investments. But our heaviest investments right now really focused on making sure that we can install this products at a timeframe for our customers and there's a significant ramp in front of us with customers that might have been in the three-year plan to install clinicals that are saying, ""Gee, we'd like to move that to 18 months."" As you might imagine, that puts tremendous strain on our implementation teams and in our customers to get ready for stimulus. So we are actually hiring now pretty aggressively because we have to train these people before they're deployed in the hospital and that expense is falling in this quarter and next quarter, it will fall into next year as well as we start those implementations. And as I mentioned, an answer to an earlier question, part of our revenue and earnings outlook on this business is predicated in our ability to successfully deploy and install these products. Not so much that our contractual obligations have changed with our customers but just from a percentage of completion accounting methodology perspective, if we have a large contract that contained multiple products, our recognition of the entire contract is put off until the final product is installed. So if a customer is going to take 18 months to get  a product or a series of products or contracts installed, it will be the 18th month when we finally put the last product in that we will realize the earnings out of it, even though we might have invested 18 months worth of expense to get that product or that contract, I should say, complete for that customer. So I'm less concerned about our ability to get our products certified than I am about our customers to be ready for meaningful use based on the fact that at least 50% of the work is necessary is going to be done by them and their staffs as opposed to what we try to do from the industry side. There's a lot of work to be done. But this is all good for us and it's all going to deliver increased revenues and increased margins."

I'd say, Lisa, really the biggest uncertainty that's a little tricky to forecast is still the demand around the flu. And so that's probably the biggest thing that would either nudge us towards the higher end of our range or nudge us towards the lower end of the range. The second comment I would make is there's always a little bit of volatility for the modest portion of our compensation from branded manufacturers that comes through price increases. And while that's modest, it's still enough to be noticed in the quarter. Interestingly enough, the year-to-date for our mix of products through 12/31, price increases are actually down slightly although not by a material amount. Based on what we've seen so far in January, I think we'll be right in line with our guidance for the year of having price increases be pretty similar the last year. There's always a little bit of uncertainty from that. So those are probably the two biggest things I'd say at this point in time that could drive us up or down a little bit as we go through the March quarter. As to your second question, although the real biggest change on the depreciation and amortization side is that this quarter is the first quarter that we begun to amortize the costs or the capitalized costs associated with our Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management product. And so that was almost $8 million in the quarter. You'll see now that $8 million every quarter for the next three years which means that for half of this year and half of next year, you're going to see that as an increase. But the rest of the year-over-year change and depreciation and amortization is really just the normal increase, I guess, it's another $12 million or so the normal increase that comes from spending $350 million to $400 million on various kinds of capital spending each year."

Our branded sell side margin is down because of the repricing with some loss of a couple of customers that we've experienced last year. Our compensation from branded manufacturers is similar to up a tad year-over-year then you've got some operating expense leverage. So those are really the four components.

You are absolutely right that there's a big requirement on the provider side in terms of what they have to do. And frankly, the providers are probably better positioned to speak for that and represent themselves in Washington. However, that said, we clearly are focused on helping our customers be more successful and we have been working to make all of these regulations slightly more lenient. For example, one of the earlier drafts require that every physician for every order use electronic orders. And that's just not feasible, it's not practical. So things like that we've been able to change over time and I think we've been able to affect legislation.

The question one was how the flu had impacted our guidance change versus 90 days ago, and question two is a question on flu revenue. So assuming that's right, if you think about the $0.10 increase in our guidance, I would really say that's two things: It's the fact that we're $0.15 to $0.20 more optimistic on the flu than we were 90 days ago. And that's partially offset by the fact that we were a little surprised this quarter by some legal costs we incurred, most of which have to do frankly with some things related to the old HBOC acquisition and amazingly enough, some things related to McKesson Chemical,, which I believe the company sold off in 1987 and we're still dealing with some of the environmental cases. So those things along with some tax discrete items that went against this quarter offset a little bit of that flu upside. That explains the guidance change of where we were 90 days ago to today. In terms of the flu's impact on revenues, that's a very good question. Because the impact on the revenue is pretty immaterial to the company. Almost everything we do with regard to the flu is much higher margin from a flu test kit to a generic drug that's flu related to importantly, the CDC contract which is a third-party logistics contract, where we are not taking the value of the product into our inventory. So of course, a third-party logistics contract always has a much higher margin than our normal distribution sort of arrangement."

I'm pleased that in our fourth quarter, we had one of the highest levels of bookings ever. And we also had the highest full year operating margin in recent history. Last year's performance provides a good foundation for fiscal 2011 success.
Moving on to some of the specifics for the quarter and the year. Distribution Solutions performed very well with solid contributions from all of our businesses. In U.S. Pharmaceutical, the team delivered terrific results despite the challenges we faced early in the year for some lost business and some margin pressure.
Our commitment to our pharmaceutical distribution customers has never been stronger. This is reflected by the success we have demonstrated in each of our customers segments. For example, in our Retail National Accounts segment, we retained all of our accounts that were up for renewal in fiscal 2010. In the Independent segment, we were able to achieve profit growth with compliance programs that drove adoption of our value-added products, including our Health Mart franchise, which we increased by 500 stores this year.
In our Hospital business, we saw continued success from new initiatives, such as our recently launched Plasma and BioLogics business. And we benefited from further penetrating our base of customers with our proprietary generics program. Across all of our customer segments, we focused on better generics compliance within our existing base and realized significant growth in generics gross profit. We also had a strong contribution from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers.
Included in our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services results are the results of Specialty Care Solutions. This business had a tremendous year, successfully delivering on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention H1N1 flu vaccine program and benefiting from the launch of a generic, earlier in the year.
Since October, we've shipped more than 126 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine and the related medical supply kits to thousands of providers across the country. Thanks to the team's leadership and hard work, we've earned high praise from our clients at the CDC. We are working with the CDC on a modest program to continue delivering the H1N1 flu vaccine through July 31. And we have significantly wind down our operations to match these reduced volumes.
The H1N1 flu vaccine distribution initiative was not only the largest public health initiative in CDC history, it was also a significant event for McKesson. Never before have so many McKesson employees from across the company come together for a customer. I'm very proud of our team which work closely with the CDC to execute on this opportunity in one McKesson way.
Turning to our other businesses in the Distribution Solutions segment. Our Medical Surgical business had a solid contribution to the overall success of Distribution Solutions. Medical Surgical's revenues grew significantly reflecting increased demand related to the flu and aided by acquisitions made in fiscal 2009. This business too was able to respond quickly to an anticipated demand related to the flu vaccine season. And the team organized immediately to respond to the unique market opportunity.
That and aside the contribution from flu, our Medical Surgical business has demonstrated tremendous execution not just this year, but over the past three years as we focused on the alternate site markets. I'm pleased with our progress in this business, particularly the continued focus on expense control measures and global sourcing that McKesson branded products, which have led to improved operating results.
Finally, our Canadian Distribution business had strong revenue growth and gains in market share. McKesson Canada continues to get operating leverage through investment in our distribution center network and increased participation in the corporation's global sourcing programs. I'm extremely pleased with our full year performance in Distribution Solutions. We've achieved strong results despite the challenges we faced coming into the year and we expect our momentum to continue.  Next fiscal year at Distribution Solutions, we expect that our revenues will grow at market adjusted for our mix of business.
Generics should continue to be a significant driver of margin expansion. We are headed into the year with a robust launch calendar. And we are well-positioned with our proprietary generics program, OneStop, which cuts across all of our customer segments in U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Care Solutions.
On the branded drug side, we deliver a broad range of value-added services to the manufacturers, resulting in steady compensation. In fiscal 2011, we expect branded price inflation will be at similar levels to fiscal 2010. Overall, we have tremendous confidence in the continued success of Distribution Solutions and we remain steadfastly focused on delivering superior value to our customers.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. We started our fiscal year during an economic downturn that lengthened as customer's buying cycles and implementation times stretched out. More recently, our customers access to capital has improved and they have better visibility into the stimulus requirements. These dynamics helped us with a strong finish to fiscal 2010, with software revenues up 5% in the fourth quarter. Our full year operating profit margin expanded to the highest level in recent history and it now approaches our goal of low to the mid-teens.
While our Technology businesses is best known for market share leading products and solutions to support hospital and physician office customers, we do have a more diverse and robust offering. So let me take a moment to remind you of the major businesses that comprise Technology Solutions because each of them contributed significantly to our progress this year.
Our largest technology business deliver solutions for hospitals. These providers have been focused on the stimulus this year and we have the market leading clinical systems and analytics they need to qualify for stimulus money. We also have solutions for hospitals that improve their performance by automating financial and administrative operations. And we recently introduced our next-generation revenue cycle system, Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management, where we are a leader in medical imaging solutions, as well as providing innovative capabilities in hospital pharmacy automation.
Earlier in the year, we told you that stimulus has generated an increase customer interest in our solutions, but the interest had not yet been reflected in increase buying. As the year progressed, stimulus-related purchases accelerated and we a saw strong growth in new business in the fourth quarter, achieving the solid finish to the year.
We are adding more Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management customers as our legacy hospitals are realizing that this solution will enable them to streamline their systems and improve their financial performance. In the physician market, we have a large footprint with more than 100,000 physicians using our solutions to improve both their office and clinical efficiency. We have a very complete offering for payors through our Health Solutions business, where our expert technology and evidence-based clinical information enables payors to manage their administrative and medical costs. And we are a leader, a longtime leader with an unmatched footprint. Our solutions today are used by the top 20 health plans in the United States, which cover 73% of the commercial lines.
Health Solutions had its best performance ever, driven by a rapid adoption in several new products that we introduced into the marketplace earlier in the year, namely, Total Payment Solutions, Clear Coverage and Molecular Diagnostics. These products drove strong bookings within our installed base of customers.
Through our Health Solutions business, we also run programs that focus on improving the health and wellness of Medicaid beneficiaries. For example, our program with the State of Illinoi has achieved net savings by the state of more than $300 million over a three-year period. By helping patients better manage chronic and acute illnesses, we assure that there are fewer unnecessary emergency room visits and hospital admissions.
Finally, our  RelayHealth Connectivity business differentiates our offering because we automate the operations in each care setting and support the flow of financial and clinical transactions between health systems, labs, physicians, pharmacies, payors, consumers and others.
A significant portion of the meaningful use guidelines under the HITECH portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, relate to the ability to exchange patient health information and approximately $564 million in stimulus funding is earmarked for health care information exchanges.
This year, Relay closed its biggest clinical connectivity contract ever with Henry Ford Health System. The agreement is a good example of one McKesson, because it also included our Electronic Health Record Solutions for physician offices called Practice Partner.
Q4 marked one of our highest levels of bookings in recent history for our Technology Solutions segment. Across the business, we have sharpened our focus on execution, innovation and collaboration to drive customer success. 
In the back half of fiscal 2010, we invested more heavily to ensure that we have the resources necessary to successfully move our customers through the deployment process to qualify for stimulus money. We expect to make continued investment in the first half of fiscal 2011. But we are confident that we will see solid margin expansion in this segment for the full year.
In summary, fiscal 2010 was a remarkable year defined by political and economic change. We pushed through the challenges and exercised financial discipline and successfully executed on opportunities to increase our business. Throughout the year, McKesson has been engaged in every step of the healthcare debate. We are very committed to our presence in Washington, where we attempt to share our expertise with the policy community. 
The passage of the healthcare reform bill marks the most sweeping proposal for change through our industry in decades. It marks an important step toward expanding access to health insurance, yet the real work of transforming the nation's health care system is just beginning.
To ensure ongoing access to affordable, high-quality health care, we must continue to address the underlying factors that keep our system from reaching the optimum levels of quality and cost effectiveness. As the largest healthcare services and technology company, McKesson is committed to working with all the participants in health care to develop innovations that address these issues, leading to our health care system that are simultaneously high-performing, accessible and economically sustainable. 
Over time, our Distribution business should benefit from expanding health insurance coverage. Our Technology businesses should benefit from increased reporting requirements for case management and care coordination, along with initiatives to prevent hospital re-admissions and the complexity of ever-changing insurance reimbursement. And our Connectivity business should benefit from the adoption of standards from financial and administrative transactions to promote administrative simplification. We expect healthcare reform will help sustain our momentum.
Now to wrap up. Our fiscal 2010 results provide us with a good foundation for continuous success in fiscal 2011. Both Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions are producing sound, operating results and very positive cash flow. Over time, we've used our portfolio approach for acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and internal investment, creating significant value for our shareholders. Our increased share repurchase authorization announced today maximizes our flexibility to begin deploying our significant cash balances and we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that will advance our mission to improve the quality and safety of the health care system.
Based on the operating trends in our business, we expect earnings per diluted share of $4.72 to $4.92 for fiscal 2011. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?"

As you've just heard, this is another solid operational quarter capping off a great year. In my remarks today, I'll cover both the fourth quarter and the full year results. As you've heard me say before, w",2487,"Well, thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've just heard, this is another solid operational quarter capping off a great year. In my remarks today, I'll cover both the fourth quarter and the full year results. As you've heard me say before, we provide our EPS guidance on an annual basis due to both seasonality and the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations that are inherent to our business. 
In this context, an annual look at our financial results can provide more meaningful insight into some of the key trends. So I'll focus more on the annual numbers than the quarterly once today. And I'll also comment on what these trends might mean for fiscal 2011.
My comments today will exclude the current year impact of the litigation reserve release and the prior year's AWP litigation charge. As usual, I'll begin with a review of our consolidated results followed by a more detailed discussion of each segment.
Consolidated revenues for both the full year and quarter were up 2%. And we ended the full year with revenues of $108.7 billion. Both segments contributed to this revenue growth, each demonstrating resilience, given the tough economic environment.
Gross profit was up 6% to $5.7 billion for the year and up 8% to $1.6 billion for the quarter, giving us nice leverage on the 2% revenue growth. For the year, both segments contributed to this increase in our gross profit margin.
Moving now to operating expenses. As we entered fiscal 2010, we enacted strong cost containment measures across the company in response to the tough economic environment, which resulted in lower year-over-year operating expense in the first two quarters of fiscal 2010. 
As we begin to outperform our original expectations, we chose to make certain investments in both segments to support the business and build a better foundation for the future. This resulted in modest operating expense increases in the latter half of fiscal 2010. In line with this trend, our full year operating expense was flat year-over-year at $3.7 billion, while our fourth quarter operating expense was up 4%.
Also as a reminder, in fiscal 2010, our operating expense benefited from a legal settlement impacting the company's 401(k) plan, which resulted in us having little expense related to our 401(k) plan in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011, we expect our expense associated with the voluntary contributions to our company's 401(k) plan to return to approximately $58 million. Overall, considering all these impacts, our fiscal 2011 outlook reflects a modest increase in operating expense going forward.
Next, our operating income was up 18% to $2 billion for the full year and up 15% to $573 million for the quarter. This performance is really driven by both the growth in the gross margin, I described earlier, combined with the leverage we achieved at the operating expense line. 
Increasingly, we have moved our focus to measuring our operating expense leverage relative to our gross profit. For our Distribution segment, in particular, as generic conversions have grown over the years, this metric has become more relevant than viewing our operating expense leverage relative to revenue. So looking at our operating expense on the more relevant metric as a percentage of gross profit, operating expense for the company was just 65% for fiscal 2010 compared to 69% in the prior year.
Moving down the P&L for the full year. Other income was impacted by several factors. In both the current and prior year, we had a gain on sale of the business. And then last year's fourth quarter, we had $63 million of impairment charges. Excluding these one-time items, other income was down significantly compared to the prior year, driven by lower short-term interest rates. Interest expense increased for the full year and quarter due to the debt we issued in February of fiscal 2009.
Moving to taxes. We ended the year with an effective tax rate of 32.2%, which is slightly higher than our original fiscal 2010 guidance of 32%. Let me remind you that our fiscal 2009 tax provision was favorably impacted by $111 million of net income tax benefits for discrete items.
Looking at just the fourth quarter tax rate, however, we did have a number of catch-up adjustments that drove our quarterly tax rate up to 35%. This was about $0.05 to $0.06 above of what we had expected when we last gave you guidance in January, $0.01 of this reflects our expense associated with the recently enacted health care reform law related to the elimination of a tax benefit for retiree prescription drug coverage.
The weighted average diluted shares outstanding declined in both the full year and the quarter. The cumulative impact of shares repurchase lowered our full year diluted weighted shares average outstanding by 2% year-over-year to 273 million shares. You do see, however, that our fourth quarter number of $275 million was above the full year, as we did not repurchase any shares later in fiscal 2010. Our guidance for fiscal 2011 builds in an assumption that our share repurchase activity resumes, which is reflected in our weighted average diluted shares assumption for 2011 of 267 million.
To wrap up our consolidated results, our full year diluted EPS from continuing operations was $4.58 versus $4.07 in the prior year, an increase of 13%. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.26 for the quarter compared to $1.01 in the prior year, which was unfavorably impacted by $0.22 of impairment charges.
So all in all, we're pleased with the growth that we achieved in fiscal 2010 given the headwinds we faced at the beginning of the year. So let's move on now to the segments.
In Distribution Solutions, overall revenues were up 2% for the full year and quarter. Looking at the components of this revenue, our total U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues grew 1% for the full year and were flat for the quarter. The full year was impacted by the losses in late fiscal 2009 of several customers that we have previously discussed. 
The fourth quarter was also impacted by lower purchases from two of our large retail national chain customers. Given the size of these customers and the volumes associated with them, their purchasing patterns and business wins and losses can obviously have an effect on our revenue growth.
Turning to the split between direct and warehouse sales. Over the past year, we have repeatedly commented on a shift from warehouse purchases to direct store delivery by a large customer. This mix shift is the primary driver of the increase in Direct Distribution revenues and similar decline in warehouse revenues for the full year. 
Canadian revenues on a constant currency basis were 7% for the full year and 3% for the quarter, primarily driven by market growth. Medical-Surgical Distribution revenues were up 8% for the full year and 5% for the quarter, primarily driven by the positive impact of the flu, as well as several small acquisitions we made. 
Gross profit in this segment increased 7% for the full year and 11% for the quarter, resulting in a nice improvement in our gross profit margin. Several factors contributed to the increase in gross profit, and these drivers have consistently impacted our results throughout the fiscal year. Our Distribution Solutions operating expenses declined 1% for the year but increased 3% for the quarter, in line with the overall trends I discussed earlier. For the full year, operating profit grew 20% to $2 billion. 
As we've discussed the last several quarters, increased demand from the flu season was a significant driver of this increase. We told you 90 days ago on our last call that we expected the total incremental flu impact across all of our Distribution Solutions businesses to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.40 for fiscal 2010. We, in fact, ended the year right in the middle of this range. 
Excluding this incremental impact of flu and the favorable settlement related to our company's 401(k) plan that I discussed earlier, our full year operating margin in Distribution Solutions was 172 basis points. This is a 13 basis point improvement from the prior year and represents a real demonstration of the strength of the longer-term trends in these businesses.
In summary and before I move on to Technology Solutions, we're very pleased with the strong performance delivered by our Distribution Solution businesses this year, as they effectively mitigated the challenges we faced at the beginning of the fiscal year.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. Overall revenues were up 2% for the full year to $3.1 billion and also up 2% for the fourth quarter to $820 million. Services revenues grew 4% to $2.4 billion for the year, and 2% to $627 million for the quarter, reflecting the more stable nature of these revenues. 
Software and Software Systems revenues were flat for the year, but up 5% for the quarter. As John mentioned, we had historically high bookings in the March quarter but we also had a higher software deferral rate, due to the more complex nature of the products that were sold. To be specific, our software revenue deferral rate was up nine points to 80% for the full year, and up 11 points to 83% for the quarter. These strong bookings and high deferral rates provide a clear focus for us in the coming year to efficiently implement our customer solutions and convert these deferred revenues in the bottom line results.
Technology Solutions gross profit increased 2% to $1.5 billion for the full year, roughly in line with our revenue growth. Gross profit for the quarter is flat compared to the prior year.  Technology Solutions operating expenses declined 2% for the year and increased 7% to $299 million for the quarter. 
In this segment, you most dramatically saw the impact of our cost containment efforts in the first half of the year. In the second half, we stepped up our investments to ensure we have the right resources to successfully implement our customers' clinical solutions.
Technology Solutions had total gross R&D spending for the year of $414 million compared to $410 million in the prior year. Of these amounts, we capitalized 16% compared to 17% a year ago. So even in a tough year when we were cutting costs early on, we still felt it was important to invest in the business and sustain our levels of R&D spending.
For the year, Technology Solutions' operating profit increased 15% to $385 million, and our operating margin rate was 12.32% compared to 10.9% in the prior year. This is the fourth consecutive year we're making progress towards our long-term operating margin goal of being in the low- to mid-teens and we are pleased with this progress.
Moving now to the balance sheet and working capital metrics. Our receivables were $8.1 billion, which is up from the March 31, 2009 balance of $7.8 billion. Our days sales outstanding increased by one day versus the prior year to 25 days. Our inventories were $9.4 billion on March 31, an increase of 11% over the prior year. And similarly, our payables increased 13% to $13.3 billion from a year ago.  
Both of these increases stem partly from the timing of some year end purchases, and you see this in our days sales and inventory of 34, which was up three days in the prior year on our days sales and payables of 48, which was up from 43 days last year. But beyond the year end timing impacts, we also did a great job this year of focusing the entire management team on cash generation in light of the difficult economic environment we confronted as we enter the year. This focus drove our cash flow from operations up to $2.3 billion, well above our original guidance. This is a great result.
Going forward, we have assumed that many of the gains we made in fiscal 2010 were one-time in nature. So you see that we expect our cash flow from operations to be back to a more typical amount of approximately $1.5 billion for fiscal 2011. This strong cash generation allowed us to end the year with a cash balance of $3.7 billion. The strength of our balance sheet and our consistent track record of cash flow generation led two rating agencies in the past year to raise our long-term debt rating to A- levels. All of this positions us well for the continued use of our portfolio referred to capital deployment.
Our total capital spending was $378 million for the year, in line with our original guidance of $350 million to $400 million. As we look forward to fiscal 2011, our annual guidance range for capital expenditures is slightly higher than $400 million to $450 million, driven by increased investment in our Distribution network.
Let me now close by providing some additional context around our fiscal 2011 earnings guidance of $4.72 to $4.92 per diluted share. In our press release today, you will find a list of the key assumptions underlying this guidance, so I won't go over these again here. I do want to take a minute, however, to provide some additional context for these assumptions.
I mentioned earlier that our normalized fiscal 2010 operating margin in Distribution Solutions was 172 basis points. We expect improvement to this normalized operating margin in the high-single-digit basis points. I would point out that our guidance for fiscal 2011 assumes that our flu-related profits will return to the levels we typically experienced in the normal year.
In Technology Solutions, we would expect our operating margin rate to show some modest improvement. This improvement, however, will be heavily weighted towards the back half of the fiscal year.
In terms of quarters, we do not provide quarterly EPS guidance, due to the variability and the timing of certain items in our businesses. However, at this moment, we can directionally estimate that the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 will be our strongest. 
In addition, I would also remind you that in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, as I said at the time, many things went right. Our cost control measures had better-than-expected results, compensation from branded manufacturers was trending well and we had excellent growth in generics despite the customer losses we had experienced entering fiscal 2010. This year, in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we do expect a sizable antitrust settlement that will generate a positive gain of approximately $51 million. Even with this antitrust settlement, however, we would expect to be flat to down modestly year-over-year for the first quarter.
In summary, our fourth quarter results were a solid end to what we believe was a great year in fiscal 2010, considering the challenges we faced entering the year. These 2010 results have built a solid foundation for us as we head into fiscal 2011. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions."

Obviously, the share repurchase that we've expanded today from an authorization perspective gives us over $1.5 billion worth of firepower on that strategy. And we do see a continued acquisition opportunities albeit difficult to forecast and difficult to discuss on a call like this. I don't think we feel like we're particularly constrained from a size perspective. Our constraints are really driven by three factors: first is, sort of the financial model of any potential acquisition. In your term, what does it mean long term, and what is the price of the target? Is it something that makes sense economically for us to pursue? The second and no less important, clearly, is the strategy value that the company might deliver to us over the long haul. And the third, also important is the amount of synergy that exists between our business and the acquired company business. And so I think given McKesson's footprint, we see opportunities really across the healthcare universe that are open for our evaluation. Thus far, obviously, because we've not announced any acquisitions recently, those targets that we've been evaluating amidst on one or of those parameters, or simply can't be executed in a way that makes sense for our shareholders. So I think that we continue to be optimistic that there's a way for us to continue our track record of building value and we plan to continue to keep our options open."

And so we may see those multiples contract over time, and those opportunities then would become more appropriate for us over time. So I think the best way to think about how we evaluate capital deployment is we're patient and the patience ultimately will pay off in good execution for our shareholders. Our patience has limits and clearly the share repurchase authorization that we have announced today shows that we clearly see share repurchase of McKesson's stock as a very competitive alternative to the other strategies we might be evaluating."

It was an at-risk launch, and we do have product left in our system that we will continue to use this year that will bolster our performance in that business. And there's a chance in our third or fourth quarter that there'll be a couple of additional generic launches in that business that, once again, will be important to that business, but it will be less important to the corporation, overall.

Certainly, we see the strength of our balance sheet and our financial flexibility, as they vary material sources of value for our shareholders in the long term, and plan to continue with our portfolio approach to capital deployment. I do think that to get to the share count that we've given, you need to chew not quite a bit more than a third of the current share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion. You need to remember that there is some level of option exercises that were always experienced in each year. And of course, we do have equity-based compensation programs, and there are some new contingent shares issued as part of those programs each year. So in fact, as earlier commentators or earlier questionners asked about, depending on the pace at which we do this, we will potentially use a very good chunk of the existing authorization to get to that share count assumption.

And clearly, the pressure from Washington to get to these milestone dates is important, albeit there are some parts of our customer base that are trying to lobby Congress to stretch those time frames out. That gives us the benefit of having more time to make the implementations go live, but obviously, the detriment side of that is it reduces the rush to get it done as well. So it's kind of a mixed blessing. But there is a debate, obviously, if you follow technology going on in Washington, about whether these objectives are too difficult for our customers to reach."

We believe that we will be able to grow at market rates, but we always talk about our mix of customers. And the ebbs and flows of market share for very large customers, particularly with people like mail customers, you should assume are our lowest profit margin customers as well. So although the revenue was impacted this year, as a result of some of that reduced buying, we actually saw the strength in our gross profits. So there's two reasons we'd point to the gross profits strength: one, is that, that's really how we have to run the company; but secondly, it's also an indicator of the strength of our generics programs and our ability to build margin that isn't affected by the downward pressure on revenues that occurs, as a result of the generic conversions that go on in our industry. So although we see revenue growth rates in the industry continuing in that low single-digit range, we hope the gross profit will grow faster. And that will be a sign of the health of the distribution community, it's if we can grow our gross profits faster than our revenues.

For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $27.5 billion and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.10. Our first quarter performance positions us well for the remainder of the fiscal year, and we continue to expect McKesson should earn between $4.72 and $4.92 per diluted share. 
Before I turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results, I thought I would highlight the trends in both segments of our business.
Distribution Solutions started the year with solid growth and operating margin expansion. Operating profit was up 17%, including the $51 million antitrust settlement we talked about during our fourth quarter call. Excluding this settlement, the operating profit margin in Distribution Solutions expanded by four basis points as we continued to benefit from our generics offering across our Distribution businesses. If you take a moment to think back several years, you will recall that our discussions about our generics offering were mainly focused on progress we were making penetrating the independent segment of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. 
Today, when we talk about generics, our discussions encompass the broader array of customer-centric programs available throughout McKesson. In U.S. Pharmaceutical, our proprietary generics program, OneStop, is available to customers regardless of whether they are independent, retail chain, hospital or long-term care. Just importantly, our generics programs are available across different geographies and across multiple business units such as specialty and Medical-Surgical. With a favorable generics environment this year and our comprehensive offering, we anticipate continued profit growth in generics for fiscal 2011, and we have confidence that we are building a multi-year period of strong generics growth.
The revenues for our Specialty Distribution business are included in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Specialty Distribution is performing extremely well. We are wrapping up the final part of our very successful Centers for Disease Control and Preventions program to deliver the H1N1 flu vaccine. In addition, this quarter, we had another strong contribution from oxaliplatin. This drug is a good example of how we benefit from generics across our business. 
In our Medical-Surgical business, revenues were flat for the first quarter, but I would remind you that last year in the first quarter, this business benefited from the demand resulting from the H1N1 virus. We expect Medical-Surgical will continue to have slower top-line growth until we see more of an economic recovery, which would translate into better employment rates and more physician visits. We also expect a normal flu season this year. 
I'm very pleased we've been able to grow in spite of the softness we've seen in the market. Physician office visits are off somewhat. In this business, we are very focused on optimizing our sourcing of McKesson-branded products, and we continue to drive leverage through aggressive cost management. Combined, these initiatives are resulting in margin expansion.
Our Canadian Distribution business had solid performance in the first quarter. McKesson Canada has leading positions in every market segment. We offer a comprehensive set of solutions and have close relationships with our customers. This is a terrific business for us. As you know, there are significant differences between the Canadian and U.S. markets. In Canada, drug prices, price increases, patient reimbursement and wholesaler up-charges are regulated by the government. Recently, provincial governments have been seeking to reduce the budget deficits that resulted from stimulus spending during the economic downturn. Drug spending by the government has been targeted as a way to reduce costs. As a result, there have been public policy changes in Canada that have the potential to impact our performance.
Over the past several months, the provinces of Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia announced and enacted drug reform that will result in price cuts on most generic drugs by up to 50% over the next three years. Qu√©bec has recently announced its intention to implement a similar effort, but final details are not yet available.
The government has provided some offsets for this, and we continue to work with all of our stakeholders on mitigation strategies. Going forward, it is our goal to grow our footprint in Canada, expanding our offering in high-growth segments such as Specialty Distribution. For fiscal 2011, we expect the potential impact from Canada regulations to be manageable within our guidance range. Overall, we are well positioned to continue to have a thriving business in Canada.
I'm pleased with the first quarter performance in Distribution Solutions, with solid revenue growth and margin expansion, and I have confidence in our full year business performance. 
Turning now to Technology Solutions. While the results are in line with our expectations for the first quarter, they are not indicative of our performance we expect from the business over the long term. As we said during our fiscal year-end call and again at our Investor Day, we did expect our first quarter results to be down quite significantly, and while we continue to expect modest improvements to our full year operating profit margin, that improvement will be heavily weighted to the back half of our fiscal year.
Within our Technology Solutions segment, we have three large businesses. Two of them, our payor-facing Health Solutions business and our RelayHealth Connectivity business, showed steady results year-over-year in the June quarter. The drop in segment operating profit in the first quarter stems from our hospital-facing Provider Technology business, where we are investing heavily in our enterprise revenue management and clinical solutions. I'm pleased to report that we continue to experience high levels of bookings for stimulus-related clinical products, and we are committed to the rapid deployment of these software solutions so we can support our customers in their efforts to achieve meaningful use.
Taking a step back from the quarter results, we are very pleased with the recent progress that we've made with the Department of Health and Human Services released the final rules for meaningful use and certification standards for electronic health record systems. The rules were generally consistent with the recommendations we had submitted during the comment period. By creating two categories of requirements, core and menu, providers now have the flexibility to achieve meaningful use by taking different paths when implementing an EHR system based on their individual needs and priorities, which we believe is critical to broad-based adoption. We believe this positions more providers to participate in the program in a timely manner.
We remain focused on working with our customers to make sure that they have the right resources in place to qualify for stimulus money. For more than a year, McKesson has been actively moving our EHR systems towards having the capabilities our customers need to achieve the proposed objectives.
The official certification process has not been fully delineated. However, we are on track to submit our EHR systems for initial certification as soon as we have a clear indication of the process, and we believe we are well positioned to achieve certification of our EHR systems. 
Our strategy in Technology Solutions remains the same: to help providers reduce cost while improving quality, safety and efficiency through automation and connectivity. McKesson has a comprehensive set of products and services to achieve this goal. 
In summary, we're off to a good start to fiscal 2011. In addition to solid operating performance, our strong balance sheet and tremendous cash flow provides us with opportunities to deploy capital to advance our long-term strategic objectives. 
In the first quarter, we executed a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, and we also announced a 50% increase to our dividend. Both the share repurchase and the dividend increase demonstrate our confidence in our business and our future cash flow generation. We plan to continue our portfolio approach to capital deployment, and you should expect a mixture of share repurchases and acquisitions that will advance our mission: to improve the quality and safety of the health care system. I believe we are well positioned for continued success. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?"
288195,108918554,70811,"McKesson Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Jul-30-2010",2010-07-30,"Earnings Calls","McKesson Corporation","Executives","Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As you just heard, McKesson is off to another solid start to the fiscal year, led by the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment and the continued strength of our balance sheet.As usual, I'll beg",1787,"Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As you just heard, McKesson is off to another solid start to the fiscal year, led by the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment and the continued strength of our balance sheet.
As usual, I'll begin with a review of our consolidated results, and then I'll provide additional color as I discuss each segment. 
Consolidated revenues were $27.5 billion for the quarter, up 3% from the prior year, with both segments contributing to this growth. On this 3% revenue growth, gross profit for the quarter increased 7% to $1.4 billion. As we discussed during our May earnings call, when we first gave guidance for fiscal 2011, the first quarter in our current fiscal year benefited from a $51 million antitrust settlement. Excluding this antitrust settlement, which flowed through our gross profit line, our gross profit margin was flat. The steady gross profit leverage we saw in Distribution Solutions driven by generics was offset by a decline in the Technology Solutions gross margin, which I'll come back to later.
Moving below the gross profit line. First quarter operating expense increased 9% to $918 million due to higher employee compensation and benefit costs, increased investment in our Technology Solutions segment and foreign exchange rate movements. As you recall, last year, our operating expenses grew sequentially as we progressed through the year and gained more confidence in the strength of our businesses. We entered fiscal 2011 at the run rate at which we finished fiscal 2010. As a result, our year-over-year comparisons will show the kind of growth you saw this quarter until we get into the back half of this year, when they should moderate significantly.
For the full year, I would expect our operating expense growth to be fairly modest, as we expected when we first provided guidance for fiscal 2011 last quarter. As one other reminder about operating expense, as you recall, last year's operating expense benefited from the favorable legal settlement related to the company's 401(k) plan. This resulted in us having little expense related to our 401(k) plan in fiscal 2010. For the current fiscal year, we now expect full year 401(k)-related expenses will be close to $60 million.
Other income was fairly flat for the quarter at $9 million. Interest expense declined $5 million versus the prior year to $43 million, driven primarily by the repayment of $215 million in long-term debt in March of fiscal 2010.
Moving to taxes. Our effective tax rate, 32.3%, is generally in line with the 32% we expect for the full year and is slightly higher than the 31.6% effective tax rate in the first quarter a year ago. Net income in the quarter was $298 million, up 3% from the prior year. Our diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.10 for the quarter, an increase of 4% compared to the prior year. To wrap up our consolidated results, this quarter's diluted weighted average shares was flat year-over-year at 272 million shares. 
Let me take just a minute to explain how the accelerated share repurchase program impacted our share count this quarter. As we've previously disclosed, on May 17, we entered into an accelerated share buyback agreement to repurchase $1 billion of the company's common stock. While this had some impact on our share count this quarter, the full impact won't be felt until later this year since the agreement was only implemented midway through the June quarter. As an aside, the ASR program officially concluded this week, which was somewhat earlier than we had originally thought. Overall, on our share count, as we discussed at our Investor Day in June, we continue to expect our full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding to come in at our original guidance of 267 million.
Let's now move on to our segment results. In Distribution Solutions, overall revenue growth was 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Looking at the components, total U.S. Pharmaceuticals Distribution and Services revenue grew 2% for the quarter. As we've discussed, over the past several quarters, we do continue to see a shift from warehouse to direct revenues.
Canada revenues on a constant-currency basis grew 5% for the quarter, primarily due to market growth rates and one additional sales day. Including the favorable currency impact of 15%, Canada revenues grew 20% for the quarter.
Medical-Surgical distribution revenues were flat for the quarter at $686 million. As you recall, though, the prior year benefited from increased demand related to the H1N1 flu virus, and the current quarter benefited from two small acquisitions we made in mid-fiscal 2010. Adjusting for these two items, Medical-Surgical distribution revenues grew at about 2% this quarter.
Gross profit in the segment was up 12% to $1.1 billion for the quarter, a strong performance, with $51 million of the increase coming from the pretax antitrust settlement that we discussed earlier. Excluding the antitrust settlement, gross profit would still be up a solid 6%, resulting in a 13-basis-point improvement in gross margin. The primary driver of this profit growth in the quarter was strong growth in our generic profits.
Our Distribution Solutions operating expense was up 7% to $568 million for the quarter. This year-over-year increase is driven by the same sequential timing issues I talked about earlier for the company overall. For the full year, I would expect the increase to be more modest.
Operating margin rates for the quarter were 189 basis points versus 166 basis points in the prior-year quarter. Excluding the antitrust settlement, we are showing a four-basis-point margin improvement year-over-year in this segment. All in all, we saw a very solid start to the year in Distribution Solutions.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. Total revenues grew 2% for the quarter to $759 million. Services revenue increased 1% for the quarter, a little bit slower growth than what you've seen in the past. A modest amount of Services revenue is tied to software implementations, and the pace of these implementations has slowed due to the higher mix of the more complex enterprise revenue management and clinical software solutions. 
Software and software systems revenues of $135 million in the quarter grew 4% from a year ago. Hardware revenues were up 21% for the quarter, as this line has a fair amount of quarterly volatility. Technology Solutions gross profit declined by 7% to $325 million, which is in line with our original expectations for the quarter. As we told you back on May 3, we stepped up our investments in the latter half of fiscal 2010 in this segment in order to ensure we had the right resources to successfully implement our customers' clinical and next generation of enterprise revenue management solutions. A large majority of these investments are reflected in our gross profit results. 
I'd also remind you that our Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management solution became generally available late in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, triggering an incremental $8 million of amortization expense for the quarter. You will continue to see this impact our year-over-year gross profit growth until it is fully lapped in the third quarter of the current fiscal year. Technology Solutions operating expenses increased 6% in the quarter to $262 million. Higher expenses in this segment were driven by continued investment in research and development activities as well as the general ramp-up of investment spending we have discussed.
To be specific, Technology Solutions had total gross R&D spending of $105 million compared to $98 million in the prior year. Of these amounts, we capitalized 14% this year compared to 18% a year ago. Our operating profit in our Technology Solutions segment this quarter was $64 million, down 38% from $103 million a year ago. Operating margins were 8.43% for the quarter compared to 13.8% in the prior year, primarily due to the decline in gross profit discussed earlier and increased investment in research and development activities.
Leaving our segment performance and turning briefly to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. Our receivables increased 4% to $7.8 billion versus $7.5 billion a year ago, and our days sales outstanding were flat at 23 days. Compared to a year ago, inventories were up 9% to $9.4 billion, and payables were also up 9% to $13.3 billion. So our days sales and inventory of 33 days was up two days from a year ago, while our days sales and payables increased three days from a year ago to 46 days. These working capital metrics contributed to us generating $528 million in operating cash flow in the quarter, a good start to the year. Going forward, we continue to expect to generate approximately $1.5 billion in full year cash flow from operations.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.3 billion, down slightly from our year-end balance of $3.7 billion. Our ability to deliver consistent operating cash flows, along with our strong balance sheet, uniquely positions us to create shareholder value through the continued use of our portfolio approach to capital deployment. As part of this approach, we were pleased to launch this quarter both the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program and the 50% increase in our dividend.
Property acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures combined were essentially flat with the prior year at $87 million, and we continue to expect our capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. 
Now to conclude. Our first quarter results were solid and on track. Our guidance range remains at earnings from continuing operations of $4.72 to $4.92 per fully diluted share. For clarity, let me make just one other point about this range. As you saw in our press release, after the quarter ended, we completed the sale of our McKesson Asia-Pacific business. As a result of the sale, we will record a pretax gain in the second quarter of approximately $94 million, which we will show in the discontinued operations line. For modeling purposes, this business is primarily reflected in the services revenue line within our Technology Solutions segment and rolls up to our Payor business, with revenues running approximately $21 million per quarter and profits being insignificant. 
Also as you know, we give guidance based on our earnings from continuing operations. So this transaction and the gain on it will not have an impact on our EPS guidance range. In summary, we feel our first quarter results provide us with a solid foundation for another good year. 
Thank you for joining us this morning, and with that, I will turn the call over to the Operator for your questions. I would ask that you limit your questions to just one per person to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?"

So when you look at the number year-over-year, we, of course, have a much higher stock price, which is a very good thing. We have a much higher stock price this year than we did a year ago, so that drove a pretty significant increase in the dilution impact of options that are outstanding, and that drove the share price up a little bit.

When you think about the full year, I'd say we're still tracking to the original assumption that we think the full year number will be 267 million shares outstanding."

First of all, we hear some of the same rumors you hear, and sometimes, we're not involved in the activities at all. And actually, when we inquire, the companies that are purportedly for sale aren't for sale, and somebody is trying to either, on the media side, to generate a story or sometimes, potentially, bankers are trying to generate interest in a company that may not have an interest in a transaction. Secondly, sometimes there are real sales activities going on, and I think our company views anything in health care around the globe, frankly, as, at a minimum, a learning experience for us to at least view the opportunity and take a look at the financial and strategic implications of moving forward in any kind of a transaction. And I think on behalf of our shareholders, we have a responsibility to remain globally aware of what‚Äôs going on in health care. And then lastly, I'd comment that any smart banker would always have us included in a deal even if we're not, just in an effort to make sure that fair price is being paid for the asset. So I've seen occasions where we're not involved in a deal or we‚Äôve long since moved on in our minds, but yet we're still purportedly involved heavily at the final stages of negotiation for whatever reasons that you guys could dream up. So thinking in a broader context, what would we look at and actually want to buy? As I've mentioned in the past, we don't necessarily feel constrained, necessarily, geographically or even size-related. We feel more constrained about whether or not it makes financial sense, and it makes it through that gate and that hurdle, then we can actually create value for our shareholders, both with and without synergies and what is our dependence on synergies, what is our likely probability of realizing those synergies. And then if we get past those financial gates, then the question is sort of the strategic implications of making those moves. As Jeff mentioned in his comments, we do believe a portfolio approach to capital deployment is the best way to create value. We plan to continue that approach. You‚Äôve seen evidence of the share repurchases and the dividend increase recently. On the acquisition front, we've not been very active in the last 18 months, and primarily due to valuations, many of the assets that we think might make sense for us strategically, as I said, don't make it through the first gate. And lastly, I'd say you see tremendous evidence of our discipline, both in terms of our performance from an acquisition perspective retrospectively, but also in our ability to sell assets that we might feel are valuable to us and meet the needs of our strategy. But frankly, we can't produce the same financial result over a long-term view that we could realize on a DCF basis very quickly. And so Jeff talked once again about the amount of, I think, tremendous cash flow we've generated from a company that was well-run and strategic to us. But frankly, we were offered a price that made sense for us to stop and listen, and we executed the transaction. So I think that discipline and that lack of sort of being married to being global or not being global, having an asset or not having an asset and thinking about it in a more analytical context will drive value for our shareholders, and it demonstrates our discipline."

How long does it take to overcome that? I don't know, but if you think about John pointing out we haven't done an acquisition of scale in six to eight quarters, well, within that time frame, you have the real collapse of equity values that you saw beginning in the fall of 2008. And I think it's fair to say, John, that even though that collapse lasted for quite some time, I don't know that we found anyone of any significant note who suddenly said, ‚ÄúYes, I'm going to sell my company based on the new public market valuation.‚Äù"

I mean, I would agree with Jeff entirely that valuations are largely driven by the view that I should be back where I was and then put a premium on it. That said, I think that over time, people begin to become more realistic about the real value of their enterprise. And I think the other thing that we struggle with, frankly, on the smaller acquisitions is they already have a premium built in for a takeover by us or one of our larger competitors. So they come to us with a built-in premium, and you'll even see sometimes the sell-side reports say, ‚ÄúWell, the stability in this stock will be held up. Even though their performance is waning, the stability will be held up, because they're going to be bought if they drop too low.‚Äù Well, that obviously feeds that view that they have a floor on their PEs or a floor on their valuations that is driven by performance when, in fact, the floor is driven by the optics of us coming in to buy. So it makes it challenging for us. And so we need to be patient, we need to work these deals over time and we need to convince ourselves and potentially the target owners that the kind of valuations that we might be willing to pay are more realistic.

More stores are coming online. We‚Äôre seeing more interest in buying our generics. To the point was made earlier on the call, people are beginning to become more dependent on our ability to manage their inventory and their buys. And we can get access to product that might not be able to get access to. And so I think the symbiotic relationship between retail and wholesalers are actually reinforced when the market gets difficult, because we just do a terrific job of delivering value. As it relates specifically to a weakness at the storefront level or the outbound sales level, we do see that in our revenue line. So clearly, when our largest customers begin to tail off from a revenue perspective or if they lose market share, frankly, that's a direct reflection back into our business. So when they win, we win, and when they lose, we lose. And our goal is to continue to try to bolster their performance as much as we can, but they've got to win patients at the front counter.

I think it is a complex question, and we only see a sample of the physician offices. We do have many businesses, though, that are involved in physician offices, which might give us a different view or, certainly, maybe a better view than others might have. As you know, we have a transaction processing business that brings the actual visit itself between the physician and the payor. From a reimbursement-cycle perspective, we get to see those transactions. So we do see frequency and we do see sort of the load on the doctors. We also see some people buying software at the physician office level, and then clearly, our footprint in Medical-Surgical, where we‚Äôre actually selling to the alternate site, in particular to the doctor offices, we get to see volume and have discussions with physicians at that level. So I do think we believe doc visits are down, and as a result there will be some moderation of the use of medical supplies and perhaps also a moderation in the amount of scrips being written. But I would say that we still believe that the scrip volume levels are okay. We're not seeing a step function change in scrip volumes. But once again, we are focused, really, on the pull-through in our business and what product is pulled through. So if scrip volumes are off with our customers because they‚Äôre losing share, that's a problem for us. If our scrip volumes are off with them in a branded way, but more is being converted to generics, we can have a little scrip volume degradation on brand if we have a scrip volume conversion increase on generics. From a financial perspective, that's a pretty good trade for us. It's an offset.

I think that's our view. As we've talked about in the past, there's a large transaction-processing business in there that is more of a software-as-a-service kind of model, where we get continued revenue. And that business certainly can grow nicely, but it is a steady grower. We also have our Payor business, which in the past, actually, has had some lumpy revenue characteristics with it. But that also is a strong part of our business. And then, as we‚Äôve described, at our McKesson Provider Technologies is actually multiple businesses. We have our Medical Imaging business, we have our Legacy Financial Systems businesses, we have an Automation business. So those businesses are all part of that segment, and the Clinicals are but a sub-segment of that. Now having said that, I just said that our fourth quarter's dependent on our successful implementation of clinical contracts in terms of actually achieving the objectives that we've given you. So there is a significant amount of profit in clinical software sales, and that'll be necessary. But you're not going to drive the whole true success in the Clinical side in the fourth quarter. I don't think you're going to drive for the year double-digit revenue increases for the segment. That simply is difficult to do."

For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $27.5 billion and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.10. Our first quarter performance positions us well for the remainder of the fiscal year, and we continue to expect McKesson should earn between $4.72 and $4.92 per diluted share.
 Before I turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results, I thought I would highlight the trends in both segments of our business.
 Distribution Solutions started the year with solid growth and operating margin expansion. Operating profit was up 17%, including the $51 million antitrust settlement we talked about during our fourth quarter call. Excluding this settlement, the operating profit margin in Distribution Solutions expanded by four basis points as we continued to benefit from our generics offering across our Distribution businesses. If you take a moment to think back several years, you will recall that our discussions about our generics offering were mainly focused on progress we were making penetrating the independent segment of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business.
 Today, when we talk about generics, our discussions encompass the broader array of customer-centric programs available throughout McKesson. In U.S. Pharmaceutical, our proprietary generics program, OneStop, is available to customers regardless of whether they are independent, retail chain, hospital or long-term care. Just importantly, our generics programs are available across different geographies and across multiple business units such as specialty and Medical-Surgical. With a favorable generics environment this year and our comprehensive offering, we anticipate continued profit growth in generics for fiscal 2011, and we have confidence that we are building a multi-year period of strong generics growth.
 The revenues for our Specialty Distribution business are included in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Specialty Distribution is performing extremely well. We are wrapping up the final part of our very successful Centers for Disease Control and Preventions program to deliver the H1N1 flu vaccine. In addition, this quarter, we had another strong contribution from oxaliplatin. This drug is a good example of how we benefit from generics across our business.
 In our Medical-Surgical business, revenues were flat for the first quarter, but I would remind you that last year in the first quarter, this business benefited from the demand resulting from the H1N1 virus. We expect Medical-Surgical will continue to have slower top-line growth until we see more of an economic recovery, which would translate into better employment rates and more physician visits. We also expect a normal flu season this year.
 I'm very pleased we've been able to grow in spite of the softness we've seen in the market. Physician office visits are off somewhat. In this business, we are very focused on optimizing our sourcing of McKesson-branded products, and we continue to drive leverage through aggressive cost management. Combined, these initiatives are resulting in margin expansion.
 Our Canadian Distribution business had solid performance in the first quarter. McKesson Canada has leading positions in every market segment. We offer a comprehensive set of solutions and have close relationships with our customers. This is a terrific business for us. As you know, there are significant differences between the Canadian and U.S. markets. In Canada, drug prices, price increases, patient reimbursement and wholesaler up-charges are regulated by the government. Recently, provincial governments have been seeking to reduce the budget deficits that resulted from stimulus spending during the economic downturn. Drug spending by the government has been targeted as a way to reduce costs. As a result, there have been public policy changes in Canada that have the potential to impact our performance.
 Over the past several months, the provinces of Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia announced and enacted drug reform that will result in price cuts on most generic drugs by up to 50% over the next three years. Qu√©bec has recently announced its intention to implement a similar effort, but final details are not yet available.
 The government has provided some offsets for this, and we continue to work with all of our stakeholders on mitigation strategies. Going forward, it is our goal to grow our footprint in Canada, expanding our offering in high-growth segments such as Specialty Distribution. For fiscal 2011, we expect the potential impact from Canada regulations to be manageable within our guidance range. Overall, we are well positioned to continue to have a thriving business in Canada.
 I'm pleased with the first quarter performance in Distribution Solutions, with solid revenue growth and margin expansion, and I have confidence in our full year business performance.
 Turning now to Technology Solutions. While the results are in line with our expectations for the first quarter, they are not indicative of our performance we expect from the business over the long term. As we said during our fiscal year-end call and again at our Investor Day, we did expect our first quarter results to be down quite significantly, and while we continue to expect modest improvements to our full year operating profit margin, that improvement will be heavily weighted to the back half of our fiscal year.
 Within our Technology Solutions segment, we have three large businesses. Two of them, our payor-facing Health Solutions business and our RelayHealth Connectivity business, showed steady results year-over-year in the June quarter. The drop in segment operating profit in the first quarter stems from our hospital-facing Provider Technology business, where we are investing heavily in our enterprise revenue management and clinical solutions. I'm pleased to report that we continue to experience high levels of bookings for stimulus-related clinical products, and we are committed to the rapid deployment of these software solutions so we can support our customers in their efforts to achieve meaningful use.
 Taking a step back from the quarter results, we are very pleased with the recent progress that we've made with the Department of Health and Human Services released the final rules for meaningful use and certification standards for electronic health record systems. The rules were generally consistent with the recommendations we had submitted during the comment period. By creating two categories of requirements, core and menu, providers now have the flexibility to achieve meaningful use by taking different paths when implementing an EHR system based on their individual needs and priorities, which we believe is critical to broad-based adoption. We believe this positions more providers to participate in the program in a timely manner.
 We remain focused on working with our customers to make sure that they have the right resources in place to qualify for stimulus money. For more than a year, McKesson has been actively moving our EHR systems towards having the capabilities our customers need to achieve the proposed objectives.
 The official certification process has not been fully delineated. However, we are on track to submit our EHR systems for initial certification as soon as we have a clear indication of the process, and we believe we are well positioned to achieve certification of our EHR systems.
 Our strategy in Technology Solutions remains the same: to help providers reduce cost while improving quality, safety and efficiency through automation and connectivity. McKesson has a comprehensive set of products and services to achieve this goal.
 In summary, we're off to a good start to fiscal 2011. In addition to solid operating performance, our strong balance sheet and tremendous cash flow provides us with opportunities to deploy capital to advance our long-term strategic objectives.
 In the first quarter, we executed a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, and we also announced a 50% increase to our dividend. Both the share repurchase and the dividend increase demonstrate our confidence in our business and our future cash flow generation. We plan to continue our portfolio approach to capital deployment, and you should expect a mixture of share repurchases and acquisitions that will advance our mission: to improve the quality and safety of the health care system. I believe we are well positioned for continued success.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?

288195,108918554,71272,"McKesson Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Jul-30-2010",2010-07-30,"Earnings Calls","McKesson Corporation","Executives"," Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As you just heard, McKesson is off to another solid start to the fiscal year, led by the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment and the continued strength of our balance sheet. As usual, I'll b",1787," Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As you just heard, McKesson is off to another solid start to the fiscal year, led by the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment and the continued strength of our balance sheet.
 As usual, I'll begin with a review of our consolidated results, and then I'll provide additional color as I discuss each segment.
 Consolidated revenues were $27.5 billion for the quarter, up 3% from the prior year, with both segments contributing to this growth. On this 3% revenue growth, gross profit for the quarter increased 7% to $1.4 billion. As we discussed during our May earnings call, when we first gave guidance for fiscal 2011, the first quarter in our current fiscal year benefited from a $51 million antitrust settlement. Excluding this antitrust settlement, which flowed through our gross profit line, our gross profit margin was flat. The steady gross profit leverage we saw in Distribution Solutions driven by generics was offset by a decline in the Technology Solutions gross margin, which I'll come back to later.
 Moving below the gross profit line. First quarter operating expense increased 9% to $918 million due to higher employee compensation and benefit costs, increased investment in our Technology Solutions segment and foreign exchange rate movements. As you recall, last year, our operating expenses grew sequentially as we progressed through the year and gained more confidence in the strength of our businesses. We entered fiscal 2011 at the run rate at which we finished fiscal 2010. As a result, our year-over-year comparisons will show the kind of growth you saw this quarter until we get into the back half of this year, when they should moderate significantly.
 For the full year, I would expect our operating expense growth to be fairly modest, as we expected when we first provided guidance for fiscal 2011 last quarter. As one other reminder about operating expense, as you recall, last year's operating expense benefited from the favorable legal settlement related to the company's 401(k) plan. This resulted in us having little expense related to our 401(k) plan in fiscal 2010. For the current fiscal year, we now expect full year 401(k)-related expenses will be close to $60 million.
 Other income was fairly flat for the quarter at $9 million. Interest expense declined $5 million versus the prior year to $43 million, driven primarily by the repayment of $215 million in long-term debt in March of fiscal 2010.
 Moving to taxes. Our effective tax rate, 32.3%, is generally in line with the 32% we expect for the full year and is slightly higher than the 31.6% effective tax rate in the first quarter a year ago. Net income in the quarter was $298 million, up 3% from the prior year. Our diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.10 for the quarter, an increase of 4% compared to the prior year. To wrap up our consolidated results, this quarter's diluted weighted average shares was flat year-over-year at 272 million shares.
 Let me take just a minute to explain how the accelerated share repurchase program impacted our share count this quarter. As we've previously disclosed, on May 17, we entered into an accelerated share buyback agreement to repurchase $1 billion of the company's common stock. While this had some impact on our share count this quarter, the full impact won't be felt until later this year since the agreement was only implemented midway through the June quarter. As an aside, the ASR program officially concluded this week, which was somewhat earlier than we had originally thought. Overall, on our share count, as we discussed at our Investor Day in June, we continue to expect our full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding to come in at our original guidance of 267 million.
 Let's now move on to our segment results. In Distribution Solutions, overall revenue growth was 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Looking at the components, total U.S. Pharmaceuticals Distribution and Services revenue grew 2% for the quarter. As we've discussed, over the past several quarters, we do continue to see a shift from warehouse to direct revenues.
 Canada revenues on a constant-currency basis grew 5% for the quarter, primarily due to market growth rates and one additional sales day. Including the favorable currency impact of 15%, Canada revenues grew 20% for the quarter.
 Medical-Surgical distribution revenues were flat for the quarter at $686 million. As you recall, though, the prior year benefited from increased demand related to the H1N1 flu virus, and the current quarter benefited from two small acquisitions we made in mid-fiscal 2010. Adjusting for these two items, Medical-Surgical distribution revenues grew at about 2% this quarter.
 Gross profit in the segment was up 12% to $1.1 billion for the quarter, a strong performance, with $51 million of the increase coming from the pretax antitrust settlement that we discussed earlier. Excluding the antitrust settlement, gross profit would still be up a solid 6%, resulting in a 13-basis-point improvement in gross margin. The primary driver of this profit growth in the quarter was strong growth in our generic profits.
 Our Distribution Solutions operating expense was up 7% to $568 million for the quarter. This year-over-year increase is driven by the same sequential timing issues I talked about earlier for the company overall. For the full year, I would expect the increase to be more modest.
 Operating margin rates for the quarter were 189 basis points versus 166 basis points in the prior-year quarter. Excluding the antitrust settlement, we are showing a four-basis-point margin improvement year-over-year in this segment. All in all, we saw a very solid start to the year in Distribution Solutions.
 Turning now to Technology Solutions. Total revenues grew 2% for the quarter to $759 million. Services revenue increased 1% for the quarter, a little bit slower growth than what you've seen in the past. A modest amount of Services revenue is tied to software implementations, and the pace of these implementations has slowed due to the higher mix of the more complex enterprise revenue management and clinical software solutions.
 Software and software systems revenues of $135 million in the quarter grew 4% from a year ago. Hardware revenues were up 21% for the quarter, as this line has a fair amount of quarterly volatility. Technology Solutions gross profit declined by 7% to $325 million, which is in line with our original expectations for the quarter. As we told you back on May 3, we stepped up our investments in the latter half of fiscal 2010 in this segment in order to ensure we had the right resources to successfully implement our customers' clinical and next generation of enterprise revenue management solutions. A large majority of these investments are reflected in our gross profit results.
 I'd also remind you that our Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management solution became generally available late in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, triggering an incremental $8 million of amortization expense for the quarter. You will continue to see this impact our year-over-year gross profit growth until it is fully lapped in the third quarter of the current fiscal year. Technology Solutions operating expenses increased 6% in the quarter to $262 million. Higher expenses in this segment were driven by continued investment in research and development activities as well as the general ramp-up of investment spending we have discussed.
 To be specific, Technology Solutions had total gross R&D spending of $105 million compared to $98 million in the prior year. Of these amounts, we capitalized 14% this year compared to 18% a year ago. Our operating profit in our Technology Solutions segment this quarter was $64 million, down 38% from $103 million a year ago. Operating margins were 8.43% for the quarter compared to 13.8% in the prior year, primarily due to the decline in gross profit discussed earlier and increased investment in research and development activities.
 Leaving our segment performance and turning briefly to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. Our receivables increased 4% to $7.8 billion versus $7.5 billion a year ago, and our days sales outstanding were flat at 23 days. Compared to a year ago, inventories were up 9% to $9.4 billion, and payables were also up 9% to $13.3 billion. So our days sales and inventory of 33 days was up two days from a year ago, while our days sales and payables increased three days from a year ago to 46 days. These working capital metrics contributed to us generating $528 million in operating cash flow in the quarter, a good start to the year. Going forward, we continue to expect to generate approximately $1.5 billion in full year cash flow from operations.
 We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.3 billion, down slightly from our year-end balance of $3.7 billion. Our ability to deliver consistent operating cash flows, along with our strong balance sheet, uniquely positions us to create shareholder value through the continued use of our portfolio approach to capital deployment. As part of this approach, we were pleased to launch this quarter both the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program and the 50% increase in our dividend.
 Property acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures combined were essentially flat with the prior year at $87 million, and we continue to expect our capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million.
 Now to conclude. Our first quarter results were solid and on track. Our guidance range remains at earnings from continuing operations of $4.72 to $4.92 per fully diluted share. For clarity, let me make just one other point about this range. As you saw in our press release, after the quarter ended, we completed the sale of our McKesson Asia-Pacific business. As a result of the sale, we will record a pretax gain in the second quarter of approximately $94 million, which we will show in the discontinued operations line. For modeling purposes, this business is primarily reflected in the services revenue line within our Technology Solutions segment and rolls up to our Payor business, with revenues running approximately $21 million per quarter and profits being insignificant.
 Also as you know, we give guidance based on our earnings from continuing operations. So this transaction and the gain on it will not have an impact on our EPS guidance range. In summary, we feel our first quarter results provide us with a solid foundation for another good year.
 Thank you for joining us this morning, and with that, I will turn the call over to the Operator for your questions. I would ask that you limit your questions to just one per person to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?

You are correct that there's always some quarterly differences and timing in terms of when some of our compensation from the branded manufacturers comes in.

On the mechanics of the shares, Bob. So as you'll see in our Q, the actual number of shares outstanding on June 30 was about a little over 261 million. Of course, our fully diluted share calculation, which was 272 million for the quarter, has to do that on an average daily basis and then, very importantly, add the fully diluted shares. So when you look at the number year-over-year, we, of course, have a much higher stock price, which is a very good thing.

When you think about the full year, I'd say we're still tracking to the original assumption that we think the full year number will be 267 million shares outstanding.

First of all, we hear some of the same rumors you hear, and sometimes, we're not involved in the activities at all. And actually, when we inquire, the companies that are purportedly for sale aren't for sale, and somebody is trying to either, on the media side, to generate a story or sometimes, potentially, bankers are trying to generate interest in a company that may not have an interest in a transaction. Secondly, sometimes there are real sales activities going on, and I think our company views anything in health care around the globe, frankly, as, at a minimum, a learning experience for us to at least view the opportunity and take a look at the financial and strategic implications of moving forward in any kind of a transaction. And I think on behalf of our shareholders, we have a responsibility to remain globally aware of what‚Äôs going on in health care. And then lastly, I'd comment that any smart banker would always have us included in a deal even if we're not, just in an effort to make sure that fair price is being paid for the asset. So I've seen occasions where we're not involved in a deal or we‚Äôve long since moved on in our minds, but yet we're still purportedly involved heavily at the final stages of negotiation for whatever reasons that you guys could dream up. So thinking in a broader context, what would we look at and actually want to buy? As I've mentioned in the past, we don't necessarily feel constrained, necessarily, geographically or even size-related. We feel more constrained about whether or not it makes financial sense, and it makes it through that gate and that hurdle, then we can actually create value for our shareholders, both with and without synergies and what is our dependence on synergies, what is our likely probability of realizing those synergies. And then if we get past those financial gates, then the question is sort of the strategic implications of making those moves. As Jeff mentioned in his comments, we do believe a portfolio approach to capital deployment is the best way to create value. We plan to continue that approach. You‚Äôve seen evidence of the share repurchases and the dividend increase recently. On the acquisition front, we've not been very active in the last 18 months, and primarily due to valuations, many of the assets that we think might make sense for us strategically, as I said, don't make it through the first gate. And lastly, I'd say you see tremendous evidence of our discipline, both in terms of our performance from an acquisition perspective retrospectively, but also in our ability to sell assets that we might feel are valuable to us and meet the needs of our strategy. But frankly, we can't produce the same financial result over a long-term view that we could realize on a DCF basis very quickly. And so Jeff talked once again about the amount of, I think, tremendous cash flow we've generated from a company that was well-run and strategic to us. But frankly, we were offered a price that made sense for us to stop and listen, and we executed the transaction. So I think that discipline and that lack of sort of being married to being global or not being global, having an asset or not having an asset and thinking about it in a more analytical context will drive value for our shareholders, and it demonstrates our discipline.

The Technology Solutions business is continuing to focus on, really, the demand for clinical products, as our customers are racing to get these products installed and ready. As I mentioned also in my comments, we're pleased that the government has allowed for a multiple approach to accomplishing meaningful use, and we think that multifaceted approach will facilitate our customers actually achieving the results that they're after. Our technology and the other part of that meaningful-use process is making sure they‚Äôre using certified products. And as I also mentioned, that we believe that our products will be certified once we get the party that needs to do the certification put in there and we have a body to go to. Our development work right now is to make sure that our product continues to have the components necessary as defined by meaningful use and that we have the implementation and installation people on hand to make that happen. Now turning to doctor offices, we are not really seeing an acceleration in buying at that level. So when I talk about our booking strength in clinical products, frankly, we have a large footprint in physician offices, so I don't think we're losing any share to others. I would just comment that I don't think those doctor offices are yet focused on their requirement from an EHR perspective. So we're seeing a little bit of it in the hospital-related doctors. So when physicians are purchased by hospitals, that idea of getting them up on EHR's and integrating them with the McKesson inpatient products is important to them, but standalone documents, frankly, are still on the sidelines.

That said, I think that over time, people begin to become more realistic about the real value of their enterprise. And I think the other thing that we struggle with, frankly, on the smaller acquisitions is they already have a premium built in for a takeover by us or one of our larger competitors. So they come to us with a built-in premium, and you'll even see sometimes the sell-side reports say, ‚ÄúWell, the stability in this stock will be held up. Even though their performance is waning, the stability will be held up, because they're going to be bought if they drop too low.‚Äù Well, that obviously feeds that view that they have a floor on their PEs or a floor on their valuations that is driven by performance when, in fact, the floor is driven by the optics of us coming in to buy. So it makes it challenging for us. And so we need to be patient, we need to work these deals over time and we need to convince ourselves and potentially the target owners that the kind of valuations that we might be willing to pay are more realistic.

And so I think the symbiotic relationship between retail and wholesalers are actually reinforced when the market gets difficult, because we just do a terrific job of delivering value. As it relates specifically to a weakness at the storefront level or the outbound sales level, we do see that in our revenue line. So clearly, when our largest customers begin to tail off from a revenue perspective or if they lose market share, frankly, that's a direct reflection back into our business. So when they win, we win, and when they lose, we lose. And our goal is to continue to try to bolster their performance as much as we can, but they've got to win patients at the front counter. Otherwise, our model is negatively affected.

The model, really, is if there's a dozen players in a generic compound, the pricing is going to be lower than if there's just several players. And obviously, if it's an exclusive or co-exclusive kind of a launch, then the pricing is retained at a higher level, at least during that exclusivity period. So I don't think we've seen any difference, really, in the dynamics there. If there's a lot of people in the business of that specific compound or that particular strength or dosage, then we'll see prices erode more rapidly. And if there isn't, then the profit and the prices held up a little bit higher for a longer period of time. But what does happen is that, over time, these things begin to normalize, and we end up with a growing bolus of profit that is increasingly important to the company and continues to grow. And so I know there are people that say, ‚ÄúWell, what happens when there are fewer generic launches?‚Äù Clearly, our growth rates might decrease to some extent, but that pot of profit is not going to diminish and it is not going to disappear. And so it's just a question of how fast it expands, from our view.

I think it is a complex question, and we only see a sample of the physician offices. We do have many businesses, though, that are involved in physician offices, which might give us a different view or, certainly, maybe a better view than others might have. As you know, we have a transaction processing business that brings the actual visit itself between the physician and the payor. From a reimbursement-cycle perspective, we get to see those transactions. So we do see frequency and we do see sort of the load on the doctors. We also see some people buying software at the physician office level, and then clearly, our footprint in Medical-Surgical, where we‚Äôre actually selling to the alternate site, in particular to the doctor offices, we get to see volume and have discussions with physicians at that level. So I do think we believe doc visits are down, and as a result there will be some moderation of the use of medical supplies and perhaps also a moderation in the amount of scrips being written. But I would say that we still believe that the scrip volume levels are okay. We're not seeing a step function change in scrip volumes. But once again, we are focused, really, on the pull-through in our business and what product is pulled through. So if scrip volumes are off with our customers because they‚Äôre losing share, that's a problem for us. If our scrip volumes are off with them in a branded way, but more is being converted to generics, we can have a little scrip volume degradation on brand if we have a scrip volume conversion increase on generics. From a financial perspective, that's a pretty good trade for us. It's an offset. So I think that there is some correlation, obviously, over time, but our models are slightly different than what a retailer might experience right at the counter.

As we've talked about in the past, there's a large transaction-processing business in there that is more of a software-as-a-service kind of model, where we get continued revenue. And that business certainly can grow nicely, but it is a steady grower. We also have our Payor business, which in the past, actually, has had some lumpy revenue characteristics with it. But that also is a strong part of our business. And then, as we‚Äôve described, at our McKesson Provider Technologies is actually multiple businesses. We have our Medical Imaging business, we have our Legacy Financial Systems businesses, we have an Automation business. So those businesses are all part of that segment, and the Clinicals are but a sub-segment of that. Now having said that, I just said that our fourth quarter's dependent on our successful implementation of clinical contracts in terms of actually achieving the objectives that we've given you. So there is a significant amount of profit in clinical software sales, and that'll be necessary. But you're not going to drive the whole true success in the Clinical side in the fourth quarter.

For the first quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $27.5 billion and fully diluted earnings per share of $1.10. Our first quarter performance positions us well for the remainder of the fiscal year, and we continue to expect McKesson should earn between $4.72 and $4.92 per diluted share. 
Before I turn the call over to Jeff for a detailed review of our financial results, I thought I would highlight the trends in both segments of our business.
Distribution Solutions started the year with solid growth and operating margin expansion. Operating profit was up 17%, including the $51 million antitrust settlement we talked about during our fourth quarter call. Excluding this settlement, the operating profit margin in Distribution Solutions expanded by four basis points as we continued to benefit from our generics offering across our Distribution businesses. If you take a moment to think back several years, you will recall that our discussions about our generics offering were mainly focused on progress we were making penetrating the independent segment of our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. 
Today, when we talk about generics, our discussions encompass the broader array of customer-centric programs available throughout McKesson. In U.S. Pharmaceutical, our proprietary generics program, OneStop, is available to customers regardless of whether they are independent, retail chain, hospital or long-term care. Just importantly, our generics programs are available across different geographies and across multiple business units such as specialty and Medical-Surgical. With a favorable generics environment this year and our comprehensive offering, we anticipate continued profit growth in generics for fiscal 2011, and we have confidence that we are building a multi-year period of strong generics growth.
The revenues for our Specialty Distribution business are included in our U.S. Pharmaceutical business. Specialty Distribution is performing extremely well. We are wrapping up the final part of our very successful Centers for Disease Control and Preventions program to deliver the H1N1 flu vaccine. In addition, this quarter, we had another strong contribution from oxaliplatin. This drug is a good example of how we benefit from generics across our business. 
In our Medical-Surgical business, revenues were flat for the first quarter, but I would remind you that last year in the first quarter, this business benefited from the demand resulting from the H1N1 virus. We expect Medical-Surgical will continue to have slower top-line growth until we see more of an economic recovery, which would translate into better employment rates and more physician visits. We also expect a normal flu season this year. 
I'm very pleased we've been able to grow in spite of the softness we've seen in the market. Physician office visits are off somewhat. In this business, we are very focused on optimizing our sourcing of McKesson-branded products, and we continue to drive leverage through aggressive cost management. Combined, these initiatives are resulting in margin expansion.
Our Canadian Distribution business had solid performance in the first quarter. McKesson Canada has leading positions in every market segment. We offer a comprehensive set of solutions and have close relationships with our customers. This is a terrific business for us. As you know, there are significant differences between the Canadian and U.S. markets. In Canada, drug prices, price increases, patient reimbursement and wholesaler up-charges are regulated by the government. Recently, provincial governments have been seeking to reduce the budget deficits that resulted from stimulus spending during the economic downturn. Drug spending by the government has been targeted as a way to reduce costs. As a result, there have been public policy changes in Canada that have the potential to impact our performance.
Over the past several months, the provinces of Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia announced and enacted drug reform that will result in price cuts on most generic drugs by up to 50% over the next three years. Qu√©bec has recently announced its intention to implement a similar effort, but final details are not yet available.
The government has provided some offsets for this, and we continue to work with all of our stakeholders on mitigation strategies. Going forward, it is our goal to grow our footprint in Canada, expanding our offering in high-growth segments such as Specialty Distribution. For fiscal 2011, we expect the potential impact from Canada regulations to be manageable within our guidance range. Overall, we are well positioned to continue to have a thriving business in Canada.
I'm pleased with the first quarter performance in Distribution Solutions, with solid revenue growth and margin expansion, and I have confidence in our full year business performance. 
Turning now to Technology Solutions. While the results are in line with our expectations for the first quarter, they are not indicative of our performance we expect from the business over the long term. As we said during our fiscal year-end call and again at our Investor Day, we did expect our first quarter results to be down quite significantly, and while we continue to expect modest improvements to our full year operating profit margin, that improvement will be heavily weighted to the back half of our fiscal year.
Within our Technology Solutions segment, we have three large businesses. Two of them, our payor-facing Health Solutions business and our RelayHealth Connectivity business, showed steady results year-over-year in the June quarter. The drop in segment operating profit in the first quarter stems from our hospital-facing Provider Technology business, where we are investing heavily in our enterprise revenue management and clinical solutions. I'm pleased to report that we continue to experience high levels of bookings for stimulus-related clinical products, and we are committed to the rapid deployment of these software solutions so we can support our customers in their efforts to achieve meaningful use.
Taking a step back from the quarter results, we are very pleased with the recent progress that we've made with the Department of Health and Human Services released the final rules for meaningful use and certification standards for electronic health record systems. The rules were generally consistent with the recommendations we had submitted during the comment period. By creating two categories of requirements, core and menu, providers now have the flexibility to achieve meaningful use by taking different paths when implementing an EHR system based on their individual needs and priorities, which we believe is critical to broad-based adoption. We believe this positions more providers to participate in the program in a timely manner.
We remain focused on working with our customers to make sure that they have the right resources in place to qualify for stimulus money. For more than a year, McKesson has been actively moving our EHR systems towards having the capabilities our customers need to achieve the proposed objectives.
The official certification process has not been fully delineated. However, we are on track to submit our EHR systems for initial certification as soon as we have a clear indication of the process, and we believe we are well positioned to achieve certification of our EHR systems. 
Our strategy in Technology Solutions remains the same: to help providers reduce cost while improving quality, safety and efficiency through automation and connectivity. McKesson has a comprehensive set of products and services to achieve this goal. 
In summary, we're off to a good start to fiscal 2011. In addition to solid operating performance, our strong balance sheet and tremendous cash flow provides us with opportunities to deploy capital to advance our long-term strategic objectives. 
In the first quarter, we executed a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program, and we also announced a 50% increase to our dividend. Both the share repurchase and the dividend increase demonstrate our confidence in our business and our future cash flow generation. We plan to continue our portfolio approach to capital deployment, and you should expect a mixture of share repurchases and acquisitions that will advance our mission: to improve the quality and safety of the health care system. I believe we are well positioned for continued success. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, and we'll return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?"
288195,108918554,72155,"McKesson Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Jul-30-2010",2010-07-30,"Earnings Calls","McKesson Corporation","Executives","Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As you just heard, McKesson is off to another solid start to the fiscal year, led by the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment and the continued strength of our balance sheet.As usual, I'll beg",1787,"Well, thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As you just heard, McKesson is off to another solid start to the fiscal year, led by the performance of our Distribution Solutions segment and the continued strength of our balance sheet.
As usual, I'll begin with a review of our consolidated results, and then I'll provide additional color as I discuss each segment. 
Consolidated revenues were $27.5 billion for the quarter, up 3% from the prior year, with both segments contributing to this growth. On this 3% revenue growth, gross profit for the quarter increased 7% to $1.4 billion. As we discussed during our May earnings call, when we first gave guidance for fiscal 2011, the first quarter in our current fiscal year benefited from a $51 million antitrust settlement. Excluding this antitrust settlement, which flowed through our gross profit line, our gross profit margin was flat. The steady gross profit leverage we saw in Distribution Solutions driven by generics was offset by a decline in the Technology Solutions gross margin, which I'll come back to later.
Moving below the gross profit line. First quarter operating expense increased 9% to $918 million due to higher employee compensation and benefit costs, increased investment in our Technology Solutions segment and foreign exchange rate movements. As you recall, last year, our operating expenses grew sequentially as we progressed through the year and gained more confidence in the strength of our businesses. We entered fiscal 2011 at the run rate at which we finished fiscal 2010. As a result, our year-over-year comparisons will show the kind of growth you saw this quarter until we get into the back half of this year, when they should moderate significantly.
For the full year, I would expect our operating expense growth to be fairly modest, as we expected when we first provided guidance for fiscal 2011 last quarter. As one other reminder about operating expense, as you recall, last year's operating expense benefited from the favorable legal settlement related to the company's 401(k) plan. This resulted in us having little expense related to our 401(k) plan in fiscal 2010. For the current fiscal year, we now expect full year 401(k)-related expenses will be close to $60 million.
Other income was fairly flat for the quarter at $9 million. Interest expense declined $5 million versus the prior year to $43 million, driven primarily by the repayment of $215 million in long-term debt in March of fiscal 2010.
Moving to taxes. Our effective tax rate, 32.3%, is generally in line with the 32% we expect for the full year and is slightly higher than the 31.6% effective tax rate in the first quarter a year ago. Net income in the quarter was $298 million, up 3% from the prior year. Our diluted EPS from continuing operations was $1.10 for the quarter, an increase of 4% compared to the prior year. To wrap up our consolidated results, this quarter's diluted weighted average shares was flat year-over-year at 272 million shares. 
Let me take just a minute to explain how the accelerated share repurchase program impacted our share count this quarter. As we've previously disclosed, on May 17, we entered into an accelerated share buyback agreement to repurchase $1 billion of the company's common stock. While this had some impact on our share count this quarter, the full impact won't be felt until later this year since the agreement was only implemented midway through the June quarter. As an aside, the ASR program officially concluded this week, which was somewhat earlier than we had originally thought. Overall, on our share count, as we discussed at our Investor Day in June, we continue to expect our full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding to come in at our original guidance of 267 million.
Let's now move on to our segment results. In Distribution Solutions, overall revenue growth was 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Looking at the components, total U.S. Pharmaceuticals Distribution and Services revenue grew 2% for the quarter. As we've discussed, over the past several quarters, we do continue to see a shift from warehouse to direct revenues.
Canada revenues on a constant-currency basis grew 5% for the quarter, primarily due to market growth rates and one additional sales day. Including the favorable currency impact of 15%, Canada revenues grew 20% for the quarter.
Medical-Surgical distribution revenues were flat for the quarter at $686 million. As you recall, though, the prior year benefited from increased demand related to the H1N1 flu virus, and the current quarter benefited from two small acquisitions we made in mid-fiscal 2010. Adjusting for these two items, Medical-Surgical distribution revenues grew at about 2% this quarter.
Gross profit in the segment was up 12% to $1.1 billion for the quarter, a strong performance, with $51 million of the increase coming from the pretax antitrust settlement that we discussed earlier. Excluding the antitrust settlement, gross profit would still be up a solid 6%, resulting in a 13-basis-point improvement in gross margin. The primary driver of this profit growth in the quarter was strong growth in our generic profits.
Our Distribution Solutions operating expense was up 7% to $568 million for the quarter. This year-over-year increase is driven by the same sequential timing issues I talked about earlier for the company overall. For the full year, I would expect the increase to be more modest.
Operating margin rates for the quarter were 189 basis points versus 166 basis points in the prior-year quarter. Excluding the antitrust settlement, we are showing a four-basis-point margin improvement year-over-year in this segment. All in all, we saw a very solid start to the year in Distribution Solutions.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. Total revenues grew 2% for the quarter to $759 million. Services revenue increased 1% for the quarter, a little bit slower growth than what you've seen in the past. A modest amount of Services revenue is tied to software implementations, and the pace of these implementations has slowed due to the higher mix of the more complex enterprise revenue management and clinical software solutions. 
Software and software systems revenues of $135 million in the quarter grew 4% from a year ago. Hardware revenues were up 21% for the quarter, as this line has a fair amount of quarterly volatility. Technology Solutions gross profit declined by 7% to $325 million, which is in line with our original expectations for the quarter. As we told you back on May 3, we stepped up our investments in the latter half of fiscal 2010 in this segment in order to ensure we had the right resources to successfully implement our customers' clinical and next generation of enterprise revenue management solutions. A large majority of these investments are reflected in our gross profit results. 
I'd also remind you that our Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management solution became generally available late in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, triggering an incremental $8 million of amortization expense for the quarter. You will continue to see this impact our year-over-year gross profit growth until it is fully lapped in the third quarter of the current fiscal year. Technology Solutions operating expenses increased 6% in the quarter to $262 million. Higher expenses in this segment were driven by continued investment in research and development activities as well as the general ramp-up of investment spending we have discussed.
To be specific, Technology Solutions had total gross R&D spending of $105 million compared to $98 million in the prior year. Of these amounts, we capitalized 14% this year compared to 18% a year ago. Our operating profit in our Technology Solutions segment this quarter was $64 million, down 38% from $103 million a year ago. Operating margins were 8.43% for the quarter compared to 13.8% in the prior year, primarily due to the decline in gross profit discussed earlier and increased investment in research and development activities.
Leaving our segment performance and turning briefly to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. Our receivables increased 4% to $7.8 billion versus $7.5 billion a year ago, and our days sales outstanding were flat at 23 days. Compared to a year ago, inventories were up 9% to $9.4 billion, and payables were also up 9% to $13.3 billion. So our days sales and inventory of 33 days was up two days from a year ago, while our days sales and payables increased three days from a year ago to 46 days. These working capital metrics contributed to us generating $528 million in operating cash flow in the quarter, a good start to the year. Going forward, we continue to expect to generate approximately $1.5 billion in full year cash flow from operations.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.3 billion, down slightly from our year-end balance of $3.7 billion. Our ability to deliver consistent operating cash flows, along with our strong balance sheet, uniquely positions us to create shareholder value through the continued use of our portfolio approach to capital deployment. As part of this approach, we were pleased to launch this quarter both the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program and the 50% increase in our dividend.
Property acquisitions and capitalized software expenditures combined were essentially flat with the prior year at $87 million, and we continue to expect our capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. 
Now to conclude. Our first quarter results were solid and on track. Our guidance range remains at earnings from continuing operations of $4.72 to $4.92 per fully diluted share. For clarity, let me make just one other point about this range. As you saw in our press release, after the quarter ended, we completed the sale of our McKesson Asia-Pacific business. As a result of the sale, we will record a pretax gain in the second quarter of approximately $94 million, which we will show in the discontinued operations line. For modeling purposes, this business is primarily reflected in the services revenue line within our Technology Solutions segment and rolls up to our Payor business, with revenues running approximately $21 million per quarter and profits being insignificant. 
Also as you know, we give guidance based on our earnings from continuing operations. So this transaction and the gain on it will not have an impact on our EPS guidance range. In summary, we feel our first quarter results provide us with a solid foundation for another good year. 
Thank you for joining us this morning, and with that, I will turn the call over to the Operator for your questions. I would ask that you limit your questions to just one per person to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?"

Of course, our fully diluted share calculation, which was 272 million for the quarter, has to do that on an average daily basis and then, very importantly, add the fully diluted shares. So when you look at the number year-over-year, we, of course, have a much higher stock price, which is a very good thing. We have a much higher stock price this year than we did a year ago, so that drove a pretty significant increase in the dilution impact of options that are outstanding, and that drove the share price up a little bit. When you think about the full -- or excuse me, the number of shares outstanding used in the fully diluted calculation. When you think about the full year, I'd say we're still tracking to the original assumption that we think the full year number will be 267 million shares outstanding."

First of all, we hear some of the same rumors you hear, and sometimes, we're not involved in the activities at all. And actually, when we inquire, the companies that are purportedly for sale aren't for sale, and somebody is trying to either, on the media side, to generate a story or sometimes, potentially, bankers are trying to generate interest in a company that may not have an interest in a transaction. Secondly, sometimes there are real sales activities going on, and I think our company views anything in health care around the globe, frankly, as, at a minimum, a learning experience for us to at least view the opportunity and take a look at the financial and strategic implications of moving forward in any kind of a transaction. And I think on behalf of our shareholders, we have a responsibility to remain globally aware of what‚Äôs going on in health care. And then lastly, I'd comment that any smart banker would always have us included in a deal even if we're not, just in an effort to make sure that fair price is being paid for the asset. So I've seen occasions where we're not involved in a deal or we‚Äôve long since moved on in our minds, but yet we're still purportedly involved heavily at the final stages of negotiation for whatever reasons that you guys could dream up. So thinking in a broader context, what would we look at and actually want to buy? As I've mentioned in the past, we don't necessarily feel constrained, necessarily, geographically or even size-related. We feel more constrained about whether or not it makes financial sense, and it makes it through that gate and that hurdle, then we can actually create value for our shareholders, both with and without synergies and what is our dependence on synergies, what is our likely probability of realizing those synergies. And then if we get past those financial gates, then the question is sort of the strategic implications of making those moves. As Jeff mentioned in his comments, we do believe a portfolio approach to capital deployment is the best way to create value. We plan to continue that approach. You‚Äôve seen evidence of the share repurchases and the dividend increase recently. On the acquisition front, we've not been very active in the last 18 months, and primarily due to valuations, many of the assets that we think might make sense for us strategically, as I said, don't make it through the first gate. And lastly, I'd say you see tremendous evidence of our discipline, both in terms of our performance from an acquisition perspective retrospectively, but also in our ability to sell assets that we might feel are valuable to us and meet the needs of our strategy. But frankly, we can't produce the same financial result over a long-term view that we could realize on a DCF basis very quickly. And so Jeff talked once again about the amount of, I think, tremendous cash flow we've generated from a company that was well run and strategic to us. But frankly, we were offered a price that made sense for us to stop and listen, and we executed the transaction. So I think that discipline and that lack of sort of being married to being global or not being global, having an asset or not having an asset and thinking about it in a more analytical context will drive value for our shareholders, and it demonstrates our discipline."

As both Jeff and I mentioned, we are concerned with changes to reimbursement in Canada, especially if it happens all at once. But our job is to mitigate those changes, both at the government level, to make sure we‚Äôre negotiating to make sure that we maintain our profit stream. Because out of all of the people that are affected from a generic perspective, we have the least amount of margin rate and, therefore, can make the argument that we provide great utility value and our profit structure should be protected. So mitigation strategies are always part of our overall approach. And I think from a materiality perspective, we said that the changes we might experience this year are clearly, we believe, captured in the boundaries of our guidance. So albeit we admit that there's a negative here relative to generic reimbursement in Canada, we believe it's manageable.

Our development work right now is to make sure that our product continues to have the components necessary as defined by meaningful use and that we have the implementation and installation people on hand to make that happen. Now turning to doctor offices, we are not really seeing an acceleration in buying at that level. So when I talk about our booking strength in clinical products, frankly, we have a large footprint in physician offices, so I don't think we're losing any share to others. I would just comment that I don't think those doctor offices are yet focused on their requirement from an EHR perspective. So we're seeing a little bit of it in the hospital-related doctors. So when physicians are purchased by hospitals, that idea of getting them up on EHR's and integrating them with the McKesson inpatient products is important to them, but standalone documents, frankly, are still on the sidelines."

So they come to us with a built-in premium, and you'll even see sometimes the sell-side reports say, ‚ÄúWell, the stability in this stock will be held up. Even though their performance is waning, the stability will be held up, because they're going to be bought if they drop too low.‚Äù Well, that obviously feeds that view that they have a floor on their PEs or a floor on their valuations that is driven by performance when, in fact, the floor is driven by the optics of us coming in to buy.

And so I think the symbiotic relationship between retail and wholesalers are actually reinforced when the market gets difficult, because we just do a terrific job of delivering value. As it relates specifically to a weakness at the storefront level or the outbound sales level, we do see that in our revenue line. So clearly, when our largest customers begin to tail off from a revenue perspective or if they lose market share, frankly, that's a direct reflection back into our business.

I think it is a complex question, and we only see a sample of the physician offices. We do have many businesses, though, that are involved in physician offices, which might give us a different view or, certainly, maybe a better view than others might have. As you know, we have a transaction processing business that brings the actual visit itself between the physician and the payor. From a reimbursement-cycle perspective, we get to see those transactions. So we do see frequency and we do see sort of the load on the doctors. We also see some people buying software at the physician office level, and then clearly, our footprint in Medical-Surgical, where we‚Äôre actually selling to the alternate site, in particular to the doctor offices, we get to see volume and have discussions with physicians at that level. So I do think we believe doc visits are down, and as a result there will be some moderation of the use of medical supplies and perhaps also a moderation in the amount of scrips being written. But I would say that we still believe that the scrip volume levels are okay. We're not seeing a step function change in scrip volumes. But once again, we are focused, really, on the pull-through in our business and what product is pulled through. So if scrip volumes are off with our customers because they‚Äôre losing share, that's a problem for us. If our scrip volumes are off with them in a branded way, but more is being converted to generics, we can have a little scrip volume degradation on brand if we have a scrip volume conversion increase on generics. From a financial perspective, that's a pretty good trade for us. It's an offset. So I think that there is some correlation, obviously, over time, but our models are slightly different than what a retailer might experience right at the counter."

That wouldn't be the case in, certainly, 100% of our clinical relationships. So the most important thing for us, regaining momentum in the back half of this year, is a combination of decreasing our investment in some of these areas from kind of a ramp-up perspective, but also, and perhaps most importantly, beginning to recognize revenue through the successful implementation. And another dependence, obviously, is our customers' ability to ramp up their resources to make those implementations successful.

I think that's our view. As we've talked about in the past, there's a large transaction-processing business in there that is more of a software-as-a-service kind of model, where we get continued revenue. And that business certainly can grow nicely, but it is a steady grower. We also have our Payor business, which in the past, actually, has had some lumpy revenue characteristics with it. But that also is a strong part of our business. And then, as we‚Äôve described, at our McKesson Provider Technologies is actually multiple businesses. We have our Medical Imaging business, we have our Legacy Financial Systems businesses, we have an Automation business.

Let me start by saying that I'm pleased overall with our company's results for the second quarter and the first half of our fiscal 2011. This quarter, we achieved total company revenues",1529,"Thanks, Ana, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today. Let me start by saying that I'm pleased overall with our company's results for the second quarter and the first half of our fiscal 2011. This quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $27.5 billion and fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.3, excluding adjustments to the litigation reserves. 
Let me quickly highlight three items that impacted our financial statements this quarter. As we announced on October 19, we reached an agreement to settle an action filed by the state of Connecticut relating to First Databank's published drug reimbursement benchmarks, which are commonly referred to as Average Wholesale Prices. The settlement resulted in an after-tax charge of $0.06 per diluted share. 
This agreement includes an expressed denial of liability, and as we've consistently stated and continue to believe, this case is without merit because McKesson does not and never did set PWPs. We will continue to work our way through the remaining public entity matters, and our goal is to resolve them in a reasonable manner that is in the best interest of our shareholders. 
This quarter, we're pleased to complete the sale of our McKesson Asia Pacific business. And as a result, we recorded an after-tax gain of $0.28 per diluted share. The sale of this business is a great example of our ability to create shareholder value. And lastly, we recorded a noncash, pre-tax asset impairment charge of $72 million related to our revenue cycle management product, Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management. Both Jeff and I will discuss this in more detail on this call.
Looking beyond the asset impairment charge, our results were strong for the company as a whole, particularly for Distribution Solutions and there's a lot to like about our second quarter results. Additionally, during the first six month of our fiscal year, we made significant progress deploying capital, including fully using the $1.5 billion available on our share repurchase authorization and increasing our dividend. Based on the operational momentum in our business and the results of our share repurchase activity, we are maintaining our fiscal 2011 guidance range of $4.72 to $4.92 per diluted share from continuing operations, excluding adjustments to the litigation reserve. 
Let me highlight the second quarter trends in both segments. In Distribution Solutions, we had a strong double-digit growth and operating profit, with margins expanding an impressive 25 basis points. U.S. Pharmaceutical, Canada, Medical-Surgical and Specialty Care Solutions all contributed to that outstanding performance. Our market leading generics offering filled much of the margin expansion in the second quarter. Over the years, we built solutions based on the differing needs of our customers, and we've been very successful at demonstrating the value of our generics offering to our customer base. 
In addition, we use a global sourcing approach to the procurement of generics, with coordinated purchasing across the various businesses and geographies at McKesson. This maximizes efficiencies and optimizes the value we deliver to our customers. With a favorable generics launch schedule and our comprehensive offering, we anticipate continued profit growth in generics for fiscal 2011 and beyond. 
Our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution business is performing at an exceptionally high level. We continue to benefit from our long-standing relationships with branded manufacturers, delivering great value to them and earning steady levels of compensation in return.
Again, this quarter, U.S. Pharmaceutical's results benefited greatly from generics. Sales of generics through our proprietary program, OneStop, grew 21% due to the steady pace of launches and a high degree of compliance that our customers have with our value-added programs. Generics have also been very beneficial to our Specialty Care Solutions business, and we expect that trend to continue for the remainder of this fiscal year. 
We have been talking a lot about oxaliplatin for the past year, and we are still benefiting from this generic drug with sufficient inventory that last through the end of our fiscal year. In addition, we are now increasingly optimistic about two other specialty generic introductions, so we expect another outstanding contribution this year from our Specialty business.
Our Medical-Surgical revenues grew 5% in the second quarter. We remain focused on delivering value to our Medical-Surgical customers by optimizing outsourcing of the McKesson brand, where we deliver high quality, private label products at great savings. In addition, we continue to drive leverage through aggressive cost management. Combined, these initiatives are resulting in margin expansion. 
Our Canadian Distribution business had solid performance in the second quarter. Revenues had been impacted by price reductions on generic drugs, driven by changes in public policy in certain provinces during the year, as well as the launch of the generic version of Lipitor, which happened in May of this year. The team has done an outstanding job to offset these challenges and deliver solid results this quarter. 
In our Canadian business, we have a comprehensive set of solutions and leading physicians in every market segment. It is still our expectation that will work through the public policy changes in Canada with only modest financial impact that we can manage within our guidance range for this fiscal year. We are still evaluating the longer term impact of the changes and our responses to them.
I'm pleased with the second quarter results in Distribution Solutions. We have a terrific combination of assets and a seasoned leadership team that performs exceptionally well. I have great confidence in our full year performance. 
Turning now to Technology Solutions. Setting aside the asset impairment charge for Horizon ERM that I mentioned earlier, let me point out that as expected, our first half results are down quite significantly versus prior year. For the full year, we still expect modest operating margin improvement, heavily weighted to the back half. While this quarter's results are in line with our expectations, they are certainly not indicative of what we expect from this business long term.
Now let me come back to Horizon ERM. This is McKesson's next-generation revenue cycle management solution that we designed to improve the economics of patient care for our hospital customers. Revenue cycle management products must keep pace with the changes in health care because the environment is only going to become more complex. Horizon ERM is one of the most functionally rich solutions available to hospitals. Given all of the changes that RO is driving and the rapidly changing needs and priorities of our customers, we are continuing our product development efforts on Horizon ERM.
Over the past few quarters, we have been focused on improving our customer and quality focused by strategically prioritizing our investments and delivering integrated solutions that enable greater customer success. We've also ramped up our Six Sigma efforts to prioritize opportunities for process enhancements, including streamlining our product focus and improving speed of installations.
We continue to make organizational changes that will further our efforts to provide integrated offerings and a greater focus on customer success. We are now combining our Horizon clinical and revenue cycle groups to form a new organization known as Health Systems Enterprise Solutions, which will be lead by Rod O'Reilly, reporting to Dave Souerwine. Rod has been running our very successful Medical Imaging Group for some time. He's got a great track record of innovation, execution and collaboration. And I know many of you on the call know Rod personally. The integration of the clinical and financial systems has become increasingly important for our customers who must demonstrate not only the clinical quality of care they provide, but also the costs associated with that care.
We are always committed to supporting our customers, and in particular with their current priority, clinical implementations as they navigate the RO requirements and the changing healthcare environment. We are increasingly confident in our clinical products and the value they would bring to our customers. We have confirmed test dates for most of our EHR products starting to mid-November, and we expect to achieve certification shortly after testing is complete. We are pleased to report that one of the first products we submitted for testing, our RelayHealth platform, which is a Software as a Service offering, received the modular certification this week.
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I want to spend a moment on capital deployment. In addition to the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program we completed in July, we subsequently repurchased $531 million in stock during our second fiscal quarter, fully using our authorization. Today, the board approved a new $1 billion authorization. 
Along with our increase in the dividend earlier this fiscal year, the share repurchase activity demonstrates our confidence in our business and in our future cash flow generation. We continue to target a portfolio approach to capital deployment, which would also include acquisitions. You should feel confident that we intend to continue deploying our capital wisely and strategically. 
In summary, we are seeing solid overall performance, and our strong balance sheet and tremendous cash provides us with many growth opportunities. I believe we are well positioned for continued success. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, and we will return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?"
288195,114141372,81945,"McKesson Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","McKesson Corporation","Executives","Well, thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Our overall second quarter results reflect the solid performance at this halfway point fiscal year.

Our overall second quarter results reflect the solid performance at this halfway point fiscal year. We're showing operational results in Distribution Solutions above our initial expectations coming into the year. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we're pleased with our progress on capital deployment. 
Our Technology segment performance, while weak for the quarter, was in line with our expectations other than the asset impairment charge, which I'll explain in more detail in a few moments. We continue to expect a strong finish to the year and remain committed to enhancing shareholder value through a measured and thoughtful capital deployment approach. 
Before I begin reviewing our financial performance, let me start by pointing out that we completed the sale of our McKesson Asia Pacific business this quarter. The $0.28 after-tax gain on sale is recorded as a discontinued operation. And as you know, we focused on our results from continuing operations. 
Therefore, my discussion today will focus on our $1.3 EPS from continuing operations, which also excludes the impact of the $0.06 AWP litigation charge this quarter. It is important to note, however, that this $1.3 EPS that we'll focus on does include the asset impairment charge of approximately $0.18. With this background, as always, I'll begin with a review of our consolidated results and then provide additional color when I discuss each of the segments in more detail. 
Revenues for the quarter grew 1%  to $27.5 billion from $27.1 billion a year ago, and total gross profit increased 2% from the prior year. Outstanding gross profit growth in Distribution Solutions were somewhat offset by the asset impairment charge in Technology Solutions, which was recorded in the cost of sales. Excluding the asset impairment charge, overall gross profit would have increased 8% for the quarter versus last year.
Moving below the gross profit line. Our total operating expenses are up 4% to $925 million for the quarter. For the full year, I would continue to expect our operating expense growth to be more modest than this 4% as our back half results will face easier year-over-year comparisons.
Other income was relatively flat year-over-year, while interest expense declined 6% to $44 million for the quarter. Interest expense has been favorably impacted this fiscal year, primarily due to the repayment of $215 million in long-term debt in March of fiscal 2010.
Moving now to taxes. We have raised our full year estimate of tax run rate from 32% to 33%, primarily driven by a change in our domestic foreign business mix. As a reminder, last year's second quarter's tax run rate was 32%, and we benefited from $13 million of favorable discrete items, equating to about $0.05 per diluted share. 
Net income for the quarter was $271 million, and our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the litigation charge, was $1.3, which, as a reminder, includes the approximate $0.18 asset impairment charge. To wrap up our consolidated results, this year's EPS number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases, which lowered our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year to 262 million shares for the quarter. 
Earlier, you heard John talk about our year-to-date fiscal 2011 share repurchases of over $1.5 billion. Taking this into account, we now expect that our full year average diluted share count will come in a bit below the original guidance assumption, 267 million shares outstanding.
Let's now move on to our segment results. In Distribution Solutions, total revenues grew 2% in the quarter to $26.8 billion. Looking at the components, our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues increased 1% versus the prior year, with direct revenues up 6% and warehouse revenues down 15% for the quarter. 
The warehouse revenue decline, when adjusted for shifts of customer business to direct-store delivery, was something closer to 10% to 11%, which is still a significant decrease. Drivers of this decline were brand-to-generic conversions, which particularly impacts our warehouse revenues as well as some of our customers' business losses.
However, when you look at direct distribution revenue, which is our most profitable revenue stream, we're pleased with the good growth we showed. After adjustments for shifts from warehouse to direct distribution, we grew direct revenues by 4% to 5%. Importantly, I'd remind you that we typically make lower margins on our warehouse revenues relative to the margins on our direct revenues. 
So to sum up, while our total revenue growth may look low, it was driven by trends that allowed us to, in fact, significantly grow our gross profits this quarter. We've been saying for a while now that it is important to focus more on gross profit rather than revenue, and this quarter's results really exemplify the strength.
Moving on to Canada. On a constant currency basis, revenues declined 1% for the quarter. Including a favorable currency impact, Canadian revenues increased 4% versus the prior year. The combined effect of government-imposed price reductions on generic drugs and the launch of generic Lipitor in Canada resulted in about a 5% decrease to revenues. 
Medical-Surgical revenues were up 5% for the quarter to $770 million. In addition to a solid performance from our core business, we have also seen earlier sales of flu vaccine this year, which essentially offset the large amount of revenue from flu test kits that we shipped in the prior year.
Gross profit for the segment was up 14% to $1.1 billion. On 2% revenue growth, this represents a nice improvement in gross margin of 43 basis points versus the prior year. The increase in gross profit for the quarter was primarily due to strong growth in our generics profit and the timing of the compensation we received from branded manufacturers. 
Distribution Solutions' operating expense increased 5% to $574 million for the full year, similar to our expectations for the overall company. I would expect our growth and expenses to be more modest. Operating margin rates for the quarter were 192 basis points, an impressive increase of 34 basis points versus the prior year. 
Given the quarterly volatility in this segment, we always focus on full year margins. In this context, based on our strong first half performance in this segment, we now expect our full year fiscal 2011 operating margin to be within the range of our prior-year GAAP operating margin of 188 basis points. Now we're very pleased with this forecast. As I remind you, the prior year benefited from the positive impact of our efforts around H1N1, making it a particularly difficult benchmark to match this year.
Turning to Technology Solutions. Let me start by talking about the $72 million noncash, pre-tax asset impairment charge, which is approximately $0.18 after-tax based on our effective tax rate. 
Here at McKesson, we amortize our capitalized software over three years. As you recall, we began amortizing our Horizon ERM product late in the second quarter of our fiscal 2010, and it has been running approximately $8 million of expense per quarter. We do a calculation each quarter comparing the unamortized capitalized software costs to the projected net revenues during the remaining amortization period. Based on our most recent evaluation, the net revenues we foresee in the remaining 24-month amortization period were not sufficient to recover the unamortized costs, which resulted in the asset impairment charge. We remain committed to the product and would expect to expense most of our future development costs.
Now turning to the rest of the segment results. Total revenues were down 3% from the prior year to $770 million. Part of this result was driven by the sale of our McKesson Asia Pacific business. While the profits from this business were financially insignificant, it did contribute approximately $17 million in revenues in last year's second quarter. We will continue to see the McKesson Asia Pacific revenues impact our year-over-year revenue results in the services line of our P&L through the first quarter of fiscal 2012. 
Also, as a reminder, the prior year was favorably impacted by the recognition of $22 million of previously deferred revenues. Majority of these deferred revenues were associated with ancillary products included as part of a bundled purchase, and were triggered when our Horizon ERM solution became generally available late in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. So adjusting for these two items, you'd see revenue growth of about 3% this quarter.
Moving on from revenues. Excluding the asset impairment charge, Technology Solutions' gross profit declined 7% to $348 million for the quarter. Contributing to this year-over-year result is the prior-year deferred revenue recognition, which had equated to $16 million in gross profit. 
Operating expense increased just 1% in the quarter to  $263 million. We had total gross R&D spending of $107 million compared to $102 million in the prior year. This is a demonstration of our continued commitment to developing our products for our customers. Of this amount, we capitalized 16% compared to 20% a year ago. Our Technology Solutions' operating profit was down 26% versus a year ago to $86 million, excluding the asset impairment charge.
To summarize, excluding the asset impairment charge, the overall Technology Solution results, while weak, were in line with our original expectations. We continue to expect a stronger back-half performance from Technology Solutions this fiscal year and modest improvement in the full year operating margin rate, excluding the asset impairment charge. 
Leaving our segment performance now and turning to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. Our receivables were $8.2 billion, which is up from the prior year balance of $7.8 billion and our days sales outstanding increased by one day to 24 days. Inventories increased 2% to $8.8 billion, while our payables increased 1% to $12.8 billion. This resulted in our days sales and inventory remaining flat at 30 days, and our days sales and payables remaining flat from the prior year at 44 days. 
These relatively stable working capital metrics resulted in McKesson generating $798 million in operating cash flow year-to-date. Based on the start to the year, we now expect to generate a bit more than our original expectation of $1.5 billion in full year cash flow from operations in fiscal 2011.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.1 billion, down slightly from our first quarter balance of $3.3 billion. Our great financial flexibility provides us good opportunity to continue our portfolio capital deployment strategies. Capitalized spending was $182 million for the first six months of the fiscal year, and we continue to expect full year capitalized spending between $400 million and  $450 million. 
And the last, let me turn to our outlook. Our guidance range remains at earnings from continuing operations of $4.72 to $4.92 for fully diluted share excluding litigation charges. What this means is that we have absorbed in our range both the $72 million pre-tax asset impairment charge and the related increase in our full year tax rate assumption from 32% to 33%. These two items are significant hurdles, but we can see a pathway to achieving our original guidance range due to the outstanding performance thus far in Distribution Solutions, our expectation of a stronger back half in Technology Solutions and our lower full year share count assumption. 
One other point about the rest of the year, keeping in mind that we don't routinely provide quarterly EPS guidance. Sitting here today, we anticipate our fourth quarter to be unusually strong this fiscal year, both measured by its growth year-over-year and as a percentage of our overall earnings for the full year. Given the timing shifts in some of the economics we have with branded and generic manufacturers, we can directionally estimate that our December quarter EPS will be more in the range of our first and second quarters.
In closing, we're pleased with the overall performance across McKesson, and we believe our financial flexibility positions us well for future capital deployment. Thanks, and with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I would ask that you limit your questions to just one per person to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?"

Clearly, there's an infrastructure cost that our customers can deleverage. And as I mentioned, we have a great portfolio of products where we do a terrific job of buying them. I think it probably is a stretch to think about the very largest customers buying their generics from us because they're very sophisticated in their own buying. But on occasion, we do sell generics to them, particularly when their own supply is not available to them. And we do see some revenue impact when our large chain customers buying a brand from us. And when it goes generic, they buy the generic on their own. But frankly, our margin structure and a lot of those relationships, particularly on the warehousing side, is so low that even if we lose the revenues, it's not a significant impact to us.

And we're gaining in all three of those areas. We also, as John talked about, continue to we create growth in some of our private brand efforts, which is helping us in the Canadian environment.

Perhaps not in the acquisition quarter because of one-time related issues, but certainly over time, it has to make sense. And we have to get a return for our investors that is superior to other alternatives that we might be evaluating, including the safer versions of share repurchases and dividends. It has to have a strategic sense for us. It has to be something that we know and understand and can build upon and we can grow and leverage. And hopefully, there are synergies that can be captured that our shareholders wouldn't be able to capture on their own if they purchase the asset on their own, particularly if it was a public company and they're holding it that way. So I think those are the big buckets. I don't feel like we're particularly constrained on our view of which segments we would buy into. And I don't think we're particularly constrained on geographic preferences. I don't think we're particular constrained on the size of the deal as long as you can kind of fit in those three broad sweeping categories. And we, frankly, are evaluating acquisitions all the time and have been for as long as I've been here. So you will hear from time-to-time that we're looking at something, and then you'll either hear that nobody bought it or it was never for sale or somebody else bought. But just because we're involved in evaluating transactions, it doesn't mean that we're always going to end up with the target in the end. So I think it's an ongoing process. I think we've got a skilled team with a proven track record of being able to pick the right targets, integrate them appropriately and get the value for our shareholders. And clearly, as was discussed earlier on this call, things like Oncology Therapeutics Network, OTN, which was a drag on us, I think, for almost two years, as I recall, we told you it was going to be dilutive upfront and it was going to be very beneficial for our shareholders over the longer haul. Frankly, it positioned us extremely well in a very high-growth sector in specialty and oncology, and we're really pleased we have that asset. So it may not be apparent always upfront.

And also, Lisa, I might just mention it. It's clear that when we don't have acquisitions in front of us, we're not afraid to do share repurchases, and we've done over $1.5 billion this year.

And our systems business in acute care is really not affected by patient demand levels. So we see very little -- we don't track data related to admissions in hospitals or surgery procedures in hospitals because the sale of our product in the hospital marketplace, the system sale, is not really related to that. It's more driven by the need to upgrade their systems or they'd become our compliant, et cetera. On the nonhospital business where we are strong, physician offices, home care, long-term care and emergency centers, emerging care centers, those kinds of things, surgery centers, we have seen relatively flat demand. But I think our team has done a particularly good job of continuing to expand our footprint, not only within our existing customers like selling through our private label product, but also expanding beyond our existing customer base and probably taking a share, in particular, in home care, where we've got a very good presence. So I think we are continuing to see our ability to grow revenue in Medical-Surgical as evidenced by the 5% growth this quarter, and we hope those trends will continue.

If you look out over the next two years, the remainder of the amortization period, we certainly had an original plan to sell and implement sufficient customers to justify the asset that we had on the balance sheet. What's really happened is that our customers in there, complete focus on clinicals, have not just stopped buying things for now other than clinical, but they've also pushed out implementations and stop implementing. You combine that with the fact that as we look at the way the environment and requirements to what this product needs to do has evolve, we also, frankly, decided that given what was going on with our customers, it made sense for us to step back, and frankly, focus on finishing out the development of this product to meet all the new and latest requirements. That's going to take us a number of quarters. And as we do that, we're going to aim for those few customers that want to implement. We're going to push some of those implementations out. The combination of all those things is what pushed the revenues out beyond the remaining amortization period. I think it's important to realize though that these products, these kinds of products are products that should have usable life spans of 10, 20, 25 years. So there's this accounting convention where we need to look at the next three years. But our full expectation and hope here is that we're building the next equivalent of some of our legacy revenue cycle product, which we still have happy customers running 20, 30 years after they put them in.

I'll attempt to answer the question. I think that the discussion that we've been having around Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management is isolated to hospital financial systems, and it's not a commentary on the rest of our software or physician software, even Horizon Clinicals. It really is the hospital market place saying to us -- our customer base where we would naturally go to sell these enterprise revenue management products, our customers are saying to us, ""We're happy running that 20-year-old to 30-year-old software we bought from you 20 or 30 years ago."" And our priority is 
to is to get you clinical systems installed and to make sure we purchase the right systems and we get to our meaningful use and be able to document that from a regulatory and a compliance perspective to get the stimulus dollars that the industry is chasing. I don't believe that Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management that we are losing any hospital customers or potential customers to competing systems. Once again, I'm really talking about our existing customer base was the natural place to sell this product and those customers are largely looking to build out McKesson solutions as opposed to taking out McKesson solutions. That's not to say that we, on occasion, don't lose a  customer. And it's not to say that we haven't lost a clinical customer or a financial customer. I'm just talking about enterprise revenue management, and the revenue issues we have in that product really are not product-based as much as they are market-based. And then I believe competitive market since our customers' interest has gone to a different direction. As it relates to the overall portfolio and we think about financial systems that our customers are buying, frankly, they're not replacing their old legacy HIS systems. They are buying some what we call the bolt-on products on occasion to augment the systems that they already have deployed. And in fact, RelayHealth is selling many of those products. Some of them delivered Software as a Service where they can easily augment the functionality of existing McKesson STAR systems with Relay Software as a Service applications, where they're able to get a quick return on investment. And so when they see a quick return on investment and something they could put into the system very quickly and make use of if they're doing it, but they're not going to undertake, at least in this near-term environment, a complete redo of their financial systems in these hospitals when they're busy with clinical implementations. Does that answer your question, Eric?"

And again, we do that once a year, and then pull it out to that balance sheet item. So the number that's on the balance sheet is not huge. It's a part of what needs to happen and what will get recognized in the December-March quarter. But it's not the majority piece. The majority of it is just things that are not on the balance sheet today and will get recognize as we hit milestones."

Let me start by saying that I'm pleased overall with our company's results for the second quarter and the first half of our fiscal 2011. This quarter, we achieved total company revenues",1526,"Thanks, Ana, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today. Let me start by saying that I'm pleased overall with our company's results for the second quarter and the first half of our fiscal 2011. This quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $27.5 billion and fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.3, excluding adjustments to the litigation reserves.
Let me quickly highlight three items that impacted our financial statements this quarter. As we announced on October 19, we reached an agreement to settle an action filed by the state of Connecticut relating to First Databank's published drug reimbursement benchmarks, which are commonly referred to as Average Wholesale Prices. The settlement resulted in an after-tax charge of $0.06 per diluted share.
This agreement includes an expressed denial of liability, and as we've consistently stated and continue to believe, this case is without merit because McKesson does not and never did set AWPs. We will continue to work our way through the remaining public entity matters, and our goal is to resolve them in a reasonable manner that is in the best interest of our shareholders.
This quarter, we're pleased to complete the sale of our McKesson Asia Pacific business. And as a result, we recorded an after-tax gain of $0.28 per diluted share. The sale of this business is a great example of our ability to create shareholder value. And lastly, we recorded a noncash, pre-tax asset impairment charge of $72 million related to our revenue cycle management product, Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management. Both Jeff and I will discuss this in more detail on this call.
Looking beyond the asset impairment charge, our results were strong for the company as a whole, particularly for Distribution Solutions and there's a lot to like about our second quarter results. Additionally, during the first six month of our fiscal year, we made significant progress deploying capital including fully using the $1.5 billion available on our share repurchase authorization and increasing our dividend. Based on the operational momentum in our business and the results of our share repurchase activity, we are maintaining our fiscal 2011 guidance range of $4.72 to $4.92 per diluted share from continuing operations, excluding adjustments to the litigation reserve.
Let me highlight the second quarter trends in both segments. In Distribution Solutions, we had a strong double-digit growth and operating profit, with margins expanding an impressive 25 basis points. U.S. Pharmaceutical, Canada, Medical-Surgical and Specialty Care Solutions all contributed to that outstanding performance. Our market leading generics offering fueled much of the margin expansion in the second quarter. Over the years, we built solutions based on the differing needs of our customers, and we've been very successful at demonstrating the value of our generics offering to our customer base.
In addition, we use a global sourcing approach to the procurement of generics, with coordinated purchasing across the various businesses and geographies at McKesson. This maximizes efficiencies and optimizes the value we deliver to our customers. With a favorable generics launch schedule and our comprehensive offering, we anticipate continued profit growth in generics for fiscal 2011 and beyond.
Our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution business is performing at an exceptionally high level. We continue to benefit from our long-standing relationships with branded manufacturers, delivering great value to them and earning steady levels of compensation in return.
Again, this quarter, U.S. Pharmaceutical's results benefited greatly from generics. Sales of generics through our proprietary program, OneStop, grew 21% due to the steady pace of launches and a high degree of compliance that our customers have with our value-added programs. Generics have also been very beneficial to our Specialty Care Solutions business, and we expect that trend to continue for the remainder of this fiscal year.
We have been talking a lot about oxaliplatin for the past year, and we are still benefiting from this generic drug with sufficient inventory that last through the end of our fiscal year. In addition, we are now increasingly optimistic about two other specialty generic introductions, so we expect another outstanding contribution this year from our Specialty business.
Our Medical-Surgical revenues grew 5% in the second quarter. We remain focused on delivering value to our Medical-Surgical customers by optimizing outsourcing of the McKesson brand, where we deliver high quality, private label products at great savings. In addition, we continue to drive leverage through aggressive cost management. Combined, these initiatives are resulting in margin expansion.
Our Canadian Distribution business had solid performance in the second quarter. Revenues had been impacted by price reductions on generic drugs, driven by changes in public policy in certain provinces during the year, as well as the launch of the generic version of Lipitor, which happened in May of this year. The team has done an outstanding job to offset these challenges and deliver solid results this quarter.
In our Canadian business, we have a comprehensive set of solutions and leading physicians in every market segment. It is still our expectation that will work through the public policy changes in Canada with only modest financial impact that we can manage within our guidance range for this fiscal year. We are still evaluating the longer term impact of the changes and our responses to them.
I'm pleased with the second quarter results in Distribution Solutions. We have a terrific combination of assets and a seasoned leadership team that performs exceptionally well. I have great confidence in our full year performance.
Turning now to Technology Solutions. Setting aside the asset impairment charge for Horizon ERM that I mentioned earlier, let me point out that as expected, our first half results are down quite significantly versus prior year. For the full year, we still expect modest operating margin improvement, heavily weighted to the back half. While this quarter's results are in line with our expectations, they are certainly not indicative of what we expect from this business long term.
Now let me come back to Horizon ERM. This is McKesson's next-generation revenue cycle management solution that we designed to improve the economics of patient care for our hospital customers. Revenue cycle management products must keep pace with the changes in health care because the environment is only going to become more complex. Horizon ERM is one of the most functionally rich solutions available to hospitals. Given all of the changes that RO is driving and the rapidly changing needs and priorities of our customers, we are continuing our product development efforts on Horizon ERM.
Over the past few quarters, we have been focused on improving our customer and quality focused by strategically prioritizing our investments and delivering integrated solutions that enable greater customer success. We've also ramped up our Six Sigma efforts to prioritize opportunities for process enhancements, including streamlining our product focus and improving speed of installations.
We continue to make organizational changes that will further our efforts to provide integrated offerings and a greater focus on customer success. We are now combining our Horizon clinical and revenue cycle groups to form a new organization known as Health Systems Enterprise Solutions, which will be lead by Rod O'Reilly, reporting to Dave Souerwine. Rod has been running our very successful Medical Imaging Group for some time. He's got a great track record of innovation, execution and collaboration. And I know many of you on the call know Rod personally. The integration of the clinical and financial systems has become increasingly important for our customers who must demonstrate not only the clinical quality of care they provide, but also the costs associated with that care.
We are always committed to supporting our customers, and in particular with their current priority, clinical implementations as they navigate the RO requirements and the changing healthcare environment. We are increasingly confident in our clinical products and the value they would bring to our customers. We have confirmed test dates for most of our EHR products starting to mid-November, and we expect to achieve certification shortly after testing is complete. We are pleased to report that one of the first products we submitted for testing, our RelayHealth platform, which is a Software-as-a-Service offering, received the modular certification this week.
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I want to spend a moment on capital deployment. In addition to the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program we completed in July, we subsequently repurchased $531 million in stock during our second fiscal quarter, fully using our authorization. Today, the board approved a new $1 billion authorization.
Along with our increase in the dividend earlier this fiscal year, the share repurchase activity demonstrates our confidence in our business and in our future cash flow generation. We continue to target a portfolio approach to capital deployment, which would also include acquisitions. You should feel confident that we intend to continue deploying our capital wisely and strategically.
In summary, we are seeing solid overall performance, and our strong balance sheet and tremendous cash provides us with many growth opportunities. I believe we are well positioned for continued success.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, and we will return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?"

Our overall second quarter results reflect the solid performance at this halfway point fiscal year.

Our overall second quarter results reflect the solid performance at this halfway point fiscal year. We're showing operational results in Distribution Solutions above our initial expectations coming into the year. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we're pleased with our progress on capital deployment.
Our Technology segment performance, while weak for the quarter, was in line with our expectations other than the asset impairment charge, which I'll explain in more detail in a few moments. We continue to expect a strong finish to the year and remain committed to enhancing shareholder value through a measured and thoughtful capital deployment approach.
Before I begin reviewing our financial performance, let me start by pointing out that we completed the sale of our McKesson Asia Pacific business this quarter. The $0.28 after-tax gain on sale is recorded as a discontinued operation. And as you know, we focus on our results from continuing operations.
Therefore, my discussion today will focus on our $1.3 EPS from continuing operations, which also excludes the impact of the $0.06 AWP litigation charge this quarter. It is important to note, however, that this $1.3 EPS that we'll focus on does include the asset impairment charge of approximately $0.18. With this background, as always, I'll begin with a review of our consolidated results and then provide additional color when I discuss each of the segments in more detail.
Revenues for the quarter grew 1% to $27.5 billion from $27.1 billion a year ago, and total gross profit increased 2% from the prior year. Outstanding gross profit growth in Distribution Solutions were somewhat offset by the asset impairment charge in Technology Solutions, which was recorded in the cost of sales. Excluding the asset impairment charge, overall gross profit would have increased 8% for the quarter versus last year.
Moving below the gross profit line. Our total operating expenses are up 4% to $925 million for the quarter. For the full year, I would continue to expect our operating expense growth to be more modest than this 4% as our back half results will face easier year-over-year comparisons.
Other income was relatively flat year-over-year, while interest expense declined 6% to $44 million for the quarter. Interest expense has been favorably impacted this fiscal year, primarily due to the repayment of $215 million in long-term debt in March of fiscal 2010.
Moving now to taxes. We have raised our full year estimate of the tax run rate from 32% to 33%, primarily driven by a change in our domestic foreign business mix. As a reminder, last year's second quarter's tax run rate was 32%, and we benefited from $13 million of favorable discrete items, equating to about $0.05 per diluted share.
Net income for the quarter was $271 million, and our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the litigation charge, was $1.3, which, as a reminder, includes the approximate $0.18 asset impairment charge. To wrap up our consolidated results, this year's EPS number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases, which lowered our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year to 262 million shares for the quarter.
Earlier, you heard John talk about our year-to-date fiscal 2011 share repurchases of over $1.5 billion. Taking this into account, we now expect that our full year average diluted share count will come in a bit below the original guidance assumption, 267 million shares outstanding.
Let's now move on to our segment results. In Distribution Solutions, total revenues grew 2% in the quarter to $26.8 billion. Looking at the components, our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues increased 1% versus the prior year, with direct revenues up 6% and warehouse revenues down 15% for the quarter.
The warehouse revenue decline, when adjusted for shifts of customer business to direct-store delivery, was something closer to 10% to 11%, which is still a significant decrease. Drivers of this decline were brand-to-generic conversions, which particularly impacts our warehouse revenues as well as some of our customers' business losses.
However, when you look at direct distribution revenue, which is our most profitable revenue stream, we're pleased with the good growth we showed. After adjustments for shifts from warehouse to direct distribution, we grew direct revenues by 4% to 5%. Importantly, I'd remind you that we typically make lower margins on our warehouse revenues relative to the margins on our direct revenues.
So to sum up, while our total revenue growth may look low, it was driven by trends that allowed us to, in fact, significantly grow our gross profits this quarter. We've been saying for a while now that it is important to focus more on gross profit rather than revenue, and this quarter's results really exemplify the strength.
Moving on to Canada. On a constant currency basis, revenues declined 1% for the quarter. Including a favorable currency impact, Canadian revenues increased 4% versus the prior year. The combined effect of government-imposed price reductions on generic drugs and the launch of generic Lipitor in Canada resulted in about a 5% decrease to revenues.
Medical-Surgical revenues were up 5% for the quarter to $770 million. In addition to a solid performance from our core business, we have also seen earlier sales of flu vaccine this year, which essentially offset the large amount of revenue from flu test kits that we shipped in the prior year.
Gross profit for the segment was up 14% to $1.1 billion. On 2% revenue growth, this represents a nice improvement in gross margin of 43 basis points versus the prior year. The increase in gross profit for the quarter was primarily due to strong growth in our generics profit and the timing of the compensation we received from branded manufacturers.
Distribution Solutions' operating expense increased 5% to $574 million for the full year, similar to our expectations for the overall company. I would expect our growth and expenses to be more modest. Operating margin rates for the quarter were 192 basis points, an impressive increase of 34 basis points versus the prior year.
Given the quarterly volatility in this segment, we always focus on full year margins. In this context, based on our strong first half performance in this segment, we now expect our full year fiscal 2011 operating margin to be within the range of our prior-year GAAP operating margin of 188 basis points. Now we're very pleased with this forecast. As I remind you, the prior year benefited from the positive impact of our efforts around H1N1, making it a particularly difficult benchmark to match this year.
Turning to Technology Solutions. Let me start by talking about the $72 million noncash, pre-tax asset impairment charge, which is approximately $0.18 after-tax based on our effective tax rate.
Here at McKesson, we amortize our capitalized software over three years. As you recall, we began amortizing our Horizon ERM product late in the second quarter of our fiscal 2010, and it has been running approximately $8 million of expense per quarter. We do a calculation each quarter comparing the unamortized capitalized software costs to the projected net revenues during the remaining amortization period. Based on our most recent evaluation, the net revenues we foresee in the remaining 24-month amortization period were not sufficient to recover the unamortized costs, which resulted in the asset impairment charge. We remain committed to the product and would expect to expense most of our future development costs.
Now turning to the rest of the segment results. Total revenues were down 3% from the prior year to $770 million. Part of this result was driven by the sale of our McKesson Asia Pacific business. While the profits from this business were financially insignificant, it did contribute approximately $17 million in revenues in last year's second quarter. We will continue to see the McKesson Asia Pacific revenues impact our year-over-year revenue results in the services line of our P&L through the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
Also, as a reminder, the prior year was favorably impacted by the recognition of $22 million of previously deferred revenues. Majority of these deferred revenues were associated with ancillary products included as part of a bundled purchase, and were triggered when our Horizon ERM solution became generally available late in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. So adjusting for these two items, you'd see revenue growth of about 3% this quarter.
Moving on from revenues. Excluding the asset impairment charge, Technology Solutions' gross profit declined 7% to $348 million for the quarter. Contributing to this year-over-year result is the prior-year deferred revenue recognition, which had equated to $16 million in gross profit.
Operating expense increased just 1% in the quarter to $263 million. We had total gross R&D spending of $107 million compared to $102 million in the prior year. This is a demonstration of our continued commitment to developing our products for our customers. Of this amount, we capitalized 16% compared to 20% a year ago. Our Technology Solutions' operating profit was down 26% versus a year ago to $86 million, excluding the asset impairment charge.
To summarize, excluding the asset impairment charge, the overall Technology Solution results, while weak, were in line with our original expectations. We continue to expect a stronger back-half performance from Technology Solutions this fiscal year and modest improvement in the full year operating margin rate, excluding the asset impairment charge.
Leaving our segment performance now and turning to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. Our receivables were $8.2 billion, which is up from the prior year balance of $7.8 billion and our days sales outstanding increased by one day to 24 days. Inventories increased 2% to $8.8 billion, while our payables increased 1% to $12.8 billion. This resulted in our days sales and inventory remaining flat at 30 days, and our days sales and payables remaining flat from the prior year at 44 days.
These relatively stable working capital metrics resulted in McKesson generating $798 million in operating cash flow year-to-date. Based on the start to the year, we now expect to generate a bit more than our original expectation of $1.5 billion in full year cash flow from operations in fiscal 2011.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.1 billion, down slightly from our first quarter balance of $3.3 billion. Our great financial flexibility provides us good opportunity to continue our portfolio capital deployment strategies. Capitalized spending was $182 million for the first six months of the fiscal year, and we continue to expect full year capitalized spending between $400 million and $450 million.
And the last, let me turn to our outlook. Our guidance range remains at earnings from continuing operations of $4.72 to $4.92 for fully diluted share excluding litigation charges. What this means is that we have absorbed in our range both the $72 million pre-tax asset impairment charge and the related increase in our full year tax rate assumption from 32% to 33%. These two items are significant hurdles, but we can see a pathway to achieving our original guidance range due to the outstanding performance thus far in Distribution Solutions, our expectation of a stronger back half in Technology Solutions and our lower full year share count assumption.
One other point about the rest of the year, keeping in mind that we don't routinely provide quarterly EPS guidance. Sitting here today, we anticipate our fourth quarter to be unusually strong this fiscal year, both measured by its growth year-over-year and as a percentage of our overall earnings for the full year. Given the timing shifts in some of the economics we have with branded and generic manufacturers, we can directionally estimate that our December quarter EPS will be more in the range of our first and second quarters.
In closing, we're pleased with the overall performance across McKesson, and we believe our financial flexibility positions us well for future capital deployment.
Thanks, and with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I would ask that you limit your questions to just one per person to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?"

I would agree with you that generics are the biggest driver, and it's important to think about the fact that that's generics in Canada, it's generics in our traditional U.S. Pharma business and it's generics in our Specialty business. And we're gaining in all three of those areas. We also, as John talked about, continue to we create growth in some of our private brand efforts, which is helping us in the Canadian environment. Some of the regulatory changes have been deferred a little bit from what we initially thought in our plans. And frankly, our team up there is doing a little bit better job than we might have anticipated it, managing their way through that.

It would not be beneficial to them and clearly, would be dilutive to our compliance or penetration of the total spend. So I think I share of their wallet is growing up, and I think that's showing in our OneStop generic performance. We've also talked about the fact that we're expanding the program into other sectors, including the hospital sector, which we've talked about on previous calls. So we have new customer bases. We're starting out with a very little market share of their existing generic spend, and we're pointed into our proprietary programs.

I will tell, I won't really know until we get to the end of the next quarter, whether it's a good thing but not that great because demand didn't continue or whether in fact it continued and we sold the rest of our vaccines. That business is important to us because it's important to our customers that we provide that service. There's always a little bit of variability here in how it goes. Today, we have in Technology business, really the drivers, as we've talked about are that, in our Hospital business, you got customers almost exclusively focused on buying and implementing clinically oriented systems. We have made significant investments in our people to make sure we've got the right teams in place to both finish the necessary development on the products, to meet the final requirements as well as get implementations done quickly for our customers. There's just a lot of implementation scheduled to be done in both the December and March quarters.

I think the first thing we have to think about is whether the acquisitions make financial sense. And clearly, if you look at the effect of the use of the cash, the value of the target alternatives for use of that same cash, and it has to make financial sense. Perhaps not in the acquisition quarter because of one-time related issues, but certainly over time, it has to make sense. And we have to get a return for our investors that is superior to other alternatives that we might be evaluating, including the safer versions of share repurchases and dividends. It has to have a strategic sense for us. It has to be something that we know and understand and can build upon and we can grow and leverage. And hopefully, there are synergies that can be captured that our shareholders wouldn't be able to capture on their own if they purchase the asset on their own, particularly if it was a public company and they're holding it that way. So I think those are the big buckets. I don't feel like we're particularly constrained on our view of which segments we would buy into. And I don't think we're particularly constrained on geographic preferences. I don't think we're particular constrained on the size of the deal as long as you can kind of fit in those three broad sweeping categories. And we, frankly, are evaluating acquisitions all the time and have been for as long as I've been here. So you will hear from time-to-time that we're looking at something, and then you'll either hear that nobody bought it or it was never for sale or somebody else bought. But just because we're involved in evaluating transactions, doesn't mean that we're always going to end up with the target in the end. So I think it's an ongoing process. I think we've got a skilled team with a proven track record of being able to pick the right targets, integrate them appropriately and get the value for our shareholders. And clearly, as was discussed earlier on this call, things like Oncology Therapeutics Network, OTN, which was a drag on us, I think, for almost two years, as I recall, we told you it was going to be dilutive upfront and it was going to be very beneficial for our shareholders over the longer haul. Frankly, it positioned us extremely well in a very high-growth sector in specialty and oncology, and we're really pleased we have that asset. So it may not be apparent always upfront. But the value of paying for the acquisition is equated in the near-term results. But clearly, if we have a plan that we can execute, then we'll go forward and we'll deliver against those expectations that we have in that acquisition as well as per se and the many distribution acquisitions within where we just rolled companies into our Distribution structure so..."

On the nonhospital business where we are strong, physician offices, home care, long-term care and emergency centers, urgent care centers, those kinds of things, surgery centers, we have seen relatively flat demand. But I think our team has done a particularly good job of continuing to expand our footprint, not only within our existing customers like selling through our private label product, but also expanding beyond our existing customer base and probably taking a share, in particular, in home care, where we've got a very good presence.

What I would tell you is that the revenues from Horizon ERM in fiscal '11 were not material. If you look out over the next two years, the remainder of the amortization period, we certainly had an original plan to sell and implement sufficient customers to justify the asset that we had on the balance sheet. What's really happened is that our customers in there, complete focus on clinicals, have not just stopped buying things for now other than clinical, but they've also pushed out implementations and stop implementing. You combine that with the fact that as we look at the way the environment and requirements to what this product needs to do has evolve, we also, frankly, decided that given what was going on with our customers, it made sense for us to step back, and frankly, focus on finishing out the development of this product to meet all the new and latest requirements. That's going to take us a number of quarters. And as we do that, we're going to aim for those few customers that want to implement. We're going to push some of those implementations out. The combination of all those things is what pushed the revenues out beyond the remaining amortization period. I think it's important to realize though that these products, these kinds of products are products that should have usable life spans of 10, 20, 25 years. So there's this accounting convention where we need to look at the next three years. But our full expectation and hope here is that we're building the next equivalent of some of our legacy revenue cycle products, which we still have happy customers running 20, 30 years after they put them in. And quite frankly, it's a pretty good financial proposition for us at that point in time."

As we think about the long-term growth of that segment for us, I don't think we'll directionally change our discussions. I think that it's a part of the portfolio approach of products that we bring to the marketplace. And as we talked about this year, that sector we thought was going to grow in the 4% to 6% kind of range from a market perspective, and that we thought we would grow in those kinds of ranges.

I think that the discussion that we've been having around Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management is isolated to hospital financial systems, and it's not a commentary on the rest of our software or physician software, even Horizon Clinicals. It really is the hospital market place saying to us -- our customer base where we would naturally go to sell these enterprise revenue management products, our customers are saying to us, ""We're happy running that 20-year-old to 30-year-old software we bought from you 20 or 30 years ago. And our priority is 
to get your clinical systems installed and to make sure we purchase the right systems and we get to our meaningful use and be able to document that from a regulatory and a compliance perspective to get the stimulus dollars that the industry is chasing."" I don't believe that Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management that we are losing any hospital customers or potential customers to competing systems. Once again, I'm really talking about our existing customer base was the natural place to sell this product and those customers are largely looking to build out McKesson solutions as opposed to taking out McKesson solutions. That's not to say that we, on occasion, don't lose a customer. And it's not to say that we haven't lost a clinical customer or a financial customer. I'm just talking about enterprise revenue management, and the revenue issues we have in that product really are not product-based as much as they are market-based. And then I believe competitive market since our customers' interest has gone to a different direction.
As it relates to the overall portfolio and we think about financial systems that our customers are buying, frankly, they're not replacing their old legacy HIS systems. They are buying some what we call the bolt-on products on occasion to augment the systems that they already have deployed. And in fact, RelayHealth is selling many of those products. Some of them delivered Software-as-a-Service where they can easily augment the functionality of existing McKesson STAR systems with Relay Software-as-a-Service applications, where they're able to get a quick return on investment. And so when they see a quick return on investment and something they could put into the system very quickly and make use of if they're doing it, but they're not going to undertake, at least in this near-term environment, a complete redo of their financial systems in these hospitals when they're busy with clinical implementations. Does that answer your question, Eric?"

Let me start by saying that I'm pleased overall with our company's results for the second quarter and the first half of our fiscal 2011. This quarter, we achieved total company revenues",1529," Thanks, Ana, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today. Let me start by saying that I'm pleased overall with our company's results for the second quarter and the first half of our fiscal 2011. This quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $27.5 billion and fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.3, excluding adjustments to the litigation reserves.
 Let me quickly highlight three items that impacted our financial statements this quarter. As we announced on October 19, we reached an agreement to settle an action filed by the state of Connecticut relating to First Databank's published drug reimbursement benchmarks, which are commonly referred to as Average Wholesale Prices. The settlement resulted in an after-tax charge of $0.06 per diluted share.
 This agreement includes an expressed denial of liability, and as we've consistently stated and continue to believe, this case is without merit because McKesson does not and never did set PWPs. We will continue to work our way through the remaining public entity matters, and our goal is to resolve them in a reasonable manner that is in the best interest of our shareholders.
 This quarter, we're pleased to complete the sale of our McKesson Asia Pacific business. And as a result, we recorded an after-tax gain of $0.28 per diluted share. The sale of this business is a great example of our ability to create shareholder value. And lastly, we recorded a noncash, pre-tax asset impairment charge of $72 million related to our revenue cycle management product, Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management. Both Jeff and I will discuss this in more detail on this call.
 Looking beyond the asset impairment charge, our results were strong for the company as a whole, particularly for Distribution Solutions and there's a lot to like about our second quarter results. Additionally, during the first six month of our fiscal year, we made significant progress deploying capital, including fully using the $1.5 billion available on our share repurchase authorization and increasing our dividend. Based on the operational momentum in our business and the results of our share repurchase activity, we are maintaining our fiscal 2011 guidance range of $4.72 to $4.92 per diluted share from continuing operations, excluding adjustments to the litigation reserve.
 Let me highlight the second quarter trends in both segments. In Distribution Solutions, we had a strong double-digit growth and operating profit, with margins expanding an impressive 25 basis points. U.S. Pharmaceutical, Canada, Medical-Surgical and Specialty Care Solutions all contributed to that outstanding performance. Our market leading generics offering filled much of the margin expansion in the second quarter. Over the years, we built solutions based on the differing needs of our customers, and we've been very successful at demonstrating the value of our generics offering to our customer base.
 In addition, we use a global sourcing approach to the procurement of generics, with coordinated purchasing across the various businesses and geographies at McKesson. This maximizes efficiencies and optimizes the value we deliver to our customers. With a favorable generics launch schedule and our comprehensive offering, we anticipate continued profit growth in generics for fiscal 2011 and beyond.
 Our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution business is performing at an exceptionally high level. We continue to benefit from our long-standing relationships with branded manufacturers, delivering great value to them and earning steady levels of compensation in return.
 Again, this quarter, U.S. Pharmaceutical's results benefited greatly from generics. Sales of generics through our proprietary program, OneStop, grew 21% due to the steady pace of launches and a high degree of compliance that our customers have with our value-added programs. Generics have also been very beneficial to our Specialty Care Solutions business, and we expect that trend to continue for the remainder of this fiscal year.
 We have been talking a lot about oxaliplatin for the past year, and we are still benefiting from this generic drug with sufficient inventory that last through the end of our fiscal year. In addition, we are now increasingly optimistic about two other specialty generic introductions, so we expect another outstanding contribution this year from our Specialty business.
 Our Medical-Surgical revenues grew 5% in the second quarter. We remain focused on delivering value to our Medical-Surgical customers by optimizing outsourcing of the McKesson brand, where we deliver high quality, private label products at great savings. In addition, we continue to drive leverage through aggressive cost management. Combined, these initiatives are resulting in margin expansion.
 Our Canadian Distribution business had solid performance in the second quarter. Revenues had been impacted by price reductions on generic drugs, driven by changes in public policy in certain provinces during the year, as well as the launch of the generic version of Lipitor, which happened in May of this year. The team has done an outstanding job to offset these challenges and deliver solid results this quarter.
 In our Canadian business, we have a comprehensive set of solutions and leading physicians in every market segment. It is still our expectation that will work through the public policy changes in Canada with only modest financial impact that we can manage within our guidance range for this fiscal year. We are still evaluating the longer term impact of the changes and our responses to them.
 I'm pleased with the second quarter results in Distribution Solutions. We have a terrific combination of assets and a seasoned leadership team that performs exceptionally well. I have great confidence in our full year performance.
 Turning now to Technology Solutions. Setting aside the asset impairment charge for Horizon ERM that I mentioned earlier, let me point out that as expected, our first half results are down quite significantly versus prior year. For the full year, we still expect modest operating margin improvement, heavily weighted to the back half. While this quarter's results are in line with our expectations, they are certainly not indicative of what we expect from this business long term.
 Now let me come back to Horizon ERM. This is McKesson's next-generation revenue cycle management solution that we designed to improve the economics of patient care for our hospital customers. Revenue cycle management products must keep pace with the changes in health care because the environment is only going to become more complex. Horizon ERM is one of the most functionally rich solutions available to hospitals. Given all of the changes that RO is driving and the rapidly changing needs and priorities of our customers, we are continuing our product development efforts on Horizon ERM.
 Over the past few quarters, we have been focused on improving our customer and quality focused by strategically prioritizing our investments and delivering integrated solutions that enable greater customer success. We've also ramped up our Six Sigma efforts to prioritize opportunities for process enhancements, including streamlining our product focus and improving speed of installations.
 We continue to make organizational changes that will further our efforts to provide integrated offerings and a greater focus on customer success. We are now combining our Horizon clinical and revenue cycle groups to form a new organization known as Health Systems Enterprise Solutions, which will be lead by Rod O'Reilly, reporting to Dave Souerwine. Rod has been running our very successful Medical Imaging Group for some time. He's got a great track record of innovation, execution and collaboration. And I know many of you on the call know Rod personally. The integration of the clinical and financial systems has become increasingly important for our customers who must demonstrate not only the clinical quality of care they provide, but also the costs associated with that care.
 We are always committed to supporting our customers, and in particular with their current priority, clinical implementations as they navigate the RO requirements and the changing healthcare environment. We are increasingly confident in our clinical products and the value they would bring to our customers. We have confirmed test dates for most of our EHR products starting to mid-November, and we expect to achieve certification shortly after testing is complete. We are pleased to report that one of the first products we submitted for testing, our RelayHealth platform, which is a Software as a Service offering, received the modular certification this week.
 Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I want to spend a moment on capital deployment. In addition to the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program we completed in July, we subsequently repurchased $531 million in stock during our second fiscal quarter, fully using our authorization. Today, the board approved a new $1 billion authorization.
 Along with our increase in the dividend earlier this fiscal year, the share repurchase activity demonstrates our confidence in our business and in our future cash flow generation. We continue to target a portfolio approach to capital deployment, which would also include acquisitions. You should feel confident that we intend to continue deploying our capital wisely and strategically.
 In summary, we are seeing solid overall performance, and our strong balance sheet and tremendous cash provides us with many growth opportunities. I believe we are well positioned for continued success. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, and we will return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?

Our overall second quarter results reflect the solid performance at this halfway point fiscal year. We're showing operational results in Distribution Solutions above our initial expectations coming into the year. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we're pleased with our progress on capital deployment.
 Our Technology segment performance, while weak for the quarter, was in line with our expectations other than the asset impairment charge, which I'll explain in more detail in a few moments. We continue to expect a strong finish to the year and remain committed to enhancing shareholder value through a measured and thoughtful capital deployment approach.
 Before I begin reviewing our financial performance, let me start by pointing out that we completed the sale of our McKesson Asia Pacific business this quarter. The $0.28 after-tax gain on sale is recorded as a discontinued operation. And as you know, we focused on our results from continuing operations.
 Therefore, my discussion today will focus on our $1.3 EPS from continuing operations, which also excludes the impact of the $0.06 AWP litigation charge this quarter. It is important to note, however, that this $1.3 EPS that we'll focus on does include the asset impairment charge of approximately $0.18. With this background, as always, I'll begin with a review of our consolidated results and then provide additional color when I discuss each of the segments in more detail.
 Revenues for the quarter grew 1%  to $27.5 billion from $27.1 billion a year ago, and total gross profit increased 2% from the prior year. Outstanding gross profit growth in Distribution Solutions were somewhat offset by the asset impairment charge in Technology Solutions, which was recorded in the cost of sales. Excluding the asset impairment charge, overall gross profit would have increased 8% for the quarter versus last year.
 Moving below the gross profit line. Our total operating expenses are up 4% to $925 million for the quarter. For the full year, I would continue to expect our operating expense growth to be more modest than this 4% as our back half results will face easier year-over-year comparisons.
 Other income was relatively flat year-over-year, while interest expense declined 6% to $44 million for the quarter. Interest expense has been favorably impacted this fiscal year, primarily due to the repayment of $215 million in long-term debt in March of fiscal 2010.
 Moving now to taxes. We have raised our full year estimate of tax run rate from 32% to 33%, primarily driven by a change in our domestic foreign business mix. As a reminder, last year's second quarter's tax run rate was 32%, and we benefited from $13 million of favorable discrete items, equating to about $0.05 per diluted share.
 Net income for the quarter was $271 million, and our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the litigation charge, was $1.3, which, as a reminder, includes the approximate $0.18 asset impairment charge. To wrap up our consolidated results, this year's EPS number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases, which lowered our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year to 262 million shares for the quarter.
 Earlier, you heard John talk about our year-to-date fiscal 2011 share repurchases of over $1.5 billion. Taking this into account, we now expect that our full year average diluted share count will come in a bit below the original guidance assumption, 267 million shares outstanding.
 Let's now move on to our segment results. In Distribution Solutions, total revenues grew 2% in the quarter to $26.8 billion. Looking at the components, our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues increased 1% versus the prior year, with direct revenues up 6% and warehouse revenues down 15% for the quarter.
 The warehouse revenue decline, when adjusted for shifts of customer business to direct-store delivery, was something closer to 10% to 11%, which is still a significant decrease. Drivers of this decline were brand-to-generic conversions, which particularly impacts our warehouse revenues as well as some of our customers' business losses.
 However, when you look at direct distribution revenue, which is our most profitable revenue stream, we're pleased with the good growth we showed. After adjustments for shifts from warehouse to direct distribution, we grew direct revenues by 4% to 5%. Importantly, I'd remind you that we typically make lower margins on our warehouse revenues relative to the margins on our direct revenues.
 So to sum up, while our total revenue growth may look low, it was driven by trends that allowed us to, in fact, significantly grow our gross profits this quarter. We've been saying for a while now that it is important to focus more on gross profit rather than revenue, and this quarter's results really exemplify the strength.
 Moving on to Canada. On a constant currency basis, revenues declined 1% for the quarter. Including a favorable currency impact, Canadian revenues increased 4% versus the prior year. The combined effect of government-imposed price reductions on generic drugs and the launch of generic Lipitor in Canada resulted in about a 5% decrease to revenues.
 Medical-Surgical revenues were up 5% for the quarter to $770 million. In addition to a solid performance from our core business, we have also seen earlier sales of flu vaccine this year, which essentially offset the large amount of revenue from flu test kits that we shipped in the prior year.
 Gross profit for the segment was up 14% to $1.1 billion. On 2% revenue growth, this represents a nice improvement in gross margin of 43 basis points versus the prior year. The increase in gross profit for the quarter was primarily due to strong growth in our generics profit and the timing of the compensation we received from branded manufacturers.
 Distribution Solutions' operating expense increased 5% to $574 million for the full year, similar to our expectations for the overall company. I would expect our growth and expenses to be more modest. Operating margin rates for the quarter were 192 basis points, an impressive increase of 34 basis points versus the prior year.
 Given the quarterly volatility in this segment, we always focus on full year margins. In this context, based on our strong first half performance in this segment, we now expect our full year fiscal 2011 operating margin to be within the range of our prior-year GAAP operating margin of 188 basis points. Now we're very pleased with this forecast. As I remind you, the prior year benefited from the positive impact of our efforts around H1N1, making it a particularly difficult benchmark to match this year.
 Turning to Technology Solutions. Let me start by talking about the $72 million noncash, pre-tax asset impairment charge, which is approximately $0.18 after-tax based on our effective tax rate.
 Here at McKesson, we amortize our capitalized software over three years. As you recall, we began amortizing our Horizon ERM product late in the second quarter of our fiscal 2010, and it has been running approximately $8 million of expense per quarter. We do a calculation each quarter comparing the unamortized capitalized software costs to the projected net revenues during the remaining amortization period. Based on our most recent evaluation, the net revenues we foresee in the remaining 24-month amortization period were not sufficient to recover the unamortized costs, which resulted in the asset impairment charge. We remain committed to the product and would expect to expense most of our future development costs.
 Now turning to the rest of the segment results. Total revenues were down 3% from the prior year to $770 million. Part of this result was driven by the sale of our McKesson Asia Pacific business. While the profits from this business were financially insignificant, it did contribute approximately $17 million in revenues in last year's second quarter. We will continue to see the McKesson Asia Pacific revenues impact our year-over-year revenue results in the services line of our P&L through the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
 Also, as a reminder, the prior year was favorably impacted by the recognition of $22 million of previously deferred revenues. Majority of these deferred revenues were associated with ancillary products included as part of a bundled purchase, and were triggered when our Horizon ERM solution became generally available late in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. So adjusting for these two items, you'd see revenue growth of about 3% this quarter.
 Moving on from revenues. Excluding the asset impairment charge, Technology Solutions' gross profit declined 7% to $348 million for the quarter. Contributing to this year-over-year result is the prior-year deferred revenue recognition, which had equated to $16 million in gross profit.
 Operating expense increased just 1% in the quarter to  $263 million. We had total gross R&D spending of $107 million compared to $102 million in the prior year. This is a demonstration of our continued commitment to developing our products for our customers. Of this amount, we capitalized 16% compared to 20% a year ago. Our Technology Solutions' operating profit was down 26% versus a year ago to $86 million, excluding the asset impairment charge.
 To summarize, excluding the asset impairment charge, the overall Technology Solution results, while weak, were in line with our original expectations. We continue to expect a stronger back-half performance from Technology Solutions this fiscal year and modest improvement in the full year operating margin rate, excluding the asset impairment charge.
 Leaving our segment performance now and turning to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. Our receivables were $8.2 billion, which is up from the prior year balance of $7.8 billion and our days sales outstanding increased by one day to 24 days. Inventories increased 2% to $8.8 billion, while our payables increased 1% to $12.8 billion. This resulted in our days sales and inventory remaining flat at 30 days, and our days sales and payables remaining flat from the prior year at 44 days.
 These relatively stable working capital metrics resulted in McKesson generating $798 million in operating cash flow year-to-date. Based on the start to the year, we now expect to generate a bit more than our original expectation of $1.5 billion in full year cash flow from operations in fiscal 2011.
 We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.1 billion, down slightly from our first quarter balance of $3.3 billion. Our great financial flexibility provides us good opportunity to continue our portfolio capital deployment strategies. Capitalized spending was $182 million for the first six months of the fiscal year, and we continue to expect full year capitalized spending between $400 million and  $450 million.
 And the last, let me turn to our outlook. Our guidance range remains at earnings from continuing operations of $4.72 to $4.92 for fully diluted share excluding litigation charges. What this means is that we have absorbed in our range both the $72 million pre-tax asset impairment charge and the related increase in our full year tax rate assumption from 32% to 33%. These two items are significant hurdles, but we can see a pathway to achieving our original guidance range due to the outstanding performance thus far in Distribution Solutions, our expectation of a stronger back half in Technology Solutions and our lower full year share count assumption.
 One other point about the rest of the year, keeping in mind that we don't routinely provide quarterly EPS guidance. Sitting here today, we anticipate our fourth quarter to be unusually strong this fiscal year, both measured by its growth year-over-year and as a percentage of our overall earnings for the full year. Given the timing shifts in some of the economics we have with branded and generic manufacturers, we can directionally estimate that our December quarter EPS will be more in the range of our first and second quarters.
 In closing, we're pleased with the overall performance across McKesson, and we believe our financial flexibility positions us well for future capital deployment. Thanks, and with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I would ask that you limit your questions to just one per person to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?

For years, I kind of feel like you've been targeting an operating margin goal in Distribution Solutions of between 1.5% and 2%. Now you're continuously bumping into the upper bend of that. Can you maybe talk about what's driving that? Is there anything beyond generics? Is it more on the specialty side? Just listening to Jeff's comments, you're talking about a big March quarter already. I mean, are we now going to be looking at sustained operating margin north of 2%, and is that really just generics driving that?

Clearly, there's an infrastructure cost that our customers can deleverage. And as I mentioned, we have a great portfolio of products where we do a terrific job of buying them. I think it probably is a stretch to think about the very largest customers buying their generics from us because they're very sophisticated in their own buying. But on occasion, we do sell generics to them, particularly when their own supply is not available to them. And we do see some revenue impact when our large chain customers buying a brand from us. And when it goes generic, they buy the generic on their own. But frankly, our margin structure and a lot of those relationships, particularly on the warehousing side, is so low that even if we lose the revenues, it's not a significant impact to us. And clearly, it's more than offset by the generic pull-through in the rest of our customer base where we have significant opportunities to save them money, take the patient money and include better margin structures for ourselves simultaneously.

And we're gaining in all three of those areas. We also, as John talked about, continue to we create growth in some of our private brand efforts, which is helping us in the Canadian environment.

So if you start in our Medical-Surgical business, I'd remind you that, that, in the context of overall, McKesson is a small business. And our seasonal flu profits are modest by the standards of the company overall as you're talking a couple of pennies a year. When you look, however, at the year-over-year results this quarter, we have gotten off to a much earlier start with seasonal flu vaccine. And that's a good thing. I will tell, I won't really know until we get to the end of the next quarter, whether it's a good thing but not that great because demand didn't continue or whether in fact it continued and we sold the rest of our vaccines. That business is important to us because it's important to our customers that we provide that service. There's always a little bit of variability here in how it goes. Today, we have in Technology business, really the drivers, as we've talked about are that, in our Hospital business, you got customers almost exclusively focused on buying and implementing clinically oriented systems. We have made significant investments in our people to make sure we've got the right teams in place to both finish the necessary development on the products, to meet the final requirements as well as get implementations done quickly for our customers. There's just a lot of implementation schedules to be done in both the December and March quarters. You also got a couple of the key clinical products that have both a  certification that needs to be done as well as a general availability target time line that needs to be hit. And both of those things, for certain customers, are tied to when we recognize revenue as well. So it's really that focus that drives the strong back half.

I think the first thing we have to think about is whether the acquisitions make financial sense. And clearly, if you look at the effect of the use of the cash, the value of the target alternatives for use of that same cash, and it has to make financial sense. Perhaps not in the acquisition quarter because of one-time related issues, but certainly over time, it has to make sense. And we have to get a return for our investors that is superior to other alternatives that we might be evaluating, including the safer versions of share repurchases and dividends. It has to have a strategic sense for us. It has to be something that we know and understand and can build upon and we can grow and leverage. And hopefully, there are synergies that can be captured that our shareholders wouldn't be able to capture on their own if they purchase the asset on their own, particularly if it was a public company and they're holding it that way. So I think those are the big buckets. I don't feel like we're particularly constrained on our view of which segments we would buy into. And I don't think we're particularly constrained on geographic preferences. I don't think we're particular constrained on the size of the deal as long as you can kind of fit in those three broad sweeping categories. And we, frankly, are evaluating acquisitions all the time and have been for as long as I've been here. So you will hear from time-to-time that we're looking at something, and then you'll either hear that nobody bought it or it was never for sale or somebody else bought. But just because we're involved in evaluating transactions, it doesn't mean that we're always going to end up with the target in the end. So I think it's an ongoing process. I think we've got a skilled team with a proven track record of being able to pick the right targets, integrate them appropriately and get the value for our shareholders. And clearly, as was discussed earlier on this call, things like Oncology Therapeutics Network, OTN, which was a drag on us, I think, for almost two years, as I recall, we told you it was going to be dilutive upfront and it was going to be very beneficial for our shareholders over the longer haul. Frankly, it positioned us extremely well in a very high-growth sector in specialty and oncology, and we're really pleased we have that asset. So it may not be apparent always upfront. But the value of paying for the acquisition is equated in the near-term results. But clearly, if we have a plan that we can execute, then we'll go forward and we'll deliver against those expectations that we have in that acquisition as well as per se and the many distribution acquisitions within where we just rolled companies into our Distribution structure so...

And our systems business in acute care is really not affected by patient demand levels. So we see very little -- we don't track data related to admissions in hospitals or surgery procedures in hospitals because the sale of our product in the hospital marketplace, the system sale, is not really related to that. It's more driven by the need to upgrade their systems or they'd become our compliant, et cetera. On the nonhospital business where we are strong, physician offices, home care, long-term care and emergency centers, emerging care centers, those kinds of things, surgery centers, we have seen relatively flat demand. But I think our team has done a particularly good job of continuing to expand our footprint, not only within our existing customers like selling through our private label product, but also expanding beyond our existing customer base and probably taking a share, in particular, in home care, where we've got a very good presence. So I think we are continuing to see our ability to grow revenue in Medical-Surgical as evidenced by the 5% growth this quarter, and we hope those trends will continue. And our team is now really focused on continuing to execute. And a larger view of physician office visits, et cetera, clearly, I think that those really haven't changed much in the last 12 months.

What I would tell you is that the revenues from Horizon ERM in fiscal '11 were not material. If you look out over the next two years, the remainder of the amortization period, we certainly had an original plan to sell and implement sufficient customers to justify the asset that we had on the balance sheet. What's really happened is that our customers in there, complete focus on clinicals, have not just stopped buying things for now other than clinical, but they've also pushed out implementations and stop implementing. You combine that with the fact that as we look at the way the environment and requirements to what this product needs to do has evolve, we also, frankly, decided that given what was going on with our customers, it made sense for us to step back, and frankly, focus on finishing out the development of this product to meet all the new and latest requirements. That's going to take us a number of quarters. And as we do that, we're going to aim for those few customers that want to implement. We're going to push some of those implementations out. The combination of all those things is what pushed the revenues out beyond the remaining amortization period. I think it's important to realize though that these products, these kinds of products are products that should have usable life spans of 10, 20, 25 years. So there's this accounting convention where we need to look at the next three years. But our full expectation and hope here is that we're building the next equivalent of some of our legacy revenue cycle product, which we still have happy customers running 20, 30 years after they put them in.

It really is the hospital market place saying to us -- our customer base where we would naturally go to sell these enterprise revenue management products, our customers are saying to us, ""We're happy running that 20-year-old to 30-year-old software we bought from you 20 or 30 years ago."" And our priority is
 to is to get you clinical systems installed and to make sure we purchase the right systems and we get to our meaningful use and be able to document that from a regulatory and a compliance perspective to get the stimulus dollars that the industry is chasing. I don't believe that Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management that we are losing any hospital customers or potential customers to competing systems. Once again, I'm really talking about our existing customer base was the natural place to sell this product and those customers are largely looking to build out McKesson solutions as opposed to taking out McKesson solutions. That's not to say that we, on occasion, don't lose a  customer. And it's not to say that we haven't lost a clinical customer or a financial customer. I'm just talking about enterprise revenue management, and the revenue issues we have in that product really are not product-based as much as they are market-based. And then I believe competitive market since our customers' interest has gone to a different direction. As it relates to the overall portfolio and we think about financial systems that our customers are buying, frankly, they're not replacing their old legacy HIS systems. They are buying some what we call the bolt-on products on occasion to augment the systems that they already have deployed. And in fact, RelayHealth is selling many of those products. Some of them delivered Software as a Service where they can easily augment the functionality of existing McKesson STAR systems with Relay Software as a Service applications, where they're able to get a quick return on investment. And so when they see a quick return on investment and something they could put into the system very quickly and make use of if they're doing it, but they're not going to undertake, at least in this near-term environment, a complete redo of their financial systems in these hospitals when they're busy with clinical implementations. Does that answer your question, Eric?

And we have a pretty darn good sense of how those economics are going to play out over a 12-month period. But we don't have a very good sense of which quarter, and it varies every quarter. So part of our really strong year-over-year performance in the September quarter in Distribution Solutions was just a difference in timing that I mentioned in terms of our branded compensation. So you shouldn't, in anyway, relate sequential trend into that. In fact, some of the strong September quarter, that's why I made more moderating comments about the December quarter and what that will look like.

On the deferred revenue, we don't call out a number. There is a number on our balance sheet, which is not a particularly helpful number because frankly, it's driven by the very large annual payments customers make to us for maintenance. And again, we do that once a year, and then pull it out to that balance sheet item. So the number that's on the balance sheet is not huge. It's a part of what needs to happen and what will get recognized in the December-March quarter. But it's not the majority piece.

Let me start by saying that I'm pleased overall with our company's results for the second quarter and the first half of our fiscal 2011. This quarter, we achieved total company revenues",1529,"Thanks, Ana, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today. Let me start by saying that I'm pleased overall with our company's results for the second quarter and the first half of our fiscal 2011. This quarter, we achieved total company revenues of $27.5 billion and fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.3, excluding adjustments to the litigation reserves. 
Let me quickly highlight three items that impacted our financial statements this quarter. As we announced on October 19, we reached an agreement to settle an action filed by the state of Connecticut relating to First Databank's published drug reimbursement benchmarks, which are commonly referred to as Average Wholesale Prices. The settlement resulted in an after-tax charge of $0.06 per diluted share. 
This agreement includes an expressed denial of liability, and as we've consistently stated and continue to believe, this case is without merit because McKesson does not and never did set PWPs. We will continue to work our way through the remaining public entity matters, and our goal is to resolve them in a reasonable manner that is in the best interest of our shareholders. 
This quarter, we're pleased to complete the sale of our McKesson Asia Pacific business. And as a result, we recorded an after-tax gain of $0.28 per diluted share. The sale of this business is a great example of our ability to create shareholder value. And lastly, we recorded a noncash, pre-tax asset impairment charge of $72 million related to our revenue cycle management product, Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management. Both Jeff and I will discuss this in more detail on this call.
Looking beyond the asset impairment charge, our results were strong for the company as a whole, particularly for Distribution Solutions and there's a lot to like about our second quarter results. Additionally, during the first six month of our fiscal year, we made significant progress deploying capital, including fully using the $1.5 billion available on our share repurchase authorization and increasing our dividend. Based on the operational momentum in our business and the results of our share repurchase activity, we are maintaining our fiscal 2011 guidance range of $4.72 to $4.92 per diluted share from continuing operations, excluding adjustments to the litigation reserve. 
Let me highlight the second quarter trends in both segments. In Distribution Solutions, we had a strong double-digit growth and operating profit, with margins expanding an impressive 25 basis points. U.S. Pharmaceutical, Canada, Medical-Surgical and Specialty Care Solutions all contributed to that outstanding performance. Our market leading generics offering filled much of the margin expansion in the second quarter. Over the years, we built solutions based on the differing needs of our customers, and we've been very successful at demonstrating the value of our generics offering to our customer base. 
In addition, we use a global sourcing approach to the procurement of generics, with coordinated purchasing across the various businesses and geographies at McKesson. This maximizes efficiencies and optimizes the value we deliver to our customers. With a favorable generics launch schedule and our comprehensive offering, we anticipate continued profit growth in generics for fiscal 2011 and beyond. 
Our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution business is performing at an exceptionally high level. We continue to benefit from our long-standing relationships with branded manufacturers, delivering great value to them and earning steady levels of compensation in return.
Again, this quarter, U.S. Pharmaceutical's results benefited greatly from generics. Sales of generics through our proprietary program, OneStop, grew 21% due to the steady pace of launches and a high degree of compliance that our customers have with our value-added programs. Generics have also been very beneficial to our Specialty Care Solutions business, and we expect that trend to continue for the remainder of this fiscal year. 
We have been talking a lot about oxaliplatin for the past year, and we are still benefiting from this generic drug with sufficient inventory that last through the end of our fiscal year. In addition, we are now increasingly optimistic about two other specialty generic introductions, so we expect another outstanding contribution this year from our Specialty business.
Our Medical-Surgical revenues grew 5% in the second quarter. We remain focused on delivering value to our Medical-Surgical customers by optimizing outsourcing of the McKesson brand, where we deliver high quality, private label products at great savings. In addition, we continue to drive leverage through aggressive cost management. Combined, these initiatives are resulting in margin expansion. 
Our Canadian Distribution business had solid performance in the second quarter. Revenues had been impacted by price reductions on generic drugs, driven by changes in public policy in certain provinces during the year, as well as the launch of the generic version of Lipitor, which happened in May of this year. The team has done an outstanding job to offset these challenges and deliver solid results this quarter. 
In our Canadian business, we have a comprehensive set of solutions and leading physicians in every market segment. It is still our expectation that will work through the public policy changes in Canada with only modest financial impact that we can manage within our guidance range for this fiscal year. We are still evaluating the longer term impact of the changes and our responses to them.
I'm pleased with the second quarter results in Distribution Solutions. We have a terrific combination of assets and a seasoned leadership team that performs exceptionally well. I have great confidence in our full year performance. 
Turning now to Technology Solutions. Setting aside the asset impairment charge for Horizon ERM that I mentioned earlier, let me point out that as expected, our first half results are down quite significantly versus prior year. For the full year, we still expect modest operating margin improvement, heavily weighted to the back half. While this quarter's results are in line with our expectations, they are certainly not indicative of what we expect from this business long term.
Now let me come back to Horizon ERM. This is McKesson's next-generation revenue cycle management solution that we designed to improve the economics of patient care for our hospital customers. Revenue cycle management products must keep pace with the changes in health care because the environment is only going to become more complex. Horizon ERM is one of the most functionally rich solutions available to hospitals. Given all of the changes that RO is driving and the rapidly changing needs and priorities of our customers, we are continuing our product development efforts on Horizon ERM.
Over the past few quarters, we have been focused on improving our customer and quality focused by strategically prioritizing our investments and delivering integrated solutions that enable greater customer success. We've also ramped up our Six Sigma efforts to prioritize opportunities for process enhancements, including streamlining our product focus and improving speed of installations.
We continue to make organizational changes that will further our efforts to provide integrated offerings and a greater focus on customer success. We are now combining our Horizon clinical and revenue cycle groups to form a new organization known as Health Systems Enterprise Solutions, which will be lead by Rod O'Reilly, reporting to Dave Souerwine. Rod has been running our very successful Medical Imaging Group for some time. He's got a great track record of innovation, execution and collaboration. And I know many of you on the call know Rod personally. The integration of the clinical and financial systems has become increasingly important for our customers who must demonstrate not only the clinical quality of care they provide, but also the costs associated with that care.
We are always committed to supporting our customers, and in particular with their current priority, clinical implementations as they navigate the RO requirements and the changing healthcare environment. We are increasingly confident in our clinical products and the value they would bring to our customers. We have confirmed test dates for most of our EHR products starting to mid-November, and we expect to achieve certification shortly after testing is complete. We are pleased to report that one of the first products we submitted for testing, our RelayHealth platform, which is a Software as a Service offering, received the modular certification this week.
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I want to spend a moment on capital deployment. In addition to the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program we completed in July, we subsequently repurchased $531 million in stock during our second fiscal quarter, fully using our authorization. Today, the board approved a new $1 billion authorization. 
Along with our increase in the dividend earlier this fiscal year, the share repurchase activity demonstrates our confidence in our business and in our future cash flow generation. We continue to target a portfolio approach to capital deployment, which would also include acquisitions. You should feel confident that we intend to continue deploying our capital wisely and strategically. 
In summary, we are seeing solid overall performance, and our strong balance sheet and tremendous cash provides us with many growth opportunities. I believe we are well positioned for continued success. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, and we will return to address your questions when he finishes. Jeff?"

Our overall second quarter results reflect the solid performance at this halfway point fiscal year.

Our overall second quarter results reflect the solid performance at this halfway point fiscal year. We're showing operational results in Distribution Solutions above our initial expectations coming into the year. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we're pleased with our progress on capital deployment. 
Our Technology segment performance, while weak for the quarter, was in line with our expectations other than the asset impairment charge, which I'll explain in more detail in a few moments. We continue to expect a strong finish to the year and remain committed to enhancing shareholder value through a measured and thoughtful capital deployment approach. 
Before I begin reviewing our financial performance, let me start by pointing out that we completed the sale of our McKesson Asia Pacific business this quarter. The $0.28 after-tax gain on sale is recorded as a discontinued operation. And as you know, we focused on our results from continuing operations. 
Therefore, my discussion today will focus on our $1.3 EPS from continuing operations, which also excludes the impact of the $0.06 AWP litigation charge this quarter. It is important to note, however, that this $1.3 EPS that we'll focus on does include the asset impairment charge of approximately $0.18. With this background, as always, I'll begin with a review of our consolidated results and then provide additional color when I discuss each of the segments in more detail. 
Revenues for the quarter grew 1%  to $27.5 billion from $27.1 billion a year ago, and total gross profit increased 2% from the prior year. Outstanding gross profit growth in Distribution Solutions were somewhat offset by the asset impairment charge in Technology Solutions, which was recorded in the cost of sales. Excluding the asset impairment charge, overall gross profit would have increased 8% for the quarter versus last year.
Moving below the gross profit line. Our total operating expenses are up 4% to $925 million for the quarter. For the full year, I would continue to expect our operating expense growth to be more modest than this 4% as our back half results will face easier year-over-year comparisons.
Other income was relatively flat year-over-year, while interest expense declined 6% to $44 million for the quarter. Interest expense has been favorably impacted this fiscal year, primarily due to the repayment of $215 million in long-term debt in March of fiscal 2010.
Moving now to taxes. We have raised our full year estimate of tax run rate from 32% to 33%, primarily driven by a change in our domestic foreign business mix. As a reminder, last year's second quarter's tax run rate was 32%, and we benefited from $13 million of favorable discrete items, equating to about $0.05 per diluted share. 
Net income for the quarter was $271 million, and our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the litigation charge, was $1.3, which, as a reminder, includes the approximate $0.18 asset impairment charge. To wrap up our consolidated results, this year's EPS number was aided by the cumulative impact of our share repurchases, which lowered our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by 3% year-over-year to 262 million shares for the quarter. 
Earlier, you heard John talk about our year-to-date fiscal 2011 share repurchases of over $1.5 billion. Taking this into account, we now expect that our full year average diluted share count will come in a bit below the original guidance assumption, 267 million shares outstanding.
Let's now move on to our segment results. In Distribution Solutions, total revenues grew 2% in the quarter to $26.8 billion. Looking at the components, our U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution and Services revenues increased 1% versus the prior year, with direct revenues up 6% and warehouse revenues down 15% for the quarter. 
The warehouse revenue decline, when adjusted for shifts of customer business to direct-store delivery, was something closer to 10% to 11%, which is still a significant decrease. Drivers of this decline were brand-to-generic conversions, which particularly impacts our warehouse revenues as well as some of our customers' business losses.
However, when you look at direct distribution revenue, which is our most profitable revenue stream, we're pleased with the good growth we showed. After adjustments for shifts from warehouse to direct distribution, we grew direct revenues by 4% to 5%. Importantly, I'd remind you that we typically make lower margins on our warehouse revenues relative to the margins on our direct revenues. 
So to sum up, while our total revenue growth may look low, it was driven by trends that allowed us to, in fact, significantly grow our gross profits this quarter. We've been saying for a while now that it is important to focus more on gross profit rather than revenue, and this quarter's results really exemplify the strength.
Moving on to Canada. On a constant currency basis, revenues declined 1% for the quarter. Including a favorable currency impact, Canadian revenues increased 4% versus the prior year. The combined effect of government-imposed price reductions on generic drugs and the launch of generic Lipitor in Canada resulted in about a 5% decrease to revenues. 
Medical-Surgical revenues were up 5% for the quarter to $770 million. In addition to a solid performance from our core business, we have also seen earlier sales of flu vaccine this year, which essentially offset the large amount of revenue from flu test kits that we shipped in the prior year.
Gross profit for the segment was up 14% to $1.1 billion. On 2% revenue growth, this represents a nice improvement in gross margin of 43 basis points versus the prior year. The increase in gross profit for the quarter was primarily due to strong growth in our generics profit and the timing of the compensation we received from branded manufacturers. 
Distribution Solutions' operating expense increased 5% to $574 million for the full year, similar to our expectations for the overall company. I would expect our growth and expenses to be more modest. Operating margin rates for the quarter were 192 basis points, an impressive increase of 34 basis points versus the prior year. 
Given the quarterly volatility in this segment, we always focus on full year margins. In this context, based on our strong first half performance in this segment, we now expect our full year fiscal 2011 operating margin to be within the range of our prior-year GAAP operating margin of 188 basis points. Now we're very pleased with this forecast. As I remind you, the prior year benefited from the positive impact of our efforts around H1N1, making it a particularly difficult benchmark to match this year.
Turning to Technology Solutions. Let me start by talking about the $72 million noncash, pre-tax asset impairment charge, which is approximately $0.18 after-tax based on our effective tax rate. 
Here at McKesson, we amortize our capitalized software over three years. As you recall, we began amortizing our Horizon ERM product late in the second quarter of our fiscal 2010, and it has been running approximately $8 million of expense per quarter. We do a calculation each quarter comparing the unamortized capitalized software costs to the projected net revenues during the remaining amortization period. Based on our most recent evaluation, the net revenues we foresee in the remaining 24-month amortization period were not sufficient to recover the unamortized costs, which resulted in the asset impairment charge. We remain committed to the product and would expect to expense most of our future development costs.
Now turning to the rest of the segment results. Total revenues were down 3% from the prior year to $770 million. Part of this result was driven by the sale of our McKesson Asia Pacific business. While the profits from this business were financially insignificant, it did contribute approximately $17 million in revenues in last year's second quarter. We will continue to see the McKesson Asia Pacific revenues impact our year-over-year revenue results in the services line of our P&L through the first quarter of fiscal 2012. 
Also, as a reminder, the prior year was favorably impacted by the recognition of $22 million of previously deferred revenues. Majority of these deferred revenues were associated with ancillary products included as part of a bundled purchase, and were triggered when our Horizon ERM solution became generally available late in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. So adjusting for these two items, you'd see revenue growth of about 3% this quarter.
Moving on from revenues. Excluding the asset impairment charge, Technology Solutions' gross profit declined 7% to $348 million for the quarter. Contributing to this year-over-year result is the prior-year deferred revenue recognition, which had equated to $16 million in gross profit. 
Operating expense increased just 1% in the quarter to  $263 million. We had total gross R&D spending of $107 million compared to $102 million in the prior year. This is a demonstration of our continued commitment to developing our products for our customers. Of this amount, we capitalized 16% compared to 20% a year ago. Our Technology Solutions' operating profit was down 26% versus a year ago to $86 million, excluding the asset impairment charge.
To summarize, excluding the asset impairment charge, the overall Technology Solution results, while weak, were in line with our original expectations. We continue to expect a stronger back-half performance from Technology Solutions this fiscal year and modest improvement in the full year operating margin rate, excluding the asset impairment charge. 
Leaving our segment performance now and turning to the balance sheet and our working capital metrics. Our receivables were $8.2 billion, which is up from the prior year balance of $7.8 billion and our days sales outstanding increased by one day to 24 days. Inventories increased 2% to $8.8 billion, while our payables increased 1% to $12.8 billion. This resulted in our days sales and inventory remaining flat at 30 days, and our days sales and payables remaining flat from the prior year at 44 days. 
These relatively stable working capital metrics resulted in McKesson generating $798 million in operating cash flow year-to-date. Based on the start to the year, we now expect to generate a bit more than our original expectation of $1.5 billion in full year cash flow from operations in fiscal 2011.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.1 billion, down slightly from our first quarter balance of $3.3 billion. Our great financial flexibility provides us good opportunity to continue our portfolio capital deployment strategies. Capitalized spending was $182 million for the first six months of the fiscal year, and we continue to expect full year capitalized spending between $400 million and  $450 million. 
And the last, let me turn to our outlook. Our guidance range remains at earnings from continuing operations of $4.72 to $4.92 for fully diluted share excluding litigation charges. What this means is that we have absorbed in our range both the $72 million pre-tax asset impairment charge and the related increase in our full year tax rate assumption from 32% to 33%. These two items are significant hurdles, but we can see a pathway to achieving our original guidance range due to the outstanding performance thus far in Distribution Solutions, our expectation of a stronger back half in Technology Solutions and our lower full year share count assumption. 
One other point about the rest of the year, keeping in mind that we don't routinely provide quarterly EPS guidance. Sitting here today, we anticipate our fourth quarter to be unusually strong this fiscal year, both measured by its growth year-over-year and as a percentage of our overall earnings for the full year. Given the timing shifts in some of the economics we have with branded and generic manufacturers, we can directionally estimate that our December quarter EPS will be more in the range of our first and second quarters.
In closing, we're pleased with the overall performance across McKesson, and we believe our financial flexibility positions us well for future capital deployment. Thanks, and with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. In the interest of time, I would ask that you limit your questions to just one per person to allow others an opportunity to participate. Operator?"

I think it probably is a stretch to think about the very largest customers buying their generics from us because they're very sophisticated in their own buying. But on occasion, we do sell generics to them, particularly when their own supply is not available to them. And we do see some revenue impact when our large chain customers buying a brand from us. And when it goes generic, they buy the generic on their own. But frankly, our margin structure and a lot of those relationships, particularly on the warehousing side, is so low that even if we lose the revenues, it's not a significant impact to us.

And we're gaining in all three of those areas. We also, as John talked about, continue to we create growth in some of our private brand efforts, which is helping us in the Canadian environment.

I think the first thing we have to think about is whether the acquisitions make financial sense. And clearly, if you look at the effect of the use of the cash, the value of the target alternatives for use of that same cash, and it has to make financial sense. Perhaps not in the acquisition quarter because of one-time related issues, but certainly over time, it has to make sense. And we have to get a return for our investors that is superior to other alternatives that we might be evaluating, including the safer versions of share repurchases and dividends. It has to have a strategic sense for us. It has to be something that we know and understand and can build upon and we can grow and leverage. And hopefully, there are synergies that can be captured that our shareholders wouldn't be able to capture on their own if they purchase the asset on their own, particularly if it was a public company and they're holding it that way. So I think those are the big buckets. I don't feel like we're particularly constrained on our view of which segments we would buy into. And I don't think we're particularly constrained on geographic preferences. I don't think we're particular constrained on the size of the deal as long as you can kind of fit in those three broad sweeping categories. And we, frankly, are evaluating acquisitions all the time and have been for as long as I've been here. So you will hear from time-to-time that we're looking at something, and then you'll either hear that nobody bought it or it was never for sale or somebody else bought. But just because we're involved in evaluating transactions, it doesn't mean that we're always going to end up with the target in the end. So I think it's an ongoing process. I think we've got a skilled team with a proven track record of being able to pick the right targets, integrate them appropriately and get the value for our shareholders. And clearly, as was discussed earlier on this call, things like Oncology Therapeutics Network, OTN, which was a drag on us, I think, for almost two years, as I recall, we told you it was going to be dilutive upfront and it was going to be very beneficial for our shareholders over the longer haul. Frankly, it positioned us extremely well in a very high-growth sector in specialty and oncology, and we're really pleased we have that asset. So it may not be apparent always upfront. But the value of paying for the acquisition is equated in the near-term results. But clearly, if we have a plan that we can execute, then we'll go forward and we'll deliver against those expectations that we have in that acquisition as well as per se and the many distribution acquisitions within where we just rolled companies into our Distribution structure so..."

And our systems business in acute care is really not affected by patient demand levels. So we see very little -- we don't track data related to admissions in hospitals or surgery procedures in hospitals because the sale of our product in the hospital marketplace, the system sale, is not really related to that. It's more driven by the need to upgrade their systems or they'd become our compliant, et cetera. On the nonhospital business where we are strong, physician offices, home care, long-term care and emergency centers, emerging care centers, those kinds of things, surgery centers, we have seen relatively flat demand. But I think our team has done a particularly good job of continuing to expand our footprint, not only within our existing customers like selling through our private label product, but also expanding beyond our existing customer base and probably taking a share, in particular, in home care, where we've got a very good presence. So I think we are continuing to see our ability to grow revenue in Medical-Surgical as evidenced by the 5% growth this quarter, and we hope those trends will continue.

If you look out over the next two years, the remainder of the amortization period, we certainly had an original plan to sell and implement sufficient customers to justify the asset that we had on the balance sheet. What's really happened is that our customers in there, complete focus on clinicals, have not just stopped buying things for now other than clinical, but they've also pushed out implementations and stop implementing. You combine that with the fact that as we look at the way the environment and requirements to what this product needs to do has evolve, we also, frankly, decided that given what was going on with our customers, it made sense for us to step back, and frankly, focus on finishing out the development of this product to meet all the new and latest requirements. That's going to take us a number of quarters. And as we do that, we're going to aim for those few customers that want to implement. We're going to push some of those implementations out. The combination of all those things is what pushed the revenues out beyond the remaining amortization period. I think it's important to realize though that these products, these kinds of products are products that should have usable life spans of 10, 20, 25 years. So there's this accounting convention where we need to look at the next three years. But our full expectation and hope here is that we're building the next equivalent of some of our legacy revenue cycle product, which we still have happy customers running 20, 30 years after they put them in.

I'll attempt to answer the question. I think that the discussion that we've been having around Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management is isolated to hospital financial systems, and it's not a commentary on the rest of our software or physician software, even Horizon Clinicals. It really is the hospital market place saying to us -- our customer base where we would naturally go to sell these enterprise revenue management products, our customers are saying to us, ""We're happy running that 20-year-old to 30-year-old software we bought from you 20 or 30 years ago."" And our priority is 
to is to get you clinical systems installed and to make sure we purchase the right systems and we get to our meaningful use and be able to document that from a regulatory and a compliance perspective to get the stimulus dollars that the industry is chasing. I don't believe that Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management that we are losing any hospital customers or potential customers to competing systems. Once again, I'm really talking about our existing customer base was the natural place to sell this product and those customers are largely looking to build out McKesson solutions as opposed to taking out McKesson solutions. That's not to say that we, on occasion, don't lose a  customer. And it's not to say that we haven't lost a clinical customer or a financial customer. I'm just talking about enterprise revenue management, and the revenue issues we have in that product really are not product-based as much as they are market-based. And then I believe competitive market since our customers' interest has gone to a different direction. As it relates to the overall portfolio and we think about financial systems that our customers are buying, frankly, they're not replacing their old legacy HIS systems. They are buying some what we call the bolt-on products on occasion to augment the systems that they already have deployed. And in fact, RelayHealth is selling many of those products. Some of them delivered Software as a Service where they can easily augment the functionality of existing McKesson STAR systems with Relay Software as a Service applications, where they're able to get a quick return on investment. And so when they see a quick return on investment and something they could put into the system very quickly and make use of if they're doing it, but they're not going to undertake, at least in this near-term environment, a complete redo of their financial systems in these hospitals when they're busy with clinical implementations.

The March quarter in every year is always by far our biggest quarter just due to it being the end of the sales year.

The March quarter in every year is always by far our biggest quarter just due to it being the end of the sales year. And what you will see this year, that will be compounded by the implementation schedule and the certification and GA schedule. All that said, you should still see sequentially and year-over-year a much stronger December quarter than what you've seen from us the last two quarters. But March will be unusually strong. On the deferred revenue, we don't call out a number. There is a number on our balance sheet, which is not a particularly helpful number because frankly, it's driven by the very large annual payments customers make to us for maintenance. And again, we do that once a year, and then pull it out to that balance sheet item. So the number that's on the balance sheet is not huge. It's a part of what needs to happen and what will get recognized in the December-March quarter. But it's not the majority piece. The majority of it is just things that are not on the balance sheet today and will get recognize as we hit milestones."
