This morning, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $0.40 and full year 2009 operating earnings per share of $2.75, in line with our previous full year guidance.",745,"Good morning. Thank you, Kim, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $0.40 and full year 2009 operating earnings per share of $2.75, in line with our previous full year guidance. The fourth quarter performance reflects a Commercial medical benefit ratio of 85%, favorable to our previous guidance of approximately 86.5%. This positive variance to our guidance includes a 20-basis point improvement from lower-than-projected H1N1 flu cost, with the remainder due to improved premium yields and lower medical cost.  Fourth quarter performance also reflects lower-than-projected Group Insurance operating earnings due to an increase in reserves in our Long Term Disability business and excellent investment returns and cash flow from operations.The underwriting margin improvement plans we put in place during 2009 are beginning to show positive results. We considered the long-term aspect of customer relationships in our plans to improve our underwriting margin by pricing each customer or group of customers to an appropriate margin. To date, we have repriced a significant portion of our Commercial Insured business and are creating momentum toward the improvement of our long-term operating margin profile.We continue to focus on strategically positioning the company for future success, along with four dimensions of our strategy: Segmentation, integration, consumerism and operational excellence. As examples, we commercialized and now serve more than 700,000 members on our leading-edge Aetna One integrated platform. As a testament to the success of this new innovative model, Aetna was recently awarded the J. D. Power and Associates certification for providing an outstanding customer service experience through our Aetna One concierge customer service center. In addition, we acquired Horizon Behavioral Services to further strengthen Aetna's Behavioral Health business and enhance our portfolio of integrated product offerings, making Aetna the second-largest player in the domestic Employee Assistance Program marketplace.  Also, to sustain leadership in segmenting the market and focusing on creating value for our customers, we increased net medical membership by more than 1.2 million members during the year, including almost 500,000 members in our newer segments. Looking ahead to 2010, we expect to face continued environmental challenges during 2010 and have factored them into our outlook. These challenges include continued macroeconomic pressures impacting employment growth and medical cost; pressure on premium and fee yields, as plan sponsors deal with budgetary concerns; lower Medicare reimbursement rates, which again do not keep pace with medical cost trend; and heightened activity in the regulatory and public policy environment.Given all of these, we project a decline in first quarter medical membership of approximately 350,000 members, favorable to our original outlook of a decline of 600,000 to 650,000 members; a full year 2010 Commercial medical benefit ratio that improves from the 84.5% we reported in 2009 by up to 50 basis points; a 2010 total company before-tax operating margin that is lower than 2009; and full year operating earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.65.We continue to view 2010 as a repositioning year, a year that will not fully reflect the earnings potential of our business but positions us well for the future. Joe will provide additional details on our 2010 outlook in a moment. Mark will then provide insight into the key operational drivers of our expected 2010 performance. First though, I would like to briefly comment on healthcare reform. Recent developments have created some uncertainty regarding specific mix steps. However, the fundamental trends and underlying issues driving the need for meaningful healthcare reform continue. And it is our hope that we return to a bipartisan approach to address the accessibility and affordability of healthcare in America.I have a great deal of confidence in Aetna and our long-term future. We are intensely focused on the operational performance of our businesses and are confident that actions we have taken will yield positive results. We have a customer-focused strategy and a seasoned leadership team. We have a robust product suite that includes benefit designs, product features and price points that continue to meet the needs of our customers. And our financial strength, capital structure and cash flow generation continue to be excellent.I would like to thank our employees for their unwavering dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. We are confident that through their efforts, we will reposition Aetna for success in 2010 and beyond. I will now turn the call over to Joe Zubretsky to provide insight into our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our outlook for 2010. Joe?"

Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $0.40 and full year operating earnings per share of $2.75, in line with our most recent full year guidance. Fourth quarter highlights include a rep",1745,"Thank you, Ron, and good morning. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $0.40 and full year operating earnings per share of $2.75, in line with our most recent full year guidance. Fourth quarter highlights include a reported Commercial medical benefit ratio of 85%, 150 basis points better than our previous projection of approximately 86.5%; lower-than-projected Group Insurance operating earnings, as we increased reserves in our Long Term Disability business; favorable prior-period reserve development in all medical product lines; and excellent investment returns and operating cash flows. I will now discuss the drivers of our 2009 financial performance, starting with operating margin and its key components: Revenue, medical costs and operating expenses. Full year 2009 pretax operating margin was 6.4%, a 390-basis point decrease from 2008, due primarily to lower Commercial risk underwriting margin and higher pension expense.Full year 2009 Health Care revenue grew 10.2%, driven by a 10.7% increase in Health Care premiums and an approximate 6% increase in Health Care fees and other revenue. Health Care premium growth reflects an increase in Commercial premium of approximately 7.5%, resulting from 4% volume growth and a rate increase of 5%, partially offset by a 1.5% decline from product mix. Premium growth also reflects strong performance in our Medicare and Medicaid businesses, with year-over-year increases of 19% and 56% respectively. This growth was the result of attracting new customers through strong value propositions in those markets.The approximate 6% year-over-year increase in Health Care fees and other revenue was due to a 9% increase in volume, resulting from strong membership growth in our Commercial ASC business, partially offset by a 3% decline from the impact of lower fee yields in product and service mix.The second key component of operating margin results is medical cost. Fourth quarter and full year 2009 total medical benefit ratios were 85.4% and 85.2% respectively, favorable to our previous guidance. Our reported Commercial medical benefit ratio was 85% for the fourth quarter, 150-basis points better than our previous guidance, and 84.5% for the full year. This positive variance to our guidance includes 20 basis points from lower-than-projected H1N1 flu costs, with the remainder due to improved premium yields and lower medical costs. Cost related to COBRA were generally in line with previous projections.We reported favorable prior-period reserve development of $103 million before tax during the quarter. This development includes favorable Commercial reserve development of $59 million, that was essentially offset by the re-establishment of the reserve strengthening we previously reported and continued to hold on our December 31 balance sheet. Fourth quarter favorable prior-period reserve development also included $28 million and $16 million in Medicare and Medicaid respectively. After giving effect to the prior-period development we had off of December 31, 2008, reserves, total 2009 year-end health reserves increased approximately 15% year-over-year relative to the annual increase in full year total health premium of approximately 11%.2009 medical cost trend was approximately 9%, in line with our previous guidance. Trends within major healthcare cost categories were in line with the projections we have shared with you previously. Days claims payable remained at 43.8 days as of December 31, in line with the September 30 level. Our projected days claims payable remains in the low-40s, reflecting the effectiveness and efficiency of our claim operations. Group Insurance full year operating earnings were $103.8 million, a 24% decline from 2008. This includes a fourth quarter operating loss of $14.1 million, as solid Group Life results were more than offset by a reserve increase of approximately $50 million before tax in our Long Term Disability business. This reserve increase reflects longer disability claim durations, due in part to the soft economy, and a lower reserve discount rate, reflecting our new outlook for yields in the investment portfolio that supports this business.  Our disability underwriting practices remain sound, as new claim incidence rates are in line with expectations and our current pricing reflects updated investment yield and claim duration assumptions. The third key component of operating margin results is operating expense management. We continue to invest in our future to capitalize on marketplace opportunities for future profitable growth, while also improving productivity and ensuring that we appropriately serve the needs of our customers.  For the year, we achieved a business segment operating expense ratio of 17.6%, in line with our previous guidance. This 70-basis point year-over-year improvement was the result of revenue growth and positive fixed cost leverage, as well as a decrease in our performance-based variable compensation pool.Turning now to membership, we ended 2009 with 18.9 million medical members, a sequential decline of 113,000 members. This was approximately 100,000 members better than our previous outlook, due primarily to better-than-projected customer retention and lower-than-projected economic-related membership attrition. The final area of financial performance I will comment on is our investment performance in management of capital. Investment performance closed the year on a very positive note. Fourth quarter net investment income on our continuing business portfolio, primarily Health Care and Group Insurance, was $176 million, an increase over the prior-year quarter by $46 million. This increase was due primarily to higher average asset levels and improved returns on alternative investments, partially offset by lower average yields.  For the full year, continuing business net investment income increased by $75 million to $689 million before tax. The investment portfolio also had a very strong year from a valuation perspective. The tightening of credit spreads resulted in a net pretax unrealized gain position for our continuing business portfolio of $517 million as of December 31, a mark-to-market improvement of $870 million during the year.Now with respect to liquidity and capital management, our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be strong. Our balance sheet metrics are excellent. As of December 31, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of approximately 30%; $6.8 billion of total adjusted capital, more than $5.7 billion in excess of our regulatory requirements; and a risk-based capital ratio of approximately 600% of the authorized control level.We generated significant excess capital during 2009. We began 2009 with holding company liquidity of approximately $100 million. Full year dividends to our parent company totaled approximately $640 million and net commercial paper issuance was $265 million. This cash flow generation enabled us to cover fixed charges from the Horizon acquisition and repurchased approximately $775 million of shares.  We ended the year with approximately $100 million of holding company liquidity and approximately $480 million of commercial paper. During the year, we repurchased 28.9 million shares. Our basic share count was 430.8 million at December 31, down from 456.3 million at the beginning of 2009. We produced excellent operating cash flows during the fourth quarter, with Health Care and Group Insurance GAAP operating cash flow representing approximately 320% of operating earnings, excluding pension expense. Drivers of this performance were the timing of Medicare cash receipts, increased Group Insurance reserves, higher Commercial premium collections and lower income tax payments. Our full year cash flow ratio was approximately 200%, exceeding our previous guidance.I will now provide some additional insight into our outlook for 2010. Overall, we project 2010 operating earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.65. This year-over-year operating earnings per share decline, using the $2.60 midpoint of our operating earnings per share guidance range, is due to several factors, including a year-over-year increase in Commercial insured underwriting margin of approximately $0.08 per share, as operating margin expansion is partially offset by a decline in volume; a decline in Medicare underwriting margin of approximately $0.08 per share and a decline in ASC fees of approximately $0.05 per share, partially offset by an improvement in Group Insurance underwriting results of approximately $0.05 per share; a decrease of approximately $0.35 per share due to higher business segment SG&A expenses; and improvement from capital actions and lower pension financing costs of approximately $0.20 per share. Our 2010 projections include a total net medical membership decline of approximately 350,000 members during the first quarter, an improvement from our previous outlook due to a more successful open enrollment season in national accounts and growth in newer segments.The first quarter change in total medical membership includes a decrease of approximately 450,000 Commercial insured members, an increase of approximately 75,000 Commercial ASC members and a combined increase of approximately 25,000 members in Medicare and Medicaid.Total net medical membership is projected to remain generally flat for the remaining three quarters of the year, leading to a projected 1% to 2% decline in full year total company revenue. With respect to medical benefit ratios, we project a full year Commercial premium yield that exceeds medical cost trend of 9% plus or minus 50 basis points, leading to a full year Commercial medical benefit ratio that improves from the 84.5% we reported in 2009 by up to 50 basis points. For our Medicare business, we project a higher year-over-year medical benefit ratio, although still in the high-80s. While we expect to largely offset the impact of lower reimbursement rates, our experience-rated large group Medicare business is projected to have higher medical benefit ratios in 2010 compared to the favorable experience we had during 2009.2010 business segment SG&A expenses are projected to increase year-over-year. The majority of this increase is due to variable compensation pool restoration of approximately $100 million; funding of new initiatives, such as ICD-10 conversion costs and the TRICARE platform, should we prevail on the protest and retain the contract; and the full year impact of our Horizon acquisition.The impact of these items and some negative leverage associated with our membership and revenue outlook is projected to result in a 2010 business segment operating expense ratio of approximately 18.6%. Our projections exclude any impact of healthcare reform, such as taxes imposed upon us or costs we would incur to operationalize market or other reforms should legislation be enacted this year. These projections also assume a weighted average share count of approximately 430 million shares. We have been appropriately conservative in the assumption supporting our outlook. And as such, we do not project operating margin expansion in 2010. We have repriced a significant portion of our Commercial insured business and are creating momentum toward the improvement of our long-term operating margin profile. We will provide you with an update to our outlook for 2010 and beyond at our investor conference on March 19. I will now turn the call over to Mark Bertolini for an update on our businesses and the actions we are taking to improve our operational performance. Mark?"

We have been prudent and disciplined in our pricing strateg",829,"Thank you, Joe. I will now provide some additional insight into the performance of our Commercial Insured, Commercial ASC and Medicare business, starting first with the Commercial Insured update. We have been prudent and disciplined in our pricing strategies. Based upon our experience to date, we project achieved yields on our first quarter 2010 renewals to be in line with our expectations, due to our approach for examining experience by product, geography and segment for each renewal cohort, our strong distribution partner relationships and our widely-recognized reputation for service excellence in the marketplace.  As a result of our pricing actions, we plan to achieve a positive spread between premium yield and medical cost trend during 2010. As 80% of our 2010 member months have now been priced, we are confident that our pricing strategy is striking the appropriate balance between improving our Commercial medical benefit ratio and the retention of profitable Commercial Insured membership. Turning to medical costs, the quality and cost management actions we initiated last year are proceeding as anticipated in producing tangible benefits. These actions include contractual changes with providers to address the types of risks and behavioral shifts we experienced during 2009; restructuring of contracts for laboratory and other ancillary services to achieve more favorable terms; implementation of fee schedule changes, where appropriate; and increased utilization management at certain targeted facilities.We have also developed detailed plans to achieve additional reductions while ensuring quality in a variety of medical cost areas. I am confident in the robust management and measurement processes we have in place to ensure we deliver improved quality and total cost outcomes for our customers. With respect to Commercial ASC, Aetna is a widely-recognized leader in the national accounts customer market segment, serving 71 companies in the Fortune 100 and 56% of Fortune 500 companies. Our leading-edge Aetna One integrated platform now serves more than 700,000 members as of January 1. And we have a broad portfolio of products and services to meet the needs of our Commercial ASC customers.As we have shared with you previously, the challenging economic climate is prompting some customers in this segment to reduce short-term costs. This is putting pressure on our national accounts Commercial ASC fee yields. We are also experiencing a modest decline in product penetration and buy up [ph] programs purchased by our customers. But we continue to find ways to provide additional value in the marketplace. We also regularly look for opportunities to offset the impact of inflationary cost structure, with business process improvements, productivity and fixed cost leverage. In addition, over the last 90 days, we right-sized our business to offset the impact of inflation.Some comments now regarding Medicare, our Medicare strategy remains sound, with a well balanced portfolio of individual Medicare Advantage, Group Private Fee for Service and Medicare Part D business.  Our performance in the individual Medicare marketplace continues to be strong. We exited several Private Fee for Service markets, where we could not develop appropriate networks for our customers. This was offset by strong sales in individual network-based products, which continue to perform well. Our Group Private Fee for Service business, which had very favorable results in 2009, leverages our institutional sales and network management capabilities. As this market is largely experience-rated, these 2009 favorable results have been shared with our customers in 2010 negotiated prices. This pricing is projected to result in 2010 Group Private Fee for Service operating margins that are not as high as in 2009 but still meet expectations.Our January Part D results also illustrate the effectiveness of our Medicare strategy. We just concluded our Part D sale season, our most successful season to date, due to the competitiveness of our offerings, enhanced direct-to-consumer marketing efforts and the strength of our pharmacy management capabilities.  We look forward to continued strong financial performance in this business during 2010. Through well designed benefit plans, effective medical management, disciplined pricing and prudent provider contracting, we have been able to mitigate the majority of the impact of lower 2010 Medicare reimbursement rates, while still maintaining a very strong value proposition in the marketplace. As such, we project first quarter Medicare membership of approximately 450,000 members and first quarter Part D membership of approximately 550,000 members. In summary, the operational enhancements we put in place during 2009 are gaining traction. Our key areas of focus remain, accurately forecasting and managing medical quality and costs, pricing our business to an appropriate margin based on this forecasted level of medical costs and providing service excellence to our customers in the most efficient way possible. In fact, our continued focus on service excellence contributed to a net increase in medical membership of approximately 150,000 members during open enrollment. We remain intensely focused on improving performance in each of these areas across all of our businesses during 2010, and we continue to have a great deal of confidence in our long-term future. With that, I will turn the call back over to Kim Keck. Kim?"

This morning, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $0.40 and full year 2009 operating earnings per share of $2.75, in line with our previous full year guidance.",745,"Good morning. Thank you, Kim, and thank you, all, for joining us today. This morning, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $0.40 and full year 2009 operating earnings per share of $2.75, in line with our previous full year guidance. The fourth quarter performance reflects a Commercial medical benefit ratio of 85%, favorable to our previous guidance of approximately 86.5%. This positive variance to our guidance includes a 20-basis point improvement from lower-than-projected H1N1 flu cost, with the remainder due to improved premium yields and lower medical cost.  Fourth quarter performance also reflects lower-than-projected Group Insurance operating earnings due to an increase in reserves in our Long Term Disability business and excellent investment returns and cash flow from operations.The underwriting margin improvement plans we put in place during 2009 are beginning to show positive results. We considered the long-term aspect of customer relationships in our plans to improve our underwriting margin by pricing each customer or group of customers to an appropriate margin. To date, we have repriced a significant portion of our Commercial Insured business and are creating momentum toward the improvement of our long-term operating margin profile.We continue to focus on strategically positioning the company for future success, along with four dimensions of our strategy: Segmentation, integration, consumerism and operational excellence. As examples, we commercialized and now serve more than 700,000 members on our leading-edge Aetna One integrated platform. As a testament to the success of this new innovative model, Aetna was recently awarded the J. D. Power and Associates certification for providing an outstanding customer service experience through our Aetna One concierge customer service center. In addition, we acquired Horizon Behavioral Services to further strengthen Aetna's Behavioral Health business and enhance our portfolio of integrated product offerings, making Aetna the second-largest player in the domestic Employee Assistance Program marketplace.  Also to sustain leadership in segmenting the market and focusing on creating value for our customers, we increased net medical membership by more than 1.2 million members during the year, including almost 500,000 members in our newer segments. Looking ahead to 2010, we expect to face continued environmental challenges during 2010 and have factored them into our outlook. These challenges include continued macroeconomic pressures impacting employment growth and medical cost; pressure on premium and fee yields, as plan sponsors deal with budgetary concerns; lower Medicare reimbursement rates, which again do not keep pace with medical cost trend; and heightened activity in the regulatory and public policy environment.Given all of this, we project a decline in first quarter medical membership of approximately 350,000 members, favorable to our original outlook of a decline of 600,000 to 650,000 members; a full year 2010 Commercial medical benefit ratio that improves from the 84.5% we reported in 2009 by up to 50 basis points; a 2010 total company, before-tax operating margin that is lower than 2009; and full year operating earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.65.We continue to view 2010 as a repositioning year, a year that will not fully reflect the earnings potential of our business but positions us well for the future. Joe will provide additional details on our 2010 outlook in a moment. Mark will then provide insight into the key operational drivers of our expected 2010 performance. First though, I would like to briefly comment on healthcare reform. Recent developments have created some uncertainty regarding specific mix steps. However, the fundamental trends and underlying issues driving the need for meaningful healthcare reform continue. And it is our hope that we return to a bipartisan approach to address the accessibility and affordability of healthcare in America.I have a great deal of confidence in Aetna and our long-term future. We are intensely focused on the operational performance of our businesses and are confident that actions we have taken will yield positive results. We have a customer-focused strategy and a seasoned leadership team. We have a robust product suite that includes benefit designs, product features and price points that continue to meet the needs of our customers. And our financial strength, capital structure and cash flow generation continue to be excellent.I would like to thank our employees for their unwavering dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. We are confident that through their efforts, we will reposition Aetna for success in 2010 and beyond. I will now turn the call over to Joe Zubretsky to provide insight into our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our outlook for 2010. Joe?"

Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $0.40 and full year operating earnings per share of $2.75, in line with our most recent full year guidance. Fourth quarter highlights include a rep",1745,"Thank you, Ron, and good morning. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $0.40 and full year operating earnings per share of $2.75, in line with our most recent full year guidance. Fourth quarter highlights include a reported Commercial medical benefit ratio of 85%, 150 basis points better than our previous projection of approximately 86.5%; lower-than-projected Group Insurance operating earnings, as we increased reserves in our Long Term Disability business; favorable prior-period reserve development in all medical product lines; and excellent investment returns and operating cash flows. I will now discuss the drivers of our 2009 financial performance, starting with operating margin and its key components: Revenue, medical costs and operating expenses. Full year 2009 pretax operating margin was 6.4%, a 390-basis point decrease from 2008, due primarily to lower Commercial risk underwriting margin and higher pension expense.Full year 2009 Health Care revenue grew 10.2%, driven by a 10.7% increase in Health Care premiums and an approximate 6% increase in Health Care fees and other revenue. Health Care premium growth reflects an increase in Commercial premium of approximately 7.5%, resulting from 4% volume growth and a rate increase of 5%, partially offset by a 1.5% decline from product mix. Premium growth also reflects strong performance in our Medicare and Medicaid businesses, with year-over-year increases of 19% and 56% respectively. This growth was the result of attracting new customers through strong value propositions in those markets.The approximate 6% year-over-year increase in Health Care fees and other revenue was due to a 9% increase in volume, resulting from strong membership growth in our Commercial ASC business, partially offset by a 3% decline from the impact of lower fee yields in product and service mix.The second key component of operating margin results is medical cost. Fourth quarter and full year 2009 total medical benefit ratios were 85.4% and 85.2% respectively, favorable to our previous guidance. Our reported Commercial medical benefit ratio was 85% for the fourth quarter, 150-basis points better than our previous guidance, and 84.5% for the full year. This positive variance to our guidance includes 20 basis points from lower-than-projected H1N1 flu costs, with the remainder due to improved premium yields and lower medical costs. Cost related to COBRA were generally in line with previous projections.We reported favorable prior-period reserve development of $103 million before tax during the quarter. This development includes favorable Commercial reserve development of $59 million, that was essentially offset by the re-establishment of the reserve strengthening we previously reported and continued to hold on our December 31 balance sheet. Fourth quarter favorable prior-period reserve development also included $28 million and $16 million in Medicare and Medicaid respectively. After giving effect to the prior-period development we had off of December 31, 2008, reserves, total 2009 year-end health reserves increased approximately 15% year-over-year relative to the annual increase in full year total health premium of approximately 11%.2009 medical cost trend was approximately 9%, in line with our previous guidance. Trends within major healthcare cost categories were in line with the projections we have shared with you previously. Days claims payable remained at 43.8 days as of December 31, in line with the September 30 level. Our projected days claims payable remains in the low-40s, reflecting the effectiveness and efficiency of our claim operations. Group Insurance full year operating earnings were $103.8 million, a 24% decline from 2008. This includes a fourth quarter operating loss of $14.1 million, as solid Group Life results were more than offset by a reserve increase of approximately $50 million before tax in our Long Term Disability business. This reserve increase reflects longer disability claim durations, due in part to the soft economy, and a lower reserve discount rate, reflecting our new outlook for yields in the investment portfolio that supports this business.  Our disability underwriting practices remain sound, as new claim incidence rates are in line with expectations and our current pricing reflects updated investment yield and claim duration assumptions. The third key component of operating margin results is operating expense management. We continue to invest in our future to capitalize on marketplace opportunities for future profitable growth, while also improving productivity and ensuring that we appropriately serve the needs of our customers.  For the year, we achieved a business segment operating expense ratio of 17.6%, in line with our previous guidance. This 70-basis point year-over-year improvement was the result of revenue growth and positive fixed cost leverage, as well as a decrease in our performance-based variable compensation pool.Turning now to membership, we ended 2009 with 18.9 million medical members, a sequential decline of 113,000 members. This was approximately 100,000 members better than our previous outlook, due primarily to better-than-projected customer retention and lower-than-projected economic-related membership attrition. The final area of financial performance I will comment on is our investment performance in management of capital. Investment performance closed the year on a very positive note. Fourth quarter net investment income on our continuing business portfolio, primarily Health Care and Group Insurance, was $176 million, an increase over the prior-year quarter by $46 million. This increase was due primarily to higher average asset levels and improved returns on alternative investments, partially offset by lower average yields.  For the full year, continuing business net investment income increased by $75 million to $689 million before tax. The investment portfolio also had a very strong year from a valuation perspective. The tightening of credit spreads resulted in a net pretax unrealized gain position for our continuing business portfolio of $517 million as of December 31, a mark-to-market improvement of $870 million during the year.Now with respect to liquidity and capital management, our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be strong. Our balance sheet metrics are excellent. As of December 31, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of approximately 30%; $6.8 billion of total adjusted capital, more than $5.7 billion in excess of our regulatory requirements; and a risk-based capital ratio of approximately 600% of the authorized control level.We generated significant excess capital during 2009. We began 2009 with holding company liquidity of approximately $100 million. Full year dividends to our parent company totaled approximately $640 million and net commercial paper issuance was $265 million. This cash flow generation enabled us to cover fixed charges from the Horizon acquisition and repurchased approximately $775 million of shares.  We ended the year with approximately $100 million of holding company liquidity and approximately $480 million of commercial paper. During the year, we repurchased 28.9 million shares. Our basic share count was 430.8 million at December 31, down from 456.3 million at the beginning of 2009. We produced excellent operating cash flows during the fourth quarter, with Health Care and Group Insurance GAAP operating cash flow representing approximately 320% of operating earnings, excluding pension expense. Drivers of this performance were the timing of Medicare cash receipts, increased Group Insurance reserves, higher Commercial premium collections and lower income tax payments. Our full year cash flow ratio was approximately 200%, exceeding our previous guidance.I will now provide some additional insight into our outlook for 2010. Overall, we project 2010 operating earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.65. This year-over-year operating earnings per share decline, using the $2.60 midpoint of our operating earnings per share guidance range, is due to several factors, including a year-over-year increase in Commercial insured underwriting margin of approximately $0.08 per share, as operating margin expansion is partially offset by a decline in volume; a decline in Medicare underwriting margin of approximately $0.08 per share and a decline in ASC fees of approximately $0.05 per share, partially offset by an improvement in Group Insurance underwriting results of approximately $0.05 per share; a decrease of approximately $0.35 per share due to higher business segment SG&A expenses; and improvement from capital actions and lower pension financing costs of approximately $0.20 per share. Our 2010 projections include a total net medical membership decline of approximately 350,000 members during the first quarter, an improvement from our previous outlook due to a more successful open enrollment season in national accounts and growth in newer segments.The first quarter change in total medical membership includes a decrease of approximately 450,000 Commercial insured members, an increase of approximately 75,000 Commercial ASC members and a combined increase of approximately 25,000 members in Medicare and Medicaid.Total net medical membership is projected to remain generally flat for the remaining three quarters of the year, leading to a projected 1% to 2% decline in full year total company revenue. With respect to medical benefit ratios, we project a full year Commercial premium yield that exceeds medical cost trend of 9% plus or minus 50 basis points, leading to a full year Commercial medical benefit ratio that improves from the 84.5% we reported in 2009 by up to 50 basis points. For our Medicare business, we project a higher year-over-year medical benefit ratio, although still in the high-80s. While we expect to largely offset the impact of lower reimbursement rates, our experience-rated large group Medicare business is projected to have higher medical benefit ratios in 2010 compared to the favorable experience we had during 2009.2010 business segment SG&A expenses are projected to increase year-over-year. The majority of this increase is due to variable compensation pool restoration of approximately $100 million; funding of new initiatives, such as ICD-10 conversion costs and the TRICARE platform, should we prevail on the protest and retain the contract; and the full year impact of our Horizon acquisition.The impact of these items and some negative leverage associated with our membership and revenue outlook is projected to result in a 2010 business segment operating expense ratio of approximately 18.6%. Our projections exclude any impact of healthcare reform, such as taxes imposed upon us or costs we would incur to operationalize market or other reforms should legislation be enacted this year. These projections also assume a weighted average share count of approximately 430 million shares. We have been appropriately conservative in the assumption supporting our outlook. And as such, we do not project operating margin expansion in 2010. We have repriced a significant portion of our Commercial Insured business and are creating momentum toward the improvement of our long-term operating margin profile. We will provide you with an update to our outlook for 2010 and beyond at our investor conference on March 19. I will now turn the call over to Mark Bertolini for an update on our businesses and the actions we are taking to improve our operational performance. Mark?"

I will now provide some additional insight into the performance of our Commercial Insured, Commercial ASC and Medicare business, starting first with the Commercial Insured update. We have been prudent and disciplined in our pricing strategies. Based upon our experience to date, we project achieved yields on our first quarter 2010 renewals to be in line with our expectations, due to our approach for examining experience by product, geography and segment for each renewal cohort, our strong distribution partner relationships and our widely-recognized reputation for service excellence in the marketplace.  As a result of our pricing actions, we plan to achieve a positive spread between premium yield and medical cost trend during 2010. As 80% of our 2010 member months have now been priced, we are confident that our pricing strategy is striking the appropriate balance between improving our Commercial medical benefit ratio and the retention of profitable Commercial Insured membership. Turning to medical costs, the quality and cost management actions we initiated last year are proceeding as anticipated in producing tangible benefits. These actions include contractual changes with providers to address the types of risks and behavioral shifts we experienced during 2009; restructuring of contracts for laboratory and other ancillary services to achieve more favorable terms; implementation of fee schedule changes, where appropriate; and increased utilization management at certain targeted facilities.We have also developed detailed plans to achieve additional reductions while ensuring quality in a variety of medical cost areas. I am confident in the robust management and measurement processes we have in place to ensure we deliver improved quality and total cost outcomes for our customers. With respect to Commercial ASC, Aetna is a widely-recognized leader in the national accounts customer market segment, serving 71 companies in the Fortune 100 and 56% of Fortune 500 companies. Our leading-edge Aetna One integrated platform now serves more than 700,000 members as of January 1. And we have a broad portfolio of products and services to meet the needs of our Commercial ASC customers.As we have shared with you previously, the challenging economic climate is prompting some customers in this segment to reduce short-term costs. This is putting pressure on our national accounts Commercial ASC fee yields. We are also experiencing a modest decline in product penetration and buy up programs purchased by our customers. But we continue to find ways to provide additional value in the marketplace. We also regularly look for opportunities to offset the impact of inflationary cost structure, with business process improvements, productivity and fixed cost leverage. In addition, over the last 90 days, we right-sized our business to offset the impact of inflation.Some comments now regarding Medicare, our Medicare strategy remains sound, with a well balanced portfolio of individual Medicare Advantage, Group Private Fee for Service and Medicare Part D business.  Our performance in the individual Medicare marketplace continues to be strong. We exited several Private Fee for Service markets, where we could not develop appropriate networks for our customers. This was offset by strong sales in individual network-based products, which continue to perform well. Our Group Private Fee for Service business, which had very favorable results in 2009, leverages our institutional sales and network management capabilities. As this market is largely experience-rated, these 2009 favorable results have been shared with our customers in 2010 negotiated prices. This pricing is projected to result in 2010 Group Private Fee for Service operating margins that are not as high as in 2009 but still meet expectations.Our January Part D results also illustrate the effectiveness of our Medicare strategy. We just concluded our Part D sale season, our most successful season to date, due to the competitiveness of our offerings, enhanced direct-to-consumer marketing efforts and the strength of our pharmacy management capabilities.  We look forward to continued strong financial performance in this business during 2010. Through well designed benefit plans, effective medical management, disciplined pricing and prudent provider contracting, we have been able to mitigate the majority of the impact of lower 2010 Medicare reimbursement rates, while still maintaining a very strong value proposition in the marketplace. As such, we project first quarter Medicare membership of approximately 450,000 members and first quarter Part D membership of approximately 550,000 members. In summary, the operational enhancements we put in place during 2009 are gaining traction. Our key areas of focus remain, accurately forecasting and managing medical quality and costs, pricing our business to an appropriate margin based on this forecasted level of medical costs and providing service excellence to our customers in the most efficient way possible. In fact, our continued focus on service excellence contributed to a net increase in medical membership of approximately 150,000 members during open enrollment. We remain intensely focused on improving performance in each of these areas across all of our businesses during 2010, and we continue to have a great deal of confidence in our long-term future. With that, I will turn the call back over to Kim Keck. Kim?"

And all of us have been competing in that space. That's the number that everybody can measure one company against the other. In these additional add-ons and by a premium products, we've been offering over the years, we've been largely been able to offset or grow our fee yields as a result. Employers are doing exactly the same thing we're doing as a company, which is looking at our line items, understanding what we can afford right now and they're taking action on some of those. And so we're seeing less of an attitude toward buying buy-ups while the base fees are still very competitive and continue to be a competitive marketplace. However, we are seeing some employers' bias. As we noted earlier, in our Aetna One platform people are buying it. We have now 700,000 members in that product. And we expect that as the economy turns around, that pricing market will become much more rational."

Now what we have to watch for and what we're looking for is what is the retro lapse potential, particularly in Small gGoup or half the cases lapse after the effective date.

This morning, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $0.98. Excluding favorable prior-period development, first quarter operating earnings per share were $0.77, $0.05",1000,"Good morning. Thank you, Kim, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $0.98. Excluding favorable prior-period development, first quarter operating earnings per share were $0.77, $0.05 higher than the consensus estimate of $0.72, as a result of sound operating fundamentals. 
Our commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.1% or 82.9% excluding favorable prior-period development, which is 60 basis points better than our guidance of approximately 83.5%. This first quarter performance was generally in line with expectations as a result of disciplined pricing actions and effective medical quality and cost management. First quarter results also include better-than-projected medical membership of approximately 18.7 million members, reflecting better-than-projected ASC growth. We are strategically positioning the company for future success, with the aspiration of shaping more effective healthcare systems. The three components of our strategy are: First, obtaining deep insight into the evolving needs of our customers to identify areas for future profitable growth; second, providing information and decision support to help our customers make better informed health decisions; and third, aspiring to achieve operational excellence in everything we do.  We are pleased to report strategic successes in each of these three areas during the first quarter. 
First, with respect to deep customer insight. Through sophisticated segmentation, we continue to diversify our revenue streams. Of note this quarter, we achieved commercial ASO membership growth of 157,000 members despite economic-related attrition of approximately 80,000 members. And by combining our strong geographical presence and marketplace relationships with acquired Medicaid capabilities, we were successful in growing our Medicaid business. In particular, we were awarded the new Medicaid contract in Pennsylvania, which combined with our new Medicaid Florida launch has the potential to add up to 60,000 new members this year, demonstrating our ability to provide value-added solutions to this growing marketplace. 
Second, with respect to information and decision support, our transparency, integration and engagement initiatives are designed to improve quality and lower total costs for our customers. By leveraging the power of technology to provide personalized evidence-based information, our goal is to create an information-driven marketplace. For example, we recently launched realtime payment estimators that allow members to get the care they need at the price that's right for them. These estimators display the costs of various procedures in different settings based upon their specific benefit plan and current deductible status before the service is rendered. This realtime price transparency is the next step in our strategy to drive true consumer behavior by enabling value-based purchasing. Our success in this area is also illustrated by the results of a recent study of Aetna HealthFund consumer-directed plans which demonstrated substantial savings and better engagement for our customers. The study found that employers with full-replacement health reimbursement arrangement and health savings account plans saved $18 million per 10,000 members over five years. Our growing consumer-directed health plan membership reflects our success in selling and effectively administering these plans and now stands at 2.2 million members as of March 31. 
Third, with respect to operational excellence. Aetna was recognized by Fortune as the most admired healthcare company for the third year in a row. In addition, our continued focus on operational excellence produced sequentially improved performance during the quarter across many of our operating metrics. 
In turning to our 2010 full-year outlook, we now project a commercial medical benefit ratio of 83.5% to 84% and operating earnings per share of $2.75 to $2.85. This revised outlook includes our better-than-projected performance and favorable prior-period development reported in the first quarter. It also reflects updated membership and SG&A projections. Our revised SG&A projection includes our current estimate of the costs we expect to incur in 2010 to prepare for healthcare reform. Joe will provide additional details on our 2010 outlook in a moment. Mark will then provide an update regarding the key operational drivers of our projected 2010 performance. 
First though, I would like to briefly comment on healthcare reform. There are still a great deal to be determined regarding how healthcare reform will actually be implemented. As anticipated, we are just now entering the regulation development phase and much in the legislation has been left to be determined by substantive regulation. We have been preparing for this phase for some time and are taking the same approach to the rulemaking process that we did to the legislative process. We are actively engaged in constructive, fact-based dialogue at the national level and with regulators in 50 states based upon our experience in making insurance markets work. Mark and Joe have mobilized a broad and experienced team to ensure reform is implemented at the company in a manner that is best for Aetna's customers, is compliant with all laws and regulations and continues to create value for shareholders. Once the regulations have been developed and there is more clarity with regard to implementation details, particularly those dealing with minimal medical benefit ratios, we will provide more specific guidance on our outlook. Although the recent legislation addresses access, the issues of affordability and quality remain unmet challenges for our nation. 
Aetna plays a significant role in helping our customers, both employers and individuals, meet the total quality and cost challenge. We are looking across the healthcare landscape as we believe reform will create strategic growth opportunities with an even greater imperative to manage quality and costs. I have a great deal of confidence in Aetna and our long-term future. We are continuing to improve the operational performance of our businesses to ensure we reach our full potential. 
We have a customer-focused strategy and a seasoned leadership team, and our financial strength and liquidity continue to be excellent. I would like to thank our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. We are confident that through their efforts, we will be successful in 2010 and beyond. I will now turn the call over to Joe Zubretsk to provide insight into our first quarter financial performance and our 2010 outlook. Joe?"
655542,99720386,58444,"Aetna Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ronnie, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $0.98, an increase of 2% compared to the prior-year quarter. Excluding prior-period reserve development, operating earnings per share was",1368,"Thanks, Ronnie, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $0.98, an increase of 2% compared to the prior-year quarter. Excluding prior-period reserve development, operating earnings per share was $0.77. Operating earnings decreased 3% compared to the prior-year quarter to $431 million as lower Commercial Underwriting margin was offset by favorable prior-period development. 
Other key highlights of the quarter include a Commercial medical benefit ratio of 81.1%, or 82.9% excluding favorable prior-period development, better-than-projected total medical membership of approximately 18.7 million members and excellent operating cash flows and very strong investment performance. 
I will now discuss the drivers of our first quarter financial performance, starting with operating margin and its key components. First quarter before-tax operating margin was 8.7%, or 7% excluding prior-period development, which is 4.6% on an after-tax basis. First quarter revenue of $8.5 billion reflects a 1% year-over-year decrease in Health Care revenue. This was the result of a 1% decrease in Health Care premium and a 1% increase in Health Care fees and other revenue. Health Care premium reflects a net decrease in Commercial premium of approximately 3.5% resulting from a volume decline of 8%, an overall rate increase of 9% and a 4.5% decline from product mix. This mix effect is due to increased benefit buy-downs and the fact that the majority of our membership attrition was in higher premium products. This mix effect is a key driver behind the year-over-year change in our reported premium yields and medical cost trends. Health Care premium also reflects a 4% increase in Medicare premium and 11% growth in Medicaid. Growth in Health Care fees and other revenue of 1% is due to stable year-over-year volume and a 1% increase in yield, reflecting continued pressure on fee yields and lower product penetration in this challenging economy. 
Our first quarter total medical benefit ratio was 82.5%, which includes $143 million before tax of favorable prior-period reserve development across all products: $92 million in Commercial, $38 million in Medicare and $13 million in Medicaid. 
Our first quarter Commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.1%, or 82.9% excluding prior-period development, which is 60 basis points better than our guidance of approximately 83.5%. This favorable variance to guidance is due primarily to lower-than-projected flu costs. Our first quarter also included some slight favorability due to the severe winter weather. The commercial favorable prior-period development of $92 million is due primarily to lower-than-expected flu costs in the fourth quarter, lower-than-projected medical cost trend for the month of December 2009 and the partial release of a previously-disclosed provision for certain provider medical costs related to prior years. We are not projecting this lower 2009 medical cost baseline to result in a lower medical cost run rate for 2010. 
Our first quarter Medicare and Medicaid medical benefit ratios were 87% and 85.9%, respectively. We continue to reflect appropriate assumptions regarding medical cost trend, operating metrics and payout patterns in setting reserves for estimated healthcare costs. Days claims payable were 46.9 days as of March 31, an increase of 3.1 days during the quarter due primarily to a temporary increase in pending claims that was fully reflected in our March 31 reserves. We project Days claims payable to be in the low 40s for the remainder of the year. 
Group Insurance operating earnings were $29 million during the quarter, representing a year-over-year decrease of 32%. The majority of this decline was due to unfavorable Group Life claim experienced during the quarter, resulting from several large claims in one account, which unfortunately lost several employees in the Haiti earthquake, and higher than normal gains on long-term care reserve transfers in the first quarter of 2009 as we continue to execute our strategy to transfer much of this business to other carriers. Long-term disability performance was slightly ahead of our projections. 
The third key component of operating margin results is operating expense management. We continue to invest in our future to capitalize on marketplace opportunities for future profitable growth. Our business segment operating expense ratio of 18.1% represents a year-over-year increase of 80 basis points and was in line with our projections. 
We ended the quarter with 18.7 million medical members, a sequential decline of 226,000. This contraction reflects a decline of 416,000 Commercial insured members across many of our customer segments, an increase of 157,000 Commercial ASC members, which is net of estimated economic-related attrition of 80,000 and increases of 18,000 and 15,000 members in Medicare and Medicaid, respectively. 
The final area of financial performance I will comment on is our investment performance and management of capital. First quarter investment performance was very strong. Net investment income on our continuing business portfolio was $186 million, $17 million higher than the prior year as growth in invested assets and stronger alternative investment returns more than offset a lower-yield environment. Our unrealized gain position on the continuing business portfolio improved and now stands at $598 million before tax as of March 31. 
Turning now to liquidity and capital management. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. Our balance sheet metrics are excellent. As of March 31, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 29.3% and $7 billion of adjusted statutory surplus, $5.9 billion in excess of our reported regulatory requirements. We also continue to target a risk-based capital ratio of approximately 600% of the authorized control level. 
Our liquidity is strong. We began and ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $100 million and $480 million of commercial paper outstanding. First quarter dividends to the parent were $330 million, which we deployed to fund $252 million of share repurchases and cover fixed charges of $78 million. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 7.2 million shares. Our basic share count was 424.9 million at March 31, down from $430.8 million at the beginning of the year. HealthCare and Group Insurance gap operating cash flow for the quarter represented approximately 200% of operating earnings excluding pension expense due to the timing of tax payments and the temporary increase in pending claims mentioned previously, both of which are projected to reverse in the second quarter. 
I will now provide some additional insight into our 2010 guidance. We now project 2010 operating earnings per share of $2.75 to $2.85, a $0.20 increase from our previous guidance. This projection reflects our current estimate for spending to prepare for healthcare reform, a weighted-average share count of approximately 430 million shares and the impact of the favorable first quarter prior-period reserve development as do all of our guidance metrics. In addition, consistent with previous projections, we project operating earnings per share in each of the remaining three quarters to be lower than the first quarter excluding development. 
Medical membership is projected to contract by approximately 150,000 members during the remainder of the year with the majority of the change occurring during the second quarter, as additional contraction in Commercial insured and ASC membership is partially offset by growth in Medicaid. This membership outlook leads to a projected decrease in full-year total company revenue of approximately 3%. 
With respect to medical benefit ratios, we project a full-year Commercial premium yield that exceeds medical cost trend, which we project to be at the low end of our 9%, plus or minus 50 basis point range. This leads to a 2010 Commercial medical benefit ratio of 83.5% to 84%, Commercial medical benefit ratios in the range of 84% to 85% for each of the remaining three quarters of the year and a 2010 Medicare medical benefit ratio that is higher than 2009 but still in the high 80s. 
For the full year, we also project a business segment operating expense ratio of approximately 18.9%, an increase of 30 basis points, due to our lower revenue projection and additional investments, particularly operational and process changes related to healthcare reform implementation. We are also projecting a full-year before-tax operating margin of approximately 6.5% and a debt to capitalization ratio of approximately 30%. 
In summary, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and are confident in our outlook for 2010. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for commentary on our operations. Mark?"

I'd like to start with an update on our first quarter operating performance and then provide some insight into the initiatives we are taking to ensure continued success in an evolving regulatory environment. As a reminder",684,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning. I'd like to start with an update on our first quarter operating performance and then provide some insight into the initiatives we are taking to ensure continued success in an evolving regulatory environment. As a reminder, the actions we initiated last year to improve our operational performance fall into two main categories: Medical quality and cost management, and pricing and underwriting. 
First, with respect to medical quality and cost management, we believe the quality and cost management actions we took last year are working as planned. These process enhancements focused on three areas: Claim payment and adjudication procedures; contractual changes for providers, ancillary contracts and fee schedules; and increased intensity of care and utilization management to improve quality and avoid unnecessary expense. As a result, our medical cost trend projection is now at the low end of our range of 9% plus or minus 50 basis points. This projection includes the effects associated with prolonged consumer and provider behavior changes and the impact of mental health parity legislation as well as inpatient costs trending at the high single to low double digits, outpatient costs trending at low double digits, physician costs at mid to high single digits and pharmacy costs at high single digits. 
Next, with respect to pricing and underwriting. Given the challenging economic environment and our first quarter change in Commercial-insured membership, our achieved premium yields have been impacted by significant mix changes as expected. We believe our disciplined strategy to better align pricing with medical costs is working. The spread between our premium yield and medical cost trend improved sequentially by 420 basis points during the quarter from negative 570 basis points to negative 150 basis points, excluding the impact of favorable prior-period development. This spread reflects some of the continuing impact of some second and third quarter 2009 renewal cohorts, but was generally in line with our expectations. We project a positive yield trend spread for the remaining three quarters of the year. We are encouraged by our first quarter performance. We are focused on delivering an improved yield trend spread that will provide additional insight on our progress as we obtain further visibility into the impact of mix and potential seasonality patterns on our book of business. 
I will now speak to the recent suspension by CMS of our marketing and enrollment for new Medicare members. We have built a very robust Medicare Part D business, now with over 600,000 members, and we take our obligations to our customers very seriously. Compliance problems of any nature are unacceptable to us. While we strive for service excellence with all of our customers, we did experience transition of care and other issues for some Medicare Part D members this quarter. We are working closely with CMS to address their concerns and fully resolve this matter as quickly as possible. This matter has my attention and that of Aetna’s entire senior team. Importantly, we have received a waiver from CMS to continue to enroll eligible members into existing contracted group Medicare plans through July 31, 2010. 
Turning now to healthcare reform. Late last year, Joe and I mobilized an experienced team of leaders to ensure that reform is implemented in a manner that is best for Aetna's customers, is compliant with all laws and regulations and continues to create value for our shareholders. The team is focused on all aspects of healthcare reform legislation with primary emphasis on those areas having immediate impact, particularly mandated benefits and minimum benefit ratio requirements in 2011. In addition, Ron, Joe and I are engaged to ensure that we identify the strategic business opportunities that may emerge as the result of reform. We have strong working relationships with the parties responsible for developing healthcare reform regulations, and we look forward to a continued dialogue and sharing of ideas at both the federal and state levels to ensure a successful implementation of reform. We remain committed as we have been in the past to be part of the solution. With that, I will turn the call back over to Kim. Kim?"

Most of the first quarter performance, while favorable, we view as non-recurring in nature, both the prior-period development and the favorable first quarter underlying results. So at this time, we see no need to reduce our medical cost forecast for the year. Obviously, as experience emergers, we might change our view. And I also think that your intuition about some of the other items was correct, but they generally offset each other. Our first quarter underlying Commercial list performance was favorable, but we have had to increase our SG&A forecast for the year, primarily to implement the operational protocols for healthcare reform. Those items largely offset each other so basically the prior-period development adds the increase to earnings per share for the year."

This morning, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $0.98. Excluding favorable prior-period development, first quarter operating earnings per share were $0.77, $0.05",1000,"Good morning. Thank you, Kim, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $0.98. Excluding favorable prior-period development, first quarter operating earnings per share were $0.77, $0.05 higher than the consensus estimate of $0.72, as a result of sound operating fundamentals. 
Our commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.1% or 82.9% excluding favorable prior-period development, which is 60 basis points better than our guidance of approximately 83.5%. This first quarter performance was generally in line with expectations as a result of disciplined pricing actions and effective medical quality and cost management. First quarter results also include better-than-projected medical membership of approximately 18.7 million members, reflecting better-than-projected ASC growth. We are strategically positioning the company for future success, with the aspiration of shaping more effective healthcare systems. The three components of our strategy are: First, obtaining deep insight into the evolving needs of our customers to identify areas for future profitable growth; second, providing information and decision support to help our customers make better informed health decisions; and third, aspiring to achieve operational excellence in everything we do.  We are pleased to report strategic successes in each of these three areas during the first quarter. 
First, with respect to deep customer insight. Through sophisticated segmentation, we continue to diversify our revenue streams. Of note this quarter, we achieved commercial ASO membership growth of 157,000 members despite economic-related attrition of approximately 80,000 members. And by combining our strong geographical presence and marketplace relationships with acquired Medicaid capabilities, we were successful in growing our Medicaid business. In particular, we were awarded the new Medicaid contract in Pennsylvania, which combined with our new Medicaid Florida launch has the potential to add up to 60,000 new members this year, demonstrating our ability to provide value-added solutions to this growing marketplace. 
Second, with respect to information and decision support, our transparency, integration and engagement initiatives are designed to improve quality and lower total costs for our customers. By leveraging the power of technology to provide personalized evidence-based information, our goal is to create an information-driven marketplace. For example, we recently launched realtime payment estimators that allow members to get the care they need at the price that's right for them. These estimators display the costs of various procedures in different settings based upon their specific benefit plan and current deductible status before the service is rendered. This realtime price transparency is the next step in our strategy to drive true consumer behavior by enabling value-based purchasing. Our success in this area is also illustrated by the results of a recent study of Aetna HealthFund consumer-directed plans which demonstrated substantial savings and better engagement for our customers. The study found that employers with full-replacement health reimbursement arrangement and health savings account plans saved $18 million per 10,000 members over five years. Our growing consumer-directed health plan membership reflects our success in selling and effectively administering these plans and now stands at 2.2 million members as of March 31. 
Third, with respect to operational excellence. Aetna was recognized by Fortune as the most admired healthcare company for the third year in a row. In addition, our continued focus on operational excellence produced sequentially improved performance during the quarter across many of our operating metrics. 
In turning to our 2010 full-year outlook, we now project a commercial medical benefit ratio of 83.5% to 84% and operating earnings per share of $2.75 to $2.85. This revised outlook includes our better-than-projected performance and favorable prior-period development reported in the first quarter. It also reflects updated membership and SG&A projections. Our revised SG&A projection includes our current estimate of the costs we expect to incur in 2010 to prepare for healthcare reform. Joe will provide additional details on our 2010 outlook in a moment. Mark will then provide an update regarding the key operational drivers of our projected 2010 performance. 
First though, I would like to briefly comment on healthcare reform. There are still a great deal to be determined regarding how healthcare reform will actually be implemented. As anticipated, we are just now entering the regulation development phase and much in the legislation has been left to be determined by substantive regulation. We have been preparing for this phase for some time and are taking the same approach to the rulemaking process that we did to the legislative process. We are actively engaged in constructive, fact-based dialogue at the national level and with regulators in 50 states based upon our experience in making insurance markets work. Mark and Joe have mobilized a broad and experienced team to ensure reform is implemented at the company in a manner that is best for Aetna's customers, is compliant with all laws and regulations and continues to create value for shareholders. Once the regulations have been developed and there is more clarity with regard to implementation details, particularly those dealing with minimal medical benefit ratios, we will provide more specific guidance on our outlook. Although the recent legislation addresses access, the issues of affordability and quality remain unmet challenges for our nation. 
Aetna plays a significant role in helping our customers, both employers and individuals, meet the total quality and cost challenge. We are looking across the healthcare landscape as we believe reform will create strategic growth opportunities with an even greater imperative to manage quality and costs. I have a great deal of confidence in Aetna and our long-term future. We are continuing to improve the operational performance of our businesses to ensure we reach our full potential. 
We have a customer-focused strategy and a seasoned leadership team, and our financial strength and liquidity continue to be excellent. I would like to thank our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. We are confident that through their efforts, we will be successful in 2010 and beyond. I will now turn the call over to Joe Zubretsk to provide insight into our first quarter financial performance and our 2010 outlook. Joe?

655542,99720386,58472,"Aetna Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ronnie, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $0.98, an increase of 2% compared to the prior-year quarter. Excluding prior-period reserve development, operating earnings per share was",1368,"Thanks, Ronnie, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $0.98, an increase of 2% compared to the prior-year quarter. Excluding prior-period reserve development, operating earnings per share was $0.77. Operating earnings decreased 3% compared to the prior-year quarter to $431 million as lower Commercial Underwriting margin was offset by favorable prior-period development. 
Other key highlights of the quarter include a Commercial medical benefit ratio of 81.1%, or 82.9% excluding favorable prior-period development, better-than-projected total medical membership of approximately 18.7 million members and excellent operating cash flows and very strong investment performance. 
I will now discuss the drivers of our first quarter financial performance, starting with operating margin and its key components. First quarter before-tax operating margin was 8.7%, or 7% excluding prior-period development, which is 4.6% on an after-tax basis. First quarter revenue of $8.5 billion reflects a 1% year-over-year decrease in Health Care revenue. This was the result of a 1% decrease in Health Care premium and a 1% increase in Health Care fees and other revenue. Health Care premium reflects a net decrease in Commercial premium of approximately 3.5% resulting from a volume decline of 8%, an overall rate increase of 9% and a 4.5% decline from product mix. This mix effect is due to increased benefit buy-downs and the fact that the majority of our membership attrition was in higher premium products. This mix effect is a key driver behind the year-over-year change in our reported premium yields and medical cost trends. Health Care premium also reflects a 4% increase in Medicare premium and 11% growth in Medicaid. Growth in Health Care fees and other revenue of 1% is due to stable year-over-year volume and a 1% increase in yield, reflecting continued pressure on fee yields and lower product penetration in this challenging economy. 
Our first quarter total medical benefit ratio was 82.5%, which includes $143 million before tax of favorable prior-period reserve development across all products: $92 million in Commercial, $38 million in Medicare and $13 million in Medicaid. 
Our first quarter Commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.1%, or 82.9% excluding prior-period development, which is 60 basis points better than our guidance of approximately 83.5%. This favorable variance to guidance is due primarily to lower-than-projected flu costs. Our first quarter also included some slight favorability due to the severe winter weather. The commercial favorable prior-period development of $92 million is due primarily to lower-than-expected flu costs in the fourth quarter, lower-than-projected medical cost trend for the month of December 2009 and the partial release of a previously-disclosed provision for certain provider medical costs related to prior years. We are not projecting this lower 2009 medical cost baseline to result in a lower medical cost run rate for 2010. 
Our first quarter Medicare and Medicaid medical benefit ratios were 87% and 85.9%, respectively. We continue to reflect appropriate assumptions regarding medical cost trend, operating metrics and payout patterns in setting reserves for estimated healthcare costs. Days claims payable were 46.9 days as of March 31, an increase of 3.1 days during the quarter due primarily to a temporary increase in pending claims that was fully reflected in our March 31 reserves. We project Days claims payable to be in the low 40s for the remainder of the year. 
Group Insurance operating earnings were $29 million during the quarter, representing a year-over-year decrease of 32%. The majority of this decline was due to unfavorable Group Life claim experienced during the quarter, resulting from several large claims in one account, which unfortunately lost several employees in the Haiti earthquake, and higher than normal gains on long-term care reserve transfers in the first quarter of 2009 as we continue to execute our strategy to transfer much of this business to other carriers. Long-term disability performance was slightly ahead of our projections. 
The third key component of operating margin results is operating expense management. We continue to invest in our future to capitalize on marketplace opportunities for future profitable growth. Our business segment operating expense ratio of 18.1% represents a year-over-year increase of 80 basis points and was in line with our projections. 
We ended the quarter with 18.7 million medical members, a sequential decline of 226,000. This contraction reflects a decline of 416,000 Commercial insured members across many of our customer segments, an increase of 157,000 Commercial ASC members, which is net of estimated economic-related attrition of 80,000 and increases of 18,000 and 15,000 members in Medicare and Medicaid, respectively. 
The final area of financial performance I will comment on is our investment performance and management of capital. First quarter investment performance was very strong. Net investment income on our continuing business portfolio was $186 million, $17 million higher than the prior year as growth in invested assets and stronger alternative investment returns more than offset a lower-yield environment. Our unrealized gain position on the continuing business portfolio improved and now stands at $598 million before tax as of March 31. 
Turning now to liquidity and capital management. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. Our balance sheet metrics are excellent. As of March 31, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 29.3% and $7 billion of adjusted statutory surplus, $5.9 billion in excess of our reported regulatory requirements. We also continue to target a risk-based capital ratio of approximately 600% of the authorized control level. 
Our liquidity is strong. We began and ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $100 million and $480 million of commercial paper outstanding. First quarter dividends to the parent were $330 million, which we deployed to fund $252 million of share repurchases and cover fixed charges of $78 million. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 7.2 million shares. Our basic share count was 424.9 million at March 31, down from $430.8 million at the beginning of the year. HealthCare and Group Insurance gap operating cash flow for the quarter represented approximately 200% of operating earnings excluding pension expense due to the timing of tax payments and the temporary increase in pending claims mentioned previously, both of which are projected to reverse in the second quarter. 
I will now provide some additional insight into our 2010 guidance. We now project 2010 operating earnings per share of $2.75 to $2.85, a $0.20 increase from our previous guidance. This projection reflects our current estimate for spending to prepare for healthcare reform, a weighted-average share count of approximately 430 million shares and the impact of the favorable first quarter prior-period reserve development as do all of our guidance metrics. In addition, consistent with previous projections, we project operating earnings per share in each of the remaining three quarters to be lower than the first quarter excluding development. 
Medical membership is projected to contract by approximately 150,000 members during the remainder of the year with the majority of the change occurring during the second quarter, as additional contraction in Commercial insured and ASC membership is partially offset by growth in Medicaid. This membership outlook leads to a projected decrease in full-year total company revenue of approximately 3%. 
With respect to medical benefit ratios, we project a full-year Commercial premium yield that exceeds medical cost trend, which we project to be at the low end of our 9%, plus or minus 50 basis point range. This leads to a 2010 Commercial medical benefit ratio of 83.5% to 84%, Commercial medical benefit ratios in the range of 84% to 85% for each of the remaining three quarters of the year and a 2010 Medicare medical benefit ratio that is higher than 2009 but still in the high 80s. 
For the full year, we also project a business segment operating expense ratio of approximately 18.9%, an increase of 30 basis points, due to our lower revenue projection and additional investments, particularly operational and process changes related to healthcare reform implementation. We are also projecting a full-year before-tax operating margin of approximately 6.5% and a debt to capitalization ratio of approximately 30%. 
In summary, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and are confident in our outlook for 2010. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for commentary on our operations. Mark?

I'd like to start with an update on our first quarter operating performance and then provide some insight into the initiatives we are taking to ensure continued success in an evolving regulatory environment. As a reminder",684,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning. I'd like to start with an update on our first quarter operating performance and then provide some insight into the initiatives we are taking to ensure continued success in an evolving regulatory environment. As a reminder, the actions we initiated last year to improve our operational performance fall into two main categories: Medical quality and cost management, and pricing and underwriting. 
First, with respect to medical quality and cost management, we believe the quality and cost management actions we took last year are working as planned. These process enhancements focused on three areas: Claim payment and adjudication procedures; contractual changes for providers, ancillary contracts and fee schedules; and increased intensity of care and utilization management to improve quality and avoid unnecessary expense. As a result, our medical cost trend projection is now at the low end of our range of 9% plus or minus 50 basis points. This projection includes the effects associated with prolonged consumer and provider behavior changes and the impact of mental health parity legislation as well as inpatient costs trending at the high single to low double digits, outpatient costs trending at low double digits, physician costs at mid to high single digits and pharmacy costs at high single digits. 
Next, with respect to pricing and underwriting. Given the challenging economic environment and our first quarter change in Commercial-insured membership, our achieved premium yields have been impacted by significant mix changes as expected. We believe our disciplined strategy to better align pricing with medical costs is working. The spread between our premium yield and medical cost trend improved sequentially by 420 basis points during the quarter from negative 570 basis points to negative 150 basis points, excluding the impact of favorable prior-period development. This spread reflects some of the continuing impact of some second and third quarter 2009 renewal cohorts, but was generally in line with our expectations. We project a positive yield trend spread for the remaining three quarters of the year. We are encouraged by our first quarter performance. We are focused on delivering an improved yield trend spread that will provide additional insight on our progress as we obtain further visibility into the impact of mix and potential seasonality patterns on our book of business. 
I will now speak to the recent suspension by CMS of our marketing and enrollment for new Medicare members. We have built a very robust Medicare Part D business, now with over 600,000 members, and we take our obligations to our customers very seriously. Compliance problems of any nature are unacceptable to us. While we strive for service excellence with all of our customers, we did experience transition of care and other issues for some Medicare Part D members this quarter. We are working closely with CMS to address their concerns and fully resolve this matter as quickly as possible. This matter has my attention and that of Aetna’s entire senior team. Importantly, we have received a waiver from CMS to continue to enroll eligible members into existing contracted group Medicare plans through July 31, 2010. 
Turning now to healthcare reform. Late last year, Joe and I mobilized an experienced team of leaders to ensure that reform is implemented in a manner that is best for Aetna's customers, is compliant with all laws and regulations and continues to create value for our shareholders. The team is focused on all aspects of healthcare reform legislation with primary emphasis on those areas having immediate impact, particularly mandated benefits and minimum benefit ratio requirements in 2011. In addition, Ron, Joe and I are engaged to ensure that we identify the strategic business opportunities that may emerge as the result of reform. We have strong working relationships with the parties responsible for developing healthcare reform regulations, and we look forward to a continued dialogue and sharing of ideas at both the federal and state levels to ensure a successful implementation of reform. We remain committed as we have been in the past to be part of the solution. With that, I will turn the call back over to Kim. Kim?

So at this time, we see no need to reduce our medical cost forecast for the year. Obviously, as experience emergers, we might change our view. And I also think that your intuition about some of the other items was correct, but they generally offset each other. Our first quarter underlying Commercial list performance was favorable, but we have had to increase our SG&A forecast for the year, primarily to implement the operational protocols for healthcare reform. Those items largely offset each other so basically the prior-period development adds the increase to earnings per share for the year.

This morning, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $0.98. Excluding favorable prior-period development, first quarter operating earnings per share were $0.77, $0.05",1000,"Good morning. Thank you, Kim, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $0.98. Excluding favorable prior-period development, first quarter operating earnings per share were $0.77, $0.05 higher than the consensus estimate of $0.72, as a result of sound operating fundamentals. 
Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.1% or 82.9% excluding favorable prior-period development, which is 60 basis points better than our guidance of approximately 83.5%. This first quarter performance was generally in line with expectations as a result of disciplined pricing actions and effective medical quality and cost management. First quarter results also include better-than-projected medical membership of approximately 18.7 million members, reflecting better-than-projected ASC growth. We are strategically positioning the company for future success, with the aspiration of shaping more effective healthcare systems. The three components of our strategy are: First, obtaining deep insight into the evolving needs of our customers to identify areas for future profitable growth; second, providing information and decision support to help our customers make better informed health decisions; and third, aspiring to achieve operational excellence in everything we do.  We are pleased to report strategic successes in each of these three areas during the first quarter. 
First, with respect to deep customer insight. Through sophisticated segmentation, we continue to diversify our revenue streams. Of note this quarter, we achieved Commercial ASO membership growth of 157,000 members despite economic-related attrition of approximately 80,000 members. And by combining our strong geographical presence and marketplace relationships with acquired Medicaid capabilities, we were successful in growing our Medicaid business. In particular, we were awarded the new Medicaid contract in Pennsylvania, which combined with our new Medicaid Florida launch has the potential to add up to 60,000 new members this year, demonstrating our ability to provide value-added solutions to this growing marketplace. 
Second, with respect to information and decision support, our transparency, integration and engagement initiatives are designed to improve quality and lower total costs for our customers. By leveraging the power of technology to provide personalized evidence-based information, our goal is to create an information-driven marketplace. For example, we recently launched realtime payment estimators that allow members to get the care they need at the price that's right for them. These estimators display the costs of various procedures in different settings based upon their specific benefit plan and current deductible status before the service is rendered. This realtime price transparency is the next step in our strategy to drive true consumer behavior by enabling value-based purchasing. Our success in this area is also illustrated by the results of a recent study of Aetna HealthFund consumer-directed plans which demonstrated substantial savings and better engagement for our customers. The study found that employers with full-replacement health reimbursement arrangement and health savings account plans saved $18 million per 10,000 members over five years. Our growing consumer-directed health plan membership reflects our success in selling and effectively administering these plans and now stands at 2.2 million members as of March 31. 
Third, with respect to operational excellence. Aetna was recognized by Fortune as the most admired healthcare company for the third year in a row. In addition, our continued focus on operational excellence produced sequentially improved performance during the quarter across many of our operating metrics. 
In turning to our 2010 full-year outlook, we now project a Commercial medical benefit ratio of 83.5% to 84% and operating earnings per share of $2.75 to $2.85. This revised outlook includes our better-than-projected performance and favorable prior-period development reported in the first quarter. It also reflects updated membership and SG&A projections. Our revised SG&A projection includes our current estimate of the costs we expect to incur in 2010 to prepare for healthcare reform. Joe will provide additional details on our 2010 outlook in a moment. Mark will then provide an update regarding the key operational drivers of our projected 2010 performance. 
First though, I would like to briefly comment on healthcare reform. There are still a great deal to be determined regarding how healthcare reform will actually be implemented. As anticipated, we are just now entering the regulation development phase and much in the legislation has been left to be determined by substantive regulation. We have been preparing for this phase for some time and are taking the same approach to the rule-making process that we did to the legislative process. We are actively engaged in constructive, fact-based dialogue at the national level and with regulators in 50 states based upon our experience in making insurance markets work. Mark and Joe have mobilized a broad and experienced team to ensure reform is implemented at the company in a manner that is best for Aetna's customers, is compliant with all laws and regulations and continues to create value for shareholders. Once the regulations have been developed and there is more clarity with regard to implementation details, particularly those dealing with minimal medical benefit ratios, we will provide more specific guidance on our outlook. Although the recent legislation addresses access, the issues of affordability and quality remain unmet challenges for our nation. 
Aetna plays a significant role in helping our customers, both employers and individuals, meet the total quality and cost challenge. We are looking across the healthcare landscape as we believe reform will create strategic growth opportunities with an even greater imperative to manage quality and costs. I have a great deal of confidence in Aetna and our long-term future. We are continuing to improve the operational performance of our businesses to ensure we reach our full potential. 
We have a customer-focused strategy and a seasoned leadership team, and our financial strength and liquidity continue to be excellent. I would like to thank our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. We are confident that through their efforts, we will be successful in 2010 and beyond. I will now turn the call over to Joe Zubretsky to provide insight into our first quarter financial performance and our 2010 outlook. Joe?"
655542,99720386,58494,"Aetna Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ronnie, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $0.98, an increase of 2% compared to the prior-year quarter. Excluding prior-period reserve development, operating earnings per share was",1368,"Thanks, Ronnie, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $0.98, an increase of 2% compared to the prior-year quarter. Excluding prior-period reserve development, operating earnings per share was $0.77. Operating earnings decreased 3% compared to the prior-year quarter to $431 million as lower Commercial underwriting margin was offset by favorable prior-period development. 
Other key highlights of the quarter include a Commercial medical benefit ratio of 81.1%, or 82.9% excluding favorable prior-period development, better-than-projected total medical membership of approximately 18.7 million members and excellent operating cash flows and very strong investment performance. 
I will now discuss the drivers of our first quarter financial performance, starting with operating margin and its key components. First quarter before-tax operating margin was 8.7%, or 7% excluding prior-period development, which is 4.6% on an after-tax basis. First quarter revenue of $8.5 billion reflects a 1% year-over-year decrease in Health Care revenue. This was the result of a 1% decrease in Health Care premium and a 1% increase in Health Care fees and other revenue. Health Care premium reflects a net decrease in Commercial premium of approximately 3.5% resulting from a volume decline of 8%, an overall rate increase of 9% and a 4.5% decline from product mix. This mix effect is due to increased benefit buy-downs and the fact that the majority of our membership attrition was in higher-premium products. This mix effect is a key driver behind the year-over-year change in our reported premium yields and medical cost trends. Health Care premium also reflects a 4% increase in Medicare premium and 11% growth in Medicaid. Growth in Health Care fees and other revenue of 1% is due to stable year-over-year volume and a 1% increase in yield, reflecting continued pressure on fee yields and lower product penetration in this challenging economy. 
Our first quarter total medical benefit ratio was 82.5%, which includes $143 million before tax of favorable prior-period reserve development across all products: $92 million in Commercial, $38 million in Medicare and $13 million in Medicaid. 
Our first quarter Commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.1%, or 82.9% excluding prior-period development, which is 60 basis points better than our guidance of approximately 83.5%. This favorable variance to guidance is due primarily to lower-than-projected flu costs. Our first quarter also included some slight favorability due to the severe winter weather. The Commercial favorable prior-period development of $92 million is due primarily to lower-than-expected flu costs in the fourth quarter, lower-than-projected medical cost trend for the month of December 2009 and the partial release of a previously-disclosed provision for certain provider medical costs related to prior years. We are not projecting this lower 2009 medical cost baseline to result in a lower medical cost run rate for 2010. 
Our first quarter Medicare and Medicaid medical benefit ratios were 87% and 85.9%, respectively. We continue to reflect appropriate assumptions regarding medical cost trend, operating metrics and payout patterns in setting reserves for estimated healthcare costs. Days claims payable were 46.9 days as of March 31, an increase of 3.1 days during the quarter due primarily to a temporary increase in pending claims that was fully reflected in our March 31 reserves. We project days claims payable to be in the low 40s for the remainder of the year. 
Group Insurance operating earnings were $29 million during the quarter, representing a year-over-year decrease of 32%. The majority of this decline was due to unfavorable Group Life claim experienced during the quarter, resulting from several large claims in one account, which unfortunately lost several employees in the Haiti earthquake, and higher than normal gains on long-term care reserve transfers in the first quarter of 2009 as we continue to execute our strategy to transfer much of this business to other carriers. Long-term disability performance was slightly ahead of our projections. 
The third key component of operating margin results is operating expense management. We continue to invest in our future to capitalize on marketplace opportunities for future profitable growth. Our business segment operating expense ratio of 18.1% represents a year-over-year increase of 80 basis points and was in line with our projections. 
We ended the quarter with 18.7 million medical members, a sequential decline of 226,000. This contraction reflects a decline of 416,000 Commercial insured members across many of our customer segments, an increase of 157,000 Commercial ASC members, which is net of estimated economic-related attrition of 80,000 and increases of 18,000 and 15,000 members in Medicare and Medicaid, respectively. 
The final area of financial performance I will comment on is our investment performance and management of capital. First quarter investment performance was very strong. Net investment income on our continuing business portfolio was $186 million, $17 million higher than the prior year as growth in invested assets and stronger alternative investment returns more than offset a lower-yield environment. Our unrealized gain position on the continuing business portfolio improved and now stands at $598 million before tax as of March 31. 
Turning now to liquidity and capital management. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. Our balance sheet metrics are excellent. As of March 31, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 29.3% and $7 billion of adjusted statutory surplus, $5.9 billion in excess of our reported regulatory requirements. We also continue to target a risk-based capital ratio of approximately 600% of the authorized control level. 
Our liquidity is strong. We began and ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $100 million and $480 million of commercial paper outstanding. First quarter dividends to the parent were $330 million, which we deployed to fund $252 million of share repurchases and cover fixed charges of $78 million. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 7.2 million shares. Our basic share count was 424.9 million at March 31, down from $430.8 million at the beginning of the year. Health Care and Group Insurance gap operating cash flow for the quarter represented approximately 200% of operating earnings excluding pension expense due to the timing of tax payments and the temporary increase in pending claims mentioned previously, both of which are projected to reverse in the second quarter. 
I will now provide some additional insight into our 2010 guidance. We now project 2010 operating earnings per share of $2.75 to $2.85, a $0.20 increase from our previous guidance. This projection reflects our current estimate for spending to prepare for healthcare reform, a weighted-average share count of approximately 430 million shares and the impact of the favorable first quarter prior-period reserve development as do all of our guidance metrics. In addition, consistent with previous projections, we project operating earnings per share in each of the remaining three quarters to be lower than the first quarter excluding development. 
Medical membership is projected to contract by approximately 150,000 members during the remainder of the year with the majority of the change occurring during the second quarter, as additional contraction in Commercial insured and ASC membership is partially offset by growth in Medicaid. This membership outlook leads to a projected decrease in full-year total company revenue of approximately 3%. 
With respect to medical benefit ratios, we project a full-year Commercial premium yield that exceeds medical cost trend, which we project to be at the low end of our 9%, plus or minus 50 basis point range. This leads to a 2010 Commercial medical benefit ratio of 83.5% to 84%, Commercial medical benefit ratios in the range of 84% to 85% for each of the remaining three quarters of the year and a 2010 Medicare medical benefit ratio that is higher than 2009 but still in the high 80s. 
For the full year, we also project a business segment operating expense ratio of approximately 18.9%, an increase of 30 basis points, due to our lower revenue projection and additional investments, particularly operational and process changes related to healthcare reform implementation. We are also projecting a full-year before-tax operating margin of approximately 6.5% and a debt to capitalization ratio of approximately 30%. 
In summary, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and are confident in our outlook for 2010. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for commentary on our operations. Mark?"

I'd like to start with an update on our first quarter operating performance and then provide some insight into the initiatives we are taking to ensure continued success in an evolving regulatory environment. As a reminder",684,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning. I'd like to start with an update on our first quarter operating performance and then provide some insight into the initiatives we are taking to ensure continued success in an evolving regulatory environment. As a reminder, the actions we initiated last year to improve our operational performance fall into two main categories: Medical quality and cost management, and pricing and underwriting. 
First, with respect to medical quality and cost management, we believe the quality and cost management actions we took last year are working as planned. These process enhancements focused on three areas: Claim payment and adjudication procedures; contractual changes for providers, ancillary contracts and fee schedules; and increased intensity of care and utilization management to improve quality and avoid unnecessary expense. As a result, our medical cost trend projection is now at the low end of our range of 9% plus or minus 50 basis points. This projection includes the effects associated with prolonged consumer and provider behavior changes and the impact of mental health parity legislation as well as inpatient costs trending at the high single to low double digits, outpatient costs trending at low double digits, physician costs at mid to high single digits and pharmacy costs at high single digits. 
Next, with respect to pricing and underwriting. Given the challenging economic environment and our first quarter change in Commercial-insured membership, our achieved premium yields have been impacted by significant mix changes as expected. We believe our disciplined strategy to better align pricing with medical costs is working. The spread between our premium yield and medical cost trend improved sequentially by 420 basis points during the quarter from negative 570 basis points to negative 150 basis points, excluding the impact of favorable prior-period development. This spread reflects some of the continuing impact of some second and third quarter 2009 renewal cohorts, but was generally in line with our expectations. We project a positive yield trend spread for the remaining three quarters of the year. We are encouraged by our first quarter performance. We are focused on delivering an improved yield trend spread that will provide additional insight on our progress as we obtain further visibility into the impact of mix and potential seasonality patterns on our book of business. 
I will now speak to the recent suspension by CMS of our marketing and enrollment for new Medicare members. We have built a very robust Medicare Part D business, now with over 600,000 members, and we take our obligations to our customers very seriously. Compliance problems of any nature are unacceptable to us. While we strive for service excellence with all of our customers, we did experience transition of care and other issues for some Medicare Part D members this quarter. We are working closely with CMS to address their concerns and fully resolve this matter as quickly as possible. This matter has my attention and that of Aetna’s entire senior team. Importantly, we have received a waiver from CMS to continue to enroll eligible members into existing contracted group Medicare plans through July 31, 2010. 
Turning now to healthcare reform. Late last year, Joe and I mobilized an experienced team of leaders to ensure that reform is implemented in a manner that is best for Aetna's customers, is compliant with all laws and regulations and continues to create value for our shareholders. The team is focused on all aspects of healthcare reform legislation with primary emphasis on those areas having immediate impact, particularly mandated benefits and minimum benefit ratio requirements in 2011. In addition, Ron, Joe and I are engaged to ensure that we identify the strategic business opportunities that may emerge as the result of reform. We have strong working relationships with the parties responsible for developing healthcare reform regulations, and we look forward to a continued dialogue and sharing of ideas at both the federal and state levels to ensure a successful implementation of reform. We remain committed as we have been in the past to be part of the solution. With that, I will turn the call back over to Kim. Kim?"

And I also think that your intuition about some of the other items was correct, but they generally offset each other. Our first quarter underlying Commercial list performance was favorable, but we have had to increase our SG&A forecast for the year, primarily to implement the operational protocols for healthcare reform. Those items largely offset each other so basically the prior-period development adds the increase to earnings per share for the year."

Last night, we announced our second quarter earnings, which reflect strong underlying operating results, positioning us for an improved outlook for the remainder of 2010. We also announced a long-term pharmacy benefit management strategic agreement with CVS Caremark, which will result in enhanced value for our customers, members and shareholders. I will discuss the strategic aspects of our agreement with CVS Caremark in a moment. But first, I will begin with our second quarter operating results.
For the second quarter, we reported operating earnings per share of $1.05. These results include favorable prior-period reserved development of $0.30 per share, primarily from first quarter incurred Health Care costs. Excluding this favorable development, second quarter operating earnings per share were $0.75, higher than the consensus estimate of $0.74. These results are a continuation of the strong fundamental performance we experienced in the first quarter, bringing our year-to-date operating earnings to $2.03 per share. 
Our second quarter Commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.1%, or 83.2% excluding favorable prior-period development. Our performance this quarter, as it did last quarter, reflects the benefits of our enhanced management processes to improve the underwriting margin profile of our business. We were successful this quarter in all three dimensions of our strategy, which are: First, obtaining deep insight into the evolving needs of our customers to identify areas for future profitable growth; second, providing information and decision support to help our customers make better informed health decisions; and third, aspiring to achieve operational excellence in everything we do. 
The most notable accomplishment, which addresses all three dimensions of our strategy, is our innovative agreement with CVS Caremark. This arrangement creates differentiation in the marketplace by deploying the collective strength of Aetna and CVS Caremark to create value for Aetna's customers and shareholders. This opportunity provides significant benefits to our customers by preserving and enhancing our integrated value proposition, an important aspect of our long-term strategy; integrating medical care with clinical and pharmacy programs and data to improve quality while lowering costs; and enhancing the affordability of our Health products through improved retail, mail-order drug and specialty pricing at a time when Health Care costs are a key concern for our customers and members. This agreement will also improve our financial and operating profile by creating a lower cost structure to drive future earnings growth and increasing our retention of pharmacy membership and penetration of our medical membership base. We chose CVS Caremark because we both share a common vision for the future of Health Care. In addition, this agreement creates immediate tangible value for our customers. The arrangement provides a future opportunity to build on each other's key strategic assets such as Aetna's active Health Care engine and CVS Caremark's medical franchise. Joel will provide further details on the financial aspects of this agreement, and Mark will speak to the customer and operational details. 
As we look to the remainder of this year, our strong second quarter performance provides us with increased confidence and an updated 2010 full year outlook. We now project a Commercial medical benefit ratio of 82.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points, and operating earnings per share of $3.05 to $3.15. 
Joe and Mark will provide additional details on our performance this quarter and our 2010 outlook in a moment. But first, a few comments on Health Care perform. There is still much to be determined regarding how Health Care reform will be implemented. We remain committed to addressing affordability and quality through policy changes and market innovation, as these issues remain challenges for our nation as a whole and for Health Care consumers. 
As we implement the newly enacted legislation, the more comprehensive benefits required will result in higher costs for American consumers. We are actively involved in the regulation development phase of reform and working collaboratively with the parties responsible for developing the regulations to provide our thought leadership and expertise. Once the regulations have been finalized and there is more clarity with regard to implementation details, particularly those dealing with minimum medical benefit ratios, we will provide more specific guidance on our post-reform outlook. 
In closing, I have a great deal of confidence in Aetna and our long-term future. Our operating performance continues to improve, as we maintain our focus on responsible pricing and effective medical quality and cost management. We are successfully executing our customer-focused strategy to build a better, more information-driven Health Care marketplace. We have a seasoned leadership team, and our financial strength and flexibility provide a strong foundation for future success. I would like to thank our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. We are confident that through their efforts, we will be successful in 2010 and beyond. 
I will now turn the call over to Joe Zubretsky. Joe?"
655542,99720403,69930,"Aetna Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-28-2010",2010-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported second quarter operating earnings per share of $1.05, an increase of 54% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding prior-period reserve development, operating earnings per share was $0.7",1547,"Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported second quarter operating earnings per share of $1.05, an increase of 54% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding prior-period reserve development, operating earnings per share was $0.75. Our year-to-date operating earnings per share is $2.03, including $0.22 of favorable development from 2009 incurred Health Care costs. 
Second quarter operating earnings of $450 million were 46% higher than the prior year quarter due primarily to a higher Commercial underwriting margin from favorable prior-period development and improved underlying performance in the quarter, partially offset by lower Commercial insured volume. I will now discuss the drivers of our second quarter financial performance, starting first with operating margin and its key components.
Second quarter before-tax operating margin was 9.2%, or 6.9% excluding prior-period development, which is 4.4% on an after-tax basis. Second quarter revenue of $8.5 billion reflects a 2% year-over-year decrease in Health Care revenue, primarily from a 2% decrease in premiums. Second quarter fees and other revenue also declined 2% due to lower fee yields, reflecting a competitive pricing environment. The 2% decrease in Health Care premium reflects a net decrease in Commercial premium of approximately 4%, resulting from a volume decline of 9.5%, an overall rate increase of 10½ % and a 5% decline from mix of business. Health Care premium also reflects a 6% increase in Medicare premium and a 7% increase in Medicaid premium, related primarily to membership gains. 
Our second quarter total medical benefit ratio was 81.8%, which includes $199 million before-tax of favorable prior-period reserved development across all products, $160 million in Commercial, $34 million in Medicare and $5 million in Medicaid. 
Our second quarter Commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.1%, or 83.2% excluding prior-period development. This result is 80 basis points better than the low end of our previous guidance range of 84% to 85%. This favorable variance to guidance is due primarily to lower-than-projected utilization. 
The Commercial favorable prior-period development of $160 million is primarily related to first quarter incurred Health Care costs. Relative to our first quarter reserve estimates, we experienced lower flu cost and utilization. This lower utilization included the impact of severe weather on the East Coast. Year-to-date, our Commercial medical benefit ratio is 80.6%, or 81.5% excluding favorable reserve development from 2009 incurred Health Care costs. 
Our second quarter Medicare medical benefit ratio was 86.4%, an improvement from the prior year due primarily to the favorable prior-period reserve development in the current quarter. We continue to reflect appropriate assumptions regarding medical cost trend, operating metrics and payout patterns in setting reserves for estimated Health Care costs. 
Days claims payable were 43.2 days as of June 30, a decrease of 3.7 days during the quarter. This change was due primarily to the payment of previously reported pending claims that were higher than normal at the end of the first quarter, and the impact of our second quarter of favorable prior-period development. We project days claims payable to be in the low 40s for the remainder of the year. 
Group Insurance operating earnings were $44 million during the quarter, in line with our expectations and the prior-year quarter.
Our business segment operating expense ratio of 18.1% was in line with our projections. We ended the quarter with 18.6 million medical members; a sequential decrease of 86,000 comprising a decrease of 156,000 Commercial members, partially offset by growth in Medicaid of 70,000 members. The Commercial decrease consisted of 65,000 insured members and 91,000 ASE members. Included in the Commercial decrease is economic-related attrition of approximately 80,000 members. 
The final area of financial performance I will comment on is our investment performance and management of capital. Second quarter net investment income on our continuing business portfolio was $175 million, a 10% increase over the prior year, as growth in invested assets more than offset lower yields. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. As of June 30, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 28.3%, in line with our expectations. 
Our liquidity remains strong as well. We began and ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $100 million. Second quarter dividends to the parent were approximately $350 million, which we deployed to fund $229 million of share repurchases, cover fixed charges of $93 million and reduce our outstanding Commercial paper by $30 million. Our outstanding Commercial paper at June 30 was $450 million. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 7.8 million shares. Our basic share count was 417.4 million at June 30. For the second quarter, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow was negative $11 million. This result reflects previously reported timing differences, including the seasonal pattern of our income tax payments and the payment of higher-than-normal pended claims at the end of the first quarter of approximately $120 million. Year-to-date, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow represented 97% of operating earnings, excluding pension expense. I will now discuss our updated 2010 guidance.
We now project full year 2010 operating earnings per share of $3.05 to $3.15, a $0.30 increase from our previous guidance. This increase from the midpoint of our previous guidance range reflects $0.30 of favorable reserve development reported in the second quarter, $0.06 of higher Commercial underwriting margin due to the favorable underlying results we reported in the second quarter, offset by $0.06 of integration costs for our agreement with CVS Caremark that we will incur in preparation for transitioning our customers to this new arrangement. I will provide additional financial details of the CVS Caremark agreement in a moment.
Our projection reflects operating earnings per share to be lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. This decrease is due primarily to two factors: The favorable prior-period reserve development from 2009 in our first-half results, and the seasonal pattern of higher medical costs and SG&A spending in the second half of the year. We project earnings per share in the third quarter to be higher than the fourth quarter. 
Medical membership is projected to decrease by 220,000 members during the remainder of the year. This decrease includes 280,000 Commercial members, primarily due to projected economic to attrition, partially offset by growth of 60,000 members in Medicaid.  
We have maintained our outlook for total company revenue to decrease by approximately 3% from 2009. With respect to medical benefit ratios, we project a full year Commercial premium yield that exceeds medical cost trend, which we now project to be 8% plus or minus 50 basis points, a 2010 Commercial medical benefit ratio of 82.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points, and a 2010 Medicare medical benefit ratio that is in the high 80s. 
In projecting our full year 2010 Commercial medical benefit ratio, we believe the second quarter result of 83.2%, which excludes favorable development, is an appropriate representation of the underwriting margin profile of the business. We are placing less reliance on our first quarter result, as it included the impacts of lower flu costs and utilization, which we do not expect to recur. Our projection also reflects the higher Commercial medical benefit ratio we expect in the second half of the year, due primarily to the seasonal pattern of our business.
Turning now to our agreement with CVS Caremark. This agreement is the capstone of a comprehensive strategic review of our pharmacy operations, in which we scanned the entire PBM marketplace and thoroughly evaluated all strategic options. Our objective was to maximize long-term value for both our customers and our shareholders. We are confident that this strategic agreement with CVS Caremark will strengthen our long-term competitive position in the marketplace and realize significant drug cost savings for our customers and Aetna, as well as produce operational efficiencies through economies of scale. 
We expect to begin transitioning to CVS Caremark's platforms and pharmacy networks on January 1, 2011, following all required approvals. Our customers will begin to benefit immediately, but any earnings impact to Aetna in 2011 is likely to be offset by the cost of integrating CVS Caremark’s pharmacy systems into our infrastructure. 
In 2012, Aetna and our customers will each see significant financial benefits of this long-term agreement. While we have not yet provided long-term earnings per share guidance beyond 2010, we estimate that this agreement will create earnings per share accretion of approximately $0.30 per share when the agreement is near-fully implemented in 2012. The significant benefit that will be delivered to our customers has been contemplated in this projection. 
As we consider the impact of this agreement on our future financial profile, the synergies would be realized across multiple aspects of our Pharmacy business, including enhanced fee revenue, lower SG&A expenses and lower medical costs. With respect to 2010, we expect to incur one-time transaction costs in the second half of the year that are not included in our operating earnings per share guidance due to their one-time nature. 
In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter performance and are confident in our outlook for 2010. We are also excited about the opportunities and value that our agreement with CVS Caremark creates for our customers, members and shareholders. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for commentary on our operations. Mark?"

I would like to start with an update on our second quarter strategic accomplishments and operating performance. I will then provide further details on the operating aspects and customer benefits of our strategic agreement",951,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning. I would like to start with an update on our second quarter strategic accomplishments and operating performance. I will then provide further details on the operating aspects and customer benefits of our strategic agreement with CVS Caremark.
We had a number of accomplishments this quarter which aligned to the three dimensions of our strategy to provide value to our customers and shape more effective Health Care systems. I would note this quarter, we expanded our payment estimator tool to our entire customer base. This industry-first capability provides members with personalized estimates for expenses based on their specific plan of benefits before services are rendered. We also launched our virtual online assistant to provide members with 24-hour support to answer their questions about their health benefits as they navigate our Web site. And our focus on operational excellence led to a continued improvement in key metrics.
Turning to our operating performance, I will first discuss pricing and underwriting. We have continued to maintain discipline in these areas, with the objective that our pricing decisions reflect our projected medical costs. During the quarter, we produced a positive spread between our premium yield and medical cost trend of 150 basis points, excluding the impact of favorable reserve development. This achievement demonstrates that the management processes we put in place to price appropriately are working. We project a positive yield trend spread for the remainder of the year, with the second half of the year higher than the 150 basis points we reported in the second quarter. 
Next, with respect to medical quality and cost management, the actions we took last year to improve the management of our medical costs are working as planned. We continue to work with our customers and the medical community to improve the quality and value of our services for an improved experience for our members within the Health Care system. By offering the right benefit designs, effective provider networks, health and wellness programs and information tools, our members can make informed decisions about their Health Care. 
The results of these actions, as well as the low utilization that we experienced in the first half of 2010, contributed to our new projected annual 2010 medical cost trend of 8%, plus or minus 50 basis points. This projection also includes an increase due to mandated benefits as required by Health Care reform and reflects inpatient cost trending at high single digits, outpatient cost trending at high single-to-low double digits, physician costs at mid-to-high single digits and pharmacy costs at high single digits. Our 2011 medical cost trend will include the full year impact of mandated benefits. These projected costs are reflected in our 2011 pricing. I will now discuss our arrangement with CVS Caremark.
Our Pharmacy business has been and continues to be a key component of our integrated value proposition. However, as we conducted our strategic review of this important asset, it became clear to us that by working with a larger, independent pharmacy benefit manager, we could create additional value for our customers and shareholders. By entering into a 12-year strategic agreement with CVS Caremark, we believe we have created a doable [ph] competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
From an operational perspective, Aetna will maintain its control of the clinical integration of pharmacy and medical benefits. We will also retain most of the customer-facing functions of our Mail Order and Specialty Pharmacy businesses and continue to control medical and pharmacy policy, formula and contracting and other core functions. CVS Caremark will provide the administration of selected functions for Aetna's claim processing, customer service and retail pharmacy network contracting. They will also be responsible for the purchasing and fulfillment functions of our Mail Order and Specialty Pharmacy businesses. 
CVS Caremark shares our objective of providing quality outcomes and lowering Health Care costs for our members. In fact, customer benefits of our agreement include improved drug pricing, as CVS Caremark serves a greater volume of customers and is able to offer more competitive cost structure; enhanced clinical capabilities through best-in-class integrated clinical programs focused on medication adherence for our members that foster better health outcomes and reduce overall medical costs; improved customer service and member experience as we migrate to CVS Caremark's platform. The agreement will enable Aetna's members and customers to take advantage of CVS Caremark's innovative technology and significant retail presence. 
Additionally, this agreement provides the flexibility to collaborate on future pharmacy offerings to generate profitable growth. Overall, we believe that this agreement will improve our competitive position as a premier provider of pharmacy benefit management services.
Turning to Health Care reform. We continue to be an active participant in the development of Health Care reform regulations, both at the national and state levels. We are providing our expertise on all of the regulations, including minimum benefit ratio requirements, grandfathering, rate review guidelines and the impact for mandated benefits. Additionally, we are working very closely with state insurance departments on our ongoing rate filings. We continue to responsibly price our products in alignment with underlying medical costs. In working with all parties involved in developing the regulations, we remain committed, as we have been in the past, to be part of the solution. Our Health Care reform implementation team remains focused on the immediate impacts to our business and our customers. Importantly, Ron, Joe and I are very engaged in this implementation to ensure that we are compliant with the intent of the law and identify the strategic business opportunities that may emerge as a result of reform. We are confident that Aetna's well-positioned to be successful in the post-reform environment. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Kim. Kim?"

We also announ",810,"Good morning. Thank you, Kim, and thank you all for joining us today. Last night, we announced our second quarter earnings, which reflect strong underlying operating results, positioning us for an improved outlook for the remainder of 2010. We also announced a long-term pharmacy benefit management strategic agreement with CVS Caremark, which will result in enhanced value for our customers, members and shareholders. I will discuss the strategic aspects of our agreement with CVS Caremark in a moment. But first, I will begin with our second quarter operating results.
For the second quarter, we reported operating earnings per share of $1.05. These results include favorable prior-period reserved development of $0.30 per share, primarily from first quarter incurred Health Care costs. Excluding this favorable development, second quarter operating earnings per share were $0.75, higher than the consensus estimate of $0.74. These results are a continuation of the strong fundamental performance we experienced in the first quarter, bringing our year-to-date operating earnings to $2.03 per share. 
Our second quarter Commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.1%, or 83.2% excluding favorable prior-period development. Our performance this quarter, as it did last quarter, reflects the benefits of our enhanced management processes to improve the underwriting margin profile of our business. We were successful this quarter in all three dimensions of our strategy, which are: First, obtaining deep insight into the evolving needs of our customers to identify areas for future profitable growth; second, providing information and decision support to help our customers make better informed health decisions; and third, aspiring to achieve operational excellence in everything we do. 
The most notable accomplishment, which addresses all three dimensions of our strategy, is our innovative agreement with CVS Caremark. This arrangement creates differentiation in the marketplace by deploying the collective strength of Aetna and CVS Caremark to create value for Aetna's customers and shareholders. This opportunity provides significant benefits to our customers by preserving and enhancing our integrated value proposition, an important aspect of our long-term strategy; integrating medical care with clinical and pharmacy programs and data to improve quality while lowering costs; and enhancing the affordability of our Health products through improved retail, mail-order drug and specialty pricing at a time when Health Care costs are a key concern for our customers and members. This agreement will also improve our financial and operating profile by creating a lower cost structure to drive future earnings growth and increasing our retention of pharmacy membership and penetration of our medical membership base. We chose CVS Caremark because we both share a common vision for the future of Health Care. In addition, this agreement creates immediate tangible value for our customers. The arrangement provides a future opportunity to build on each other's key strategic assets such as Aetna's active Health Care engine and CVS Caremark's medical franchise. Joel will provide further details on the financial aspects of this agreement, and Mark will speak to the customer and operational details. 
As we look to the remainder of this year, our strong second quarter performance provides us with increased confidence and an updated 2010 full year outlook. We now project a Commercial medical benefit ratio of 82.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points, and operating earnings per share of $3.05 to $3.15. 
Joe and Mark will provide additional details on our performance this quarter and our 2010 outlook in a moment. But first, a few comments on Health Care perform. There is still much to be determined regarding how Health Care reform will be implemented. We remain committed to addressing affordability and quality through policy changes and market innovation, as these issues remain challenges for our nation as a whole and for Health Care consumers. 
As we implement the newly enacted legislation, the more comprehensive benefits required will result in higher costs for American consumers. We are actively involved in the regulation development phase of reform and working collaboratively with the parties responsible for developing the regulations to provide our thought leadership and expertise. Once the regulations have been finalized and there is more clarity with regard to implementation details, particularly those dealing with minimum medical benefit ratios, we will provide more specific guidance on our post-reform outlook. 
In closing, I have a great deal of confidence in Aetna and our long-term future. Our operating performance continues to improve, as we maintain our focus on responsible pricing and effective medical quality and cost management. We are successfully executing our customer-focused strategy to build a better, more information-driven Health Care marketplace. We have a seasoned leadership team, and our financial strength and flexibility provide a strong foundation for future success. I would like to thank our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. We are confident that through their efforts, we will be successful in 2010 and beyond. 
I will now turn the call over to Joe Zubretsky. Joe?"
655542,99720403,70013,"Aetna Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-28-2010",2010-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported second quarter operating earnings per share of $1.05, an increase of 54% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding prior-period reserve development, operating earnings per share was $0.7",1547,"Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported second quarter operating earnings per share of $1.05, an increase of 54% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding prior-period reserve development, operating earnings per share was $0.75. Our year-to-date operating earnings per share is $2.03, including $0.22 of favorable development from 2009 incurred Health Care costs. 
Second quarter operating earnings of $450 million were 46% higher than the prior year quarter due primarily to a higher Commercial underwriting margin from favorable prior-period development and improved underlying performance in the quarter, partially offset by lower Commercial Insured volume. I will now discuss the drivers of our second quarter financial performance, starting first with operating margin and its key components.
Second quarter before-tax operating margin was 9.2% or 6.9% excluding prior-period development, which is 4.4% on an after-tax basis. Second quarter revenue of $8.5 billion reflects a 2% year-over-year decrease in Health Care revenue, primarily from a 2% decrease in premiums. Second quarter fees and other revenue also declined 2% due to lower fee yields, reflecting a competitive pricing environment. The 2% decrease in Health Care premium reflects a net decrease in Commercial premium of approximately 4%, resulting from a volume decline of 9.5%, an overall rate increase of 10.5% and a 5% decline from mix of business. Health Care premium also reflects a 6% increase in Medicare premium and a 7% increase in Medicaid premium, related primarily to membership gains. 
Our second quarter total medical benefit ratio was 81.8%, which includes $199 million before tax of favorable prior-period reserve development across all products, $160 million in Commercial, $34 million in Medicare and $5 million in Medicaid. 
Our second quarter Commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.1%, or 83.2% excluding prior-period development. This result is 80 basis points better than the low end of our previous guidance range of 84% to 85%. This favorable variance to guidance is due primarily to lower-than-projected utilization. 
The Commercial favorable prior-period development of $160 million is primarily related to first quarter incurred Health Care costs. Relative to our first quarter reserve estimates, we experienced lower flu cost and utilization. This lower utilization included the impact of severe weather on the East Coast. Year-to-date, our Commercial medical benefit ratio is 80.6%, or 81.5% excluding favorable reserve development from 2009 incurred Health Care costs. 
Our second quarter Medicare medical benefit ratio was 86.4%, an improvement from the prior year due primarily to the favorable prior-period reserve development in the current quarter. We continue to reflect appropriate assumptions regarding medical cost trend, operating metrics and payout patterns in setting reserves for estimated Health Care costs. 
Days claims payable were 43.2 days as of June 30, a decrease of 3.7 days during the quarter. This change was due primarily to the payment of previously reported pending claims that were higher than normal at the end of the first quarter and the impact of our second quarter of favorable prior-period development. We project days claims payable to be in the low 40s for the remainder of the year. 
Group Insurance operating earnings were $44 million during the quarter, in line with our expectations and the prior-year quarter.
Our business segment operating expense ratio of 18.1% was in line with our projections. We ended the quarter with 18.6 million medical members; a sequential decrease of 86,000 comprising a decrease of 156,000 Commercial members, partially offset by growth in Medicaid of 70,000 members. The Commercial decrease consisted of 65,000 insured members and 91,000 ASC members. Included in the Commercial decrease is economic-related attrition of approximately 80,000 members. 
The final area of financial performance I will comment on is our investment performance and management of capital. Second quarter net investment income on our continuing business portfolio was $175 million, a 2% increase over the prior year, as growth in invested assets more than offset lower yields. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong. As of June 30, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 28.3%, in line with our expectations. 
Our liquidity remains strong as well. We began and ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $100 million. Second quarter dividends to the parent were approximately $350 million, which we deployed to fund $229 million of share repurchases, cover fixed charges of $93 million and reduce our outstanding Commercial paper by $30 million. Our outstanding Commercial paper at June 30 was $450 million. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 7.8 million shares. Our basic share count was 417.4 million at June 30. For the second quarter, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow was negative $11 million. This result reflects previously reported timing differences, including the seasonal pattern of our income tax payments and the payment of higher-than-normal pended claims at the end of the first quarter of approximately $120 million. Year-to-date, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow represented 97% of operating earnings, excluding pension expense. I will now discuss our updated 2010 guidance.
We now project full year 2010 operating earnings per share of $3.05 to $3.15, a $0.30 increase from our previous guidance. This increase from the midpoint of our previous guidance range reflects $0.30 of favorable reserve development reported in the second quarter, $0.06 of higher Commercial underwriting margin due to the favorable underlying results we reported in the second quarter, offset by $0.06 of integration costs for our agreement with CVS Caremark that we will incur in preparation for transitioning our customers to this new arrangement. I will provide additional financial details of the CVS Caremark agreement in a moment.
Our projection reflects operating earnings per share to be lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. This decrease is due primarily to two factors: The favorable prior-period reserve development from 2009 in our first-half results, and the seasonal pattern of higher medical costs and SG&A spending in the second half of the year. We project earnings per share in the third quarter to be higher than the fourth quarter. 
Medical membership is projected to decrease by 220,000 members during the remainder of the year. This decrease includes 280,000 Commercial members, primarily due to projected economic to attrition, partially offset by growth of 60,000 members in Medicaid.  
We have maintained our outlook for total company revenue to decrease by approximately 3% from 2009. With respect to medical benefit ratios, we project a full year Commercial premium yield that exceeds medical cost trend, which we now project to be 8% plus or minus 50 basis points, a 2010 Commercial medical benefit ratio of 82.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points, and a 2010 Medicare medical benefit ratio that is in the high 80s. 
In projecting our full year 2010 Commercial medical benefit ratio, we believe the second quarter result of 83.2%, which excludes favorable development, is an appropriate representation of the underwriting margin profile of the business. We are placing less reliance on our first quarter result, as it included the impacts of lower flu costs and utilization, which we do not expect to recur. Our projection also reflects the higher Commercial medical benefit ratio we expect in the second half of the year, due primarily to the seasonal pattern of our business.
Turning now to our agreement with CVS Caremark. This agreement is the capstone of a comprehensive strategic review of our pharmacy operations, in which we scanned the entire PBM marketplace and thoroughly evaluated all strategic options. Our objective was to maximize long-term value for both our customers and our shareholders. We are confident that this strategic agreement with CVS Caremark will strengthen our long-term competitive position in the marketplace and realize significant drug cost savings for our customers and Aetna, as well as produce operational efficiencies through economies of scale. 
We expect to begin transitioning to CVS Caremark's platforms and pharmacy networks on January 1, 2011, following all required approvals. Our customers will begin to benefit immediately, but any earnings impact to Aetna in 2011 is likely to be offset by the cost of integrating CVS Caremark’s pharmacy systems into our infrastructure. 
In 2012, Aetna and our customers will each see significant financial benefits of this long-term agreement. While we have not yet provided long-term earnings per share guidance beyond 2010, we estimate that this agreement will create earnings per share accretion of approximately $0.30 per share when the agreement is near-fully implemented in 2012. The significant benefit that will be delivered to our customers has been contemplated in this projection. 
As we consider the impact of this agreement on our future financial profile, the synergies would be realized across multiple aspects of our Pharmacy business, including enhanced fee revenue, lower SG&A expenses and lower medical costs. With respect to 2010, we expect to incur one-time transaction costs in the second half of the year that are not included in our operating earnings per share guidance due to their one-time nature. 
In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter performance and are confident in our outlook for 2010. We are also excited about the opportunities and value that our agreement with CVS Caremark creates for our customers, members and shareholders. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for commentary on our operations. Mark?"
655542,99720403,70013,"Aetna Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-28-2010",2010-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning. I would like to start with an update on our second quarter strategic accomplishments and operating performance. I will then provide further details on the operating aspects and customer benefits of our strategic agreement",952,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning. I would like to start with an update on our second quarter strategic accomplishments and operating performance. I will then provide further details on the operating aspects and customer benefits of our strategic agreement with CVS Caremark.
We had a number of accomplishments this quarter which aligned to the three dimensions of our strategy to provide value to our customers and shape more effective Health Care systems. I would note this quarter, we expanded our payment estimator tool to our entire customer base. This industry-first capability provides members with personalized estimates for expenses based on their specific plan of benefits before services are rendered. We also launched our virtual online assistant to provide members with 24-hour support to answer their questions about their health benefits as they navigate our Web site. And our focus on operational excellence led to a continued improvement in key metrics.
Turning to our operating performance, I will first discuss pricing and underwriting. We have continued to maintain discipline in these areas, with the objective that our pricing decisions reflect our projected medical costs. During the quarter, we produced a positive spread between our premium yield and medical cost trend of 150 basis points, excluding the impact of favorable reserve development. This achievement demonstrates that the management processes we put in place to price appropriately are working. We project a positive yield trend spread for the remainder of the year, with the second half of the year higher than the 150 basis points we reported in the second quarter. 
Next, with respect to medical quality and cost management, the actions we took last year to improve the management of our medical costs are working as planned. We continue to work with our customers and the medical community to improve the quality and value of our services for an improved experience for our members within the Health Care system. By offering the right benefit designs, effective provider networks, health and wellness programs and information tools, our members can make informed decisions about their Health Care. 
The results of these actions, as well as the low utilization that we experienced in the first half of 2010, contributed to our new projected annual 2010 medical cost trend of 8%, plus or minus 50 basis points. This projection also includes an increase due to mandated benefits as required by Health Care reform and reflects inpatient cost trending at high single digits, outpatient cost trending at high single-to-low double digits, physician costs at mid-to-high single digits and pharmacy costs at high single digits. Our 2011 medical cost trend will include the full year impact of mandated benefits. These projected costs are reflected in our 2011 pricing. I will now discuss our arrangement with CVS Caremark.
Our Pharmacy business has been and continues to be a key component of our integrated value proposition. However, as we conducted our strategic review of this important asset, it became clear to us that by working with a larger, independent pharmacy benefit manager, we could create additional value for our customers and shareholders. By entering into a 12-year strategic agreement with CVS Caremark, we believe we have created a doable [ph] competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
From an operational perspective, Aetna will maintain its control of the clinical integration of pharmacy and medical benefits. We will also retain most of the customer-facing functions of our Mail Order and Specialty Pharmacy businesses and continue to control medical and pharmacy policy, formula and contracting and other core functions. CVS Caremark will provide the administration of selected functions for Aetna's claim processing, customer service and retail pharmacy network contracting. They will also be responsible for the purchasing and fulfillment functions of our Mail Order and Specialty Pharmacy businesses. 
CVS Caremark shares our objective of providing quality outcomes and lowering Health Care costs for our members. In fact, customer benefits of our agreement include improved drug pricing, as CVS Caremark serves a greater volume of customers and is able to offer a more competitive cost structure; enhanced clinical capabilities through best-in-class integrated clinical programs focused on medication adherence for our members that foster better health outcomes and reduce overall medical costs; improved customer service and member experience as we migrate to CVS Caremark's platform. The agreement will enable Aetna's members and customers to take advantage of CVS Caremark's innovative technology and significant retail presence. 
Additionally, this agreement provides the flexibility to collaborate on future pharmacy offerings to generate profitable growth. Overall, we believe that this agreement will improve our competitive position as a premier provider of pharmacy benefit management services.
Turning to Health Care reform. We continue to be an active participant in the development of Health Care reform regulations, both at the national and state levels. We are providing our expertise on all of the regulations, including minimum benefit ratio requirements, grandfathering, rate review guidelines and the impact from mandated benefits. Additionally, we are working very closely with state insurance departments on our ongoing rate filings. We continue to responsibly price our products in alignment with underlying medical costs. In working with all parties involved in developing the regulations, we remain committed, as we have been in the past, to be part of the solution. Our Health Care reform implementation team remains focused on the immediate impacts to our business and our customers. Importantly, Ron, Joe and I are very engaged in this implementation to ensure that we are compliant with the intent of the law and identify the strategic business opportunities that may emerge as the result of reform. We are confident that Aetna's well-positioned to be successful in the post-reform environment.

We also announ",810,"Good morning. Thank you, Kim, and thank you all for joining us today. Last night, we announced our second quarter earnings, which reflect strong underlying operating results, positioning us for an improved outlook for the remainder of 2010. We also announced a long-term pharmacy benefit management strategic agreement with CVS Caremark, which will result in enhanced value for our customers, members and shareholders. I will discuss the strategic aspects of our agreement with CVS Caremark in a moment. But first, I will begin with our second quarter operating results.
For the second quarter, we reported operating earnings per share of $1.05. These results include favorable prior-period reserved development of $0.30 per share, primarily from first quarter incurred Health Care costs. Excluding this favorable development, second quarter operating earnings per share were $0.75, higher than the consensus estimate of $0.74. These results are a continuation of the strong fundamental performance we experienced in the first quarter, bringing our year-to-date operating earnings to $2.03 per share. 
Our second quarter Commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.1%, or 83.2% excluding favorable prior-period development. Our performance this quarter, as it did last quarter, reflects the benefits of our enhanced management processes to improve the underwriting margin profile of our business. We were successful this quarter in all three dimensions of our strategy, which are: First, obtaining deep insight into the evolving needs of our customers to identify areas for future profitable growth; second, providing information and decision support to help our customers make better informed health decisions; and third, aspiring to achieve operational excellence in everything we do. 
The most notable accomplishment, which addresses all three dimensions of our strategy, is our innovative agreement with CVS Caremark. This arrangement creates differentiation in the marketplace by deploying the collective strength of Aetna and CVS Caremark to create value for Aetna's customers and shareholders. This opportunity provides significant benefits to our customers by preserving and enhancing our integrated value proposition, an important aspect of our long-term strategy; integrating medical care with clinical and pharmacy programs and data to improve quality while lowering costs; and enhancing the affordability of our Health products through improved retail, mail-order drug and specialty pricing at a time when Health Care costs are a key concern for our customers and members. This agreement will also improve our financial and operating profile by creating a lower cost structure to drive future earnings growth and increasing our retention of pharmacy membership and penetration of our medical membership base. We chose CVS Caremark because we both share a common vision for the future of Health Care. In addition, this agreement creates immediate tangible value for our customers. The arrangement provides a future opportunity to build on each other's key strategic assets such as Aetna's active Health Care engine and CVS Caremark's medical franchise. Joel will provide further details on the financial aspects of this agreement, and Mark will speak to the customer and operational details. 
As we look to the remainder of this year, our strong second quarter performance provides us with increased confidence and an updated 2010 full year outlook. We now project a Commercial medical benefit ratio of 82.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points, and operating earnings per share of $3.05 to $3.15. 
Joe and Mark will provide additional details on our performance this quarter and our 2010 outlook in a moment. But first, a few comments on Health Care perform. There is still much to be determined regarding how Health Care reform will be implemented. We remain committed to addressing affordability and quality through policy changes and market innovation, as these issues remain challenges for our nation as a whole and for Health Care consumers. 
As we implement the newly enacted legislation, the more comprehensive benefits required will result in higher costs for American consumers. We are actively involved in the regulation development phase of reform and working collaboratively with the parties responsible for developing the regulations to provide our thought leadership and expertise. Once the regulations have been finalized and there is more clarity with regard to implementation details, particularly those dealing with minimum medical benefit ratios, we will provide more specific guidance on our post-reform outlook. 
In closing, I have a great deal of confidence in Aetna and our long-term future. Our operating performance continues to improve, as we maintain our focus on responsible pricing and effective medical quality and cost management. We are successfully executing our customer-focused strategy to build a better, more information-driven Health Care marketplace. We have a seasoned leadership team, and our financial strength and flexibility provide a strong foundation for future success. I would like to thank our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. We are confident that through their efforts, we will be successful in 2010 and beyond. 
I will now turn the call over to Joe Zubretsky. Joe?"
655542,99720403,70018,"Aetna Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-28-2010",2010-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported second quarter operating earnings per share of $1.05, an increase of 54% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding prior-period reserve development, operating earnings per share was $0.7",1547,"Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported second quarter operating earnings per share of $1.05, an increase of 54% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding prior-period reserve development, operating earnings per share was $0.75. Our year-to-date operating earnings per share is $2.03, including $0.22 of favorable development from 2009 incurred Health Care costs. 
Second quarter operating earnings of $450 million were 46% higher than the prior year quarter due primarily to a higher Commercial underwriting margin from favorable prior-period development and improved underlying performance in the quarter, partially offset by lower Commercial Insured volume. I will now discuss the drivers of our second quarter financial performance, starting first with operating margin and its key components.
Second quarter before-tax operating margin was 9.2% or 6.9% excluding prior-period development, which is 4.4% on an after-tax basis. Second quarter revenue of $8.5 billion reflects a 2% year-over-year decrease in Health Care revenue, primarily from a 2% decrease in premiums. Second quarter fees and other revenue also declined 2% due to lower fee yields, reflecting a competitive pricing environment. The 2% decrease in Health Care premium reflects a net decrease in Commercial premium of approximately 4%, resulting from a volume decline of 9.5%, an overall rate increase of 10.5% and a 5% decline from mix of business. Health Care premium also reflects a 6% increase in Medicare premium and a 7% increase in Medicaid premium, related primarily to membership gains. 
Our second quarter total medical benefit ratio was 81.8%, which includes $199 million before tax of favorable prior-period reserve development across all products, $160 million in Commercial, $34 million in Medicare and $5 million in Medicaid. 
Our second quarter Commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.1%, or 83.2% excluding prior-period development. This result is 80 basis points better than the low end of our previous guidance range of 84% to 85%. This favorable variance to guidance is due primarily to lower-than-projected utilization. 
The Commercial favorable prior-period development of $160 million is primarily related to first quarter incurred Health Care costs. Relative to our first quarter reserve estimates, we experienced lower flu cost and utilization. This lower utilization included the impact of severe weather on the East Coast. Year-to-date, our Commercial medical benefit ratio is 80.6%, or 81.5% excluding favorable reserve development from 2009 incurred Health Care costs. 
Our second quarter Medicare medical benefit ratio was 86.4%, an improvement from the prior year due primarily to the favorable prior-period reserve development in the current quarter. We continue to reflect appropriate assumptions regarding medical cost trend, operating metrics and payout patterns in setting reserves for estimated Health Care costs. 
Days claims payable were 43.2 days as of June 30, a decrease of 3.7 days during the quarter. This change was due primarily to the payment of previously reported pending claims that were higher than normal at the end of the first quarter and the impact of our second quarter of favorable prior-period development. We project days claims payable to be in the low 40s for the remainder of the year. 
Group Insurance operating earnings were $44 million during the quarter, in line with our expectations and the prior-year quarter.
Our business segment operating expense ratio of 18.1% was in line with our projections. We ended the quarter with 18.6 million medical members; a sequential decrease of 86,000 comprising a decrease of 156,000 Commercial members, partially offset by growth in Medicaid of 70,000 members. The Commercial decrease consisted of 65,000 insured members and 91,000 ASC members. Included in the Commercial decrease is economic-related attrition of approximately 80,000 members. 
The final area of financial performance I will comment on is our investment performance and management of capital. Second quarter net investment income on our continuing business portfolio was $175 million, a 2% increase over the prior year, as growth in invested assets more than offset lower yields. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong. As of June 30, we had a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 28.3%, in line with our expectations. 
Our liquidity remains strong as well. We began and ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $100 million. Second quarter dividends to the parent were approximately $350 million, which we deployed to fund $229 million of share repurchases, cover fixed charges of $93 million and reduce our outstanding Commercial paper by $30 million. Our outstanding Commercial paper at June 30 was $450 million. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 7.8 million shares. Our basic share count was 417.4 million at June 30. For the second quarter, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow was negative $11 million. This result reflects previously reported timing differences, including the seasonal pattern of our income tax payments and the payment of higher-than-normal pended claims at the end of the first quarter of approximately $120 million. Year-to-date, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow represented 97% of operating earnings, excluding pension expense. I will now discuss our updated 2010 guidance.
We now project full year 2010 operating earnings per share of $3.05 to $3.15, a $0.30 increase from our previous guidance. This increase from the midpoint of our previous guidance range reflects $0.30 of favorable reserve development reported in the second quarter, $0.06 of higher Commercial underwriting margin due to the favorable underlying results we reported in the second quarter, offset by $0.06 of integration costs for our agreement with CVS Caremark that we will incur in preparation for transitioning our customers to this new arrangement. I will provide additional financial details of the CVS Caremark agreement in a moment.
Our projection reflects operating earnings per share to be lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. This decrease is due primarily to two factors: The favorable prior-period reserve development from 2009 in our first-half results, and the seasonal pattern of higher medical costs and SG&A spending in the second half of the year. We project earnings per share in the third quarter to be higher than the fourth quarter. 
Medical membership is projected to decrease by 220,000 members during the remainder of the year. This decrease includes 280,000 Commercial members, primarily due to projected economic to attrition, partially offset by growth of 60,000 members in Medicaid.  
We have maintained our outlook for total company revenue to decrease by approximately 3% from 2009. With respect to medical benefit ratios, we project a full year Commercial premium yield that exceeds medical cost trend, which we now project to be 8% plus or minus 50 basis points, a 2010 Commercial medical benefit ratio of 82.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points, and a 2010 Medicare medical benefit ratio that is in the high 80s. 
In projecting our full year 2010 Commercial medical benefit ratio, we believe the second quarter result of 83.2%, which excludes favorable development, is an appropriate representation of the underwriting margin profile of the business. We are placing less reliance on our first quarter result, as it included the impacts of lower flu costs and utilization, which we do not expect to recur. Our projection also reflects the higher Commercial medical benefit ratio we expect in the second half of the year, due primarily to the seasonal pattern of our business.
Turning now to our agreement with CVS Caremark. This agreement is the capstone of a comprehensive strategic review of our pharmacy operations, in which we scanned the entire PBM marketplace and thoroughly evaluated all strategic options. Our objective was to maximize long-term value for both our customers and our shareholders. We are confident that this strategic agreement with CVS Caremark will strengthen our long-term competitive position in the marketplace and realize significant drug cost savings for our customers and Aetna, as well as produce operational efficiencies through economies of scale. 
We expect to begin transitioning to CVS Caremark's platforms and pharmacy networks on January 1, 2011, following all required approvals. Our customers will begin to benefit immediately, but any earnings impact to Aetna in 2011 is likely to be offset by the cost of integrating CVS Caremark’s pharmacy systems into our infrastructure. 
In 2012, Aetna and our customers will each see significant financial benefits of this long-term agreement. While we have not yet provided long-term earnings per share guidance beyond 2010, we estimate that this agreement will create earnings per share accretion of approximately $0.30 per share when the agreement is near-fully implemented in 2012. The significant benefit that will be delivered to our customers has been contemplated in this projection. 
As we consider the impact of this agreement on our future financial profile, the synergies would be realized across multiple aspects of our Pharmacy business, including enhanced fee revenue, lower SG&A expenses and lower medical costs. With respect to 2010, we expect to incur one-time transaction costs in the second half of the year that are not included in our operating earnings per share guidance due to their one-time nature. 
In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter performance and are confident in our outlook for 2010. We are also excited about the opportunities and value that our agreement with CVS Caremark creates for our customers, members and shareholders. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Mark for commentary on our operations. Mark?"

I would like to start with an update on our second quarter strategic accomplishments and operating performance. I will then provide further details on the operating aspects and customer benefits of our strategic agreement",952,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning. I would like to start with an update on our second quarter strategic accomplishments and operating performance. I will then provide further details on the operating aspects and customer benefits of our strategic agreement with CVS Caremark.
We had a number of accomplishments this quarter which aligned to the three dimensions of our strategy to provide value to our customers and shape more effective Health Care systems. I would note this quarter, we expanded our payment estimator tool to our entire customer base. This industry-first capability provides members with personalized estimates for expenses based on their specific plan of benefits before services are rendered. We also launched our virtual online assistant to provide members with 24-hour support to answer their questions about their health benefits as they navigate our Web site. And our focus on operational excellence led to a continued improvement in key metrics.
Turning to our operating performance, I will first discuss pricing and underwriting. We have continued to maintain discipline in these areas, with the objective that our pricing decisions reflect our projected medical costs. During the quarter, we produced a positive spread between our premium yield and medical cost trend of 150 basis points, excluding the impact of favorable reserve development. This achievement demonstrates that the management processes we put in place to price appropriately are working. We project a positive yield trend spread for the remainder of the year, with the second half of the year higher than the 150 basis points we reported in the second quarter. 
Next, with respect to medical quality and cost management, the actions we took last year to improve the management of our medical costs are working as planned. We continue to work with our customers and the medical community to improve the quality and value of our services for an improved experience for our members within the Health Care system. By offering the right benefit designs, effective provider networks, health and wellness programs and information tools, our members can make informed decisions about their Health Care. 
The results of these actions, as well as the low utilization that we experienced in the first half of 2010, contributed to our new projected annual 2010 medical cost trend of 8%, plus or minus 50 basis points. This projection also includes an increase due to mandated benefits as required by Health Care reform and reflects inpatient cost trending at high single digits, outpatient cost trending at high single-to-low double digits, physician costs at mid-to-high single digits and pharmacy costs at high single digits. Our 2011 medical cost trend will include the full year impact of mandated benefits. These projected costs are reflected in our 2011 pricing. I will now discuss our arrangement with CVS Caremark.
Our Pharmacy business has been and continues to be a key component of our integrated value proposition. However, as we conducted our strategic review of this important asset, it became clear to us that by working with a larger, independent pharmacy benefit manager, we could create additional value for our customers and shareholders. By entering into a 12-year strategic agreement with CVS Caremark, we believe we have created a doable [ph] competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
From an operational perspective, Aetna will maintain its control of the clinical integration of pharmacy and medical benefits. We will also retain most of the customer-facing functions of our Mail Order and Specialty Pharmacy businesses and continue to control medical and pharmacy policy, formula and contracting and other core functions. CVS Caremark will provide the administration of selected functions for Aetna's claim processing, customer service and retail pharmacy network contracting. They will also be responsible for the purchasing and fulfillment functions of our Mail Order and Specialty Pharmacy businesses. 
CVS Caremark shares our objective of providing quality outcomes and lowering Health Care costs for our members. In fact, customer benefits of our agreement include improved drug pricing, as CVS Caremark serves a greater volume of customers and is able to offer a more competitive cost structure; enhanced clinical capabilities through best-in-class integrated clinical programs focused on medication adherence for our members that foster better health outcomes and reduce overall medical costs; improved customer service and member experience as we migrate to CVS Caremark's platform. The agreement will enable Aetna's members and customers to take advantage of CVS Caremark's innovative technology and significant retail presence. 
Additionally, this agreement provides the flexibility to collaborate on future pharmacy offerings to generate profitable growth. Overall, we believe that this agreement will improve our competitive position as a premier provider of pharmacy benefit management services.
Turning to Health Care reform. We continue to be an active participant in the development of Health Care reform regulations, both at the national and state levels. We are providing our expertise on all of the regulations, including minimum benefit ratio requirements, grandfathering, rate review guidelines and the impact from mandated benefits. Additionally, we are working very closely with state insurance departments on our ongoing rate filings. We continue to responsibly price our products in alignment with underlying medical costs. In working with all parties involved in developing the regulations, we remain committed, as we have been in the past, to be part of the solution. Our Health Care reform implementation team remains focused on the immediate impacts to our business and our customers. Importantly, Ron, Joe and I are very engaged in this implementation to ensure that we are compliant with the intent of the law and identify the strategic business opportunities that may emerge as the result of reform. We are confident that Aetna's well-positioned to be successful in the post-reform environment. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Kim. Kim?"

But I think the message I want to leave you with is that the increases that you're seeing now, we view as related to kind of one-time events in terms of the transition and some other things we have to do. But we are very, very, very focused on our SG&A, and you should expect to see improvements in the future."

655542,114173081,84704,"Aetna Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $1. Excluding favorable prior period development, third quarter operating earnings per share were $0.84, higher t",946,"Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $1. Excluding favorable prior period development, third quarter operating earnings per share were $0.84, higher than the consensus estimate of $0.67 as the result of sound operating fundamentals. These results are a continuation of our strong performance in the first and second quarters, bringing our year-to-date operating earnings per share to $3.03. Our third quarter commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.5% or 82.2% excluding favorable prior period development.
Our performance this quarter, as in the first two quarters, reflects the favorable impact of the management actions we took to improve the underwriting margin profile of our business, as well as favorable utilization trends. We continue to deliver strong operating results. We are strategically positioning the company for future success with the goal of shaping more effective health care systems.
Over the past several years, we have been emphasizing three core elements of our strategy to shape more effective health care systems. First, obtaining deep insight into the evolving needs of our customers to identify areas for future profitable growth. Second, providing information and decision support to help our customers make better informed health decisions. And third, aspiring to achieve operational excellence in everything we do. 
Let me highlight some of the strategic successes we have had in these areas during the third quarter. First, with respect to deep customer insight, we continue to diversify our revenue streams by leveraging our medical management capability. This quarter, we were awarded a new Medicaid contract in Illinois commencing in the first half of 2011. This forward contract covers the aged, blind and disabled population in six counties. We are proud to have been chosen to serve this complex medically challenged population. With respect to information and decision support, our transparency, integration and engagement initiatives are designed to improve quality and lower total cost for our customers. By leveraging the power of technology to provide personalized evidence-based information, our goal is to create an information-driven marketplace.
In the quarter, Aetna's ActiveHealth was selected by the state of North Carolina to provide disease management, case management and wellness services to its 562,000 members, effective January 1, 2011. Notably, this contract involves ActiveHealth in helping foster a patient-centered medical home model for providers throughout the state. North Carolina is the first state where a state health plan is instituting a broad-based strategy to move members for a community-based patient-centered medical home model of care, and we are proud to be part of that effort.
Our strong third quarter performance provides us with an updated 2010 full year outlook. We now project a commercial medical benefit ratio of 81% to 81.3% and operating earnings per share of approximately $3.60. This revised outlook incorporates the prior period development reported in the third quarter, improved commercial underwriting margins and a revised view of SG&A spending. Joe will provide additional details on our 2010 outlook in a moment with some commentary on 2011. Mark will then provide an update regarding the key operational drivers of our 2010 performance.
First though, I would like to briefly comment on Health Care Reform. We are still awaiting further guidance regarding how key provisions of Health Care Reform will be implemented. As we have said, we remain committed to addressing affordability and quality through policy changes and market innovation, as these issues remain challenges for our nation as a whole and for health care consumers. As we implement this new law, the more comprehensive benefits required will result in higher costs for American consumers. We're actively involved in the regulation development phase of reform, and we are working collaboratively with the parties responsible for developing the regulations to provide our thought leadership and expertise.
We would welcome a renewed focus on discussing market-based solutions that address the critical issues of quality and affordability. In the 10 years I have been with the company, we have faced many challenges from our turnaround to the passage of Health Care Reform, and I have a great deal of confidence in our long-term future. Our operating performance continues to improve as we maintain our focus on responsible pricing and effective medical quality and cost management. We are successfully executing our customer-focused strategy to build an information-driven health care marketplace.
Our financial strength and flexibility provide a strong foundation for future success and we have a seasoned leadership team. In that regard, it gives me great pleasure that Mark Bertolini will become CEO of Aetna in a few weeks. Mark and I have worked closely together over the past seven years in running this company. Mark has developed a reputation as a thoughtful strategist and is an individual dedicated to strong operational execution. In addition, he has taken a leadership role throughout the reform effort, and I know that experience will serve him well in his new role.
Mark and Joe, and my management team, will continue to strive for industry-leading performance. I will remain at Aetna full time in the role of Executive Chairman until April of next year. As Executive Chairman, I will chair the Board of Directors, continue to work closely with Mark on strategy and transition the relationships I have developed with various important constituencies to Mark. In addition, I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. We are confident that through their efforts, we will be successful in 2010 and beyond.
I will now turn the call over to Joe Zubretsky to provide insight into our third quarter financial performance and our 2010 outlook. Joe?"
655542,114173081,84704,"Aetna Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $1, an increase of 45% compared to the prior-year quarter. Excluding prior period reserved development, operating earnings per share was $0.8",1549,"Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $1, an increase of 45% compared to the prior-year quarter. Excluding prior period reserved development, operating earnings per share was $0.84. Third quarter operating earnings of $420 million were 36% higher than the prior-year quarter. This was a result of higher commercial underwriting margin due to improve underlying performance and favorable prior period development, partially offset by lower commercial membership.
Other key highlights of the quarter include a commercial medical benefit ratio of 80.5% or 82.2% excluding favorable prior period development. A Medicare medical benefit ratio of 84.9% and a business segment SG&A ratio of 18.5%. I will now discuss the drivers of our third quarter financial performance, starting with operating margin and its key components.
Third quarter before tax operating margin was 8.7%. Excluding prior period development, the operating margin was 7.4% before tax or 4.8% after-tax. Third quarter revenue of $8.5 billion included a 2.5% year-over-year decrease in Health Care revenue. This was driven by a 2.6% decrease in Health Care premium, which reflected a net decrease in commercial premium of approximately 5%, resulting from a volume decline of approximately 11%, a rate increase of approximately 11% and a 5% decline for mix associated with product, geography and customer market segment.
Health Care premium also reflected a 3.3% increase in Medicare premium and a 17.6% increase in Medicaid premium related primarily to membership gains. In addition, third quarter fees and other revenue declined 2.7%, primarily due to lower fee yields, reflecting a competitive pricing environment.
Our third quarter total medical benefit ratio was 81.8%, which included $107 million before tax of favorable prior period reserved development. This amount related to second quarter dates of service across all products, including $90 million in Commercial, $6 million in Medicare and $11 million in Medicaid. 
Our third quarter commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.5% or 82.2% excluding prior period development. This favorable result was due primarily to lower underlying utilization. Our third quarter Medicare and Medicaid medical benefit ratios were 84.9% and 88.8%, respectively. The Medicare MBR decreased by 50 basis points year-over-year, while the Medicaid MBR increased by 220 basis points. The year-over-year increase in the Medicaid MBR was partially driven by unfavorable experience in one contract. On a full year basis, the Medicaid business is tracking with our expectations.
We continue to reflect appropriate assumptions regarding medical cost trend, operating metrics and payout patterns in setting reserves for estimated health care costs. Days claims payable were 43.2 days as of September 30, consistent with the second quarter. We continue to project days claims payable to be in the low 40s over time. Group Insurance operating earnings were $34.6 million during the quarter, representing a year-over-year increase of 3.9% in line with expectations.
Our business segment operating expense ratio of 18.5% was better than expected due to the impact of changes we made to our defined benefit pension plan, the delay of some spending now projected to occur in the fourth quarter rather than the third quarter and disciplined expense management. With respect to the defined benefit pension plan, we elected to freeze the plan as of December 31, 2010, while enhancing the employer contribution to our 401(k) plan to make our retirement benefits more appealing to a broader employee base. This change lowered our pretax expenses by approximately $21 million in the third quarter.
Turning now to membership. We ended the quarter with 18.5 million medical members, a sequential decline of 74,000. This contraction reflects a decline of 112,000 commercial members, of which 82,000 were insured and 30,000 were ASC. The commercial decline was driven by economic attrition of approximately 70,000. A decrease of 2,000 Medicare members and an increase of 40,000 Medicaid members, of which approximately 15,000 were from new contracts in Pennsylvania and Florida. The remainder of the increase was due to increases in eligibility and enrollment throughout the remainder of our footprint states. 
The final area of financial performance I will comment on is our investment performance and management of capital. Third quarter net investment income on our continuing business portfolio was $170 million, relatively consistent with the prior year. Our portfolio position is strong with an unrealized gain position on the continuing business portfolio of $1.1 billion before tax at September 30.
Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. As of September 30, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of under 31.6% as we issued debt to pre-fund a portion of a debt maturing in 2011. Our liquidity remains strong as well. We started the quarter with $100 million of holding company liquidity. During the quarter, we issued $750 million of 10-year 3.95% senior notes in anticipation of debt maturing in 2011. Third quarter dividends and other sources of funds to the parent were $716 million. We deployed these sources to fund $526 million of share repurchases, cover fixed charges of $45 million, contribute approximately $330 million after-tax to our defined benefit pension plan and reduce our outstanding commercial paper by $215 million.
During the quarter, we repurchased 17.8 million shares. Our basic share count was 400.1 million at September 30. Through the end of the third quarter, we have repurchased 33 million shares year-to-date for $1 billion. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $450 million.
For the third quarter, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow was $186 million or $515 million excluding the pension contribution. This result reflects the return of excess Medicare payments we received in 2009. Year-to-date, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow, excluding the pension contribution, represented 104% of operating earnings excluding pension expense. As we previously guided, due to various timing items, the full year 2010 cash flow is projected to be about 100% of operating earnings excluding pension expense.
I will now discuss our updated 2010 guidance. We now project full year 2010 operating earnings per share of approximately $3.60, a $0.50 increase from the midpoint of our previous guidance range. This increase reflects the favorable development reported in the third quarter, improvements in commercial risk underwriting margin and an impact of the change in our retirement plans and lower SG&A spending. We project 2010 year-end medical membership to be approximately 18.4 million members, consistent with previous guidance. This reflects a decrease in commercial membership, primarily ASC from continued projected economic attrition. The decrease in commercial members is expected to be partially offset by growth in Medicaid. We now project that total company revenue will be down by slightly less than 3% from 2009.
With respect to medical benefit ratios, we project: a full year Commercial premium yield that exceeds medical cost trend, which we now project to be at the low-end of our previous range of 8% plus or minus 50 basis points; a 2010 commercial medical benefit ratio of 81% to 81.3%; and a 2010 Medicare medical benefit ratio that is in the high 80s. For the full year, we also project: a business segment operating expense ratio below 19%, which is slightly lower than our prior guidance; a full year before tax operating margin in excess of 7.5%; and a debt-to-capitalization ratio of approximately 30%.  In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter performance and are confident in our outlook for 2010.
Turning now to 2011. We are in the midst of developing our 2011 operating plan and are factoring the potential impact of the new regulatory environment into our analysis. We are not prepared to share specific 2011 operating earnings per share guidance at this time. In general, there are a number of challenges to confront with respect to 2011. We expect to see a decline of approximately 550,000 to 600,000 members in the first quarter of 2011, with the majority of the loss from large account ASC customers. This is due to lower account retention due in part to competitive pricing and the continuing impact of economic attrition. The membership for the remainder of 2011 will be highly dependent on the state of the economy and employment.
Earnings in the 2010 benefited significantly from favorable prior period reserved development, which we, as a matter of course, do not project to recur. We are also expecting the extremely low interest rate environment to continue and while we have an outline of minimum MLR [medical loss ratio] regulations, offered by the NAIC [National Association of Insurance Commissioners], there are still many issues that are not finalized. 
In the midst of these challenges, we continue to develop our 2011 plan, which will include favorable impacts from expense actions to adjust our cost structure to be aligned with our membership projection, continued pricing discipline with a focus on pricing to forward view of medical cost trends and rigorous execution of medical management and quality initiatives, including targeted provider recontracting.
As the fourth quarter progresses, we will continue to work through our planning process for 2011, incorporating evolving views of Health Care Reform in the uncertain economy. We will provide detailed 2011 guidance on our fourth quarter call in early February, and we will elaborate further at our March 4, Investor Day. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark for commentary on our operations. Mark?"

I would like to start with an update on our third quarter operating performance, starting with pricing and underwriting.

I would like to start with an update on our third quarter operating performance, starting with pricing and underwriting. We have continued to maintain our discipline in these areas with the objective that our pricing decisions reflect our projected medical cost trend. 
During the quarter, the positive spread between our premium yield and medical cost trend continued to improve. This achievement demonstrates that the management actions we put in place to price to trend and achieve our target margins have worked. Last year, we indicated that achieving a sustainable positive spread between our premium yield and medical cost trend would take two years. Our results demonstrate that we have reached that milestone earlier than we had projected.
Next, with respect to medical quality and cost management. The actions we initiated last year to improve the management of our medical costs are also working as planned. The results of our previously discussed actions and strategies, as well as the lower utilization that we experienced in the first three quarters of 2010, contribute to our projected annual 2010 medical cost trend at the low end of the previously guided 8% plus or minus 50 basis points range. This projection includes an impact from the mandated benefits required by Health Care Reform and reflects inpatient cost trending in the high single digits, outpatient cost trending at the high single to low double digits, physician cost trending at mid to high single digits and pharmacy costs trending at high single digits.
Going forward, we are focused on impacting medical costs through facility recontracting, reimbursement policies, concurrent review and integrated case and disease management among other initiatives. Specifically, we are leveraging systems and our workforce to find and manage the impactable portion of the costs for the 3% of the members who generate 50% of medical costs, while continuing to improve outcomes. By offering the right benefit designs, effective provider networks, health and wellness programs and information tools, we believe that our members can make more informed decisions on purchasing affordable health care products and solutions.
A brief update on our agreement with CVS Caremark. We announced our long-term strategic relationship with CVS Caremark in July of this year. This arrangement is an outstanding solution for our customers and shareholders. By maintaining control of clinical functions, while outsourcing the CVS Caremark, those functions that benefit from their economies of scale and technologies, we are creating a world-class solution that we believe will be unparalleled in the industry. As we continue to describe the power of this unique offering to our customers, we are confident that it will improve our competitive position in the marketplace and specifically improve the retention of our pharmacy membership over time. The integration and necessary state regulatory approvals are on track for an end of the year commencement. We are still on target to incur $0.06 per share in integration costs for 2010.
Now turning to our CMS sanctions. As you are aware in April 2010, CMS suspended our ability to market to and enroll new members in all Aetna Medicare Advantage and Standalone Prescription Drug Plan contracts. We do not expect these sanctions to be lifted until after the start of the open-enrollment period on November 15. We take this issue very seriously and had devoted additional personnel and resources to fully meet the needs of this important customer. However, it is important to note that the segment most impacted by these sanctions is our individual Medicare business. CMS has granted us a limited waiver of these sanctions to allow us to continue to enroll members into existing group plans through December 31, 2010.
From a financial perspective, our estimate of the impact of the sanctions will be incorporated into our full year 2011 guidance when given. The impact to our Medicare membership has been incorporated into the membership projection for the first quarter of 2011 that Joe discussed. After the effective mitigating actions we intend to take, we project the impact of the CMS sanctions on 2011 operating EPS will be no greater than $0.10 per share.
Turning to Health Care Reform. We continue to be an active participant in the development of Health Care Reform regulations, both at the national and state levels. The recent NAIC votes is just one step closer to final MLR regulations. We continue to be engaged on a range of issues, including grandfathering, rate review guidelines and the impact from mandated benefits, and we continue to appropriately price our products in alignment with underlying medical costs. We are focused on creating market-based solutions to address our customer's number one priority, which is the affordability of quality health care.
Our Health Care Reform implementation team remains focused on both the immediate and the long-term impacts to our business and our customers. Importantly, Ron, Joe, and I are very engaged in this implementation to ensure that we are compliant with the law and identify the strategic business opportunities that may emerge as a result of reform. We are confident that Aetna is well positioned to be successful in the post-reform environment. We remain committed as we have been in the past to be part of the solution.
Finally, I would like to thank Ron Williams and the board for their confidence in me, and I would like to thank Ron for his leadership of Aetna. Over the last 10 years, Ron has built a strong culture that and guided by values and by a focus on the people who use our services. Over the last seven years, Ron has provided me with important insights and development in preparation for the opportunity ahead. And for this, I offer him my sincere thanks. 
Aetna has exceeded over the past 157 years by shifting to meet the needs of the market. We have a brand that will carry us into a new era for our country and our industry. This company is poised to lead our industry into the future of health care. I am honored to have been name Aetna's next Chief Executive Officer, and I will work diligently to navigate this challenging environment on behalf of our customers, our shareholders and our employees.

For example, one of the things that I talked to a lot of employers about is the whole question of part-time employment and the automatic enrollment and how does that all work and how do their business models change as it relates to that. And so I think as you get closer and closer to implementation and really understanding the impact on the employer, both the administration, as well as the employers are working to find a path through this. And I think that that's the tone that as you really get down to the nitty-gritty, there are really choices that are going to have to be made. And I think there's a strong desire for people to be able to keep what they have and to make changes and ways that are reasonable and give consumers optimum choice. So I think that employer dialogue is extremely important, and we are hearing lots of input from our employers."

This morning, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $1.00. Excluding favorable prior period development, third quarter operating earnings per share were $0.84, highe",947,"Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $1.00. Excluding favorable prior period development, third quarter operating earnings per share were $0.84, higher than the consensus estimate of $0.67 as the result of sound operating fundamentals. These results are a continuation of our strong performance in the first and second quarters, bringing our year-to-date operating earnings per share to $3.03. Our third quarter commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.5% or 82.2% excluding favorable prior period development.
Our performance this quarter, as in the first two quarters, reflects the favorable impact of the management actions we took to improve the underwriting margin profile of our business, as well as favorable utilization trends. We continue to deliver strong operating results. We are strategically positioning the company for future success with the goal of shaping more effective health care systems.
Over the past several years, we have been emphasizing three core elements of our strategy to shape more effective health care systems. First, obtaining deep insight into the evolving needs of our customers to identify areas for future profitable growth. Second, providing information and decision support to help our customers make better informed health decisions. And third, aspiring to achieve operational excellence in everything we do. 
Let me highlight some of the strategic successes we have had in these areas during the third quarter. First, with respect to deep customer insight, we continue to diversify our revenue streams by leveraging our medical management capability. This quarter, we were awarded a new Medicaid contract in Illinois commencing in the first half of 2011. This full width contract covers the aged, blind and disabled population in six counties. We are proud to have been chosen to serve this complex medically challenged population. With respect to information and decision support, our transparency, integration and engagement initiatives are designed to improve quality and lower total cost for our customers. By leveraging the power of technology to provide personalized evidence-based information, our goal is to create an information-driven marketplace.
In the quarter, Aetna's ActiveHealth was selected by the state of North Carolina to provide disease management, case management and wellness services to its 562,000 members, effective January 1, 2011. Notably, this contract involves ActiveHealth in helping foster a patient-centered medical home model for providers throughout the state. North Carolina is the first state where a state health plan is instituting a broad-based strategy to move members for a community-based patient-centered medical home model of care, and we are proud to be part of that effort.
Our strong third quarter performance provides us with an updated 2010 full year outlook. We now project a commercial medical benefit ratio of 81% to 81.3% and operating earnings per share of approximately $3.60. This revised outlook incorporates the prior period development reported in the third quarter, improved commercial underwriting margins and a revised view of SG&A spending. Joe will provide additional details on our 2010 outlook in a moment with some commentary on 2011. Mark will then provide an update regarding the key operational drivers of our 2010 performance.
First though, I would like to briefly comment on Health Care Reform. We are still awaiting further guidance regarding how key provisions of Health Care Reform will be implemented. As we have said, we remain committed to addressing affordability and quality through policy changes and market innovation, as these issues remain challenges for our nation as a whole and for health care consumers. As we implement this new law, the more comprehensive benefits required will result in higher costs for American consumers. We're actively involved in the regulation development phase of reform, and we are working collaboratively with the parties responsible for developing the regulations to provide our thought leadership and expertise.
We would welcome a renewed focus on discussing market-based solutions that address the critical issues of quality and affordability. In the 10 years I have been with the company, we have faced many challenges from our turnaround to the passage of Health Care Reform, and I have a great deal of confidence in our long-term future. Our operating performance continues to improve as we maintain our focus on responsible pricing and effective medical quality and cost management. We are successfully executing our customer-focused strategy to build an information-driven health care marketplace.
Our financial strength and flexibility provide a strong foundation for future success and we have a seasoned leadership team. In that regard, it gives me great pleasure that Mark Bertolini will become CEO of Aetna in a few weeks. Mark and I have worked closely together over the past seven years in running this company. Mark has developed a reputation as a thoughtful strategist and is an individual dedicated to strong operational execution. In addition, he has taken a leadership role throughout the reform effort, and I know that experience will serve him well in his new role.
Mark and Joe, and my management team, will continue to strive for industry-leading performance. I will remain at Aetna full time in the role of Executive Chairman until April of next year. As Executive Chairman, I will chair the Board of Directors, continue to work closely with Mark on strategy and transition the relationships I have developed with various important constituencies to Mark. In addition, I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. We are confident that through their efforts, we will be successful in 2010 and beyond.
I will now turn the call over to Joe Zubretsky to provide insight into our third quarter financial performance and our 2010 outlook. Joe?"
655542,114173081,84858,"Aetna Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $1.00, an increase of 45% compared to the prior-year quarter. Excluding prior period reserved development, operating earnings per share was $",1549,"Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $1.00, an increase of 45% compared to the prior-year quarter. Excluding prior period reserved development, operating earnings per share was $0.84. Third quarter operating earnings of $420 million were 36% higher than the prior-year quarter. This was a result of higher commercial underwriting margin due to improve underlying performance and favorable prior period development, partially offset by lower commercial membership.
Other key highlights of the quarter include a commercial medical benefit ratio of 80.5% or 82.2% excluding favorable prior period development. A Medicare medical benefit ratio of 84.9% and a business segment SG&A ratio of 18.5%. I will now discuss the drivers of our third quarter financial performance, starting with operating margin and its key components.
Third quarter before tax operating margin was 8.7%. Excluding prior period development, the operating margin was 7.4% before tax or 4.8% after-tax. Third quarter revenue of $8.5 billion included a 2.5% year-over-year decrease in Health Care revenue. This was driven by a 2.6% decrease in Health Care premium, which reflected a net decrease in commercial premium of approximately 5%, resulting from a volume decline of approximately 11%, a rate increase of approximately 11% and a 5% decline for mix associated with product, geography and customer market segment.
Health Care premium also reflected a 3.3% increase in Medicare premium and a 17.6% increase in Medicaid premium related primarily to membership gains. In addition, third quarter fees and other revenue declined 2.7%, primarily due to lower fee yields, reflecting a competitive pricing environment.
Our third quarter total medical benefit ratio was 81.8%, which included $107 million before tax of favorable prior period reserved development. This amount related to second quarter dates of service across all products, including $90 million in Commercial, $6 million in Medicare and $11 million in Medicaid. 
Our third quarter commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.5% or 82.2% excluding prior period development. This favorable result was due primarily to lower underlying utilization. Our third quarter Medicare and Medicaid medical benefit ratios were 84.9% and 88.8%, respectively. The Medicare MBR decreased by 50 basis points year-over-year, while the Medicaid MBR increased by 220 basis points. The year-over-year increase in the Medicaid MBR was partially driven by unfavorable experience in one contract. On a full year basis, the Medicaid business is tracking with our expectations.
We continue to reflect appropriate assumptions regarding medical cost trend, operating metrics and payout patterns in setting reserves for estimated health care costs. Days claims payable were 43.2 days as of September 30, consistent with the second quarter. We continue to project days claims payable to be in the low 40s over time. Group Insurance operating earnings were $34.6 million during the quarter, representing a year-over-year increase of 3.9% in line with expectations.
Our business segment operating expense ratio of 18.5% was better than expected due to the impact of changes we made to our defined benefit pension plan, the delay of some spending now projected to occur in the fourth quarter rather than the third quarter and disciplined expense management. With respect to the defined benefit pension plan, we elected to freeze the plan as of December 31, 2010, while enhancing the employer contribution to our 401(k) plan to make our retirement benefits more appealing to a broader employee base. This change lowered our pretax expenses by approximately $21 million in the third quarter.
Turning now to membership. We ended the quarter with 18.5 million medical members, a sequential decline of 74,000. This contraction reflects a decline of 112,000 commercial members, of which 82,000 were insured and 30,000 were ASC. The commercial decline was driven by economic attrition of approximately 70,000. A decrease of 2,000 Medicare members and an increase of 40,000 Medicaid members, of which approximately 15,000 were from new contracts in Pennsylvania and Florida. The remainder of the increase was due to increases in eligibility and enrollment throughout the remainder of our footprint states. 
The final area of financial performance I will comment on is our investment performance and management of capital. Third quarter net investment income on our continuing business portfolio was $170 million, relatively consistent with the prior year. Our portfolio position is strong with an unrealized gain position on the continuing business portfolio of $1.1 billion before tax at September 30.
Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. As of September 30, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of under 31.6% as we issued debt to pre-fund a portion of a debt maturing in 2011. Our liquidity remains strong as well. We started the quarter with $100 million of holding company liquidity. During the quarter, we issued $750 million of 10-year 3.95% senior notes in anticipation of debt maturing in 2011. Third quarter dividends and other sources of funds to the parent were $716 million. We deployed these sources to fund $526 million of share repurchases, cover fixed charges of $45 million, contribute approximately $330 million after-tax to our defined benefit pension plan and reduce our outstanding commercial paper by $215 million.
During the quarter, we repurchased 17.8 million shares. Our basic share count was 400.1 million at September 30. Through the end of the third quarter, we have repurchased 33 million shares year-to-date for $1 billion. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $450 million.
For the third quarter, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow was $186 million or $515 million excluding the pension contribution. This result reflects the return of excess Medicare payments we received in 2009. Year-to-date, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow, excluding the pension contribution, represented 104% of operating earnings excluding pension expense. As we previously guided, due to various timing items, the full year 2010 cash flow is projected to be about 100% of operating earnings excluding pension expense.
I will now discuss our updated 2010 guidance. We now project full year 2010 operating earnings per share of approximately $3.60, a $0.50 increase from the midpoint of our previous guidance range. This increase reflects the favorable development reported in the third quarter, improvements in commercial risk underwriting margin and an impact of the change in our retirement plans and lower SG&A spending. We project 2010 year-end medical membership to be approximately 18.4 million members, consistent with previous guidance. This reflects a decrease in commercial membership, primarily ASC from continued projected economic attrition. The decrease in commercial members is expected to be partially offset by growth in Medicaid. We now project that total company revenue will be down by slightly less than 3% from 2009.
With respect to medical benefit ratios, we project: a full year Commercial premium yield that exceeds medical cost trend, which we now project to be at the low-end of our previous range of 8% plus or minus 50 basis points; a 2010 commercial medical benefit ratio of 81% to 81.3%; and a 2010 Medicare medical benefit ratio that is in the high 80s. For the full year, we also project: a business segment operating expense ratio below 19%, which is slightly lower than our prior guidance; a full year before tax operating margin in excess of 7.5%; and a debt-to-capitalization ratio of approximately 30%.  In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter performance and are confident in our outlook for 2010.
Turning now to 2011. We are in the midst of developing our 2011 operating plan and are factoring the potential impact of the new regulatory environment into our analysis. We are not prepared to share specific 2011 operating earnings per share guidance at this time. In general, there are a number of challenges to confront with respect to 2011. We expect to see a decline of approximately 550,000 to 600,000 members in the first quarter of 2011, with the majority of the loss from large account ASC customers. This is due to lower account retention due in part to competitive pricing and the continuing impact of economic attrition. The membership for the remainder of 2011 will be highly dependent on the state of the economy and employment.
Earnings in the 2010 benefited significantly from favorable prior period reserved development, which we, as a matter of course, do not project to recur. We are also expecting the extremely low interest rate environment to continue and while we have an outline of minimum MLR [medical loss ratio] regulations, offered by the NAIC [National Association of Insurance Commissioners], there are still many issues that are not finalized. 
In the midst of these challenges, we continue to develop our 2011 plan, which will include favorable impacts from expense actions to adjust our cost structure to be aligned with our membership projection, continued pricing discipline with a focus on pricing to forward view of medical cost trends and rigorous execution of medical management and quality initiatives, including targeted provider recontracting.
As the fourth quarter progresses, we will continue to work through our planning process for 2011, incorporating evolving views of Health Care Reform in the uncertain economy. We will provide detailed 2011 guidance on our fourth quarter call in early February, and we will elaborate further at our March 4, Investor Day. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark for commentary on our operations. Mark?"
655542,114173081,84858,"Aetna Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning. I would like to start with an update on our third quarter operating performance, starting with pricing and underwriting.

I would like to start with an update on our third quarter operating performance, starting with pricing and underwriting. We have continued to maintain our discipline in these areas with the objective that our pricing decisions reflect our projected medical cost trend. 
During the quarter, the positive spread between our premium yield and medical cost trend continued to improve. This achievement demonstrates that the management actions we put in place to price to trend and achieve our target margins have worked. Last year, we indicated that achieving a sustainable positive spread between our premium yield and medical cost trend would take two years. Our results demonstrate that we have reached that milestone earlier than we had projected.
Next, with respect to medical quality and cost management. The actions we initiated last year to improve the management of our medical costs are also working as planned. The results of our previously discussed actions and strategies, as well as the lower utilization that we experienced in the first three quarters of 2010, contribute to our projected annual 2010 medical cost trend at the low end of the previously guided 8% plus or minus 50 basis points range. This projection includes an impact from the mandated benefits required by Health Care Reform and reflects inpatient cost trending in the high single digits, outpatient cost trending at the high single to low double digits, physician cost trending at mid to high single digits and pharmacy costs trending at high single digits.
Going forward, we are focused on impacting medical costs through facility recontracting, reimbursement policies, concurrent review and integrated case and disease management among other initiatives. Specifically, we are leveraging systems and our workforce to find and manage the impactable portion of the costs for the 3% of the members who generate 50% of medical costs, while continuing to improve outcomes. By offering the right benefit designs, effective provider networks, health and wellness programs and information tools, we believe that our members can make more informed decisions on purchasing affordable health care products and solutions.
A brief update on our agreement with CVS Caremark. We announced our long-term strategic relationship with CVS Caremark in July of this year. This arrangement is an outstanding solution for our customers and shareholders. By maintaining control of clinical functions, while outsourcing the CVS Caremark, those functions that benefit from their economies of scale and technologies, we are creating a world-class solution that we believe will be unparalleled in the industry. As we continue to describe the power of this unique offering to our customers, we are confident that it will improve our competitive position in the marketplace and specifically improve the retention of our pharmacy membership over time. The integration and necessary state regulatory approvals are on track for an end of the year commencement. We are still on target to incur $0.06 per share in integration costs for 2010.
Now turning to our CMS sanctions. As you are aware in April 2010, CMS suspended our ability to market to and enroll new members in all Aetna Medicare Advantage and Standalone Prescription Drug Plan contracts. We do not expect these sanctions to be lifted until after the start of the open-enrollment period on November 15. We take this issue very seriously and had devoted additional personnel and resources to fully meet the needs of this important customer. However, it is important to note that the segment most impacted by these sanctions is our individual Medicare business. CMS has granted us a limited waiver of these sanctions to allow us to continue to enroll members into existing group plans through December 31, 2010.
From a financial perspective, our estimate of the impact of the sanctions will be incorporated into our full year 2011 guidance when given. The impact to our Medicare membership has been incorporated into the membership projection for the first quarter of 2011 that Joe discussed. After the effective mitigating actions we intend to take, we project the impact of the CMS sanctions on 2011 operating EPS will be no greater than $0.10 per share.
Turning to Health Care Reform. We continue to be an active participant in the development of Health Care Reform regulations, both at the national and state levels. The recent NAIC votes brings us one step closer to final MLR regulations. We continue to be engaged on a range of issues, including grandfathering, rate review guidelines and the impact from mandated benefits, and we continue to appropriately price our products in alignment with underlying medical costs. We are focused on creating market-based solutions to address our customer's number one priority, which is the affordability of quality health care.
Our Health Care Reform implementation team remains focused on both the immediate and the long-term impacts to our business and our customers. Importantly, Ron, Joe, and I are very engaged in this implementation to ensure that we are compliant with the law and identify the strategic business opportunities that may emerge as a result of reform. We are confident that Aetna is well positioned to be successful in the post-reform environment. We remain committed as we have been in the past to be part of the solution.
Finally, I would like to thank Ron Williams and the board for their confidence in me, and I would like to thank Ron for his leadership of Aetna. Over the last 10 years, Ron has built a strong culture at Aetna guided by values and by a focus on the people who use our services. Over the last seven years, Ron has provided me with important insights and development in preparation for the opportunity ahead. And for this, I offer him my sincere thanks. 
Aetna has succeeded over the past 157 years by shifting to meet the needs of the market. We have a brand that will carry us into a new era for our country and our industry. This company is poised to lead our industry into the future of health care. I am honored to have been named Aetna's next Chief Executive Officer, and I will work diligently to navigate this challenging environment on behalf of our customers, our shareholders and our employees.
With that, I will turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?"

 During this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from currently projected results are described in Aetna's 2009 Form 10-K, our first and second quarter 2010 Form 10-Qs and our third quarter 2010 Form 10-Q, when filed with the SEC. Pursuant to SEC Regulation G, we have provided reconciliations of metrics related to the company's performance that are non-GAAP measures in our third quarter 2010 financial supplement and our 2010 guidance summary. These reconciliations are available on the Investor Information portion of aetna.com.
 Also, as you know, Regulation FD limits our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in non-public forums, so we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call.

 With that, I will turn the call over to Ron Williams. Ron?

This morning, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $1. Excluding favorable prior period development, third quarter operating earnings per share were $0.84, higher",946," Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $1. Excluding favorable prior period development, third quarter operating earnings per share were $0.84, higher than the consensus estimate of $0.67 as the result of sound operating fundamentals. These results are a continuation of our strong performance in the first and second quarters, bringing our year-to-date operating earnings per share to $3.03. Our third quarter commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.5% or 82.2% excluding favorable prior period development.
 Our performance this quarter, as in the first two quarters, reflects the favorable impact of the management actions we took to improve the underwriting margin profile of our business, as well as favorable utilization trends. We continue to deliver strong operating results. We are strategically positioning the company for future success with the goal of shaping more effective health care systems.
 Over the past several years, we have been emphasizing three core elements of our strategy to shape more effective health care systems. First, obtaining deep insight into the evolving needs of our customers to identify areas for future profitable growth. Second, providing information and decision support to help our customers make better informed health decisions. And third, aspiring to achieve operational excellence in everything we do.
 Let me highlight some of the strategic successes we have had in these areas during the third quarter. First, with respect to deep customer insight, we continue to diversify our revenue streams by leveraging our medical management capability. This quarter, we were awarded a new Medicaid contract in Illinois commencing in the first half of 2011. This forward contract covers the aged, blind and disabled population in six counties. We are proud to have been chosen to serve this complex medically challenged population. With respect to information and decision support, our transparency, integration and engagement initiatives are designed to improve quality and lower total cost for our customers. By leveraging the power of technology to provide personalized evidence-based information, our goal is to create an information-driven marketplace.
 In the quarter, Aetna's ActiveHealth was selected by the state of North Carolina to provide disease management, case management and wellness services to its 562,000 members, effective January 1, 2011. Notably, this contract involves ActiveHealth in helping foster a patient-centered medical home model for providers throughout the state. North Carolina is the first state where a state health plan is instituting a broad-based strategy to move members for a community-based patient-centered medical home model of care, and we are proud to be part of that effort.
 Our strong third quarter performance provides us with an updated 2010 full year outlook. We now project a commercial medical benefit ratio of 81% to 81.3% and operating earnings per share of approximately $3.60. This revised outlook incorporates the prior period development reported in the third quarter, improved commercial underwriting margins and a revised view of SG&A spending. Joe will provide additional details on our 2010 outlook in a moment with some commentary on 2011. Mark will then provide an update regarding the key operational drivers of our 2010 performance.
 First though, I would like to briefly comment on Health Care Reform. We are still awaiting further guidance regarding how key provisions of Health Care Reform will be implemented. As we have said, we remain committed to addressing affordability and quality through policy changes and market innovation, as these issues remain challenges for our nation as a whole and for health care consumers. As we implement this new law, the more comprehensive benefits required will result in higher costs for American consumers. We're actively involved in the regulation development phase of reform, and we are working collaboratively with the parties responsible for developing the regulations to provide our thought leadership and expertise.
 We would welcome a renewed focus on discussing market-based solutions that address the critical issues of quality and affordability. In the 10 years I have been with the company, we have faced many challenges from our turnaround to the passage of Health Care Reform, and I have a great deal of confidence in our long-term future. Our operating performance continues to improve as we maintain our focus on responsible pricing and effective medical quality and cost management. We are successfully executing our customer-focused strategy to build an information-driven health care marketplace.
 Our financial strength and flexibility provide a strong foundation for future success and we have a seasoned leadership team. In that regard, it gives me great pleasure that Mark Bertolini will become CEO of Aetna in a few weeks. Mark and I have worked closely together over the past seven years in running this company. Mark has developed a reputation as a thoughtful strategist and is an individual dedicated to strong operational execution. In addition, he has taken a leadership role throughout the reform effort, and I know that experience will serve him well in his new role.
 Mark and Joe, and my management team, will continue to strive for industry-leading performance. I will remain at Aetna full time in the role of Executive Chairman until April of next year. As Executive Chairman, I will chair the Board of Directors, continue to work closely with Mark on strategy and transition the relationships I have developed with various important constituencies to Mark. In addition, I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication in meeting the needs of our customers. We are confident that through their efforts, we will be successful in 2010 and beyond.
 I will now turn the call over to Joe Zubretsky to provide insight into our third quarter financial performance and our 2010 outlook. Joe?

655542,114173081,86556,"Aetna Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2010",2010-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives"," Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $1, an increase of 45% compared to the prior-year quarter. Excluding prior period reserved development, operating earnings per share was $0.",1549," Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $1, an increase of 45% compared to the prior-year quarter. Excluding prior period reserved development, operating earnings per share was $0.84. Third quarter operating earnings of $420 million were 36% higher than the prior-year quarter. This was a result of higher commercial underwriting margin due to improve underlying performance and favorable prior period development, partially offset by lower commercial membership.
 Other key highlights of the quarter include a commercial medical benefit ratio of 80.5% or 82.2% excluding favorable prior period development. A Medicare medical benefit ratio of 84.9% and a business segment SG&A ratio of 18.5%. I will now discuss the drivers of our third quarter financial performance, starting with operating margin and its key components.
 Third quarter before tax operating margin was 8.7%. Excluding prior period development, the operating margin was 7.4% before tax or 4.8% after-tax. Third quarter revenue of $8.5 billion included a 2.5% year-over-year decrease in Health Care revenue. This was driven by a 2.6% decrease in Health Care premium, which reflected a net decrease in commercial premium of approximately 5%, resulting from a volume decline of approximately 11%, a rate increase of approximately 11% and a 5% decline for mix associated with product, geography and customer market segment.
 Health Care premium also reflected a 3.3% increase in Medicare premium and a 17.6% increase in Medicaid premium related primarily to membership gains. In addition, third quarter fees and other revenue declined 2.7%, primarily due to lower fee yields, reflecting a competitive pricing environment.
 Our third quarter total medical benefit ratio was 81.8%, which included $107 million before tax of favorable prior period reserved development. This amount related to second quarter dates of service across all products, including $90 million in Commercial, $6 million in Medicare and $11 million in Medicaid.
 Our third quarter commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.5% or 82.2% excluding prior period development. This favorable result was due primarily to lower underlying utilization. Our third quarter Medicare and Medicaid medical benefit ratios were 84.9% and 88.8%, respectively. The Medicare MBR decreased by 50 basis points year-over-year, while the Medicaid MBR increased by 220 basis points. The year-over-year increase in the Medicaid MBR was partially driven by unfavorable experience in one contract. On a full year basis, the Medicaid business is tracking with our expectations.
 We continue to reflect appropriate assumptions regarding medical cost trend, operating metrics and payout patterns in setting reserves for estimated health care costs. Days claims payable were 43.2 days as of September 30, consistent with the second quarter. We continue to project days claims payable to be in the low 40s over time. Group Insurance operating earnings were $34.6 million during the quarter, representing a year-over-year increase of 3.9% in line with expectations.
 Our business segment operating expense ratio of 18.5% was better than expected due to the impact of changes we made to our defined benefit pension plan, the delay of some spending now projected to occur in the fourth quarter rather than the third quarter and disciplined expense management. With respect to the defined benefit pension plan, we elected to freeze the plan as of December 31, 2010, while enhancing the employer contribution to our 401(k) plan to make our retirement benefits more appealing to a broader employee base. This change lowered our pretax expenses by approximately $21 million in the third quarter.
 Turning now to membership. We ended the quarter with 18.5 million medical members, a sequential decline of 74,000. This contraction reflects a decline of 112,000 commercial members, of which 82,000 were insured and 30,000 were ASC. The commercial decline was driven by economic attrition of approximately 70,000. A decrease of 2,000 Medicare members and an increase of 40,000 Medicaid members, of which approximately 15,000 were from new contracts in Pennsylvania and Florida. The remainder of the increase was due to increases in eligibility and enrollment throughout the remainder of our footprint states.
 The final area of financial performance I will comment on is our investment performance and management of capital. Third quarter net investment income on our continuing business portfolio was $170 million, relatively consistent with the prior year. Our portfolio position is strong with an unrealized gain position on the continuing business portfolio of $1.1 billion before tax at September 30.
 Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. As of September 30, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of under 31.6% as we issued debt to pre-fund a portion of a debt maturing in 2011. Our liquidity remains strong as well. We started the quarter with $100 million of holding company liquidity. During the quarter, we issued $750 million of 10-year 3.95% senior notes in anticipation of debt maturing in 2011. Third quarter dividends and other sources of funds to the parent were $716 million. We deployed these sources to fund $526 million of share repurchases, cover fixed charges of $45 million, contribute approximately $330 million after-tax to our defined benefit pension plan and reduce our outstanding commercial paper by $215 million.
 During the quarter, we repurchased 17.8 million shares. Our basic share count was 400.1 million at September 30. Through the end of the third quarter, we have repurchased 33 million shares year-to-date for $1 billion. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $450 million.
 For the third quarter, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow was $186 million or $515 million excluding the pension contribution. This result reflects the return of excess Medicare payments we received in 2009. Year-to-date, Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flow, excluding the pension contribution, represented 104% of operating earnings excluding pension expense. As we previously guided, due to various timing items, the full year 2010 cash flow is projected to be about 100% of operating earnings excluding pension expense.
 I will now discuss our updated 2010 guidance. We now project full year 2010 operating earnings per share of approximately $3.60, a $0.50 increase from the midpoint of our previous guidance range. This increase reflects the favorable development reported in the third quarter, improvements in commercial risk underwriting margin and an impact of the change in our retirement plans and lower SG&A spending. We project 2010 year-end medical membership to be approximately 18.4 million members, consistent with previous guidance. This reflects a decrease in commercial membership, primarily ASC from continued projected economic attrition. The decrease in commercial members is expected to be partially offset by growth in Medicaid. We now project that total company revenue will be down by slightly less than 3% from 2009.
 With respect to medical benefit ratios, we project: a full year Commercial premium yield that exceeds medical cost trend, which we now project to be at the low-end of our previous range of 8% plus or minus 50 basis points; a 2010 commercial medical benefit ratio of 81% to 81.3%; and a 2010 Medicare medical benefit ratio that is in the high 80s. For the full year, we also project: a business segment operating expense ratio below 19%, which is slightly lower than our prior guidance; a full year before tax operating margin in excess of 7.5%; and a debt-to-capitalization ratio of approximately 30%.  In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter performance and are confident in our outlook for 2010.
 Turning now to 2011. We are in the midst of developing our 2011 operating plan and are factoring the potential impact of the new regulatory environment into our analysis. We are not prepared to share specific 2011 operating earnings per share guidance at this time. In general, there are a number of challenges to confront with respect to 2011. We expect to see a decline of approximately 550,000 to 600,000 members in the first quarter of 2011, with the majority of the loss from large account ASC customers. This is due to lower account retention due in part to competitive pricing and the continuing impact of economic attrition. The membership for the remainder of 2011 will be highly dependent on the state of the economy and employment.
 Earnings in the 2010 benefited significantly from favorable prior period reserved development, which we, as a matter of course, do not project to recur. We are also expecting the extremely low interest rate environment to continue and while we have an outline of minimum MLR [medical loss ratio] regulations, offered by the NAIC [National Association of Insurance Commissioners], there are still many issues that are not finalized.
 In the midst of these challenges, we continue to develop our 2011 plan, which will include favorable impacts from expense actions to adjust our cost structure to be aligned with our membership projection, continued pricing discipline with a focus on pricing to forward view of medical cost trends and rigorous execution of medical management and quality initiatives, including targeted provider recontracting.
 As the fourth quarter progresses, we will continue to work through our planning process for 2011, incorporating evolving views of Health Care Reform in the uncertain economy. We will provide detailed 2011 guidance on our fourth quarter call in early February, and we will elaborate further at our March 4, Investor Day.
 I will now turn the call over to Mark for commentary on our operations. Mark?

I would like to start with an update on our third quarter operating performance, starting with pricing and underwriting.

I would like to start with an update on our third quarter operating performance, starting with pricing and underwriting. We have continued to maintain our discipline in these areas with the objective that our pricing decisions reflect our projected medical cost trend.
 During the quarter, the positive spread between our premium yield and medical cost trend continued to improve. This achievement demonstrates that the management actions we put in place to price to trend and achieve our target margins have worked. Last year, we indicated that achieving a sustainable positive spread between our premium yield and medical cost trend would take two years. Our results demonstrate that we have reached that milestone earlier than we had projected.
 Next, with respect to medical quality and cost management. The actions we initiated last year to improve the management of our medical costs are also working as planned. The results of our previously discussed actions and strategies, as well as the lower utilization that we experienced in the first three quarters of 2010, contribute to our projected annual 2010 medical cost trend at the low end of the previously guided 8% plus or minus 50 basis points range. This projection includes an impact from the mandated benefits required by Health Care Reform and reflects inpatient cost trending in the high single digits, outpatient cost trending at the high single to low double digits, physician cost trending at mid to high single digits and pharmacy costs trending at high single digits.
 Going forward, we are focused on impacting medical costs through facility recontracting, reimbursement policies, concurrent review and integrated case and disease management among other initiatives. Specifically, we are leveraging systems and our workforce to find and manage the impactable portion of the costs for the 3% of the members who generate 50% of medical costs, while continuing to improve outcomes. By offering the right benefit designs, effective provider networks, health and wellness programs and information tools, we believe that our members can make more informed decisions on purchasing affordable health care products and solutions.
 A brief update on our agreement with CVS Caremark. We announced our long-term strategic relationship with CVS Caremark in July of this year. This arrangement is an outstanding solution for our customers and shareholders. By maintaining control of clinical functions, while outsourcing the CVS Caremark, those functions that benefit from their economies of scale and technologies, we are creating a world-class solution that we believe will be unparalleled in the industry. As we continue to describe the power of this unique offering to our customers, we are confident that it will improve our competitive position in the marketplace and specifically improve the retention of our pharmacy membership over time. The integration and necessary state regulatory approvals are on track for an end of the year commencement. We are still on target to incur $0.06 per share in integration costs for 2010.
 Now turning to our CMS sanctions. As you are aware in April 2010, CMS suspended our ability to market to and enroll new members in all Aetna Medicare Advantage and Standalone Prescription Drug Plan contracts. We do not expect these sanctions to be lifted until after the start of the open-enrollment period on November 15. We take this issue very seriously and had devoted additional personnel and resources to fully meet the needs of this important customer. However, it is important to note that the segment most impacted by these sanctions is our individual Medicare business. CMS has granted us a limited waiver of these sanctions to allow us to continue to enroll members into existing group plans through December 31, 2010.
 From a financial perspective, our estimate of the impact of the sanctions will be incorporated into our full year 2011 guidance when given. The impact to our Medicare membership has been incorporated into the membership projection for the first quarter of 2011 that Joe discussed. After the effective mitigating actions we intend to take, we project the impact of the CMS sanctions on 2011 operating EPS will be no greater than $0.10 per share.
 Turning to Health Care Reform. We continue to be an active participant in the development of Health Care Reform regulations, both at the national and state levels. The recent NAIC votes is just one step closer to final MLR regulations. We continue to be engaged on a range of issues, including grandfathering, rate review guidelines and the impact from mandated benefits, and we continue to appropriately price our products in alignment with underlying medical costs. We are focused on creating market-based solutions to address our customer's number one priority, which is the affordability of quality health care.
 Our Health Care Reform implementation team remains focused on both the immediate and the long-term impacts to our business and our customers. Importantly, Ron, Joe, and I are very engaged in this implementation to ensure that we are compliant with the law and identify the strategic business opportunities that may emerge as a result of reform. We are confident that Aetna is well positioned to be successful in the post-reform environment. We remain committed as we have been in the past to be part of the solution.
 Finally, I would like to thank Ron Williams and the board for their confidence in me, and I would like to thank Ron for his leadership of Aetna. Over the last 10 years, Ron has built a strong culture that and guided by values and by a focus on the people who use our services. Over the last seven years, Ron has provided me with important insights and development in preparation for the opportunity ahead. And for this, I offer him my sincere thanks.
 Aetna has exceeded over the past 157 years by shifting to meet the needs of the market. We have a brand that will carry us into a new era for our country and our industry. This company is poised to lead our industry into the future of health care. I am honored to have been name Aetna's next Chief Executive Officer, and I will work diligently to navigate this challenging environment on behalf of our customers, our shareholders and our employees.
 With that, I will turn the call back over to Tom. Tom?

And Mark and his operating team would contemplate any of those structures in order to have a more workable MLR formula.

We're disappointed that the broker commissions are still included in the MLR calculation because that presents fewer options for us to deal with those costs within the context of Health Care Reform. So we are actively working. We have communicated very recently with our brokers about how we could structure some of these things come and we will be announcing shortly before the end of the year how we will impact commissions going forward.

Can you talk about longer-term strategic plans here on the heels of reform? And I know regs [regulations] are still being written, but specifically exchanges and how you think of positioning or repositioning Aetna with respect to the creation of these state exchanges? For example, would you see Aetna needing to become more localized, gaining share in some markets and maybe exiting some other markets based on where you see a business-friendly environment for these exchanges? Any other things you're thinking about in terms of strategy and positioning of Aetna for success over the next five to 10 years?

With Joe's promotion, which will be part of my taking on the CEO role, in November, Joe will be working on a number of significant strategic diversification issues as we move ahead, and we'll be able to talk about those in March. I wouldn't want to address them at this point in time. As it relates to exchanges, we like exchanges properly structured on market-based aspects. And so we would see the ability to have transparency into the marketplace and how it works everyday and the ability to make changes everyday to how we're presented in the marketplace vis-à-vis our competition, a very positive impact on the individual small group markets. Having said that, we need to get regulation to that point and to that point, state-by-state. A number of states have started already, but a lot of states haven't. And the level of funding and effort required to get them there remains to be seen as to whether or not we'll be ready by 2014. We do see an imperative on our part to have fewer plan designs, being fewer markets, where we believe we have an opportunity to succeed, to have an affordable model because it will be all about total costs. And so SG&A, benefit costs and the way we approach the market including distribution costs will all be important in determining that the affordability.
