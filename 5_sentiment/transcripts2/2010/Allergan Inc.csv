249205,84111101,48923,"Allergan Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-04-2010",2010-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Allergan, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter year-over-year sales growth demonstrated the continuing trend of recovery observable across each sequential quarter of 2009 versus the corresponding quarter of 2008. Fourth quarter",2616,"Great. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter year-over-year sales growth demonstrated the continuing trend of recovery observable across each sequential quarter of 2009 versus the corresponding quarter of 2008. Fourth quarter sales increased year-over-year by a very strong 15.9% in dollars and by 11.2% in local currencies, driven by another strong quarter in ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, a return to robust growth across the facial aesthetics franchise, a strong contribution from LATISSE and finally, massive growth in Asia.Only LAP-BAND continued to be weighed down by the cost of medical co-pays and the impact of the recession on the self-pay segment of the market. Although the banding market too shows early signs of recovery. Obviously, fourth quarter performance was in comparison to the weakest quarter of 2008, when the world economy was plunging and real performance has also flattered by the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar compared to other leading global currencies.Full year performance was impacted by the sales declines in the first half of the year, posting growth of 2.5% in dollars and 4.9% in local currencies for the full year. Given the broad-based upturn in our markets around the world and the sales acceleration of our brands, some in part as a result of our increased investments in direct-to-consumer advertising. Since June, we continued our strategy of spreading into recovery, also broadening our spend from DTC alone into other impactful high-return marketing programs, with the goal of boosting our sales momentum as we enter 2010.Given management's attention to the execution of the limited number of these programs, we're applying discipline to maintain the strong spending controls and rigor that we put in place since late 2008. For the full year, Allergan spent $185 million on direct-to-consumer advertising, an increase of 47% over 2008 and even above $136 million, which we spent in our record sales performance here, pre-recession in 2007.Also aided by strong performance regarding gross margin in the fourth quarter, we recorded non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.78, an increase of 2.6% over the result of Q4 of 2008 but exceeding the expectation range of $0.75 to $0.77 provided at the time of our third quarter results. For the full year, non-GAAP EPS was $2.78, marking a growth of 8.2% for the full year versus 2008. This was also greater than the expectation range provided in February of last year of $2.69 to $2.75. Our decision announced in February to cut expenses and reduce payroll costs was clearly the correct action.Now I'd like to comment on our expectations for 2010. We're estimating sales growth in the range of 2% to 7% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.09 to $3.15, marking a return to double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth in the range of 11% to 13%. In order to achieve this performance, we'll broadly leverage our selling, general and administrative costs. During the year, we have no plans to expand our sales forces in the U.S. and Europe, although we have some expansions in emerging markets. On the other hand, we have chosen to ramp up our spending in R&D, which is estimated to be in the range of 15% to 16% of sales. There are several challenges for forecasting 2010 performance: Firstly, determining the shape for the economic recovery, while we prepare to remain somewhat cautious; secondly, predicting the full impact of generics to our U.S. Ophthalmology business; and finally, within our forecast, we're assuming that we are successful in securing some important regulatory approvals.Regarding competition for BOTOX cosmetic and therapeutic in the U.S. and Europe, we're feeling much more confident about our ability to retain high market shares, as we increasingly focus our efforts into market expansion versus defense of market share. Notwithstanding this, a full year of competition effect will still dent BOTOX sales growth. In terms of R&D in the fourth quarter, we again increased R&D expenditure to $185.2 million on a non-GAAP basis, which was 11.2% over Q4 of 2008 and sequentially increased 11.1% over Q3 of 2009.Looking back on the back end of 2008 and the whole of 2009, I wish that we have more aggressively started some new programs earlier, as we finished up many expensive Phase III trials such as for Botox for chronic migraine; OZURDEX for retinal vein occlusion and uveitis; and ACUVAIL and ZYMAR X. Well, this of course is the benefit of hindsight, and clearly, we were cautious about long-term spending and commitments early in 2009, given the economic turmoil at that time. We're also able to embark on a long-term program to reduce the cost of clinical development. In 2009, we're able to enroll 8% more patients for clinical trials per Allergan Clinical Research Associate and have set metrics in place in 2010 to reduce the average clinical trial cost per patient compared to 2009.Since the beginning of the year, we've had a string of regulatory approvals, LUMIGAN 0.1%, was approved in the European Union and is about to be launched in the U.K. and Germany. This FDA approved JUVÉDERM XC, the next-generation product providing the benefits of pain control with lidocaine, which has been shipping to the market since February 1. Health Canada approved SANCTURA XR and OZURDEX was approved in the India and New Zealand. Regarding key regulatory filings, the fourth quarter was full of activity. Regarding BOTOX for chronic migraine, files were submitted to Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Switzerland, and RESTASIS was filed in Canada and Australia. Regarding the chronic migraine filing with the U.S. FDA, we were not surprised that this will undergo the full standard review cycle.Regarding new technology, we're also pleased that we further strengthened our pipeline by acquiring Serica, a private company based in Massachusetts, with a unique patent-protected silk mesh technology for use in tissue regeneration, especially in breast reconstruction. Regarding the alpha-agonists and government [ph] program, the latter partnered with ExonHit, we are in advanced negotiations with several parties regarding our licensing. Strategically, it is proven for Allergan to concentrate its resources in specialist markets and seek partners for programs that would be commercialized predominantly with GPs. Furthermore, we wish to concentrate our R&D efforts on our targeted toxin for pain program.Turning now to the performance of the businesses, I'll commence with ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, which had an outstanding quarter with 21.2% growth in dollars and 16.5% in local currencies. All of our key products enjoyed strong growth. Now focusing on local currency growth, the numbers are as follows: RESTASIS increased by 39.6%, LUMIGAN including GANFORT by 18.1%; and ALPHAGAN including COMBIGAN by 8.7%. we enjoyed strong double-digit growth in local currencies, both in the United States and abroad, with outstanding growth in Asia due to the creation of our joint venture with Samil, our long-standing business partner in Korea and our direct sales operation in China.For the eighth consecutive year, Allergan was the fastest growing global company as reported by AMS Global for the 12-month period ended September 2009. In Europe, we continue to gain share in both  glaucoma and artificial tears. In Latin America, Allergan has outgrown Alcon for the fifth consecutive year. End market in the U.S., RESTASIS grew 20.6% versus Q4 of 2008 in acquisition dollars; and LUMIGAN, 7.6% on the same basis. LUMIGAN was further boosted by double-digit growth of LUMIGAN outside the United States and major growth for GANFORT, as it is introduced and ramps up around the world. ALPHAGAN franchise growth of 8.7% in local currencies was commendable, as this was the first full quarter for an ALPHAGAN P 0.15% was subject generic intrusion in the United States. This growth was driven by COMBIGAN and ALPHAGAN P 0.1%. Outside the U. S., brimonidine generics are available in many markets, where there too, our strategy is to emphasize the convenience of the fixed dose combination of COMBIGAN. COMBIGAN in fact enjoyed major growth in the quarter in international markets. In the U.S., our ALPHAGAN P 0.1% product receives great interest by ophthalmologists. Coupled with COMBIGAN, Allergan has been able to retain between 73% and 75% branded share of brimonidine-containing products over the last eight weeks. Regarding generics of ACULAR or ketorolac, full emphasis is being placed on the product advantages of our latest generation product, ACUVAIL. Due to the good initial uptake of ACUVAIL, Allergan is currently holding about the mid-50 percentage share for our branded products over the last six weeks. RESTASIS continues on the strong growth trajectory, as dry eye is increasingly understood as a progressive disease by ophthalmologists and optometrists. An increasing number of practitioners incorporate RESTASIS into their practices, and patients are educated about dry eye disease and therapy by our advertisements.Regarding AZURDEX, we are still in the early stages of the launch of the product, as retinal vein occlusion is the smallest of all the indications where we're conducting clinical development and we're proving in practice that payers will reimburse for AZURDEX. A limited proportion of the U.S. ophthalmic growth was due to a slight increase in trade inventories from the end of the third quarter to the end of the year, although these remained at the very low end of our targeted range of less than eight weeks cover. In the U.S., SDI Vector One National, the data provider, shows Allergan growing in Q4 at 8.6% in acquisition dollars versus Q4 of 2008; and for the full year, at 12.3%; and the prescription pharmaceutical market growing by 9.3%, thus gaining more market share than any other company.Turning to BOTOX performance, sales increased in the fourth quarter by 5.6% and only 0.7% in local currencies, as the overall market for neuromodulators recovers, but we are impacted by the launch of Dysport in the U.S. But of course, there was no sales base in the prior year. Outside the U.S., sales growth for BOTOX Cosmetic or VISTABEL was very strong in all operating regions: Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Canada. Therapeutic was particularly strong in Europe and Asia-Pacific. For the full year, BOTOX sales declined 0.1% in dollars and grew 2.5% in local currencies. Given the effect of consumer spending on BOTOX Cosmetic, we estimate that BOTOX for aesthetic use was 48% of the mix, declining 4% year-over-year in dollars; and the therapeutic uses accounted for 52% of the mix, growing 4% in dollars. In the third quarter, the last quarter for which data was available, we estimate that the worldwide neuromodulator market grew 7% in U.S. dollars and the BOTOX enjoys approximately 83% market share.In the U.S., it seems that Dysport aesthetic share in recent months has leveled off at the low double-digit market share even with heavy sampling, with about a quarter of Dysport patients being first time neuromodulator users. Based on our sales and market surveys, it would also seem that the U.S. Aesthetic market enjoyed an uptick in growth in Q4. In retrospect, the various consumer promotions for BOTOX sometimes coupled with JUVÉDERM were successful encouraging patients to increase the frequency of their treatments. They also led to a significant growth in our database of patients with whom we can communicate directly with new media tools. Use of Dysport for therapeutic uses in the U.S. has had minimal impact so far early in the launch, given reimbursement challenges. In Europe, we have marginally increased our market share in therapeutics and in aesthetics, have lost some minor share to Galderma's Azzalure and to Xeomin as they enter more geographical markets.Skincare sales of $64.5 million almost doubled versus Q4 of 2008, driven by the launch of LATISSE and strong growth versus its lunch quarter a year ago for Exon. Sales of TAZORAC were flat. Regarding LATISSE, the bulk of the business is direct to physician, so analysis of prescription trends and wholesale withdrawals only tells part of the story. The number of physicians prescribing or dispensing is increasing steadily. Aided and unaided brand awareness are climbing upwards and consumer perceptions of efficacy and safety are on a positive track. Urology. Urology sales in the fourth quarter of $17 million were absolutely flat with Q4 of 2008. We're expecting to see a pickup in prescriptions and sales following our partnership with Quintiles, whereby Quintiles since November has been detailing SANCTURA XR to general practitioners. After Thanksgiving, we also merged our urology and medical dermatology sales teams, these are the Allergan teams, into one larger combined force with the reduction in the geographical area of sales territories, which of course dramatically increased by about 70%, the coverage of the urology specialty whilst we maintain medical dermatology coverage.Further to our goals of building up a portfolio of urology products, we are pleased with the clinical program for apaziquone in partnership with Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, completed enrollment of the Phase III trials before the end of the year. Regarding facial aesthetics, we enjoyed a nice rebound in sales in Q4, which grew 18.3% in dollars and a strong 10.6% in local currencies, with modest growth in the U.S. supplemented by particularly strong growth in Latin America, Asia-Pacific and also Europe. We assume that the market also stimulated by our advertising and consumer promotions must have further improved in the fourth, as we estimated that the world market in Q3 year-over-year still shrank by about 4%.From Q4 of 2008 to Q2 of 2009, the market each quarter have been declining at double-digit rates year-over-year. Beyond market recovery, it is also clear that the Allergan line led by JUVÉDERM is gaining market share in all of the operating regions of the world. In the third quarter, we estimate that Allergan's global dermal filler share will roughly equal to that of Q-Med and Medicis combined. In the U.S., we expect that the launch of JUVÉDERM XC with its pain control benefits will enhance market growth, as well as garner incremental market share. In January, in Europe, we launched JUVÉDERM Smile, a new lip product containing lidocaine. JUVÉDERM was recently introduced in the Philippines and JUVÉDERM Ultra in Korea.Moving on to breast aesthetics. The year-over-year sales declines in earlier quarters in the year have now given weight to a good growth quarter. In Q4, sales grew 9.7% in dollars and still a commendable 5.4% in local currencies. The U.S. return to growth and certain European markets posted more than double-digit growth rates, of course, somewhat flattered by the very fewer sales of Q4 Of 2008. Brazil and parts of Asia-Pacific also recorded very strong sales growth. In the U.S., sales of silicone gel increased their share of the mix. U.S. market share has been somewhat flat, as we have consciously moved to a modest premium pricing position. In Korea, we moved to a direct sales presence, uniting breast aesthetics with our facial aesthetics line. For the obesity intervention product area, we also saw improved performance in Q4 relative to earlier quarters in the year. Sales, however, still decreased 1.3% versus Q4 of 2008 and 5.3% in local currencies. Most of the improved performance is attributable to the U.S. where the rate of decline reduced significantly in the fourth quarter, also aided by comparable market share for the LAP-BAND in Q4 2009 and Q4 of 2008. Market share for LAP-BAND seems to be settling in at just under 75%. For the first time in the U.S., the share of all bariatric procedures accounted for by bands surpassed the 50% mark, overtaking bypass and sleeve gastrectomy.Overseas markets, such as the U.K., Australia and Canada, which had recorded strong growth early in the year, suffered sales declines year-over-year in Q4. Our ORBERA Gastric Balloon grew strongly on a small basis of sales in Europe, parts of Latin America and Australia. I'll now pass it over to Jeff Edwards who will take you through the financial and operating performance in greater detail."
249205,84111101,48923,"Allergan Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-04-2010",2010-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Allergan, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. Thanks for joining us.

Thanks for joining us. As was the case in the third quarter of 2009, Allergan continued to generate strong earnings performance despite an ongoing stagnant economic environment and the challenge of new competition during the fourth quarter of 2009. Being able to overachieve our sales and earnings per share expectations for the quarter is a true reflection of the depth and breadth of Allergan's business and our strong competitive position within each of our specialty areas.  This performance is also reflective of our forward-looking focus in an effort to prepare in advance to the competition and moving towards economic recovery. Allergan's diversified base of business and thoughtfully directed approach to reinvest back into the business to further stimulate market growth enabled the company to deliver non-GAAP diluted EPS results above the top end of our range expectations. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.78, marking a 2.6% increase over 2008 results for the same quarter. As a reminder, for the fourth quarter, EPS for 2008 was positively impacted by approximately $0.04 due to the retroactive benefit caused by the renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit in 2008. Adjusting to account for this $0.04 benefit, fourth quarter 2009 EPS would have grown 8.3% year-over-year. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release. For the full year of 2009, Allergan demonstrated its ability to leverage its expense base by delivering non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.78 despite the various challenges faced throughout 2009, including continuing economy-driven challenges and volatility within the currency markets versus prior year, generic intrusion within the anti-inflammatory and glaucoma segments of our Eye Care business and new competition in the neuromodulator market. This strong result was above the high end of our initial range of expectations provided in February 2009 of $2.69 to $2.75. Our commitment to the long-term future of the company and to our shareholders is evident in this result, as we are able to both invest strongly into the growth drivers of the business and pass stronger earnings performance onto our shareholders in the form of greater EPS performance.Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q4 2009 gross margin of 84.7% increased 230 basis points when compared to the prior year. So Allergan saw improvement in both its pharmaceutical and medical device margins. On a sequential basis, Q4 2009 gross margin increased 130 basis points over prior quarter. These improvements in gross margin were a product of our keen focus on year-long broad-based implementation and manufacturing facility efficiencies and the successful transfer of our breast implant manufacturing process from Ireland to Costa Rica. The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the fourth quarter was flat at 41.7% compared with the third quarter of 2009. On a dollar basis, fourth quarter non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $503 million. Similar to the third quarter of 2009, Allergan continued to implement targeted investments during the fourth quarter to further stimulate and support our future growth, as we continue to observe emerging recovery and improvement within certain of our markets.Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 15.4% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $185.2 million, an increase of approximately $19 million over the third quarter of 2009, as we continue to fund new projects and sequentially ramp up R&D investments moving into 2010. Consistent with the expectations provided within our earnings release, this trend will continue throughout 2010. Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan fourth quarter operating income ratio increased by 100 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2009. Allergan's disciplined and selective approach centered on maximizing investment return and our commitment to cost moderation has enabled the company to generate this improvement to the operating income performance. With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 44 days while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 106 days. This represents an improvement of three days for days sales outstanding and 22 days for inventory days on hand when compared to the prior year.  I'm pleased to note that Allergan's DSO and DOH metrics represent top quartile performance versus our industry peers. Prior to the start of 2009, Allergan established objectives around working capital and capital targets that were pushed across to each of our operating units and included within each of their performance objectives for the year. With almost no exception, each of the responsible management teams exceeded our expectations and executed with impeccable quality.At the end of fourth quarter, Allergan's cash and cash net of debt position has totaled approximately $1.9 billion and $439 million, respectively. Allergan continued to maintain exceptional cash flow generation capabilities in 2009, with operating cash flow after capital expenditures of approximately $276 million for the fourth quarter and over $1 billion for the full year. This represents record annual cash flow performance for the company and truly exceptional performance by our team. These strong balances, cash balances and broader access to liquidity provide Allergan with the ability to remain active with respect to our ongoing pursuit of strategic acquisitions and licensing. As we look forward into 2010, Allergan's plan is to continue to carefully monitor our markets and manage business expenses as necessary through appropriate leverage with a goal of delivering our bottom line EPS expectations. As I've mentioned in the past, we continue to be very thoughtful on our valuation of our expense base to ensure we are leveraging the appropriate areas and operating the business with the most efficient and appropriate cost structure necessary to remain competitive in today's markets. We've also tried to be mindful with respect to the current state of the broader economic environment. Although we believe that the environment has clearly stabilized, and in many cases, shown signs of positive trends, we understand that some caution is prudent. For the first quarter of 2010, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,060,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.59. As Allergan invests to support the approvals and launches of a number of new products in 2010, spending levels are expected to be higher in the first half of the year as measured in dollars and percent of sales while the second half of the year should produce some moderation of these investment levels.Consistent with investments made in prior years, Allergan is very focused on leveraging and spending against our core traditional products and focusing the benefits of leverage on our newer high-growth short- and long-term opportunities. We project the full year non-GAAP SG&A ratio to product net sales be between 39% and 40%. Regarding full year expectations for 2010, Allergan expects non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $3.09 and $3.15, which represents growth of between 11% and 13%. This expectation assumes no passage of significant U.S. healthcare reform legislation, including excise taxes or new rebates. We will continue to monitor the outcome of the legislative process, and we will provide an update to our expectations at a later date. If any legislation is passed and when its impact, it's fully understood. Additionally, the expectations assume that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter this year with full year retroactive benefits impacting Q4 results. This will generate a higher effective tax rate in the first three quarters of 2010, and thus, lower EPS results while benefiting both the Q4 effective tax rate and reported Q4 EPS. For the full year, we expect a tax rate on non-GAAP earnings of between 28% and 29%.Regarding full year 2010 total sales expectations, Allergan expects total product net sales in the range of between $4,550,000,000 and $4,750,000,000. For your information, specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release. With respect to R&D investment in 2010, Allergan will continue to make substantial commitments spending across both our medical device and pharmaceutical technology portfolios. We project a non-GAAP R&D ratio to product net sales to be between 15% and 16% for 2010. For your information, we included expectations for other lines of the income statement within our earnings release. With respect to 2010 capital expenditures, we project CapEx of between $170 million and $190 million for the year.Regarding cash flow, as we demonstrated during 2009 Allergan is fortunate to have the ability to generate that level of cash, which allows us to maintain strong and healthy balance sheets. For 2010, we expect to generate operating cash flow after capital expenditures of approximately $800 million. We have assumed very moderate levels of share repurchase activity of approximately 4 million shares in 2010 with a repurchase objectives limited to only match expected employee stock option-based compensation programs.Our solid results during the fourth quarter and full year 2009 is another testament to the value of the depth and breadth of our diversified lines of businesses, as well as Allergan's ability to effectively manage its business through a difficult markets. We hope to continue to build on our past successes and look forward to new opportunities emerging for Allergan in 2010. With that, operator, I'd like to open the call for questions."

Roughly half of the increase was due to the DTC increase year-over-year. Of course in all my remarks today, you always have to bear in mind we're comparing against Q4 of 2008. Of course, we were busy quite frankly, ratcheting [ph] (34:38) down the expenditures. We watched the world kind of disappear down the tubes and now we're on the other end where we've increased a lot. And hence my remark over the full year, we ended up spending more from 47% or 47% more than we had in 2008, full year. Otherwise, we basically turned on broader marketing programs that we thought were high return. And one other amount of course is also bonus and commissions. Because of course, in Q4 of 2008 we were currently reducing our accruals. And this year it was the opposite, this thing has continue to ramp up, of course, then naturally Mr. Barlow was the Corporate Controller has to make sure that we are accruing properly for sale force commissions and bonuses. Another factor too is the lapping effect of Asia given that we've done an awful lot in Asia and Asia is just exploding, given all the initiatives we've taken, particularly in Korea and China but also some of the smaller countries."

And I think really a great question somebody asked me a while back was, well given JUVÉDERM's success in the market versus Restylane, why shouldn't the same happened with Dysport and BOTOX. And the big difference is, when you inject a filler you can actually see what you're doing whereas of course with BOTOX or DYSPORT, you inject into the area and then you see absolutely nothing for several days and of course in practice unless you're doing a trial, the patients don't come back for quite a while. The only thing you can get is the callback if they're unhappy with the result and I think that leads to a real issue of people saying is it worth really integrating a product that is new to me and to my practice. And so I think what we've seen is a lot of physicians naturally being curious and trying out the product than they should. But after a while deciding that they've tried it and let's go back to the tried and tested what works and they know the patients are very happy with the product and of course, BOTOX is also a household name in terms of brand recognition."

Because obviously, if the sales are growing up, we're holding the expense flat. So we know what that means. In terms of spend, obviously we spent a lot of LATISSE. This was my consumer goods launch where you spend very, very heavily at the beginning to get the product blasted off. So that ones difficult to -- where is the chicken, and where's the egg. Wouldn't have been less if we'd spent half or wouldn't have been double if we'd spent double, I don't know but we're on a very sharp ramp. I think also we've seen good results for JUVÉDERM. When you think about my remarks in dermal fillers, a really great turnaround from double digit declines in the market to now growth in the market. Our goal now as the leader is to build this market versus trying to be in a share grabbing mode. Clearly, I think the addition of Lidocaine both from us and indeed from our competition will further expand the market because it makes the procedure not only less painful but also quicker. And so everybody wins. Very importantly in R&D, I stated my disappointment but of course that's easy to -- in hindsight when one knows everything perfectly. I wish we had spend more money on R&D in 2009 so you'll see quite a dramatic uptick in 2010 and for the long-term. We as a company are very committed on continuing to build our pipeline bring through products and unfortunately of course is not just pure brilliance, you need money as well. So there's one that you'll see trending higher over the next couple of years."

First quarter sales growth demonstrates the continuing trend of recovery in our cash pay businesses, which had commenced around the spring of 2009. First quarter results were negatively impacted, alb",2438,"Great. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First quarter sales growth demonstrates the continuing trend of recovery in our cash pay businesses, which had commenced around the spring of 2009. First quarter results were negatively impacted, albeit modestly in ophthalmic pharmaceuticals by the authorized generic of ALPHAGAN P 0.15%, and genericization of Acular, both in the United States. 
First quarter sales increased year-over-year 11.2% in dollars and 6.9% in local currencies, boosted by the strong pickup in the sales of medical devices, which grew 18.4% in dollars and 13.4% in local currencies. The growth in the Medical Aesthetics businesses was even stronger outside the U.S. in all regions and across a wide range of countries, with surprisingly strong performance in Europe.
Operating performance was strong, with non-GAAP earnings per share at $0.65, marking an increase of 18.2% versus the result for Q1 of 2009, and comfortably exceeding the Q1 expectations shared with you, the investment community, of $0.57 to $0.59. 
Earnings growth was driven by strong gross margin expansion, especially in the Medical Device segment. Careful spending in the selling, general administrative area, whilst we increased investment in R&D by 11.1% on a non-GAAP.
Within SG&A, we however doubled our DTC expenditures versus Q1 of 2009, which of course was the low watermark for spending when the world economy was in crisis. Our plan is to continue to invest in 2010 across our brands and into the recovery of our markets.
During the quarter, we were pleased that we continued to strengthen our R&D pipeline, supplementing our internally development programs with acquisitions and licenses. In January, we acquired Serica, a company with proprietary technology for use in tissue regeneration especially applicable to breast reconstruction, as well as the license for Ser-120 in Phase III clinical development for nocturia. Strategically, we have made good progress in building up a portfolio of urology assets.
We also furthered our aspirations to be the leader in medical aesthetics also in Asia, by reacquiring the rights to BOTOX Cosmetic in Japan and China and expanded our footprint in fast-growing emerging markets by establishing direct operations for all of our businesses in Turkey, effective from the second quarter.
After the out-licensing transaction with Bristol-Myers for neuropathic pain, we've increased our degree of R&D focus on our core specialty areas.
Now I’d like to comment on our expectations for 2010. For the full year earnings outlook, we have brought up the bottom of the EPS range by $0.02 to $3.11 and have left the top end of the range at $3.15 which at the time of the last earnings call expressly excluded the costs of any healthcare reform bill in the United States. With the increase of the Medicaid rebate, extension to managed Medicaid and expansion of eligible hospitals in the so-called 340B program, we estimate that the cost of healthcare reform in 2010 will be approximately $12 million. This is now included in our outlook.
Looking out further into 2011, we forecast that the expanse of healthcare reform will be limited, costing Allergan in the range of $50 million to $70 million, pretax. Impact on Allergan is proportionately less than that commented by several large pharmaceutical companies reporting before us due to the following factors: First of all, Allergan's mix of medical devices and pharmaceutical businesses, our relatively lower exposure, our low exposure to Medicaid as well as the relatively lower costs of our pharmaceutical therapies. 
Now turning to the performance of the businesses, I'll commence with ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, which had a solid growth quarter growing 8.1% in dollars and 3.9% in local currencies, given the headwinds of generics in the U.S., which I commented earlier.
Outside the U.S., the business grew double digit even in local currencies, with exceptionally strong performance in Asia and Latin America. Our focused brands grew strongly, expressed in local currencies, RESTASIS increased 20.5%, LUMIGAN including GANFORT by 12.8% with solid performance from LUMIGAN and massive growth from GANFORT. The ALPHAGAN family declined 12.1% in local currencies affected by the launch of an authorized generic of ALPHAGAN P 0.15% in the U.S. as well as brimonidine generics in parts of Europe, Latin America and Asia. Within the ALPHAGAN family, Combigan grew strongly in double digits even in local currencies.
For the full year 2009, Allergan per IMS Global was the fastest-growing global company for the eighth consecutive year. Looking ahead, we’ll lose this title in 2010, but are determined to regain the position as we roll out new OZURDEX indications, LUMIGAN line extensions and bring our next-generation pipeline products to market. 
Our strategy in the U.S. to defend our brimonidine franchise with ALPHAGAN P 0.1% and Combigan has been rather successful. Four months after the launch of an authorized generic of ALPHAGAN P 0.15%, our originator brands are still holding on to more than 70% of the trailing prescriptions of all brimonidine-containing products. 
In the U.S., RESTASIS continues a strong track record of growth, as its prescriber base has grown, access is improved through better coveraged managed care plans and patients are educated by our DTC advertisements. We continue to work on getting RESTASIS approved in Europe, Canada and Australia. 
Regarding OZURDEX, we are pleased that we’re now beyond the initial challenges of reimbursement. CMS has just added OZURDEX to the so-called Not Otherwise Classified list to establish average selling prices, so-called ASP, plus 6% for all the Medicare carriers. The permanent J Code should be established by January 2011.
In Europe, we continue to gain share in glaucoma and artificial tears. The European glaucoma market is undergoing many changes. Cosopt has been genericized in several key markets. Alcon is investing heavily in the launch of Azarga. The LUMIGAN 0.01%, that’s our product, is now on the market in the U.K., Germany, Netherlands and parts of Scandinavia, with most of the other key European markets to follow during the course of 2010. We are very pleased with the performance as is the case with GANFORT.
GANFORT was also approved in Austria and South Africa. OPTIVE was approved in Korea and New Zealand. In Latin America, we're gaining further market share in tears and are holding share in glaucoma, even as ALPHAGAN is impacted by generics.
Turning to BOTOX, sales growth has picked up relative to trends seen across 2009, with growth versus the first quarter of 2009 at 11.3% in dollars and at 6.6% in local currencies. Sales of $331 million were only modestly lower sequentially than Q4, which is always seasonally the highest quarter of the year. Most of this increase was due to the more economically sensitive aesthetic side of the business, as the benefits of the upper-limb spasticity FDA approval in March occurred too late in the quarter to contribute to our sales results. 
Outside the U.S., we enjoyed very strong double-digit increases across a wide range of countries, with surprisingly strong growth in several of the main European markets. These global markets are precisely where we are successfully dealing with multiple competitors. 
It would therefore seem that the market is recovering as we can measure our market share with only a short time lag. In Europe, on the aesthetic side, we’re holding share at just under 80%, as we deal with the incursions of both Merck’s, with their Zymine and Bocatua [ph] brands and Galderma with Azzalure. 
On the therapeutic side, it seems that most of ZMM’s market share gains have been at the expense of Dysport. In the U.S., BOTOX sales growth is less buoyant, as there was no base of Dysport sales in the prior year, but it is clear that the market is growing again.
We estimate that in the aesthetic market, Dysport had somewhere between 13% and 14% share in the first quarter. We'll be curious to see the lasting impact of the Dysport Love It or Leave It promotion after it terminates at the end of May.
In the therapeutic market, Dysport’s share is so far negligible, given the long history and experience of BOTOX use. In Europe and the U.S., we have recently introduced a 200-unit vial, which is useful for injectors treating large muscle groups, as well as for differentiation from competition. Regarding global market share for the fourth quarter, the last quarter for which data is available, we estimate that BOTOX held 79% share in a market growing 13% year-over-year.
Regarding the clinical program for BOTOX for chronic migraine, the clinical trial results of our PREEMPT program were published in Cephalalgia, the journal of the International Headache Society. Regarding facial aesthetics, we've experienced an even stronger rebound in sales than observed with BOTOX. Dermal filler sales grew year-over-year, a very strong 42.4% in dollars, and 34.5% in local currencies, with great growth in all operating regions of the world, with Europe again surprising on the upside.
In the U.S., we've seen huge growth in the JUVÉDERM line since the launch of JUVÉDERM Ultra XC, this is the lidocaine-containing product, in early February. Although we have gained some market share, it would seem that the market is responding strongly to the reduction in treatment pain experienced with this lidocaine-containing product and already a substantial share of the mix is attributable to JUVÉDERM Ultra XC. 
We have just initiated print advertising for JUVÉDERM XC and have a PR campaign with TV host Dayna Devon, as our spokesperson to further drive growth. In Europe, we launched new additions to the JUVÉDERM product line, JUVÉDERM Smile at the IMCAS Conference in Paris in January and JUVÉDERM Hydrate at the Anti-Aging Conference in Monaco in March. JUVÉDERM Smile was also approved in South Africa, JUVÉDERM XC in Korea and JUVÉDERM Ultra Plus in Taiwan.
Voluma was recently launched in Brazil and also approved in Taiwan.
Based on our analysis of the world market in Q4, which we estimate grew 12%, it is clear that global market growth has accelerated since then. Our analysis also points to JUVÉDERM market share gains in all regions of the world. Beyond superior product performance characteristics, Allergan also benefits from having full product line.
For breast aesthetics, Q1 registered a further improvement in business conditions, with sales growing year-over-year 17.7% in dollars and for the first time since the recession began, at 14.0% in local currencies, with all operating regions growing double digit even in local currencies. In the U.S., we estimate that overall market share was stable, with Allergan gaining some share in gel and losing some share in the lower cost saline segment.
Outside the U.S., we estimate that we've gained some share due to the strength of our local operations that enjoyed the scale of a full line versus some of our smaller competitors.
In France and Brazil, sales of PIP have been suspended by the French and Brazilian Ministries of Health. Our Natrelle line was approved in the Ukraine. 
Moving on to skin care where almost all of our sales are in the U.S., sales increased year-over-year by 32.1% in dollars. Axon sales expanded massively given the small prior year base, which occurred shortly after launch. Sales growth of TAZORAC and Azalex were modest whilst LATISSE sales soared by 52.6%, Q1 sales of $18.8 million were sequentially $7 million lower than in Q4.
Some part of the decline is perhaps due to seasonality as Q4 is the highest quarter of the year for BOTOX dermal fillers. At the margin, trade inventory was also in retrospect a little higher than our normally targeted level. But perhaps most importantly, experienced LATISSE users are learning how to stretch out a bottle of product, which is good for the economics of the use but of course means that we have to recruit more users to attain the same value sales.
Reflecting back on the experience with the early years of BOTOX Cosmetic, we have probably brought on board the earlier doctors, but now need to expand into the mainstream. Clearly there's lots of potential, as doctors and consumers are pleased with the performance of the product. And we estimate today that only 20% to 25% of BOTOX Cosmetic users are buyers of LATISSE. Our investment in DCC will continue throughout the year.
In order to stimulate demand for LATISSE from existing users of Allergan products, we are currently running a LATISSE anniversary offer with coupon which gives $50 off for BOTOX treatment and $50 off a treatment of JUVÉDERM for a total of $100 rebate with the purchase of LATISSE.
Regarding the obesity intervention product area, sales remained rather flat, with an increased year-over-year of 2.3% in dollars and a decline of 2.2% to local currencies. A small decline in the U.S. was offset by reasonable growth x U.S. with varying performance around the world. 
In the U.S., we believe that the cash pay portion of our business, which is extremely sensitive to the economy and unemployment, has now bottomed out. And that we're beginning to see growth in the reimburse segment of the market. This LAP-BAND cash pay business was disproportionately impacted, relative to the facial and breast aesthetics businesses as the out-of-pocket expenditure at over $14,000 is the highest.
Furthermore, regarding our performance in the U.S., it seems that our market share losses to the REALIZE Band from Ethicon have been stemmed with only a loss of approximately two market share points comparing Q1 2010 to Q1 of 2009.
For March, we estimate the LAP-BAND has regained to a 75% market share. LAP-BAND sales returned to good growth in Canada and the U.K. Our ORBERA Intragastric Balloon sales grew strongly on a small base in Europe, parts of Latin America and Australia. Given the central role of treating obesity in the health care debate both here in the U.S. and around the world, we remain convinced about the long-term potential of this category.
Finally commenting on urology. Sales of SANCTURA and SANCTURA XR declined 22.6% in the quarter year-over-year. However, based on acquisition dollars reported by SDI-Verispan, sales for the first quarter only declined 3.2%. The difference between ex-factory sales is mainly explained by an accrual for a Patient Rebate Program, which started at the end of March, as well as a very minor change in channel inventory from one year to the other. With the merger of our medical dermatology and urology sales teams into a larger combined force, as well as the addition of a Quintiles sales force in the primary care and OB/GYN channels, both at the end of last year, we’re confident that we’ll see a build in sales across the remainder of 2010.
I would now like to pass over to Jeff Edwards who will comment our financial performance."

We",997,"Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. The first quarter of 2010 represented a strong start to the year for Allergan as we have experienced strong performance across each of our geographic regions, particularly on an x U.S. basis. We’ve also continued to see signs of improvement in the economy and as a result have seen improving performance across our cash pay aesthetic businesses. Allergan was again able to over-achieve our sales and earnings per share expectations due to our broad base of business and strong competitive positions within our specialty areas. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was a very strong $0.65 per share. Coming in above the top end of our range of expectations and marketing an 18.2% increase of 2009 results for the same quarter. It is worth noting that these favorable results were generated in the face of the genericization of both ALPHAGAN P 0.15% and the Acular franchise. Moreover, Allergan was able to deliver this strong first quarter earnings performance even as we continued to reinvest into the future growth drivers of our business. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments in the amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q1 2010 gross margin of 84.6% increased 150 basis points when compared to the prior year, as Allergan saw modest improvements in its pharmaceutical margins and very strong improvement in its medical device margins. This increase in medical device margins was driven primarily by year-over-year standard cost improvements, favorable volume-based manufacturing variances, favorable inventory pricing -- breasts being the biggest contributor given our low-cost manufacturing base in Costa Rica -- and lower year-over-year inventory provisions. The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the first quarter was 42.3%, totaling $468 million, an increase of approximately $46 million over the same quarter of 2009, as we continued to see signs of recovery in our cash pay aesthetic businesses and implemented targeted investments to further stimulate and support our future growth.
Importantly, we continue to believe that the economic recovery will be somewhat slow and gradual. As such, our commitment to managing Allergan's cost structure wisely to limit waste and direct our capital to the highest-yielding investments will continue to be unwavering. Non-GAAP research and development expense were 16.3% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $180 million, an increase of approximately $18 million over the first quarter of 2009, as we continue to fund new projects and invest into a promising pharmaceutical and medical device pipeline. We anticipate that Allergan's quarterly research and development spend will increase on a sequential basis over the course of 2010.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's first quarter operating income ratio increased by 170 basis points when compared to the first quarter of 2009. Allergan's disciplined approach focused on maximizing investment return, improving cost structure and controlling general expenses has enabled the company to produce its improved operating income margin. With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan day sales outstanding was 46 days while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 118 days. 
At the end of the first quarter, Allergan's cash and cash net of debt positions totaled approximately $2 billion and $471 million, respectively. Allergan continued to maintain exceptional cash flow generation capabilities in the first quarter, with operating cash flow after capital expenditures of approximately $161 million, an increase of approximately $56 million over the first quarter of 2009.
These strong cash balances and broader access to liquidity provide Allergan with the ability to remain proactive with respect to our ongoing pursuit of strategic acquisitions and licensing opportunities, as was apparent with the various business development activities announced during the first quarter.
As we move forward through 2010, Allergan's plan is to continue to carefully monitor each of our markets and manage business expenses and investment opportunities in appropriate manner and with the goal of producing high-quality financial and operational results. As I've mentioned in the past, we continue to be very thoughtful in our evaluation of our expense base to ensure we are leveraging in the appropriate areas and are operating the business with the most efficient and appropriate cost structure necessary to remain competitive in today's markets. Although we believe that the markets have clearly stabilized and, in many cases, have shown signs of positive trends, we understand that some continued caution is prudent.
For the second quarter of 2010, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1.190 billion to $1.230 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.79 to $0.81. Regarding full year expectations for 2010, to repeat what David Pyott previously said, Allergan now expects non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $3.11 and $3.15, which represents growth of between 12% and 13%. This expectation now includes the estimated impact of U.S. healthcare reform legislation which was specifically not included in our previous expectations provided during our fourth quarter 2009 earnings call. For 2010, we estimate the impact to our business from healthcare reform to be limited to approximately $12 million. As a consequence of our current strong performance and confidence in our 2010 expectations we’ll be absorbing the healthcare reform impact and raising the lower end of our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share expectations by $0.02 to $3.11 while maintaining the top end of our expectations at $3.15.
We are also adjusting our full year projections for the effective tax rate on non-GAAP earnings to approximately 28%. All other expectations provided on the February 4, 2010 call remain unchanged. The first quarter represented a strong beginning to 2010 for Allergan. We hope to continue to build on this momentum as we continue through the year and look forward to new opportunities emerging for Allergan this year. So with that, operator, I'd love to open the call for questions."

Now of course, sales build in Japan and China great potential, great opportunity, but will be relatively slow. So I think you should see more results from this in 2011 than 2010.

And therefore, it's all about market growth. And I think there's two factors to that. One is what I’d call the recovery aspect and we’re looking carefully in all our markets to see when do we get back to the – or when can we project we will get back to the high water mark pre recession. We look at that carefully. And secondly as market leader, our job is intrinsically to expand the market through our marketing efforts and through product innovation. So that covers BOTOX. On the filler side, I remarked that there the market seems to be really picking up both in the U.S. and around the world. And looking through regions, it's quite clear that we have a strong market share gain underway. If we look at breast aesthetics, I'd say my remarks, U.S. relatively stable, international’s more difficult to gauge. But there it seems that we’re marginally gaining share in most regions of the world. So I think that covers the, kind of, the big areas. And of course, LATISSE still to come in many markets x U.S."

We have a couple of additional studies that we've presented at a couple of meetings. One was OZURDEX Plus Lucentis in Patients with Age-Related Macular Degeneration. The goal of that initial study was to see if adding OZURDEX had some benefit in terms of visual acuity, decreased retinal thickness times the injection and we did see a biological effect and so the plan is to do some follow-on studies to that. The other indication, which is of interest to study is following the vitrectomy. As you know, many patients with retinal diseases need to have the vitreous removed. That changes how other drugs injected to the back of the eye act. But OZURDEX is a sustained relief. It looks like the same in a – that’s had a vitrectomy as one that’s not. And so we've been urged by a number of retina specialists to look at that in clinical trials. We did a small trial in diabetic macular edema with good effect, despite the patients having vitrectomy where other therapies don’t work. So as David said, we have uveitis, which is sitting at the FDA, with hopefully approval later this year. DME, diabetic macular edema, further out because it requires three-year study. We’re also doing a number of additional studies and publications. Finally, we're looking for our initial approval of OZURDEX in the macular edema with retinal vein occlusion in Europe later this year, which I think will also help sales."

That being said, if you look at most economic indicators, it's not obvious that there's going to be a rapid recovery, so I think we're being cautious because of what we see with respect to those indicators.

So there's fewer investments being made that are reaching investments, if you will, and more investments that we’re making that we believe will have a notable impact. So we're being cautious because of the indicators we see. However, we definitely see some improvement in these businesses, particularly on the cash pay front, particularly those that are more affordable.

So on the gross profit side, we provided guidance for the year and we haven't altered that guidance. We think that our cost structure is really well positioned. 2009 in spite of being a very difficult year operationally, for all of us, resulted in some really interesting sustainable improvements, particularly on the standard fronts. The standard cost was one of those areas where our operational organization focused on putting sustainable long-term improvements in place. And we’re the beneficiary of that this year. Of course you've got Costa Rica, which we’ve talked about for a long time on the breast front. But we're seeing higher volumes there as well. So not only have we moved to a lower cost location, of manufacturing, but we’re also seeing the benefit of much higher volumes. So of course we’re throwing off favorable variances and as long as we’re seeing very high volumes, we're going to see wonderful variances that are favorable in nature. So we’re positive with respect to the margin, but the guidance is the guidance at this point in time."

Was there a conscious postponement, thinking there obviously this is a higher ticket item than facial aesthetics, whether it be JUVÉDERM or BOTOX? Frankly, we don't know yet, and we're just watching to see and unfortunately it’s like lots of economics, we'll know better when we look back than when we're trying to forecast the future. I think as I said for fillers, I have the sense that with these lidocaine-containing products and I think we really have an excellent product with JUVÉDERM Ultra XC, I think there's a lot of new consumers either coming into the market for the first time or people who for whatever reason tried one, didn't like it and now are saying I'm going to come back and use this new product because it really is dramatic in difference, in terms of pain and really more comfort, and less bruising. And then, of course, on the LATISSE front, it's very clear there's new users coming into the market. Not only off the product, i.e., those that use BOTOX because they’re in their -- let's call it late 30s, 40s, 50s -- but clearly there's a younger age group coming into this category as well.

In my prepared remarks, basically, this year we said we estimate around about $12 million, which is due to basically Medicaid rebates going from the 15% to the, what is it, the 23%. We are relatively unaffected by the expansion of the eligible hospitals and the 340B and managed Medicaid. So we've been looking at other companies’ numbers and it's very clear even on a proportionate basis our impact’s rather low. I also then talked about 2011 where we gave you a kind of a bracket of everything costing somewhere between $50 million and $70 million. And clearly the biggest component of that is the drug industry fee. And one of the reasons this has the highest impact is because it's non tax-deductible. So you kind of get a double whammy. And we don't get any breaks, because whether the products are reimbursed or cash paid, unfortunately, we are paying our portion of the pot. So I think that gives you a good bracket there. And really the only other material change is whether the industry fee changes, and we've all read that kind of schedule of numbers. And then just as a quick reminder, the medical device fee doesn't kick in until 2013. So there's another tiny little shoe to drop later on. 
Now talking about Brazil, we have a very strong presence there because we have almost 40% market share in ophthalmology. That was our foundation stone. If you look at aesthetics, that's a market culturally that is very responsive to these products. And in fact, if we look at, say, the breast aesthetics business, in units it's the second largest market in the world after the United States. And about a year and a bit ago, we established a direct selling operation, which has really produced first-class results and I’d really like to compliment our Brazilian management team. And as a sort of further booster to all of this, given that there are import duties going into Brazil and there’s a entrenched Brazilian competitor who also exports to Europe and other places, that’s Silimed. With our Costa Rican manufacturing base, we're now really able to compete in a very effective manner. 
Next question I think you had was in terms of kind of what the gradient of recovery and, of course, I too look at that very carefully market by market, region by region. And in my remarks, I think, I said it two or three times, which usually means that it really caught my attention, the real surprise for me when I look around the world is Europe. When I kind of read the newspaper and because I've lived in many of those countries, think about all the malaise, in particularly Britain or Spain or Portugal and all those places, yet the markets are real strong. And admittedly coming off a very weak base of Q1, but of course I'm looking through Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 and so on. So it appears that although we look at indices, these are products that are quite high on people's desire to open up their purse and start using the products again or shortening the gap in the cycle between treatment A -- or one, two and three. So I'm only giving you a sense of this because it's real mix of different gradients and I'm looking at them very carefully, market by market, around the world. And I think really the next time for you to talk to us about this will be when we have the earnings call roughly three months from now, where we'll have much better trend lines."

So usual time clocks, we expect some action also from a couple of European countries during the remainder of 2010. 
And then you had a question about LATISSE. This was one where, unfortunately, we had to do an extra study in Europe. And so that one is in the 2011-plus category. So unfortunately, I’d love to tell you it's right round the corner but, well, in drug terms, it's right around the corner. But in any other terms, it's a little bit away. 
Then your last question was about direct operations. And I think I'll give you the example of Turkey, where clearly up till now we were paying a margin to our distributor, an excellent company, in fact, the largest Turkish pharmaceutical company. And naturally, it was a very old contract and these days, we're a lot smarter than that in terms of the way we write our distribution agreements. But there it’s basically pay the partner something for lost profits in future and basically recapture the much higher margin. So the punch line there is we increased dramatically our gross margin, have greater spending below that line, of course, because we have to pay for sales force and marketing and so on, which then leads to higher contribution margin. And also of course, we’re changing our revenue base from priced-to-distributor to price-to-wholesale. And so there's a pickup from that as well. And Turkey actually is one of the largest markets. If you want to be politically correct because it's kind of right on the edge of Europe, one part of it literally is in Europe, not yet in the European Union, but a very substantial market within the European, Africa, Middle East region."

Just tell me if the math we're looking at is correct, maybe it’s a $17 million hit to FX and SG&A. And if you're doubling your DTC this quarter, it took about 10% of your expenses last year of $185 would be $18. It really appears you only spent an incremental $10 million x marketing on SG&A, a lot more leverage than we’ve sort of seen in the tab financial leverage? Are you planning on spending a lot of that going out and building the infrastructure as you guys sort of move from Europe into East Asia?"

And so really, I think you were kind of backing into the question of if we spent $185 million last year, what could we be spending this year? And I'd say at a very high level, broadly comparable, because we've said over time, there’s an ability to leverage some DTC because I understand consumer marketing models very well given my prior life before I came to Allergan. I think then the second sort of thing you were pointing to was really a bit similar to Ronny Gal's question about when we take on direct marketing operations, clearly you're going to see at the margin an increase in sales and marketing expenditure, i.e., for you within the SG&A line. But of course it’s more than offset by an increase in gross margin, as we go from sales to distributor price level to the much higher capture of direct to market. So I'd say all those kinds of exercises that we're going through, you've got to be careful with the thought of instant payback, but it's really, really short, certainly within a calendar fiscal year."

So that's a disparate event. But then when you look through all those schedules of taxation, it was, if not a leap, there's a gradual ramp. I'm sure you're all -- whether it be Allergan or other companies you cover -- trying to do the same model and, of course, we've done it. Surprise, surprise. And we don't have the perfect crystal ball, but we can certainly analyze each segment of these fees and taxes. So then kind of getting into the question of what are we going to do about it? I've been very vocal inside the company, not only with the management, but even with the board to say I think a bad company just rolls over and says, okay, it costs “x” and therefore that just comes off the aspirations we have. We really want to work on how do we further tune up, tone up our sales and marketing process to become more efficient. How do we do that with an R&D and we've already done it in G&A, but basically everywhere and, of course, I refer to sales and marketing and R&D as the biggest cost blocks. 
So the final question in terms of long-term guidance. That one I can't answer, because we always give guidance at the beginning of the year. And of course in expectation of that question if you could tell me how many products I'm going to get approved when, that's just a joke. That would be very helpful as well so you understand the issue, right? And in terms of maybe one last remark, when I was listening to questions answered by Jeff, he very appropriately talked about the caution in terms of economic recovery, but we still have a couple of products that we should get approved this year. And once I've got them in the bag, I'll feel better than just being hopeful about them."

First of all on upper limb spasticity, many times I pointed out that this is the largest use of neurotoxin around the world. And a bit like what I said earlier regarding training, this is a product that is almost like a surgical procedure, although it's a drug. And so knowing about something is cool, but actually how to do it, how to administer it, how to get the optimal treatment, I don't want to call it an art form, but it's certainly an accumulated knowledge bank. And so having the ability to actually train doctors appropriately is a huge deal. I think the other thing that we knew for years from Europe and elsewhere around the world, is the fact that getting into the referral networks of physiotherapists and physiatrists is really, really important. And, of course, now we’ll be able to do that. Whereas, of course, that was totally prohibited by our selling and marketing and all of our ethical guidelines. In terms of the two OAB questions, neurogenic will be filed before the end of this year, 2010. And idiopathic, we're kind of coming towards the end of our Phase III enrollment, so everything's on track. And that’s still then in terms of approval, a little bit further out.

249205,100365211,58795,"Allergan Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-30-2010",2010-04-30,"Earnings Calls","Allergan, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First quarter sales growth demonstrates the continuing trend of recovery in our cash pay businesses, which had commenced around the spring of 2009. First quarter results were negatively impacted, alb",2438,"Great. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First quarter sales growth demonstrates the continuing trend of recovery in our cash pay businesses, which had commenced around the spring of 2009. First quarter results were negatively impacted, albeit modestly in ophthalmic pharmaceuticals by the authorized generic of ALPHAGAN P 0.15%, and genericization of Acular, both in the United States. 
First quarter sales increased year-over-year 11.2% in dollars and 6.9% in local currencies, boosted by the strong pickup in the sales of medical devices, which grew 18.4% in dollars and 13.4% in local currencies. The growth in the Medical Aesthetics businesses was even stronger outside the U.S. in all regions and across a wide range of countries, with surprisingly strong performance in Europe.
Operating performance was strong, with non-GAAP earnings per share at $0.65, marking an increase of 18.2% versus the result for Q1 of 2009, and comfortably exceeding the Q1 expectations shared with you, the investment community, of $0.57 to $0.59. 
Earnings growth was driven by strong gross margin expansion, especially in the Medical Device segment. Careful spending in the selling, general administrative area, whilst we increased investment in R&D by 11.1% on a non-GAAP.
Within SG&A, we however doubled our DTC expenditures versus Q1 of 2009, which of course was the low watermark for spending when the world economy was in crisis. Our plan is to continue to invest in 2010 across our brands and into the recovery of our markets.
During the quarter, we were pleased that we continued to strengthen our R&D pipeline, supplementing our internally development programs with acquisitions and licenses. In January, we acquired Serica, a company with proprietary technology for use in tissue regeneration especially applicable to breast reconstruction, as well as the license for Ser-120 in Phase III clinical development for nocturia. Strategically, we have made good progress in building up a portfolio of urology assets.
We also furthered our aspirations to be the leader in medical aesthetics also in Asia, by reacquiring the rights to BOTOX Cosmetic in Japan and China and expanded our footprint in fast-growing emerging markets by establishing direct operations for all of our businesses in Turkey, effective from the second quarter.
After the out-licensing transaction with Bristol-Myers for neuropathic pain, we've increased our degree of R&D focus on our core specialty areas.
Now I’d like to comment on our expectations for 2010. For the full year earnings outlook, we have brought up the bottom of the EPS range by $0.02 to $3.11 and have left the top end of the range at $3.15 which at the time of the last earnings call expressly excluded the costs of any healthcare reform bill in the United States. With the increase of the Medicaid rebate, extension to managed Medicaid and expansion of eligible hospitals in the so-called 340B program, we estimate that the cost of healthcare reform in 2010 will be approximately $12 million. This is now included in our outlook.
Looking out further into 2011, we forecast that the expanse of healthcare reform will be limited, costing Allergan in the range of $50 million to $70 million, pretax. Impact on Allergan is proportionately less than that commented by several large pharmaceutical companies reporting before us due to the following factors: First of all, Allergan's mix of medical devices and pharmaceutical businesses, our relatively lower exposure, our low exposure to Medicaid as well as the relatively lower costs of our pharmaceutical therapies. 
Now turning to the performance of the businesses, I'll commence with ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, which had a solid growth quarter growing 8.1% in dollars and 3.9% in local currencies, given the headwinds of generics in the U.S., which I commented earlier.
Outside the U.S., the business grew double digit even in local currencies, with exceptionally strong performance in Asia and Latin America. Our focused brands grew strongly, expressed in local currencies, RESTASIS increased 20.5%, LUMIGAN including GANFORT by 12.8% with solid performance from LUMIGAN and massive growth from GANFORT. The ALPHAGAN family declined 12.1% in local currencies affected by the launch of an authorized generic of ALPHAGAN P 0.15% in the U.S. as well as brimonidine generics in parts of Europe, Latin America and Asia. Within the ALPHAGAN family, Combigan grew strongly in double digits even in local currencies.
For the full year 2009, Allergan per IMS Global was the fastest-growing global company for the eighth consecutive year. Looking ahead, we’ll lose this title in 2010, but are determined to regain the position as we roll out new OZURDEX indications, LUMIGAN line extensions and bring our next-generation pipeline products to market. 
Our strategy in the U.S. to defend our brimonidine franchise with ALPHAGAN P 0.1% and Combigan has been rather successful. Four months after the launch of an authorized generic of ALPHAGAN P 0.15%, our originator brands are still holding on to more than 70% of the trailing prescriptions of all brimonidine-containing products. 
In the U.S., RESTASIS continues a strong track record of growth, as its prescriber base has grown, access is improved through better coveraged managed care plans and patients are educated by our DTC advertisements. We continue to work on getting RESTASIS approved in Europe, Canada and Australia. 
Regarding OZURDEX, we are pleased that we’re now beyond the initial challenges of reimbursement. CMS has just added OZURDEX to the so-called Not Otherwise Classified list to establish average selling prices, so-called ASP, plus 6% for all the Medicare carriers. The permanent J Code should be established by January 2011.
In Europe, we continue to gain share in glaucoma and artificial tears. The European glaucoma market is undergoing many changes. Cosopt has been genericized in several key markets. Alcon is investing heavily in the launch of Azarga. The LUMIGAN 0.01%, that’s our product, is now on the market in the U.K., Germany, Netherlands and parts of Scandinavia, with most of the other key European markets to follow during the course of 2010. We are very pleased with the performance as is the case with GANFORT.
GANFORT was also approved in Austria and South Africa. OPTIVE was approved in Korea and New Zealand. In Latin America, we're gaining further market share in tears and are holding share in glaucoma, even as ALPHAGAN is impacted by generics.
Turning to BOTOX, sales growth has picked up relative to trends seen across 2009, with growth versus the first quarter of 2009 at 11.3% in dollars and at 6.6% in local currencies. Sales of $331 million were only modestly lower sequentially than Q4, which is always seasonally the highest quarter of the year. Most of this increase was due to the more economically sensitive aesthetic side of the business, as the benefits of the upper-limb spasticity FDA approval in March occurred too late in the quarter to contribute to our sales results. 
Outside the U.S., we enjoyed very strong double-digit increases across a wide range of countries, with surprisingly strong growth in several of the main European markets. These global markets are precisely where we are successfully dealing with multiple competitors. 
It would therefore seem that the market is recovering as we can measure our market share with only a short time lag. In Europe, on the aesthetic side, we’re holding share at just under 80%, as we deal with the incursions of both Merck’s, with their Zymine and Bocatua [ph] brands and Galderma with Azzalure. 
On the therapeutic side, it seems that most of ZMM’s market share gains have been at the expense of Dysport. In the U.S., BOTOX sales growth is less buoyant, as there was no base of Dysport sales in the prior year, but it is clear that the market is growing again.
We estimate that in the aesthetic market, Dysport had somewhere between 13% and 14% share in the first quarter. We'll be curious to see the lasting impact of the Dysport Love It or Leave It promotion after it terminates at the end of May.
In the therapeutic market, Dysport’s share is so far negligible, given the long history and experience of BOTOX use. In Europe and the U.S., we have recently introduced a 200-unit vial, which is useful for injectors treating large muscle groups, as well as for differentiation from competition. Regarding global market share for the fourth quarter, the last quarter for which data is available, we estimate that BOTOX held 79% share in a market growing 13% year-over-year.
Regarding the clinical program for BOTOX for chronic migraine, the clinical trial results of our PREEMPT program were published in Cephalalgia, the journal of the International Headache Society. Regarding facial aesthetics, we've experienced an even stronger rebound in sales than observed with BOTOX. Dermal filler sales grew year-over-year, a very strong 42.4% in dollars, and 34.5% in local currencies, with great growth in all operating regions of the world, with Europe again surprising on the upside.
In the U.S., we've seen huge growth in the JUVÉDERM line since the launch of JUVÉDERM Ultra XC, this is the lidocaine-containing product, in early February. Although we have gained some market share, it would seem that the market is responding strongly to the reduction in treatment pain experienced with this lidocaine-containing product and already a substantial share of the mix is attributable to JUVÉDERM Ultra XC. 
We have just initiated print advertising for JUVÉDERM XC and have a PR campaign with TV host Dayna Devon, as our spokesperson to further drive growth. In Europe, we launched new additions to the JUVÉDERM product line, JUVÉDERM Smile at the IMCAS Conference in Paris in January and JUVÉDERM Hydrate at the Anti-Aging Conference in Monaco in March. JUVÉDERM Smile was also approved in South Africa, JUVÉDERM XC in Korea and JUVÉDERM Ultra Plus in Taiwan.
Voluma was recently launched in Brazil and also approved in Taiwan.
Based on our analysis of the world market in Q4, which we estimate grew 12%, it is clear that global market growth has accelerated since then. Our analysis also points to JUVÉDERM market share gains in all regions of the world. Beyond superior product performance characteristics, Allergan also benefits from having full product line.
For breast aesthetics, Q1 registered a further improvement in business conditions, with sales growing year-over-year 17.7% in dollars and for the first time since the recession began, at 14.0% in local currencies, with all operating regions growing double digit even in local currencies. In the U.S., we estimate that overall market share was stable, with Allergan gaining some share in gel and losing some share in the lower cost saline segment.
Outside the U.S., we estimate that we've gained some share due to the strength of our local operations that enjoyed the scale of a full line versus some of our smaller competitors.
In France and Brazil, sales of PIP have been suspended by the French and Brazilian Ministries of Health. Our Natrelle line was approved in the Ukraine. 
Moving on to skin care where almost all of our sales are in the U.S., sales increased year-over-year by 32.1% in dollars. Axon sales expanded massively given the small prior year base, which occurred shortly after launch. Sales growth of TAZORAC and Azalex were modest whilst LATISSE sales soared by 52.6%, Q1 sales of $18.8 million were sequentially $7 million lower than in Q4.
Some part of the decline is perhaps due to seasonality as Q4 is the highest quarter of the year for BOTOX dermal fillers. At the margin, trade inventory was also in retrospect a little higher than our normally targeted level. But perhaps most importantly, experienced LATISSE users are learning how to stretch out a bottle of product, which is good for the economics of the use but of course means that we have to recruit more users to attain the same value sales.
Reflecting back on the experience with the early years of BOTOX Cosmetic, we have probably brought on board the earlier doctors, but now need to expand into the mainstream. Clearly there's lots of potential, as doctors and consumers are pleased with the performance of the product. And we estimate today that only 20% to 25% of BOTOX Cosmetic users are buyers of LATISSE. Our investment in DCC will continue throughout the year.
In order to stimulate demand for LATISSE from existing users of Allergan products, we are currently running a LATISSE anniversary offer with coupon which gives $50 off for BOTOX treatment and $50 off a treatment of JUVÉDERM for a total of $100 rebate with the purchase of LATISSE.
Regarding the obesity intervention product area, sales remained rather flat, with an increased year-over-year of 2.3% in dollars and a decline of 2.2% to local currencies. A small decline in the U.S. was offset by reasonable growth x U.S. with varying performance around the world. 
In the U.S., we believe that the cash pay portion of our business, which is extremely sensitive to the economy and unemployment, has now bottomed out. And that we're beginning to see growth in the reimburse segment of the market. This LAP-BAND cash pay business was disproportionately impacted, relative to the facial and breast aesthetics businesses as the out-of-pocket expenditure at over $14,000 is the highest.
Furthermore, regarding our performance in the U.S., it seems that our market share losses to the REALIZE Band from Ethicon have been stemmed with only a loss of approximately two market share points comparing Q1 2010 to Q1 of 2009.
For March, we estimate the LAP-BAND has regained to a 75% market share. LAP-BAND sales returned to good growth in Canada and the U.K. Our ORBERA Intragastric Balloon sales grew strongly on a small base in Europe, parts of Latin America and Australia. Given the central role of treating obesity in the health care debate both here in the U.S. and around the world, we remain convinced about the long-term potential of this category.
Finally commenting on urology. Sales of SANCTURA and SANCTURA XR declined 22.6% in the quarter year-over-year. However, based on acquisition dollars reported by SDI-Verispan, sales for the first quarter only declined 3.2%. The difference between ex-factory sales is mainly explained by an accrual for a Patient Rebate Program, which started at the end of March, as well as a very minor change in channel inventory from one year to the other. With the merger of our medical dermatology and urology sales teams into a larger combined force, as well as the addition of a Quintiles sales force in the primary care and OB/GYN channels, both at the end of last year, we’re confident that we’ll see a build in sales across the remainder of 2010.
I would now like to pass over to Jeff Edwards who will comment our financial performance.

The first quarter of 2010 represented a strong start to the year for Allergan as we have experienced strong performance across each of our geographic regions, particularly on an x U.S. basis. We",997,"Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. The first quarter of 2010 represented a strong start to the year for Allergan as we have experienced strong performance across each of our geographic regions, particularly on an x U.S. basis. We’ve also continued to see signs of improvement in the economy and as a result have seen improving performance across our cash pay aesthetic businesses. Allergan was again able to over-achieve our sales and earnings per share expectations due to our broad base of business and strong competitive positions within our specialty areas. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was a very strong $0.65 per share. Coming in above the top end of our range of expectations and marketing an 18.2% increase of 2009 results for the same quarter. It is worth noting that these favorable results were generated in the face of the genericization of both ALPHAGAN P 0.15% and the Acular franchise. Moreover, Allergan was able to deliver this strong first quarter earnings performance even as we continued to reinvest into the future growth drivers of our business. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments in the amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q1 2010 gross margin of 84.6% increased 150 basis points when compared to the prior year, as Allergan saw modest improvements in its pharmaceutical margins and very strong improvement in its medical device margins. This increase in medical device margins was driven primarily by year-over-year standard cost improvements, favorable volume-based manufacturing variances, favorable inventory pricing -- breasts being the biggest contributor given our low-cost manufacturing base in Costa Rica -- and lower year-over-year inventory provisions. The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the first quarter was 42.3%, totaling $468 million, an increase of approximately $46 million over the same quarter of 2009, as we continued to see signs of recovery in our cash pay aesthetic businesses and implemented targeted investments to further stimulate and support our future growth.
Importantly, we continue to believe that the economic recovery will be somewhat slow and gradual. As such, our commitment to managing Allergan's cost structure wisely to limit waste and direct our capital to the highest-yielding investments will continue to be unwavering. Non-GAAP research and development expense were 16.3% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $180 million, an increase of approximately $18 million over the first quarter of 2009, as we continue to fund new projects and invest into a promising pharmaceutical and medical device pipeline. We anticipate that Allergan's quarterly research and development spend will increase on a sequential basis over the course of 2010.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's first quarter operating income ratio increased by 170 basis points when compared to the first quarter of 2009. Allergan's disciplined approach focused on maximizing investment return, improving cost structure and controlling general expenses has enabled the company to produce its improved operating income margin. With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan day sales outstanding was 46 days while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 118 days. 
At the end of the first quarter, Allergan's cash and cash net of debt positions totaled approximately $2 billion and $471 million, respectively. Allergan continued to maintain exceptional cash flow generation capabilities in the first quarter, with operating cash flow after capital expenditures of approximately $161 million, an increase of approximately $56 million over the first quarter of 2009.
These strong cash balances and broader access to liquidity provide Allergan with the ability to remain proactive with respect to our ongoing pursuit of strategic acquisitions and licensing opportunities, as was apparent with the various business development activities announced during the first quarter.
As we move forward through 2010, Allergan's plan is to continue to carefully monitor each of our markets and manage business expenses and investment opportunities in appropriate manner and with the goal of producing high-quality financial and operational results. As I've mentioned in the past, we continue to be very thoughtful in our evaluation of our expense base to ensure we are leveraging in the appropriate areas and are operating the business with the most efficient and appropriate cost structure necessary to remain competitive in today's markets. Although we believe that the markets have clearly stabilized and, in many cases, have shown signs of positive trends, we understand that some continued caution is prudent.
For the second quarter of 2010, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1.190 billion to $1.230 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.79 to $0.81. Regarding full year expectations for 2010, to repeat what David Pyott previously said, Allergan now expects non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $3.11 and $3.15, which represents growth of between 12% and 13%. This expectation now includes the estimated impact of U.S. healthcare reform legislation which was specifically not included in our previous expectations provided during our fourth quarter 2009 earnings call. For 2010, we estimate the impact to our business from healthcare reform to be limited to approximately $12 million. As a consequence of our current strong performance and confidence in our 2010 expectations we’ll be absorbing the healthcare reform impact and raising the lower end of our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share expectations by $0.02 to $3.11 while maintaining the top end of our expectations at $3.15.
We are also adjusting our full year projections for the effective tax rate on non-GAAP earnings to approximately 28%. All other expectations provided on the February 4, 2010 call remain unchanged. The first quarter represented a strong beginning to 2010 for Allergan. We hope to continue to build on this momentum as we continue through the year and look forward to new opportunities emerging for Allergan this year. So with that, operator, I'd love to open the call for questions.

And I think secondly, as we’ve learned more and more about the construction of this medical aesthetics market, there are tremendous benefits of having a full line of products, i.e., not only BOTOX Cosmetic and JUVÉDERM and breast aesthetics or now in the case of the U.S., LATISSE as well, and so bringing all this together makes eminent sense. Now of course, sales build in Japan and China great potential, great opportunity, but will be relatively slow. So I think you should see more results from this in 2011 than 2010.

And so, we have to accept on a worldwide basis and especially in the U.S. that we have to lose some share, as much as I'd love to keep 90%, that's not going to happen. And therefore, it's all about market growth. And I think there's two factors to that. One is what I’d call the recovery aspect and we’re looking carefully in all our markets to see when do we get back to the - or when can we project we will get back to the high water mark pre recession. We look at that carefully. And secondly as market leader, our job is intrinsically to expand the market through our marketing efforts and through product innovation. So that covers BOTOX. On the filler side, I remarked that there the market seems to be really picking up both in the U.S. and around the world. And looking through regions, it's quite clear that we have a strong market share gain underway. If we look at breast aesthetics, I'd say my remarks, U.S. relatively stable, international’s more difficult to gauge. But there it seems that we’re marginally gaining share in most regions of the world. So I think that covers the, kind of, the big areas. And of course, LATISSE still to come in many markets x U.S.

We have a couple of additional studies that we've presented at a couple of meetings. One was OZURDEX Plus Lucentis in Patients with Age-Related Macular Degeneration. The goal of that initial study was to see if adding OZURDEX had some benefit in terms of visual acuity, decreased retinal thickness times the injection and we did see a biological effect and so the plan is to do some follow-on studies to that. The other indication, which is of interest to study is following the vitrectomy. As you know, many patients with retinal diseases need to have the vitreous removed. That changes how other drugs injected to the back of the eye act. But OZURDEX is a sustained relief. It looks like the same in a - that’s had a vitrectomy as one that’s not. And so we've been urged by a number of retina specialists to look at that in clinical trials. We did a small trial in diabetic macular edema with good effect, despite the patients having vitrectomy where other therapies don’t work. So as David said, we have uveitis, which is sitting at the FDA, with hopefully approval later this year. DME, diabetic macular edema, further out because it requires three-year study. We’re also doing a number of additional studies and publications. Finally, we're looking for our initial approval of OZURDEX in the macular edema with retinal vein occlusion in Europe later this year, which I think will also help sales.

So there's fewer investments being made that are reaching investments, if you will, and more investments that we’re making that we believe will have a notable impact. So we're being cautious because of the indicators we see. However, we definitely see some improvement in these businesses, particularly on the cash pay front, particularly those that are more affordable.

So on the gross profit side, we provided guidance for the year and we haven't altered that guidance. We think that our cost structure is really well positioned. 2009 in spite of being a very difficult year operationally, for all of us, resulted in some really interesting sustainable improvements, particularly on the standard fronts. The standard cost was one of those areas where our operational organization focused on putting sustainable long-term improvements in place. And we’re the beneficiary of that this year. Of course you've got Costa Rica, which we’ve talked about for a long time on the breast front. But we're seeing higher volumes there as well. So not only have we moved to a lower cost location, of manufacturing, but we’re also seeing the benefit of much higher volumes. So of course we’re throwing off favorable variances and as long as we’re seeing very high volumes, we're going to see wonderful variances that are favorable in nature. So we’re positive with respect to the margin, but the guidance is the guidance at this point in time.

Was there a conscious postponement, thinking there obviously this is a higher ticket item than facial aesthetics, whether it be JUVÉDERM or BOTOX? Frankly, we don't know yet, and we're just watching to see and unfortunately it’s like lots of economics, we'll know better when we look back than when we're trying to forecast the future. I think as I said for fillers, I have the sense that with these lidocaine-containing products and I think we really have an excellent product with JUVÉDERM Ultra XC, I think there's a lot of new consumers either coming into the market for the first time or people who for whatever reason tried one, didn't like it and now are saying I'm going to come back and use this new product because it really is dramatic in difference, in terms of pain and really more comfort, and less bruising. And then, of course, on the LATISSE front, it's very clear there's new users coming into the market. Not only off the product, i.e., those that use BOTOX because they’re in their -- let's call it late 30s, 40s, 50s -- but clearly there's a younger age group coming into this category as well.

In my prepared remarks, basically, this year we said we estimate around about $12 million, which is due to basically Medicaid rebates going from the 15% to the, what is it, the 23%.

So we've been looking at other companies’ numbers and it's very clear even on a proportionate basis our impact’s rather low. I also then talked about 2011 where we gave you a kind of a bracket of everything costing somewhere between $50 million and $70 million. And clearly the biggest component of that is the drug industry fee. And one of the reasons this has the highest impact is because it's non tax-deductible. So you kind of get a double whammy. And we don't get any breaks, because whether the products are reimbursed or cash paid, unfortunately, we are paying our portion of the pot. So I think that gives you a good bracket there. And really the only other material change is whether the industry fee changes, and we've all read that kind of schedule of numbers. And then just as a quick reminder, the medical device fee doesn't kick in until 2013. So there's another tiny little shoe to drop later on. 
Now talking about Brazil, we have a very strong presence there because we have almost 40% market share in ophthalmology. That was our foundation stone. If you look at aesthetics, that's a market culturally that is very responsive to these products. And in fact, if we look at, say, the breast aesthetics business, in units it's the second largest market in the world after the United States. And about a year and a bit ago, we established a direct selling operation, which has really produced first-class results and I’d really like to compliment our Brazilian management team. And as a sort of further booster to all of this, given that there are import duties going into Brazil and there’s a entrenched Brazilian competitor who also exports to Europe and other places, that’s Silimed. With our Costa Rican manufacturing base, we're now really able to compete in a very effective manner. 
Next question I think you had was in terms of kind of what the gradient of recovery and, of course, I too look at that very carefully market by market, region by region. And in my remarks, I think, I said it two or three times, which usually means that it really caught my attention, the real surprise for me when I look around the world is Europe. When I kind of read the newspaper and because I've lived in many of those countries, think about all the malaise, in particularly Britain or Spain or Portugal and all those places, yet the markets are real strong. And admittedly coming off a very weak base of Q1, but of course I'm looking through Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 and so on. So it appears that although we look at indices, these are products that are quite high on people's desire to open up their purse and start using the products again or shortening the gap in the cycle between treatment A -- or one, two and three. So I'm only giving you a sense of this because it's real mix of different gradients and I'm looking at them very carefully, market by market, around the world. And I think really the next time for you to talk to us about this will be when we have the earnings call roughly three months from now, where we'll have much better trend lines.

And given that that fits what I'd liked as our R&D model, which is where possible local delivered therapy, and since it’s in the BOTOX realm, where the leaders in R&D, we made the call to move ahead with that program. So that's basically finishing its Phase I testing. Although we designed our Stage I studies to have some proof of concept, those data probably will be available I would guess end of the year publicly. And we're already in the process of designing our Phase II programs for the targeted toxin.

So usual time clocks, we expect some action also from a couple of European countries during the remainder of 2010. 
And then you had a question about LATISSE. This was one where, unfortunately, we had to do an extra study in Europe. And so that one is in the 2011-plus category. So unfortunately, I’d love to tell you it's right round the corner but, well, in drug terms, it's right around the corner. But in any other terms, it's a little bit away. 
Then your last question was about direct operations. And I think I'll give you the example of Turkey, where clearly up till now we were paying a margin to our distributor, an excellent company, in fact, the largest Turkish pharmaceutical company. And naturally, it was a very old contract and these days, we're a lot smarter than that in terms of the way we write our distribution agreements. But there it’s basically pay the partner something for lost profits in future and basically recapture the much higher margin. So the punch line there is we increased dramatically our gross margin, have greater spending below that line, of course, because we have to pay for sales force and marketing and so on, which then leads to higher contribution margin. And also of course, we’re changing our revenue base from priced-to-distributor to price-to-wholesale. And so there's a pickup from that as well. And Turkey actually is one of the largest markets. If you want to be politically correct because it's kind of right on the edge of Europe, one part of it literally is in Europe, not yet in the European Union, but a very substantial market within the European, Africa, Middle East region.

And so really, I think you were kind of backing into the question of if we spent $185 million last year, what could we be spending this year? And I'd say at a very high level, broadly comparable, because we've said over time, there’s an ability to leverage some DTC because I understand consumer marketing models very well given my prior life before I came to Allergan. I think then the second sort of thing you were pointing to was really a bit similar to Ronny Gal's question about when we take on direct marketing operations, clearly you're going to see at the margin an increase in sales and marketing expenditure, i.e., for you within the SG&A line. But of course it’s more than offset by an increase in gross margin, as we go from sales to distributor price level to the much higher capture of direct to market. So I'd say all those kinds of exercises that we're going through, you've got to be careful with the thought of instant payback, but it's really, really short, certainly within a calendar fiscal year.

So that's a disparate event. But then when you look through all those schedules of taxation, it was, if not a leap, there's a gradual ramp. I'm sure you're all -- whether it be Allergan or other companies you cover -- trying to do the same model and, of course, we've done it. Surprise, surprise. And we don't have the perfect crystal ball, but we can certainly analyze each segment of these fees and taxes. So then kind of getting into the question of what are we going to do about it? I've been very vocal inside the company, not only with the management, but even with the board to say I think a bad company just rolls over and says, okay, it costs “x” and therefore that just comes off the aspirations we have. We really want to work on how do we further tune up, tone up our sales and marketing process to become more efficient. How do we do that with an R&D and we've already done it in G&A, but basically everywhere and, of course, I refer to sales and marketing and R&D as the biggest cost blocks. 
So the final question in terms of long-term guidance. That one I can't answer, because we always give guidance at the beginning of the year. And of course in expectation of that question if you could tell me how many products I'm going to get approved when, that's just a joke. That would be very helpful as well so you understand the issue, right? And in terms of maybe one last remark, when I was listening to questions answered by Jeff, he very appropriately talked about the caution in terms of economic recovery, but we still have a couple of products that we should get approved this year. And once I've got them in the bag, I'll feel better than just being hopeful about them.

First of all on upper limb spasticity, many times I pointed out that this is the largest use of neurotoxin around the world. And a bit like what I said earlier regarding training, this is a product that is almost like a surgical procedure, although it's a drug. And so knowing about something is cool, but actually how to do it, how to administer it, how to get the optimal treatment, I don't want to call it an art form, but it's certainly an accumulated knowledge bank. And so having the ability to actually train doctors appropriately is a huge deal. I think the other thing that we knew for years from Europe and elsewhere around the world, is the fact that getting into the referral networks of physiotherapists and physiatrists is really, really important. And, of course, now we’ll be able to do that. Whereas, of course, that was totally prohibited by our selling and marketing and all of our ethical guidelines. In terms of the two OAB questions, neurogenic will be filed before the end of this year, 2010. And idiopathic, we're kind of coming towards the end of our Phase III enrollment, so everything's on track. And that’s still then in terms of approval, a little bit further out.

First quarter sales growth demonstrates the continuing trend of recovery in our cash pay businesses, which had commenced around the spring of 2009. First quarter results were negatively impacted, alb",2439,"Great. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First quarter sales growth demonstrates the continuing trend of recovery in our cash pay businesses, which had commenced around the spring of 2009. First quarter results were negatively impacted, albeit modestly in ophthalmic pharmaceuticals by the authorized generic of ALPHAGAN P 0.15%, and genericization of Acular, both in the United States. 
First quarter sales increased year-over-year 11.2% in dollars and 6.9% in local currencies, boosted by the strong pickup in the sales of medical devices, which grew 18.4% in dollars and 13.4% in local currencies. The growth in the Medical Aesthetics businesses was even stronger outside the U.S. in all regions and across a wide range of countries, with surprisingly strong performance in Europe.
Operating performance was strong, with non-GAAP earnings per share at $0.65, marking an increase of 18.2% versus the result for Q1 of 2009, and comfortably exceeding the Q1 expectations shared with you, the investment community, of $0.57 to $0.59. 
Earnings growth was driven by strong gross margin expansion, especially in the Medical Device segment. Careful spending in the selling, general administrative area, whilst we increased investment in R&D by 11.1% on a non-GAAP.
Within SG&A, we however doubled our DTC expenditures versus Q1 of 2009, which of course was the low watermark for spending when the world economy was in crisis. Our plan is to continue to invest in 2010 across our brands and into the recovery of our markets.
During the quarter, we were pleased that we continued to strengthen our R&D pipeline, supplementing our internally development programs with acquisitions and licenses. In January, we acquired Serica, a company with proprietary technology for use in tissue regeneration especially applicable to breast reconstruction, as well as the license for Ser-120 in Phase III clinical development for nocturia. Strategically, we have made good progress in building up a portfolio of urology assets.
We also furthered our aspirations to be the leader in medical aesthetics also in Asia, by reacquiring the rights to BOTOX Cosmetic in Japan and China and expanded our footprint in fast-growing emerging markets by establishing direct operations for all of our businesses in Turkey, effective from the second quarter.
After the out-licensing transaction with Bristol-Myers for neuropathic pain, we have increased our degree of R&D focus on our core specialty areas.
Now I’d like to comment on our expectations for 2010. For the full year earnings outlook, we have brought up the bottom of the EPS range by $0.02 to $3.11 and have left the top end of the range at $3.15, which at the time of the last earnings call expressly excluded the costs of any healthcare reform bill in the United States. With the increase of the Medicaid rebate, extension to managed Medicaid and expansion of eligible hospitals in the so-called 340B program, we estimate that the cost of healthcare reform in 2010 will be approximately $12 million. This is now included in our outlook.
Looking out further into 2011, we forecast that the expense of healthcare reform will be limited, costing Allergan in the range of $50 million to $70 million, pretax. Impact on Allergan is proportionately less than that commented by several large pharmaceutical companies reporting before us due to the following factors: First of all, Allergan's mix of medical devices and pharmaceutical businesses, our relatively low exposure, our low exposure to Medicaid as well as the relatively lower costs of our pharmaceutical therapies. 
Now turning to the performance of the businesses, I'll commence with ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, which had a solid growth quarter growing 8.1% in dollars and 3.9% in local currencies, given the headwinds of generics in the U.S., which I commented earlier.
Outside the U.S., the business grew double digit even in local currencies, with exceptionally strong performance in Asia and Latin America. Our focused brands grew strongly, expressed in local currencies: RESTASIS increased 20.5%, LUMIGAN including GANFORT by 12.8% with solid performance from LUMIGAN and massive growth from GANFORT. The ALPHAGAN family declined 12.1% in local currencies, affected by the launch of an authorized generic of ALPHAGAN P 0.15% in the U.S. as well as brimonidine generics in parts of Europe, Latin America and Asia. Within the ALPHAGAN family, Combigan grew strongly in double digits even in local currencies.
For the full year 2009, Allergan, per IMS Global, was the fastest-growing global company for the eighth consecutive year. Looking ahead, we’ll lose this title in 2010 but are determined to regain the position as we roll out new OZURDEX indications, LUMIGAN line extensions and bring our next-generation pipeline products to market. 
Our strategy in the U.S. to defend our brimonidine franchise with ALPHAGAN P 0.1% and Combigan has been rather successful. Four months after the launch of an authorized generic of ALPHAGAN P 0.15%, our originator brands are still holding on to more than 70% of the trailing prescriptions of all brimonidine-containing products. 
In the U.S., RESTASIS continues a strong track record of growth, as its prescriber base has grown, access is improved through better coveraged at managed care plans and patients are educated by our DTC advertisements. We continue to work on getting RESTASIS approved in Europe, Canada and Australia. 
Regarding OZURDEX, we are pleased that we’re now beyond the initial challenges of reimbursement. CMS has just added OZURDEX to the so-called Not Otherwise Classified list to establish average selling prices, so-called ASP, plus 6% for all the Medicare carriers. The permanent J Code should be established by January 2011.
In Europe, we continue to gain share in glaucoma and artificial tears. The European glaucoma market is undergoing many changes. Cosopt has been genericized in several key markets. Alcon is investing heavily in the launch of Azarga. The LUMIGAN 0.01%, that’s our product, is now on the market in the U.K., Germany, Netherlands and parts of Scandinavia, with most of the other key European markets to follow during the course of 2010. We're very pleased with the performance, as is the case with GANFORT.
GANFORT was also approved in Austria and South Africa. OPTIVE was approved in Korea and New Zealand. In Latin America, we're gaining further market share in tears and are holding share in glaucoma, even as ALPHAGAN is impacted by generics.
Turning to BOTOX. Sales growth has picked up relative to trends seen across 2009, with growth versus the first quarter of 2009 at 11.3% in dollars and at 6.6% in local currencies. Sales of $331 million were only modestly lower sequentially than Q4, which is always seasonally the highest quarter of the year. Most of this increase was due to the more economically sensitive aesthetic side of the business, as the benefits of the upper-limb spasticity FDA approval in March occurred too late in the quarter to contribute to our sales results. 
Outside the U.S., we enjoyed very strong double-digit increases across a wide range of countries, with surprisingly strong growth in several of the main European markets. These global markets are precisely where we are successfully dealing with multiple competitors. 
It would therefore seem that the market is recovering as we can measure our market share with only a short time lag. In Europe, on the aesthetic side, we’re holding share at just under 80%, as we deal with the incursions of both Merz, with their Xeomin and Bocature [ph] brands and Galderma with Azzalure. 
On the therapeutic side, it seems that most of Xeomin’s market share gains have been at the expense of Dysport. In the U.S., BOTOX sales growth is less buoyant, as there was no base of Dysport sales in the prior year, but it is clear that the market is growing again.
We estimate that in the aesthetic market, Dysport had somewhere between 13% and 14% share in the first quarter. We'll be curious to see the lasting impact of the Dysport Love It or Leave It promotion after it terminates at the end of May.
In the therapeutic market, Dysport’s share is so far negligible, given the long history and experience of BOTOX use. In Europe and the U.S., we have recently introduced a 200-unit vial, which is useful for injectors treating large muscle groups, as well as for differentiation from competition. Regarding global market share for the fourth quarter, the last quarter for which data is available, we estimate that BOTOX held 79% share in a market growing 13% year-over-year.
Regarding the clinical program for BOTOX for chronic migraine, the clinical trial results of our PREEMPT program were published in Cephalalgia, the journal of the International Headache Society. Regarding facial aesthetics, we've experienced an even stronger rebound in sales than observed with BOTOX. Dermal filler sales grew year-over-year, a very strong 42.4% in dollars, and 34.5% in local currencies, with great growth in all operating regions of the world, with Europe again surprising on the upside.
In the U.S., we've seen huge growth in the JUVÉDERM line since the launch of JUVÉDERM Ultra XC, this is the lidocaine-containing product, in early February. Although we have gained some market share, it would seem that the market is responding strongly to the reduction in treatment pain experienced with this lidocaine-containing product and already a substantial share of the mix is attributable to JUVÉDERM Ultra XC. 
We have just initiated print advertising for JUVÉDERM XC and have a PR campaign with TV host Dayna Devon, as our spokesperson to further drive growth. In Europe, we launched new additions to the JUVÉDERM product line, JUVÉDERM Smile at the IMCAS Conference in Paris in January and JUVÉDERM Hydrate at the Anti-Aging Conference in Monaco in March. JUVÉDERM Smile was also approved in South Africa, JUVÉDERM XC in Korea and JUVÉDERM Ultra Plus in Taiwan.
Voluma was recently launched in Brazil and also approved in Taiwan.
Based on our analysis of the world market in Q4, which we estimate grew 12%, it is clear that global market growth has accelerated since then. Our analysis also points to JUVÉDERM market share gains in all regions of the world. Beyond superior product performance characteristics, Allergan also benefits from having full product line.
For breast aesthetics, Q1 registered a further improvement in business conditions, with sales growing year-over-year 17.7% in dollars and for the first time since the recession began, at 14.0% in local currencies, with all operating regions growing double digit even in local currencies. In the U.S., we estimate that overall market share was stable, with Allergan gaining some share in gel and losing some share in the lower cost saline segment.
Outside the U.S., we estimate that we've gained some share due to the strength of our local operations that enjoyed the scale of a full line versus some of our smaller competitors.
In France and Brazil, sales of PIP have been suspended by the French and Brazilian Ministries of Health. Our Natrelle line was approved in the Ukraine. 
Moving on to skin care where almost all of our sales are in the U.S., sales increased year-over-year by 32.1% in dollars. Axon sales expanded massively given the small prior year base, which occurred shortly after launch. Sales growth of TAZORAC and Azalex were modest whilst LATISSE sales soared by 52.6%, Q1 sales of $18.8 million were sequentially $7 million lower than in Q4.
Some part of the decline is perhaps due to seasonality as Q4 is the highest quarter of the year for BOTOX dermal fillers. At the margin, trade inventory was also in retrospect a little higher than our normally targeted level. But perhaps most importantly, experienced LATISSE users are learning how to stretch out a bottle of product, which is good for the economics of the use but of course means that we have to recruit more users to attain the same value sales.
Reflecting back on the experience with the early years of BOTOX Cosmetic, we have probably brought on board the earlier doctors, but now need to expand into the mainstream. Clearly there's lots of potential, as doctors and consumers are pleased with the performance of the product. And we estimate today that only 20% to 25% of BOTOX Cosmetic users are buyers of LATISSE. Our investment in DTC will continue throughout the year.
In order to stimulate demand for LATISSE from existing users of Allergan products, we are currently running a LATISSE anniversary offer with coupon which gives $50 off for BOTOX treatment and $50 off a treatment of JUVÉDERM for a total of $100 rebate with the purchase of LATISSE.
Regarding the obesity intervention product area, sales remained rather flat, with an increased year-over-year of 2.3% in dollars and a decline of 2.2% to local currencies. A small decline in the U.S. was offset by reasonable growth x U.S. with varying performance around the world. 
In the U.S., we believe that the cash pay portion of our business, which is extremely sensitive to the economy and unemployment, has now bottomed out. And that we're beginning to see growth in the reimburse segment of the market. This LAP-BAND cash pay business was disproportionately impacted, relative to the facial and breast aesthetics businesses as the out-of-pocket expenditure at over $14,000 is the highest.
Furthermore, regarding our performance in the U.S., it seems that our market share losses to the REALIZE Band from Ethicon have been stemmed with only a loss of approximately two market share points comparing Q1 2010 to Q1 of 2009.
For March, we estimate the LAP-BAND has regained to a 75% market share. LAP-BAND sales returned to good growth in Canada and the U.K. Our ORBERA Intragastric Balloon sales grew strongly on a small base in Europe, parts of Latin America and Australia. Given the central role of treating obesity in the health care debate both here in the U.S. and around the world, we remain convinced about the long-term potential of this category.
Finally commenting on urology. Sales of SANCTURA and SANCTURA XR declined 22.6% in the quarter year-over-year. However, based on acquisition dollars reported by SDI-Verispan, sales for the first quarter only declined 3.2%. The difference between ex-factory sales is mainly explained by an accrual for a Patient Rebate Program, which started at the end of March, as well as a very minor change in channel inventory from one year to the other. With the merger of our medical dermatology and urology sales teams into a larger combined force, as well as the addition of a Quintiles sales force in the primary care and OB/GYN channels, both at the end of last year, we’re confident that we’ll see a build in sales across the remainder of 2010.
I would now like to pass over to Jeff Edwards who will comment our financial performance."

The first quarter of 2010 represented a strong start to the year for Allergan as we have experienced strong performance across each of our geographic regions, particularly on an x U.S. basis. We",997,"Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. The first quarter of 2010 represented a strong start to the year for Allergan as we have experienced strong performance across each of our geographic regions, particularly on an x U.S. basis. We’ve also continued to see signs of improvement in the economy and as a result have seen improving performance across our cash pay aesthetic businesses. Allergan was again able to over-achieve our sales and earnings per share expectations due to our broad base of business and strong competitive positions within our specialty areas. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was a very strong $0.65 per share. Coming in above the top end of our range of expectations and marketing an 18.2% increase of 2009 results for the same quarter. It is worth noting that these favorable results were generated in the face of the genericization of both ALPHAGAN P 0.15% and the Acular franchise. Moreover, Allergan was able to deliver this strong first quarter earnings performance even as we continued to reinvest into the future growth drivers of our business. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments in the amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q1 2010 gross margin of 84.6% increased 150 basis points when compared to the prior year, as Allergan saw modest improvements in its pharmaceutical margins and very strong improvement in its medical device margins. This increase in medical device margins was driven primarily by year-over-year standard cost improvements, favorable volume-based manufacturing variances, favorable inventory pricing -- breasts being the biggest contributor given our low-cost manufacturing base in Costa Rica -- and lower year-over-year inventory provisions. The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the first quarter was 42.3%, totaling $468 million, an increase of approximately $46 million over the same quarter of 2009, as we continued to see signs of recovery in our cash pay aesthetic businesses and implemented targeted investments to further stimulate and support our future growth.
Importantly, we continue to believe that the economic recovery will be somewhat slow and gradual. As such, our commitment to managing Allergan's cost structure wisely to limit waste and direct our capital to the highest-yielding investments will continue to be unwavering. Non-GAAP research and development expense were 16.3% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $180 million, an increase of approximately $18 million over the first quarter of 2009, as we continue to fund new projects and invest into a promising pharmaceutical and medical device pipeline. We anticipate that Allergan's quarterly research and development spend will increase on a sequential basis over the course of 2010.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's first quarter operating income ratio increased by 170 basis points when compared to the first quarter of 2009. Allergan's disciplined approach focused on maximizing investment return, improving cost structure and controlling general expenses has enabled the company to produce its improved operating income margin. With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan day sales outstanding was 46 days while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 118 days. 
At the end of the first quarter, Allergan's cash and cash net of debt positions totaled approximately $2 billion and $471 million, respectively. Allergan continued to maintain exceptional cash flow generation capabilities in the first quarter, with operating cash flow after capital expenditures of approximately $161 million, an increase of approximately $56 million over the first quarter of 2009.
These strong cash balances and broader access to liquidity provide Allergan with the ability to remain proactive with respect to our ongoing pursuit of strategic acquisitions and licensing opportunities, as was apparent with the various business development activities announced during the first quarter.
As we move forward through 2010, Allergan's plan is to continue to carefully monitor each of our markets and manage business expenses and investment opportunities in appropriate manner and with the goal of producing high-quality financial and operational results. As I've mentioned in the past, we continue to be very thoughtful in our evaluation of our expense base to ensure we are leveraging in the appropriate areas and are operating the business with the most efficient and appropriate cost structure necessary to remain competitive in today's markets. Although we believe that the markets have clearly stabilized and, in many cases, have shown signs of positive trends, we understand that some continued caution is prudent.
For the second quarter of 2010, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1.190 billion to $1.230 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.79 to $0.81. Regarding full year expectations for 2010, to repeat what David Pyott previously said, Allergan now expects non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $3.11 and $3.15, which represents growth of between 12% and 13%. This expectation now includes the estimated impact of U.S. healthcare reform legislation which was specifically not included in our previous expectations provided during our fourth quarter 2009 earnings call. For 2010, we estimate the impact to our business from healthcare reform to be limited to approximately $12 million. As a consequence of our current strong performance and confidence in our 2010 expectations we’ll be absorbing the healthcare reform impact and raising the lower end of our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share expectations by $0.02 to $3.11 while maintaining the top end of our expectations at $3.15.
We are also adjusting our full year projections for the effective tax rate on non-GAAP earnings to approximately 28%. All other expectations provided on the February 4, 2010 call remain unchanged. The first quarter represented a strong beginning to 2010 for Allergan. We hope to continue to build on this momentum as we continue through the year and look forward to new opportunities emerging for Allergan this year. So with that, operator, I'd love to open the call for questions."

And I think secondly, as we’ve learned more and more about the construction of this medical aesthetics market, there are tremendous benefits of having a full line of products, i.e., not only BOTOX Cosmetic and JUVÉDERM and breast aesthetics or now in the case of the U.S., LATISSE as well, and so bringing all this together makes eminent sense. Now of course, sales build in Japan and China great potential, great opportunity, but will be relatively slow. So I think you should see more results from this in 2011 than 2010.

And so, we have to accept on a worldwide basis and especially in the U.S. that we have to lose some share, as much as I'd love to keep 90%, that's not going to happen. And therefore, it's all about market growth. And I think there's two factors to that. One is what I’d call the recovery aspect and we’re looking carefully in all our markets to see when do we get back to the -- or when can we project we will get back to the high high-water mark pre-recession. We look at that carefully. And secondly as market leader, our job is intrinsically to expand the market through our marketing efforts and through product innovation. So that covers BOTOX. On the filler side, I remarked that there the market seems to be really picking up both in the U.S. and around the world. And looking through regions, it's quite clear that we have a strong market share gain underway. If we look at breast aesthetics, I'd say my remarks, U.S. relatively stable, international’s more difficult to gauge. But there it seems that we are marginally gaining share in most regions of the world. So I think that covers the, kind of, the big areas. And of course, LATISSE still to come in many markets x U.S."

We have a couple of additional studies that we've presented at a couple of meetings. One was OZURDEX Plus Lucentis in patients with age-related macular degeneration. The goal of that initial study was to see if adding OZURDEX had some benefit in terms of visual acuity, decreased retinal thickness and time to injection and we did see a biological effect and so the plan is to do some follow-on studies to that. The other indication, which is of interest to study is following vitrectomy. As you know, many patients with retinal diseases need to have the vitreous removed. That changes how other drugs injected to the back of the eye act. But OZURDEX is a sustained release. It looks like the same in a eye that’s had a vitrectomy as one that’s not. And so we've been urged by a number of retina specialists to look at that in clinical trials. We did a small trial in diabetic macular edema with good effect, despite those patients having vitrectomy where other therapies don’t work. So as David said, we have uveitis, which is sitting at the FDA, with hopefully approval later this year. DME, diabetic macular edema, further out because it requires three-year studies. But we’re also doing a number of additional studies and publications. Finally, we're looking for our initial approval of OZURDEX in the macular edema with retinal vein occlusion in Europe later this year, which I think will also help sales."

So on the gross profit side, we provided guidance for the year and we haven't altered that guidance. We think that our cost structure is really well positioned. 2009 in spite of being a very difficult year operationally, for all of us, resulted in some really interesting sustainable improvements, particularly on the standard fronts. The standard cost was one of those areas where our operational organization focused on putting sustainable long-term improvements in place. And we’re the beneficiary of that this year. Of course you've got Costa Rica, which we’ve talked about for a long time on the breast front. But we're seeing higher volumes there as well. So not only have we moved to a lower cost location, of manufacturing, but we’re also seeing the benefit of much higher volumes. So of course we’re throwing off favorable variances and as long as we’re seeing very high volumes, we're going to see wonderful variances that are favorable in nature. So we’re positive with respect to the margin, but the guidance is the guidance at this point in time."

Frankly, we don't know yet, and we're just watching to see and unfortunately it’s like lots of economics, we'll know better when we look back than when we're trying to forecast the future. I think as I said for fillers, I have the sense that with these lidocaine-containing products and I think we really have an excellent product with JUVÉDERM Ultra XC, I think there's a lot of new consumers either coming into the market for the first time or people who for whatever reason tried one, didn't like it and now are saying I'm going to come back and use this new product because it really is dramatic in difference, in terms of pain and really more comfort, and less bruising. And then, of course, on the LATISSE front, it's very clear there's new users coming into the market. Not only off the product, i.e., those that use BOTOX because they’re in their -- let's call it late 30s, 40s, 50s -- but clearly there's a younger age group coming into this category as well.

You actually have to find out how to use it, how to mix it, how to administer it. It's quite complicated. And there is the real benefit that once we have an indicated approval then we can go and educate physicians in an appropriate manner. I think on the commercial side, as normal we plan for success, and so we've thought very carefully about deployment both in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. And clearly that will be an area where the more certain we become, the more we’re going to keep opening the purse to spend appropriately.

We too just like the big Pharma companies are looking at emerging markets. Now fortunately we've had a great presence in many of those markets historically. I’d particularly point to India and Brazil of the big ones, but you've seen us build really almost a zero direct presence in Korea to covering every single business ourselves. Today we announced Turkey, which will be all businesses, and we're actively working on other markets, which I'm sure we'll announce in the next 3 to 6 months, and things are really underway. And here again, we see the benefits of a really strong management team where we have to add people, clearly when we set up direct operations.

Is it meaningful? Have you seen it yet? Separately, on the recovery that you mentioned, that you said is gradual but steady, how is that differing from the U.S. to Europe and Asia in the aesthetics market? And is it average ticket or volumes or both? And then lastly, on healthcare reform, there's some changes that could kick in, in 2011. I know given the business mix and how it changes and it’s a year away that you may not be able to give exact guidance on that. But relative to this year, what sort of proportion should we be thinking about incrementally year-over-year '11 to '10, as you look at it right now?"

In my prepared remarks, basically, this year we said we estimate around about $12 million, which is due to basically Medicaid rebates going from the 15% to the, what is it, the 23%. We are relatively unaffected by the expansion of the eligible hospitals and the 340B and managed Medicaid. So we've been looking at other companies’ numbers and it's very clear even on a proportionate basis our impact’s rather low. I also then talked about 2011 where we gave you a kind of a bracket of everything costing somewhere between $50 million and $70 million. And clearly the biggest component of that is the drug industry fee. And one of the reasons this has the highest impact is because it's non tax-deductible. So you kind of get a double whammy. And we don't get any breaks, because whether the products are reimbursed or cash paid, unfortunately, we are paying our portion of the pot. So I think that gives you a good bracket there. And really the only other material change is whether the industry fee changes, and we've all read that kind of schedule of numbers. And then just as a quick reminder, the medical device fee doesn't kick in until 2013. So there's another tiny little shoe to drop later on. 
Now talking about Brazil, we have a very strong presence there because we have almost 40% market share in ophthalmology. That was our foundation stone. If you look at aesthetics, that's a market culturally that is very responsive to these products. And in fact, if we look at, say, the breast aesthetics business, in units it's the second largest market in the world after the United States. And about a year and a bit ago, we established a direct selling operation, which has really produced first-class results and I’d really like to compliment our Brazilian management team. And as a sort of further booster to all of this, given that there are import duties going into Brazil and there’s a entrenched Brazilian competitor who also exports to Europe and other places, that’s Silimed. With our Costa Rican manufacturing base, we're now really able to compete in a very effective manner. 
Next question I think you had was in terms of kind of what the gradient of recovery and, of course, I too look at that very carefully market-by-market, region-by-region. And in my remarks, I think, I said it two or three times, which usually means that it really caught my attention, the real surprise for me when I look around the world is Europe. When I kind of read the newspaper and because I've lived in many of those countries, think about all the malaise, in particularly Britain or Spain or Portugal and all those places, yet the markets are real strong. And admittedly coming off a very weak base of Q1, but of course I'm looking through Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 and so on. So it appears that although we look at indices, these are products that are quite high on people's desire to open up their purse and start using the products again or shortening the gap in the cycle between treatment A -- or one, two and three. So I'm only giving you a sense of this because it's real mix of different gradients and I'm looking at them very carefully, market by market, around the world. And I think really the next time for you to talk to us about this will be when we have the earnings call roughly three months from now, where we'll have much better trend lines."

And given that that fits what I'd liked as our R&D model, which is where possible local delivered therapy, and since it’s in the BOTOX realm, where the leaders in R&D, we made the call to move ahead with that program. So that's basically finishing its Phase I testing.

So usual time clocks, we expect some action also from a couple of European countries during the remainder of 2010. 
And then you had a question about LATISSE. This was one where, unfortunately, we had to do an extra study in Europe. And so that one is in the 2011-plus category. So unfortunately, I’d love to tell you it's right round the corner but, well, in drug terms, it's right around the corner. But in any other terms, it's a little bit away. 
Then your last question was about direct operations. And I think I'll give you the example of Turkey, where clearly up till now we were paying a margin to our distributor, an excellent company, in fact, the largest Turkish pharmaceutical company. And naturally, it was a very old contract and these days, we're a lot smarter than that in terms of the way we write our distribution agreements. But there it’s basically pay the partner something for lost profits in future and basically recapture the much higher margin. So the punch line there is we increased dramatically our gross margin, have greater spending below that line, of course, because we have to pay for sales force and marketing and so on, which then leads to higher contribution margin. And also of course, we’re changing our revenue base from price-to-distributor to price-to-wholesale. And so there's a pickup from that as well. And Turkey actually is one of the largest markets. If you want to be politically correct because it's kind of right on the edge of Europe, one part of it literally is in Europe, not yet in the European Union, but a very substantial market within the European, Africa, Middle East region."

So really, I think you were kind of backing into the question of if we spent $185 million last year, what could we be spending this year? And I'd say at a very high level, broadly comparable, because we've said over time, there’s an ability to leverage down DTC because I understand consumer marketing models very well given my prior life before I came to Allergan. I think then the second sort of thing you were pointing to was really a bit similar to Ronny Gal's question about when we take on direct marketing operations, clearly you're going to see at the margin an increase in sales and marketing expenditure, i.e., for you within the SG&A line. But of course, it’s more than offset by an increase in gross margin, as we go from sales to distributor price level to the much higher capture of direct to market. So I'd say all those kinds of exercises that we're going through, you've got to be careful with the thought of instant payback, but it's really, really short, certainly within a calendar fiscal year."

So that's a disparate event. But then when you look through all those schedules of taxation, it was, if not a leap, there's a gradual ramp. I'm sure you're all -- whether it be Allergan or other companies you cover -- trying to do the same model and, of course, we've done it. Surprise, surprise. And we don't have the perfect crystal ball, but we can certainly analyze each segment of these fees and taxes. So then kind of getting into the question of what are we going to do about it? I've been very vocal inside the company, not only with the management, but even with the board to say I think a bad company just rolls over and says, okay, it costs “x” and therefore that just comes off the aspirations we have. We really want to work on how do we further tune up, tone up our sales and marketing process to become more efficient. How do we do that with an R&D and we've already done it in G&A, but basically everywhere and, of course, I refer to sales and marketing and R&D as the biggest cost blocks. 
So the final question in terms of long-term guidance. That one I can't answer, because we always give guidance at the beginning of the year. And of course in expectation of that question if you could tell me how many products I'm going to get approved when, that's just a joke. That would be very helpful as well so you understand the issue, right? And in terms of maybe one last remark, when I was listening to questions answered by Jeff, he very appropriately talked about the caution in terms of economic recovery, but we still have a couple of products that we should get approved this year.

First of all, on upper limb spasticity, many times I pointed out that this is the largest use of neurotoxin around the world.

And so knowing about something is cool, but actually how to do it, how to administer it, how to get the optimal treatment, I don't want to call it an art form, but it's certainly an accumulated knowledge bank. And so having the ability to actually train doctors appropriately is a huge deal. I think the other thing that we knew for years from Europe and elsewhere around the world, is the fact that getting into the referral networks of physiotherapists and physiatrists is really, really important. And, of course, now we’ll be able to do that. Whereas, of course, that was totally prohibited by our selling and marketing and all of our ethical guidelines. In terms of the two OAB questions, neurogenic will be filed before the end of this year, 2010. And idiopathic, we're kind of coming towards the end of our Phase III enrollment, so everything's on track. And that’s still then in terms of approval, a little bit further out.

With year-over-year growth in the second quarter of 10.1% in dollars and 9.3% in local currencies, it is apparent that the trend of recovery in our Cash Pay businesses continues around the world. Given European economic reports, we are pleased that we have not observed any recent negative growth trends across the quarter, even in the more challenged economies in the eurozone or in the U.K. We are pleased with the overall corporate performance as we have, so far, successfully mitigated the impact to generics of ALPHAGAN and ACULAR on the U.S. Ophthalmic business. 
In addition to solid growth in developed economies, we enjoyed around 20% local currency sales growth in both Latin America and Asia-Pacific. We further expanded our presence in fast-growing emerging markets by the establishment of direct operations in Poland and Turkey on July 1.
Operating performance was strong with non-GAAP earnings per share at $0.85, marking a strong increase of 13.3% versus the result for Q2 of 2009, comfortably exceeding our expectations shared with the investment community at the end of April. The strong earnings growth was driven not only by good sales growth on a broad product front, but also by gross margin expansion in both Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals and consciously offset by a strong increase for R&D of 16.3% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis as we build the strength of our pipeline for the long term.
In the second quarter, we modestly increased our overall investment in direct-to-consumer advertising relative to Q2 of 2009, especially for RESTASIS. Since the last earnings call, we are pleased that we have achieved some notable regulatory approvals. BOTOX for the prophylactic of chronic migraine was approved in the U.K. The European Medicines Agency issued the license for OZURDEX for retinal vein occlusion, and the U.S. FDA approved ZYMAXID, our second-generation gatifloxacin. We furthermore strengthened our pipeline and our future urology portfolio by in-licensing Ser-120 for nocturia from Serenity Pharmaceuticals. Regarding the review of BOTOX for chronic migraine by the U.S. FDA, we have announced that the PDUFA date has been extended by three months as they complete their review of our file. In Europe, we filed BOTOX for chronic migraine with the European Medicines Agency through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. 
Now commenting the outlook for the remainder of 2010. We are pleased that we continue to make good progress relative to the expectations we provided at the end of Q1 as we have increased the bottom end of the sales range and maintained the top end of the range, even as we face the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar relative to other principal currencies and absorb pricing pressure in Europe. As we analyze growth in the second half of the year, it is clear that we face tougher comparisons versus the quarters in 2009, especially in the Cash Pay businesses. We estimate the impact of increased rebates and lowered prices in Europe at approximately $30 million for 2010 and an incremental number of $30 million for 2011. It is to be noted that we'd already anticipated a substantial number for price reductions in our 2010 operating plan as this is a regular occurrence, unfortunately, in Europe.
Regarding the expectations for EPS, we're making no changes as we absorb the aforementioned items. As we prepare for the costs of U.S. healthcare reform and now European pricing pressures, it is our intention to drive further efficiency and productivity programs across all areas of the company as a way to pay for as much as we can of these expenses.
Turning to the performance of the individual businesses. I'll commence with Ophthalmic Pharmaceuticals, which showed a strong pattern of growth, increasing 9.8% in dollars and 9.2% in local currencies. This Q2 growth number is in line with the overall global year-over-year market growth of 10% reported by IMS Global for Q1, the last quarter for which data is available. 
This is a commendable result, given that we're enduring the effect of the authorized generic of ALPHAGAN 0.15% and ACULAR generics in the United States. Our focus brands grew strongly expressed in local currency. RESTASIS increased a massive 26.8%. LUMIGAN, including GANFORT, by 12.4% with good performance from LUMIGAN and continued very significant growth from GANFORT. The ALPHAGAN family performs much better in Q2 relative to Q1, meaning year-over-year, declining only 0.2% with very strong growth with the newest brimonidine-containing products, that is ALPHAGAN 0.1% and COMBIGAN. Our strategy to defend the brimonidine franchise in the U.S. with ALPHAGAN 0.1% and COMBIGAN has continued to be successful. Seven months after launch of the authorized generic of 0.15%, we continue to hold more than 70% of the trailing prescriptions of all brimonidine-containing products.
Regarding the ketorolac franchise, ACUVAIL and branded ACULAR are enjoying just under 30% of the trailing prescriptions. In Europe, we are pleased with the progress of GANFORT, which is supported by a strong clinical data presented at the World  Ophthalmology Congress in Berlin in terms of its clinical efficacy relative to other prostaglandin or prostamide combinations with timolol. GANFORT was approved in Turkey. Uptick of LUMIGAN 0.01% is excellent with limited cannibalization of the original LUMIGAN, with launches in France and Denmark expanding the presence from either to Germany, U.K., other parts of Scandinavia and Holland. Regarding LUMIGAN 0.01%, we continue our efforts to bring the file to a successful conclusion with the U.S. FDA.
In the Artificial Tears segment, we're further extending our worldwide leadership as our growth clearly outstrips the market growth of 7%. OPTIVE was approved in Austria, Switzerland, Egypt and Singapore. Furthermore, OPTIVE unit dose was added to the list of reimbursed products in Australia. With the issue of the OZURDEX license in Europe, we are rapidly moving to launch the product in Germany and the U.K.
Moving on to BOTOX. The pickup in sales continues at a comfortable level to that seen in Q1 on a local currency basis. In Q2, year-over-year growth was 7.0% in dollars and 5.8% in local currencies, with lower growth in the U.S. due to new competition, being offset by double-digit sales increases across the broad group of foreign country markets. These are precisely the markets where we've been successfully dealing with multiple botulinum toxin competitors for many years. On a global basis, we estimate that BOTOX enjoyed 80% market share in Q1 in a market that grew 15% year-over-year worldwide.
In the U.S., after  upper limb spasticity FDA approval in March, we are observing an initial pickup in sales. Based on more than a decade of experience abroad, it takes time for new customers to learn how to inject BOTOX, for referral pathways to be developed and for doctors to integrate BOTOX into their spasticity clinics. We're also engaged in a national disease awareness campaign in cooperation with several patient groups, also supported with the well-known celebrity Henry Winkler acting as spokesperson. Impact to Dysport in the U.S. therapeutic market has been marginal. In Europe, given the states of government finances and funding pressures on national healthcare in many countries, we are pleased that the therapeutic market is growing double digit, and that BOTOX is almost holding its share as Xeomin enters several new countries.
Regarding the Aesthetic segment, we see the market growing double digit in all geographic regions. In the U.S., we estimate that year-over-year market growth accelerated from 9.5% in Q1 to 11% in Q2, even as the prior-year comparisons get tougher. Regarding Dysport market share, we believe that procedure share increased from 13% in Q1 to 18% in Q2, boosted by the so-called Love It or Leave It campaign, which is price-oriented. Since April, share gain has, however, been rather flat as we countered with various value coupons for patients across our whole product line.
Since May, we've also returned to category building with a print campaign called There's only one BOTOX. Regarding facial aesthetics, we're enjoying continuing very strong growth. In Q2, sales expanded 32.3% in dollars and 30.5% in local currencies, broadly at the same pace as in Q1. In Q1, we estimate that the market grew 24% year-over-year, with Allergan steadily gaining share in all regions of the world, except for Asia, where we only recently launched JUVÉDERM in several key markets and still have to secure approval in important markets such as Japan and China.
Worldwide, Allergan had, for the first time in Q1, the number one brand share in dermal fillers. The addition of lidocaine to JUVÉDERM has clearly improved patient experience and thereby, stimulated the market. TV and print advertising, both in the U.S. as well as in the U.K., France and Germany, coupled with PR campaigns, is building the market and leading to market share gains for us. The launch of VOLUMA in Canada and Australia is creating a new market segment for volumizing. JUVÉDERM XC and VOLUMA were recently launched in Mexico. Fortunately, we've just brought a new, more efficient production unit onstream at our sites in France to keep ahead of the surging demand.
For breast aesthetics, Q2 sales increased a strong 9.5% and 10.1% in local currencies, as all regions outside the U.S. grew strong double digit. Q2 growth relative to Q1 growth in local currencies was a little lower, impacted by the contractual effect of a buyback of inventory from our distributor in Australia as we prepare to go direct from September 1. In the U.S., we believe that we have observed the phenomenon of pent-up demand as we saw strong expansion in lower-cost salient products in the peak spring season, which is at the margin favored Mentor, as Mentor is relatively stronger than Allergan in the salient category. Pent-up demand has been unique to breast aesthetics versus our other aesthetic categories.
Regarding category analysis in Q1, we estimate that the market grew 19%, with Allergan growing in market at 17%. Regarding skin care, with most sales being in the U.S., sales increased year-over-year by 40.2% in dollars. ACZONE sales are growing very strongly as we gain share and given the small prior-year base. In-market sales growth of TAZORAC and AZELEX are modest. Year-over-year sales of LATISSE increased by 83.3% and increased sequentially from $18.8 million in Q1 to $23.9 million in Q2, in part thanks to a successful one-year anniversary promotion.
We're still rather encouraged by several insights from our battery of consumer and market research. Women love our product as it really works, which explains a very low discontinuation rate. Advertising and brand awareness is extremely high for a brand that has only been on the market for one and half years. We still have only penetrated about a quarter of our facial aesthetics users, so a large opportunity remains ahead of us. Use of Claire Danes as a second spokeswoman, in addition to Brooke Shields, provides us a connection to an additional, younger-user audience.
On the negative side, it is apparent that women have, in practice, learned to extend the use of the product to an average consumption of two to three bottles a year. In addition, we have consumer brands and illegal product that make unsubstantiated claims as they seek to capitalize on the category that we are creating. Such indirect competition has occurred in many markets in the past. Over time, it becomes apparent which product really works for the long term and which claims are backed by clinical evidence.
Over the course of the year, we have plans underway to fine-tune our marketing and product mix. Our investment in TV and print will continue unabated. LATISSE was approved in Canada, and we'll launch later this year. 
Commenting urology. Sales of $15.6 million declined year-over-year 3.1%. On a year-to-date acquisition dollars basis, they are absolutely flat. With slowly improving shares in the urology specialty, we expect some modest improvement in performance during the remainder of the year. The next key event for this business, after securing FDA regulatory approval in 2011, is the launch of BOTOX for neurogenic overactive bladder. 
Finally, regarding the obesity intervention product area, sales declined 6.6% in dollars and 7.5% in local currencies. The decline in sales in the U.S. was offset by an increase in sales in foreign markets. Regarding the U.S., it is now clear that the overall gastric band market is lagging in the timing of market recovery and is correlated to unemployment and consumer confidence. This is explicable as the out-of-pocket expense is the highest compared to any other product in our portfolio. Based on our market research, the Cash Pay segment of the market has declined enormously, with the Reimbursed segment remaining very stable. Within the overall bariatric market, we're encouraged that bands now have 50% share relative to gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. 
The share of LAP-BAND relative to Ethicon's REALIZE Band is now stable, with LAP-BAND share in May estimated at 74%. Outside the U.S., we had strong LAP-BAND performance in Canada and the U.K. and are pleased with the strong performance of our ORBERA Gastric Balloon in certain European markets, parts of Latin America and Australia. We're working to increase public awareness and recognition for gastric banding as a viable intervention tool, especially in the U.S. In order to address this goal for the long term, we filed LAP-BAND for a lower body mass index population with the FDA. 
I'd now like to pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment on our financial performance and outlook for 2010."

During the second quarter of 2010, Allergan continued its positive trend and generated strong operating results, and we experienced good performance across each of our geographic regions and benef",1055,"Thanks, David, and good morning to all of you on the call. During the second quarter of 2010, Allergan continued its positive trend and generated strong operating results, and we experienced good performance across each of our geographic regions and benefited from double-digit sales growth in both our Pharmaceutical and Medical Device businesses. Allergan was again able to overachieve our sales and earnings per share expectations despite increasing headwinds in currency markets versus prior year and the ongoing generic impact to our ALPHAGAN P 0.15% and the ACULAR brands. The depth and breadth of our businesses, as well as our strong competitive positions within our specialty areas, have enabled Allergan to generate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of $0.85, coming in above the top end of our range of expectations and marking a 13.3% increase over 2009 results for the same quarter. 
As has been the case on a consistent basis in the past, this strong second quarter earnings performance was generated even as we continue to invest into the current and future growth drivers of the business. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in the earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustment and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q2 2010 gross margin of 84.5% increased 160 basis points when compared to prior year as Allergan saw strong improvement in its Pharmaceutical margins and very strong improvement in its Medical Device margins. This increase in gross margin was, again, driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs; favorable volume-based manufacturing variances; favorable inventory repricing; breasts being the biggest contributor, given our low-cost manufacturing base in Costa Rica; lower year-over-year inventory provisions; and lower royalty expense.
The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product mix sales ratio for the second quarter was 40.1% as compared to a comparable ratio of 42.3% in Q1 2010 totaling $495 million, an increase of approximately $61 million over the second quarter of 2009 as we continued to implement targeted investments to further stimulate the positive growth trends observed in our Pharmaceutical and Cash Pay Aesthetic businesses. We continue to believe that the economic recovery will be somewhat slow and gradual and as such, we'll maintain our commitment and focus to managing Allergan's cost structure wisely to limit waste and direct our capital to the highest yielding investments.
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 15.2% of product net sales for the quarter totaling $188 million, an increase in spend of approximately $26 million over the second quarter of 2009 and sequentially above the same level of spend for the first quarter of 2010 as we continue to fund new projects and invest into our promising Pharmaceutical and Medical Device pipelines. We anticipate that Allergan's quarterly investment into research and development will continue to increase on a sequential basis over the course of 2010.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's second quarter operating income ratio increased by 320 basis points sequentially over the first quarter of 2010. This positive trend was a result of Allergan's ongoing commitment to focus on enhancing operational efficiencies through improvement of the company's cost structure, while maximizing investment returns. With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 45 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 96 days. Each of these results represents improvements over prior-year Q2 results.
At the end of the second quarter, Allergan's cash and cash net of debt positions totaled to approximately $2.2 billion and $688 million, respectively. Allergan continued to maintain exceptional cash flow generation capabilities in the second quarter, with operating cash flow after capital expenditures of approximately $321 million. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow after capital expenditures totaled approximately $481 million, which compares to $422 million generated for the same period in 2009. These strong cash balances and broad access to liquidity allow Allergan to remain proactive with respect to ongoing pursuits of strategic acquisitions and licensing opportunities. 
The first half of the year represented a strong beginning to 2010 for Allergan. As we move forward, Allergan's plan is to continue carefully monitoring each of our markets and manage business expenses and investment opportunities in an appropriate manner, with the goal of producing high-quality financial and operational results. Although we believe that markets have clearly stabilized and in many cases, shown signs of improvement, we understand that some continued caution is also prudent. 
For the third quarter of 2010, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,130,000,000 to $1,180,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.77. Regarding full year expectations for 2010, since our first quarter earnings call, when we last provided estimates for full year sales, we have achieved better-than-expected sales performance in both our Pharmaceutical and Medical Device businesses. 
During this same period, however, currency markets fluctuated, somewhat offsetting this improved business performance and creating an approximate $50 million headwind versus our thinking at the time. Taking into account the better-than-expected sales trends observed in the second quarter and the impact of negative foreign exchange movements, as well as some pricing pressures within the European markets, we are adjusting our full year sales expectations to between $4,620,000,000 and $4,750,000,000. Please note that we have raised the bottom end of our full year sales expectation and in spite of the currency and pricing pressures, have maintained the top end of our full year sales expectations provided on our previous earnings call.
Allergan's expectations for full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share remains unchanged between $3.11 and $3.15, which represents growth of between 12% and 13%. As a reminder, these expectations assume that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter for this year, with full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. For your information, expectation for other lines of income statement and specific product sales expectations are included with our earnings release. 
We are pleased with the strong operating performance achieved in the second quarter across our broad base of business and geographic regions. We will strive to continue to build on this momentum and effectively execute against our business strategies, further strengthening Allergan as a leader in our selected medical specialty markets. 
With that, operator, I'd like now to open the call to questions."

Once that was refiled, they told us that this was considered a major amendment and to review it, they extended the user fee date by three months. But that review is focused on the REMS."

So we can basically offer, if you like, value coupons on one product linking to others because clearly, there's a real benefit from consumers if, say, they start with BOTOX, they can then go to fillers next or in reverse. And as I stated on my LATISSE commentary, still, if we use BOTOX as the kind of the gold standard, the first product that created the medical aesthetics category, only 25% of Botox users use LATISSE. So as a marketing person, I see that as a huge upside. It's just a question of how do we specifically talk to those people to bring them into the category.

You need to go out and train people appropriately, and then they have to start incorporating the product into their practice. So analogous to what I said on spasticity headache in terms of new users, new doctors will be relatively slow. Although one would imagine there will be a lot written in the press, given the huge interest and the huge unmet medical need in this condition. So that kind of covers the issue of revenue, very modest if we look at the United States. U.K., not the biggest market in the world, but not the smallest either. In terms of costs, we are very pleased with the structure we have in the United States, so in terms of sales force, it's there. Obviously, we need to spend some more money to increase awareness of the treatment, and also we need to spend money on training. In Europe, they're slightly different in that our base therapeutic sales force was smaller. Therefore, we need to expand it on a percentage basis slightly more. But at the end of the day, these are not numbers that will be visible through our SG&A spending worldwide. When we have such a base of spending hypothetically, it's not the right number.

You've got to actually sell them, which is a much tougher proposition. If we look at Canada, even say Quebec, which is always the first province to reimburse for all drug categories, negligible share for Xeomin. It's, I think -- I mean the numbers are so small, measuring a point, but we think it's 2%. If we look at Europe, really, the only share position that is multiple is in Germany, which is the first market for Xeomin, also the home market of Merz. Outside Germany, rather small shares.

I'm rather pleased, as I covered in my opening remarks, that despite, for the first time really in 12 years, having to face generics, growing almost in line with the worldwide market of ophthalmology is pretty good while we have to go through that, let's call it, the 12-month phenomenon of post-launch of the generic where you unfortunately get really pushed down, and then it kind of laps itself out, and then you can start recovering off that lower base, so pretty pleased with that. Really, as one could well imagine, the U.S. is growing a little bit thanks to RESTASIS, which is growing like a freight train and then a lot of good growth overseas. Answering your second question, with the prospect for generic latanoprost or generic sort of Xalatan from March, April of next year, we've done a lot of work on this, and the more we do, we can't say there'll be a zero effect on LUMIGAN, but we think it's going to be relatively marginal. So we took [ph] (44:05) rather confident with that given our managed care team isn't just looking at the ceiling. They're out there talking to all the customers on a very, very consistent basis and also are in the process of negotiating the contracts for 2011 already. Second question you had was on SG&A. I certainly pointed to us looking for ways to offset European pricing pressures and the cost of U.S. health care reform, and that goes right across the company whether it's greater efficiency in R&D where we have some really good programs in place that when I see those trends, I don't need to be an optimist to believe it will continue, same coming back to sales and marketing. I think we have very good deployment models. Really, where we're adding people is in particular the emerging markets. That has the greatest rate of increase and then very much at the margin, say, in Europe, where I referenced modest increase in the number of representatives for migraine. And clearly, we need to add some and have already started for the launch of OZURDEX for retina, a highly specialized area with various specialized people. So I would certainly, in conclusion, say that we will look to further fine-tuning SG&A, which is really all about the S part, selling and marketing, and it is our absolute goal in the next couple of years to start bringing down that ratio as we've said for a long time and then marginally increase in percentage R&D because it's all about growing, well, creating the pipeline for the long term."

First of all, clearly, this is a very severely impacted populations, so huge medical need, which any medical director of a managed care organization would recognize, so clearly, need. Second, let's call it just pure economics. Managed care knows that this very severe population frequently end up in the emergency room, and a visit probably costs somewhere between $4,000 and $5,000. So if they can avoid just one emergency room visit, they've already played the monopoly game in terms of passing go and collecting money. So I think in all our contracts with managed care, they realize there's a real economic benefit from avoidance of emergency room visits. And then thirdly is the issue of drug sparing where a few years ago, the math was a little simpler because at that time, TOPAMAX was not generic. None of the triptanes were generic. So now it gets more complicated to do the math. Are we talking of sparing a generic drug or sparing of a high-cost innovator drug? But still, you can look through averages and realize that there is money to be saved there. So net-net, I would say, Corey, managed care will actually be interested in this even from an economic point of view. Therefore, I do not see any major blockages being put in because, clearly, people that have 15 headache days per month in their history, they have a whole medical file. And it's quite clear, people who are milder can be weeded out very quickly for being inappropriate."

I think you can probably tell from my script and my remarks that I think the biggest single driver is women discovering how to use the product more sparingly.

The bad news is in the short term, we now need more ladies to get to the same $100 million or $140 million number that we originally planned.

R&D spend was up 16%. That was very much the plan. You probably recollect last year that we were in a kind of changing of the guards because we had finished some big trials. We're about to start new ones and, of course, that was in the depth of the recession. And Scott and I, we're being very careful not to get ahead of ourselves in the early part of the year. And by the time, June, July came along of 2009, then saying to Scott, okay, now, really start spending quickly. R&D isn't like that. It takes three, four, five, six months to really start spending in an intelligent meaningful way. Now coming back around on obesity, I'm absolutely convinced that there's enormous amount of positive work to be done for LAP-BAND. As I commented, the market of course has been fragile for the last two years. I think it's a matter of waiting and preparing just as the market starts to recover. You should see us really stepping up our efforts, both through public awareness campaigns. I think an awful lot of work has to be done with employers and payers. We have a great data in terms of health economics. You commented indirect competition. I'm personally very skeptical about drugs for obesity. The hurdle for approval is extremely high as you've seen on many different occasions, not just with FDA but also the European agencies. Unfortunately, even once approved, many of these drugs have some quite awkward side effects in terms of people's ability to tolerate them. Then the next sort of chapter would be further innovation from us. Obviously, we'll look to continuing improving LAP-BAND over time, but then we have the ORBERA Gastric Balloon that I commented. And then we also look at other intragastric devices: when might they come to market, what is interesting, and we track all of those technologies very carefully, deciding whether we'd want to purchase them or license them or distribute them. But they must -- it depends on what it is and what the economics might be."

With year-over-year growth in the second quarter of 10.1% in dollars and 9.3% in local currencies, it is apparent that the trend of recovery in our Cash Pay businesses continues around the world.",2243,"Great. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. With year-over-year growth in the second quarter of 10.1% in dollars and 9.3% in local currencies, it is apparent that the trend of recovery in our Cash Pay businesses continues around the world. Given European economic reports, we are pleased that we have not observed any recent negative growth trends across the quarter, even in the more challenged economies in the eurozone or in the U.K. We are pleased with the overall corporate performance as we have, so far, successfully mitigated the impact to generics of ALPHAGAN and ACULAR on the U.S. Ophthalmic business. 
In addition to solid growth in developed economies, we enjoyed around 20% local currency sales growth in both Latin America and Asia-Pacific. We further expanded our presence in fast-growing emerging markets by the establishment of direct operations in Poland and Turkey on July 1.
Operating performance was strong with non-GAAP earnings per share at $0.85, marking a strong increase of 13.3% versus the result for Q2 of 2009, comfortably exceeding our expectations shared with the investment community at the end of April. The strong earnings growth was driven not only by good sales growth on a broad product front, but also by gross margin expansion in both Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals and consciously offset by a strong increase for R&D of 16.3% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis as we build the strength of our pipeline for the long term.
In the second quarter, we modestly increased our overall investment in direct-to-consumer advertising relative to Q2 of 2009, especially for RESTASIS. Since the last earnings call, we are pleased that we have achieved some notable regulatory approvals. BOTOX for the prophylactic of chronic migraine was approved in the U.K. The European Medicines Agency issued the license for OZURDEX for retinal vein occlusion, and the U.S. FDA approved ZYMAXID, our second-generation gatifloxacin. We furthermore strengthened our pipeline and our future urology portfolio by in-licensing Ser-120 for nocturia from Serenity Pharmaceuticals. Regarding the review of BOTOX for chronic migraine by the U.S. FDA, we have announced that the PDUFA date has been extended by three months as they complete their review of our file. In Europe, we filed BOTOX for chronic migraine with the European Medicines Agency through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. 
Now commenting the outlook for the remainder of 2010. We are pleased that we continue to make good progress relative to the expectations we provided at the end of Q1 as we have increased the bottom end of the sales range and maintained the top end of the range, even as we face the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar relative to other principal currencies and absorb pricing pressure in Europe. As we analyze growth in the second half of the year, it is clear that we face tougher comparisons versus the quarters in 2009, especially in the Cash Pay businesses. We estimate the impact of increased rebates and lowered prices in Europe at approximately $30 million for 2010 and an incremental number of $30 million for 2011. It is to be noted that we'd already anticipated a substantial number for price reductions in our 2010 operating plan as this is a regular occurrence, unfortunately, in Europe.
Regarding the expectations for EPS, we're making no changes as we absorb the aforementioned items. As we prepare for the costs of U.S. healthcare reform and now European pricing pressures, it is our intention to drive further efficiency and productivity programs across all areas of the company as a way to pay for as much as we can of these expenses.
Turning to the performance of the individual businesses. I'll commence with Ophthalmic Pharmaceuticals, which showed a strong pattern of growth, increasing 9.8% in dollars and 9.2% in local currencies. This Q2 growth number is in line with the overall global year-over-year market growth of 10% reported by IMS Global for Q1, the last quarter for which data is available. 
This is a commendable result, given that we're enduring the effect of the authorized generic of ALPHAGAN 0.15% and ACULAR generics in the United States. Our focus brands grew strongly expressed in local currency. RESTASIS increased a massive 26.8%. LUMIGAN, including GANFORT, by 12.4% with good performance from LUMIGAN and continued very significant growth from GANFORT. The ALPHAGAN family performs much better in Q2 relative to Q1, meaning year-over-year, declining only 0.2% with very strong growth with the newest brimonidine-containing products, that is ALPHAGAN 0.1% and COMBIGAN. Our strategy to defend the brimonidine franchise in the U.S. with ALPHAGAN 0.1% and COMBIGAN has continued to be successful. Seven months after launch of the authorized generic of 0.15%, we continue to hold more than 70% of the trailing prescriptions of all brimonidine-containing products.
Regarding the ketorolac franchise, ACUVAIL and branded ACULAR are enjoying just under 30% of the trailing prescriptions. In Europe, we are pleased with the progress of GANFORT, which is supported by a strong clinical data presented at the World  Ophthalmology Congress in Berlin in terms of its clinical efficacy relative to other prostaglandin or prostamide combinations with timolol. GANFORT was approved in Turkey. Uptick of LUMIGAN 0.01% is excellent with limited cannibalization of the original LUMIGAN, with launches in France and Denmark expanding the presence from either to Germany, U.K., other parts of Scandinavia and Holland. Regarding LUMIGAN 0.01%, we continue our efforts to bring the file to a successful conclusion with the U.S. FDA.
In the Artificial Tears segment, we're further extending our worldwide leadership as our growth clearly outstrips the market growth of 7%. OPTIVE was approved in Austria, Switzerland, Egypt and Singapore. Furthermore, OPTIVE unit dose was added to the list of reimbursed products in Australia. With the issue of the OZURDEX license in Europe, we are rapidly moving to launch the product in Germany and the U.K.
Moving on to BOTOX. The pickup in sales continues at a comfortable level to that seen in Q1 on a local currency basis. In Q2, year-over-year growth was 7.0% in dollars and 5.8% in local currencies, with lower growth in the U.S. due to new competition, being offset by double-digit sales increases across the broad group of foreign country markets. These are precisely the markets where we've been successfully dealing with multiple botulinum toxin competitors for many years. On a global basis, we estimate that BOTOX enjoyed 80% market share in Q1 in a market that grew 15% year-over-year worldwide.
In the U.S., after  upper limb spasticity FDA approval in March, we are observing an initial pickup in sales. Based on more than a decade of experience abroad, it takes time for new customers to learn how to inject BOTOX, for referral pathways to be developed and for doctors to integrate BOTOX into their spasticity clinics. We're also engaged in a national disease awareness campaign in cooperation with several patient groups, also supported with the well-known celebrity Henry Winkler acting as spokesperson. Impact to Dysport in the U.S. therapeutic market has been marginal. In Europe, given the states of government finances and funding pressures on national healthcare in many countries, we are pleased that the therapeutic market is growing double digit, and that BOTOX is almost holding its share as Xeomin enters several new countries.
Regarding the Aesthetic segment, we see the market growing double digit in all geographic regions. In the U.S., we estimate that year-over-year market growth accelerated from 9.5% in Q1 to 11% in Q2, even as the prior-year comparisons get tougher. Regarding Dysport market share, we believe that procedure share increased from 13% in Q1 to 18% in Q2, boosted by the so-called Love It or Leave It campaign, which is price-oriented. Since April, share gain has, however, been rather flat as we countered with various value coupons for patients across our whole product line.
Since May, we've also returned to category building with a print campaign called There's only one BOTOX. Regarding facial aesthetics, we're enjoying continuing very strong growth. In Q2, sales expanded 32.3% in dollars and 30.5% in local currencies, broadly at the same pace as in Q1. In Q1, we estimate that the market grew 24% year-over-year, with Allergan steadily gaining share in all regions of the world, except for Asia, where we only recently launched JUVÉDERM in several key markets and still have to secure approval in important markets such as Japan and China.
Worldwide, Allergan had, for the first time in Q1, the number one brand share in dermal fillers. The addition of lidocaine to JUVÉDERM has clearly improved patient experience and thereby, stimulated the market. TV and print advertising, both in the U.S. as well as in the U.K., France and Germany, coupled with PR campaigns, is building the market and leading to market share gains for us. The launch of VOLUMA in Canada and Australia is creating a new market segment for volumizing. JUVÉDERM XC and VOLUMA were recently launched in Mexico. Fortunately, we've just brought a new, more efficient production unit onstream at our sites in France to keep ahead of the surging demand.
For breast aesthetics, Q2 sales increased a strong 9.5% and 10.1% in local currencies, as all regions outside the U.S. grew strong double digit. Q2 growth relative to Q1 growth in local currencies was a little lower, impacted by the contractual effect of a buyback of inventory from our distributor in Australia as we prepare to go direct from September 1. In the U.S., we believe that we have observed the phenomenon of pent-up demand as we saw strong expansion in lower-cost salient products in the peak spring season, which is at the margin favored Mentor, as Mentor is relatively stronger than Allergan in the salient category. Pent-up demand has been unique to breast aesthetics versus our other aesthetic categories.
Regarding category analysis in Q1, we estimate that the market grew 19%, with Allergan growing in market at 17%. Regarding skin care, with most sales being in the U.S., sales increased year-over-year by 40.2% in dollars. ACZONE sales are growing very strongly as we gain share and given the small prior-year base. In-market sales growth of TAZORAC and AZELEX are modest. Year-over-year sales of LATISSE increased by 83.3% and increased sequentially from $18.8 million in Q1 to $23.9 million in Q2, in part thanks to a successful one-year anniversary promotion.
We're still rather encouraged by several insights from our battery of consumer and market research. Women love our product as it really works, which explains a very low discontinuation rate. Advertising and brand awareness is extremely high for a brand that has only been on the market for one and half years. We still have only penetrated about a quarter of our facial aesthetics users, so a large opportunity remains ahead of us. Use of Claire Danes as a second spokeswoman, in addition to Brooke Shields, provides us a connection to an additional, younger-user audience.
On the negative side, it is apparent that women have, in practice, learned to extend the use of the product to an average consumption of two to three bottles a year. In addition, we have consumer brands and illegal product that make unsubstantiated claims as they seek to capitalize on the category that we are creating. Such indirect competition has occurred in many markets in the past. Over time, it becomes apparent which product really works for the long term and which claims are backed by clinical evidence.
Over the course of the year, we have plans underway to fine-tune our marketing and product mix. Our investment in TV and print will continue unabated. LATISSE was approved in Canada, and we'll launch later this year. 
Commenting urology. Sales of $15.6 million declined year-over-year 3.1%. On a year-to-date acquisition dollars basis, they are absolutely flat. With slowly improving shares in the urology specialty, we expect some modest improvement in performance during the remainder of the year. The next key event for this business, after securing FDA regulatory approval in 2011, is the launch of BOTOX for neurogenic overactive bladder. 
Finally, regarding the obesity intervention product area, sales declined 6.6% in dollars and 7.5% in local currencies. The decline in sales in the U.S. was offset by an increase in sales in foreign markets. Regarding the U.S., it is now clear that the overall gastric band market is lagging in the timing of market recovery and is correlated to unemployment and consumer confidence. This is explicable as the out-of-pocket expense is the highest compared to any other product in our portfolio. Based on our market research, the Cash Pay segment of the market has declined enormously, with the Reimbursed segment remaining very stable. Within the overall bariatric market, we're encouraged that bands now have 50% share relative to gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. 
The share of LAP-BAND relative to Ethicon's REALIZE Band is now stable, with LAP-BAND share in May estimated at 74%. Outside the U.S., we had strong LAP-BAND performance in Canada and the U.K. and are pleased with the strong performance of our ORBERA Gastric Balloon in certain European markets, parts of Latin America and Australia. We're working to increase public awareness and recognition for gastric banding as a viable intervention tool, especially in the U.S. In order to address this goal for the long term, we filed LAP-BAND for a lower body mass index population with the FDA. 
I'd now like to pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment on our financial performance and outlook for 2010.

During the second quarter of 2010, Allergan continued its positive trend and generated strong operating results, and we experienced good performance across each of our geographic regions and benefited from double-digit sales growth in both our Pharmaceutical and Medical Device businesses. Allergan was again able to overachieve our sales and earnings per share expectations despite increasing headwinds in currency markets versus prior year and the ongoing generic impact to our ALPHAGAN P 0.15% and the ACULAR brands. The depth and breadth of our businesses, as well as our strong competitive positions within our specialty areas, have enabled Allergan to generate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of $0.85, coming in above the top end of our range of expectations and marking a 13.3% increase over 2009 results for the same quarter. 
As has been the case on a consistent basis in the past, this strong second quarter earnings performance was generated even as we continue to invest into the current and future growth drivers of the business. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in the earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustment and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q2 2010 gross margin of 84.5% increased 160 basis points when compared to prior year as Allergan saw strong improvement in its Pharmaceutical margins and very strong improvement in its Medical Device margins. This increase in gross margin was, again, driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs; favorable volume-based manufacturing variances; favorable inventory repricing; breasts being the biggest contributor, given our low-cost manufacturing base in Costa Rica; lower year-over-year inventory provisions; and lower royalty expense.
The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product mix sales ratio for the second quarter was 40.1% as compared to a comparable ratio of 42.3% in Q1 2010 totaling $495 million, an increase of approximately $61 million over the second quarter of 2009 as we continued to implement targeted investments to further stimulate the positive growth trends observed in our Pharmaceutical and Cash Pay Aesthetic businesses. We continue to believe that the economic recovery will be somewhat slow and gradual and as such, we'll maintain our commitment and focus to managing Allergan's cost structure wisely to limit waste and direct our capital to the highest yielding investments.
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 15.2% of product net sales for the quarter totaling $188 million, an increase in spend of approximately $26 million over the second quarter of 2009 and sequentially above the same level of spend for the first quarter of 2010 as we continue to fund new projects and invest into our promising Pharmaceutical and Medical Device pipelines. We anticipate that Allergan's quarterly investment into research and development will continue to increase on a sequential basis over the course of 2010.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's second quarter operating income ratio increased by 320 basis points sequentially over the first quarter of 2010. This positive trend was a result of Allergan's ongoing commitment to focus on enhancing operational efficiencies through improvement of the company's cost structure, while maximizing investment returns. With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 45 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 96 days. Each of these results represents improvements over prior-year Q2 results.
At the end of the second quarter, Allergan's cash and cash net of debt positions totaled to approximately $2.2 billion and $688 million, respectively. Allergan continued to maintain exceptional cash flow generation capabilities in the second quarter, with operating cash flow after capital expenditures of approximately $321 million. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow after capital expenditures totaled approximately $481 million, which compares to $422 million generated for the same period in 2009. These strong cash balances and broad access to liquidity allow Allergan to remain proactive with respect to ongoing pursuits of strategic acquisitions and licensing opportunities. 
The first half of the year represented a strong beginning to 2010 for Allergan. As we move forward, Allergan's plan is to continue carefully monitoring each of our markets and manage business expenses and investment opportunities in an appropriate manner, with the goal of producing high-quality financial and operational results. Although we believe that markets have clearly stabilized and in many cases, shown signs of improvement, we understand that some continued caution is also prudent. 
For the third quarter of 2010, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,130,000,000 to $1,180,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.77. Regarding full year expectations for 2010, since our first quarter earnings call, when we last provided estimates for full year sales, we have achieved better-than-expected sales performance in both our Pharmaceutical and Medical Device businesses. 
During this same period, however, currency markets fluctuated, somewhat offsetting this improved business performance and creating an approximate $50 million headwind versus our thinking at the time. Taking into account the better-than-expected sales trends observed in the second quarter and the impact of negative foreign exchange movements, as well as some pricing pressures within the European markets, we are adjusting our full year sales expectations to between $4,620,000,000 and $4,750,000,000. Please note that we have raised the bottom end of our full year sales expectation and in spite of the currency and pricing pressures, have maintained the top end of our full year sales expectations provided on our previous earnings call.
Allergan's expectations for full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share remains unchanged between $3.11 and $3.15, which represents growth of between 12% and 13%. As a reminder, these expectations assume that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter for this year, with full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. For your information, expectation for other lines of income statement and specific product sales expectations are included with our earnings release. 
We are pleased with the strong operating performance achieved in the second quarter across our broad base of business and geographic regions. We will strive to continue to build on this momentum and effectively execute against our business strategies, further strengthening Allergan as a leader in our selected medical specialty markets. 
With that, operator, I'd like now to open the call to questions.

So what you saw in the press release was that FDA asked us to update the REMS with three specific things: one, was to update the Medication Guide to include a chronic migraine indication; two, to provide details on physician training for chronic migraine; and then three, detail a communication plan, which includes a dear healthcare practitioner letter informing them of the chronic migraine indication. Once that was refiled, they told us that this was considered a major amendment and to review it, they extended the user fee date by three months. But that review is focused on the REMS.

And clearly, we have the benefit now that we are the market leader in dermal fillers. We're creating the eye lash category and of course, we're by far and away, the originator or leader in BOTOX. So we can basically offer, if you like, value coupons on one product linking to others because clearly, there's a real benefit from consumers if, say, they start with BOTOX, they can then go to fillers next or in reverse. And as I stated on my LATISSE commentary, still, if we use BOTOX as the kind of the gold standard, the first product that created the medical aesthetics category, only 25% of Botox users use LATISSE. So as a marketing person, I see that as a huge upside. It's just a question of how do we specifically talk to those people to bring them into the category. You can see lots of, let's call it, both defensive and offensive strategies in place to manage our complete portfolio.

And so given also what I said on spasticity, this isn't the kind of category where you make product available day one and people in masks start injecting day two or three. It's just not like that. You need to go out and train people appropriately, and then they have to start incorporating the product into their practice. So analogous to what I said on spasticity headache in terms of new users, new doctors will be relatively slow. Although one would imagine there will be a lot written in the press, given the huge interest and the huge unmet medical need in this condition. So that kind of covers the issue of revenue, very modest if we look at the United States. U.K., not the biggest market in the world, but not the smallest either. In terms of costs, we are very pleased with the structure we have in the United States, so in terms of sales force, it's there. Obviously, we need to spend some more money to increase awareness of the treatment, and also we need to spend money on training. In Europe, they're slightly different in that our base therapeutic sales force was smaller. Therefore, we need to expand it on a percentage basis slightly more. But at the end of the day, these are not numbers that will be visible through our SG&A spending worldwide. When we have such a base of spending hypothetically, it's not the right number. But if it was $10 million, you wouldn't really notice it.

It's, I think -- I mean the numbers are so small, measuring a point, but we think it's 2%.

I'm rather pleased, as I covered in my opening remarks, that despite, for the first time really in 12 years, having to face generics, growing almost in line with the worldwide market of ophthalmology is pretty good while we have to go through that, let's call it, the 12-month phenomenon of post-launch of the generic where you unfortunately get really pushed down, and then it kind of laps itself out, and then you can start recovering off that lower base, so pretty pleased with that. Really, as one could well imagine, the U.S. is growing a little bit thanks to RESTASIS, which is growing like a freight train and then a lot of good growth overseas. Answering your second question, with the prospect for generic latanoprost or generic sort of Xalatan from March, April of next year, we've done a lot of work on this, and the more we do, we can't say there'll be a zero effect on LUMIGAN, but we think it's going to be relatively marginal. So we took [ph] (44:05) rather confident with that given our managed care team isn't just looking at the ceiling. They're out there talking to all the customers on a very, very consistent basis and also are in the process of negotiating the contracts for 2011 already. Second question you had was on SG&A. I certainly pointed to us looking for ways to offset European pricing pressures and the cost of U.S. health care reform, and that goes right across the company whether it's greater efficiency in R&D where we have some really good programs in place that when I see those trends, I don't need to be an optimist to believe it will continue, same coming back to sales and marketing. I think we have very good deployment models. Really, where we're adding people is in particular the emerging markets. That has the greatest rate of increase and then very much at the margin, say, in Europe, where I referenced modest increase in the number of representatives for migraine. And clearly, we need to add some and have already started for the launch of OZURDEX for retina, a highly specialized area with various specialized people. So I would certainly, in conclusion, say that we will look to further fine-tuning SG&A, which is really all about the S part, selling and marketing, and it is our absolute goal in the next couple of years to start bringing down that ratio as we've said for a long time and then marginally increase in percentage R&D because it's all about growing, well, creating the pipeline for the long term.

So how does the migraine indication for BOTOX fit into that? Does it fit into that, or the fact that they've already been used to receiving requests for that mean that they might embrace this new indication a little more quickly than we're seeing on other new products coming to market?

First of all, clearly, this is a very severely impacted populations, so huge medical need, which any medical director of a managed care organization would recognize, so clearly, need. Second, let's call it just pure economics. Managed care knows that this very severe population frequently end up in the emergency room, and a visit probably costs somewhere between $4,000 and $5,000. So if they can avoid just one emergency room visit, they've already played the monopoly game in terms of passing go and collecting money. So I think in all our contracts with managed care, they realize there's a real economic benefit from avoidance of emergency room visits. And then thirdly is the issue of drug sparing where a few years ago, the math was a little simpler because at that time, TOPAMAX was not generic. None of the triptanes were generic. So now it gets more complicated to do the math. Are we talking of sparing a generic drug or sparing of a high-cost innovator drug? But still, you can look through averages and realize that there is money to be saved there. So net-net, I would say, Corey, managed care will actually be interested in this even from an economic point of view. Therefore, I do not see any major blockages being put in because, clearly, people that have 15 headache days per month in their history, they have a whole medical file. And it's quite clear, people who are milder can be weeded out very quickly for being inappropriate.

I think you can probably tell from my script and my remarks that I think the biggest single driver is women discovering how to use the product more sparingly. Certainly, the practice is quite different than what is in the clinical study and the label. So the good and bad news about that is that it's much cheaper for consumers than they initially thought, and I'm sure physicians by now have worked that out as well, and so it's more accessible. The bad news is in the short term, we now need more ladies to get to the same $100 million or $140 million number that we originally planned. I think then when you look around the world, of course, there's lots of different regulatory situations in different markets. As I reflect upon LATISSE, it's like so many other things I've done in my career. When you create a new category, at the beginning, you think you know a lot, and then you discover all the things you didn't know. This is the great journey of creating a market. But the good news is the product really works. Women really like long eyelashes, and so we just have to keep working and discovering what the answers are to various matters and just keep building this category, and it will be a very major product in Allergan's portfolio.

And by the time, June, July came along of 2009, then saying to Scott, okay, now, really start spending quickly. R&D isn't like that. It takes three, four, five, six months to really start spending in an intelligent meaningful way. Now coming back around on obesity, I'm absolutely convinced that there's enormous amount of positive work to be done for LAP-BAND. As I commented, the market of course has been fragile for the last two years. I think it's a matter of waiting and preparing just as the market starts to recover. You should see us really stepping up our efforts, both through public awareness campaigns. I think an awful lot of work has to be done with employers and payers. We have a great data in terms of health economics. You commented indirect competition. I'm personally very skeptical about drugs for obesity. The hurdle for approval is extremely high as you've seen on many different occasions, not just with FDA but also the European agencies. Unfortunately, even once approved, many of these drugs have some quite awkward side effects in terms of people's ability to tolerate them. Then the next sort of chapter would be further innovation from us. Obviously, we'll look to continuing improving LAP-BAND over time, but then we have the ORBERA Gastric Balloon that I commented. And then we also look at other intragastric devices: when might they come to market, what is interesting, and we track all of those technologies very carefully, deciding whether we'd want to purchase them or license them or distribute them.

With year-over-year growth in the second quarter of 10.1% in dollars and 9.3% in local currencies, it is apparent that the trend of recovery in our Cash Pay businesses continues around the world.",2243,"Great. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. With year-over-year growth in the second quarter of 10.1% in dollars and 9.3% in local currencies, it is apparent that the trend of recovery in our Cash Pay businesses continues around the world. Given European economic reports, we are pleased that we have not observed any recent negative growth trends across the quarter, even in the more challenged economies in the eurozone or in the U.K. We are pleased with the overall corporate performance as we have, so far, successfully mitigated the impact to generics of ALPHAGAN and ACULAR on the U.S. Ophthalmic business. 
In addition to solid growth in developed economies, we enjoyed around 20% local currency sales growth in both Latin America and Asia-Pacific. We further expanded our presence in fast-growing emerging markets by the establishment of direct operations in Poland and Turkey on July 1.
Operating performance was strong with non-GAAP earnings per share at $0.85, marking a strong increase of 13.3% versus the result for Q2 of 2009, comfortably exceeding our expectations shared with the investment community at the end of April. The strong earnings growth was driven not only by good sales growth on a broad product front, but also by gross margin expansion in both Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals and consciously offset by a strong increase for R&D of 16.3% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis as we build the strength of our pipeline for the long term.
In the second quarter, we modestly increased our overall investment in direct-to-consumer advertising relative to Q2 of 2009, especially for RESTASIS. Since the last earnings call, we are pleased that we have achieved some notable regulatory approvals. BOTOX for the prophylactic of chronic migraine was approved in the U.K. The European Medicines Agency issued the license for OZURDEX for retinal vein occlusion, and the U.S. FDA approved ZYMAXID, our second-generation gatifloxacin. We furthermore strengthened our pipeline and our future urology portfolio by in-licensing Ser-120 for nocturia from Serenity Pharmaceuticals. Regarding the review of BOTOX for chronic migraine by the U.S. FDA, we have announced that the PDUFA date has been extended by three months as they complete their review of our file. In Europe, we filed BOTOX for chronic migraine with the European Medicines Agency through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. 
Now commenting the outlook for the remainder of 2010. We are pleased that we continue to make good progress relative to the expectations we provided at the end of Q1 as we have increased the bottom end of the sales range and maintained the top end of the range, even as we face the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar relative to other principal currencies and absorb pricing pressure in Europe. As we analyze growth in the second half of the year, it is clear that we face tougher comparisons versus the quarters in 2009, especially in the Cash Pay businesses. We estimate the impact of increased rebates and lowered prices in Europe at approximately $30 million for 2010 and an incremental number of $30 million for 2011. It is to be noted that we'd already anticipated a substantial number for price reductions in our 2010 operating plan as this is a regular occurrence, unfortunately, in Europe.
Regarding the expectations for EPS, we're making no changes as we absorb the aforementioned items. As we prepare for the costs of U.S. healthcare reform and now European pricing pressures, it is our intention to drive further efficiency and productivity programs across all areas of the company as a way to pay for as much as we can of these expenses.
Turning to the performance of the individual businesses. I'll commence with Ophthalmic Pharmaceuticals, which showed a strong pattern of growth, increasing 9.8% in dollars and 9.2% in local currencies. This Q2 growth number is in line with the overall global year-over-year market growth of 10% reported by IMS Global for Q1, the last quarter for which data is available. 
This is a commendable result, given that we're enduring the effect of the authorized generic of ALPHAGAN 0.15% and ACULAR generics in the United States. Our focus brands grew strongly expressed in local currency. RESTASIS increased a massive 26.8%. LUMIGAN, including GANFORT, by 12.4% with good performance from LUMIGAN and continued very significant growth from GANFORT. The ALPHAGAN family performs much better in Q2 relative to Q1, meaning year-over-year, declining only 0.2% with very strong growth with the newest brimonidine-containing products, that is ALPHAGAN 0.1% and COMBIGAN. Our strategy to defend the brimonidine franchise in the U.S. with ALPHAGAN 0.1% and COMBIGAN has continued to be successful. Seven months after launch of the authorized generic of 0.15%, we continue to hold more than 70% of the trailing prescriptions of all brimonidine-containing products.
Regarding the ketorolac franchise, ACUVAIL and branded ACULAR are enjoying just under 30% of the trailing prescriptions. In Europe, we are pleased with the progress of GANFORT, which is supported by a strong clinical data presented at the World  Ophthalmology Congress in Berlin in terms of its clinical efficacy relative to other prostaglandin or prostamide combinations with timolol. GANFORT was approved in Turkey. Uptick of LUMIGAN 0.01% is excellent with limited cannibalization of the original LUMIGAN, with launches in France and Denmark expanding the presence from either to Germany, U.K., other parts of Scandinavia and Holland. Regarding LUMIGAN 0.01%, we continue our efforts to bring the file to a successful conclusion with the U.S. FDA.
In the Artificial Tears segment, we're further extending our worldwide leadership as our growth clearly outstrips the market growth of 7%. OPTIVE was approved in Austria, Switzerland, Egypt and Singapore. Furthermore, OPTIVE unit dose was added to the list of reimbursed products in Australia. With the issue of the OZURDEX license in Europe, we are rapidly moving to launch the product in Germany and the U.K.
Moving on to BOTOX. The pickup in sales continues at a comfortable level to that seen in Q1 on a local currency basis. In Q2, year-over-year growth was 7.0% in dollars and 5.8% in local currencies, with lower growth in the U.S. due to new competition, being offset by double-digit sales increases across the broad group of foreign country markets. These are precisely the markets where we've been successfully dealing with multiple botulinum toxin competitors for many years. On a global basis, we estimate that BOTOX enjoyed 80% market share in Q1 in a market that grew 15% year-over-year worldwide.
In the U.S., after  upper limb spasticity FDA approval in March, we are observing an initial pickup in sales. Based on more than a decade of experience abroad, it takes time for new customers to learn how to inject BOTOX, for referral pathways to be developed and for doctors to integrate BOTOX into their spasticity clinics. We're also engaged in a national disease awareness campaign in cooperation with several patient groups, also supported with the well-known celebrity Henry Winkler acting as spokesperson. Impact to Dysport in the U.S. therapeutic market has been marginal. In Europe, given the states of government finances and funding pressures on national healthcare in many countries, we are pleased that the therapeutic market is growing double digit, and that BOTOX is almost holding its share as Xeomin enters several new countries.
Regarding the Aesthetic segment, we see the market growing double digit in all geographic regions. In the U.S., we estimate that year-over-year market growth accelerated from 9.5% in Q1 to 11% in Q2, even as the prior-year comparisons get tougher. Regarding Dysport market share, we believe that procedure share increased from 13% in Q1 to 18% in Q2, boosted by the so-called Love It or Leave It campaign, which is price-oriented. Since April, share gain has, however, been rather flat as we countered with various value coupons for patients across our whole product line.
Since May, we've also returned to category building with a print campaign called There's only one BOTOX. Regarding facial aesthetics, we're enjoying continuing very strong growth. In Q2, sales expanded 32.3% in dollars and 30.5% in local currencies, broadly at the same pace as in Q1. In Q1, we estimate that the market grew 24% year-over-year, with Allergan steadily gaining share in all regions of the world, except for Asia, where we only recently launched JUVÉDERM in several key markets and still have to secure approval in important markets such as Japan and China.
Worldwide, Allergan had, for the first time in Q1, the number one brand share in dermal fillers. The addition of lidocaine to JUVÉDERM has clearly improved patient experience and thereby, stimulated the market. TV and print advertising, both in the U.S. as well as in the U.K., France and Germany, coupled with PR campaigns, is building the market and leading to market share gains for us. The launch of VOLUMA in Canada and Australia is creating a new market segment for volumizing. JUVÉDERM XC and VOLUMA were recently launched in Mexico. Fortunately, we've just brought a new, more efficient production unit onstream at our sites in France to keep ahead of the surging demand.
For breast aesthetics, Q2 sales increased a strong 9.5% and 10.1% in local currencies, as all regions outside the U.S. grew strong double digit. Q2 growth relative to Q1 growth in local currencies was a little lower, impacted by the contractual effect of a buyback of inventory from our distributor in Australia as we prepare to go direct from September 1. In the U.S., we believe that we have observed the phenomenon of pent-up demand as we saw strong expansion in lower-cost salient products in the peak spring season, which is at the margin favored Mentor, as Mentor is relatively stronger than Allergan in the salient category. Pent-up demand has been unique to breast aesthetics versus our other aesthetic categories.
Regarding category analysis in Q1, we estimate that the market grew 19%, with Allergan growing in market at 17%. Regarding skin care, with most sales being in the U.S., sales increased year-over-year by 40.2% in dollars. ACZONE sales are growing very strongly as we gain share and given the small prior-year base. In-market sales growth of TAZORAC and AZELEX are modest. Year-over-year sales of LATISSE increased by 83.3% and increased sequentially from $18.8 million in Q1 to $23.9 million in Q2, in part thanks to a successful one-year anniversary promotion.
We're still rather encouraged by several insights from our battery of consumer and market research. Women love our product as it really works, which explains a very low discontinuation rate. Advertising and brand awareness is extremely high for a brand that has only been on the market for one and a half years. We still have only penetrated about a quarter of our facial aesthetics users, so a large opportunity remains ahead of us. Use of Claire Danes as a second spokeswoman, in addition to Brooke Shields, provides us a connection to an additional, younger-user audience.
On the negative side, it is apparent that women have, in practice, learned to extend the use of the product to an average consumption of two to three bottles a year. In addition, we have consumer brands and illegal product that make unsubstantiated claims as they seek to capitalize on the category that we are creating. Such indirect competition has occurred in many markets in the past. Over time, it becomes apparent which product really works for the long term and which claims are backed by clinical evidence.
Over the course of the year, we have plans underway to fine-tune our marketing and product mix. Our investment in TV and print will continue unabated. LATISSE was approved in Canada, and we'll launch later this year. 
Commenting urology. Sales of $15.6 million declined year-over-year 3.1%. On a year-to-date acquisition dollars basis, they are absolutely flat. With slowly improving shares in the urology specialty, we expect a modest improvement in performance during the remainder of the year. The next key event for this business, after securing FDA regulatory approval in 2011, is the launch of BOTOX for neurogenic overactive bladder. 
Finally, regarding the obesity intervention product area, sales declined 6.6% in dollars and 7.5% in local currencies. The decline in sales in the U.S. was offset by an increase in sales in foreign markets. Regarding the U.S., it is now clear that the overall gastric band market is lagging in the timing of market recovery and is correlated to unemployment and consumer confidence. This is explicable as the out-of-pocket expense is the highest compared to any other product in our portfolio. Based on our market research, the cash pay segment of the market has declined enormously, with the reimbursed segment remaining very stable. Within the overall bariatric market, we're encouraged that bands now have 50% share relative to gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. 
The share of LAP-BAND relative to Ethicon's REALIZE Band is now stable, with LAP-BAND share in May estimated at 74%. Outside the U.S., we had strong LAP-BAND performance in Canada and the U.K. and are pleased with the strong performance of our ORBERA Gastric Balloon in certain European markets, parts of Latin America and Australia. We're working to increase public awareness and recognition for gastric banding as a viable intervention tool, especially in the U.S. In order to address this goal for the long term, we filed LAP-BAND for a lower body mass index population with the FDA. 
I'd now like to pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will comment our financial performance and outlook for 2010."

During the second quarter of 2010, Allergan continued its positive trend and generated strong operating results.

During the second quarter of 2010, Allergan continued its positive trend and generated strong operating results. We experienced good performance across each of our geographic regions and benefited from double-digit sales growth in both our Pharmaceutical and Medical Device businesses. Allergan was again able to overachieve our sales and earnings per share expectations despite increasing headwinds in currency markets versus prior year and the ongoing generic impact to our ALPHAGAN P 0.15% and the ACULAR brands. The depth and breadth of our businesses, as well as our strong competitive positions within our specialty areas, have enabled Allergan to generate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of $0.85, coming in above the top end of our range of expectations and marking a 13.3% increase over 2009 results for the same quarter. 
As has been the case on a consistent basis in the past, this strong second quarter earnings performance was generated even as we continue to invest into the current and future growth drivers of the business. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in the earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustment and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q2 2010 gross margin of 84.5% increased 160 basis points when compared to prior year as Allergan saw strong improvement in its Pharmaceutical margins and very strong improvement in its Medical Device margins. This increase in gross margin was, again, driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs; favorable volume-based manufacturing variances; favorable inventory repricing, breasts being the biggest contributor, given our low-cost manufacturing base in Costa Rica; lower year-over-year inventory provisions; and lower royalty expense.
The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product mix sales ratio for the second quarter was 40.1% as compared to a comparable ratio of 42.3% in Q1 2010 totaling $495 million, an increase of approximately $61 million over the second quarter of 2009 as we continued to implement targeted investments to further stimulate the positive growth trends observed in our Pharmaceutical and Cash Pay Aesthetic businesses. We continue to believe that the economic recovery will be somewhat slow and gradual and as such, we'll maintain our commitment and focus to managing Allergan's cost structure wisely to limit waste and direct our capital to the highest yielding investments.
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 15.2% of product net sales for the quarter totaling $188 million, an increase in spend of approximately $26 million over the second quarter of 2009 and sequentially above the same level of spend for the first quarter of 2010 as we continue to fund new projects and invest into our promising Pharmaceutical and Medical Device pipelines. We anticipate that Allergan's quarterly investment into research and development will continue to increase on a sequential basis over the course of 2010.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's second quarter operating income ratio increased by 320 basis points sequentially over the first quarter of 2010. This positive trend was a result of Allergan's ongoing commitment to focus on enhancing operational efficiencies through improvement of the company's cost structure, while maximizing investment returns. With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 45 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 96 days. Each of these results represents improvements over prior-year Q2 results.
At the end of the second quarter, Allergan's cash and cash net of debt positions total to approximately $2.2 billion and $688 million, respectively. Allergan continued to maintain exceptional cash flow generation capabilities in the second quarter, with operating cash flow after-capital expenditures of approximately $321 million. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow after-capital expenditures total approximately $481 million, which compares to $422 million generated for the same period in 2009. These strong cash balances and broad access to liquidity allow Allergan to remain proactive with respect to our ongoing pursuit of strategic acquisitions and licensing opportunities. 
The first half of the year represented a strong beginning to 2010 for Allergan. As we move forward, Allergan's plan is to continue carefully monitoring each of our markets and manage business expenses and investment opportunities in an appropriate manner, with the goal of producing high-quality financial and operational results. Although we believe that markets have clearly stabilized and in many cases, shown signs of improvement, we understand that some continued caution is also prudent. 
For the third quarter of 2010, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,130,000,000 to $1,180,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.77. Regarding full year expectations for 2010, since our first quarter earnings call, when we last provided estimates for full year sales, we have achieved better-than-expected sales performance in both our Pharmaceutical and Medical Device businesses. 
During this same period, however, currency markets fluctuated, somewhat offsetting this improved business performance and creating an approximate $50 million headwind versus our thinking at the time. Taking into account the better-than-expected sales trends observed in the second quarter and the impact of negative foreign exchange movements, as well as some pricing pressures within the European markets, we are adjusting our full year sales expectations to between $4,620,000,000 and $4,750,000,000. Please note that we have raised the bottom end of our full year sales expectation and in spite of the currency and pricing pressures, have maintained the top end of our full year sales expectations provided on our previous earnings call.
Allergan's expectations for full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share remains unchanged between $3.11 and $3.15, which represents growth of between 12% and 13%. As a reminder, these expectations assume that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter for this year, with full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 results. For your information, expectation for other lines of income statement and specific product sales expectations are included with our earnings release. 
We are pleased with the strong operating performance achieved in the second quarter across our broad base of business and geographic regions. We will strive to continue to build on this momentum and effectively execute against our business strategies, further strengthening Allergan as a leader in our selected medical specialty markets. 
With that, operator, I'd like now to open the call to questions."

So we can basically offer, if you like, value coupons on one product linking to others because clearly, there's a real benefit from consumers if, say, they start with BOTOX, they can then go to fillers next or in reverse. And as I stated on my LATISSE commentary, still, if we use BOTOX as the kind of the gold standard, the first product that created the medical aesthetics category, only 25% of Botox users use LATISSE. So as a marketing person, I see that as a huge upside. It's just a question of how do we specifically talk to those people to bring them into the category.

And so given also what I said on spasticity, this isn't the kind of category where you make product available day one and people in masks start injecting day two or three. It's just not like that. You need to go out and train people appropriately, and then they have to start incorporating the product into their practice. So analogous to what I said on spasticity headache in terms of new users, new doctors will be relatively slow. Although one would imagine there will be a lot written in the press, given the huge interest and the huge unmet medical need in this condition. So that kind of covers the issue of revenue, very modest if we look at the United States. U.K., not the biggest market in the world, but not the smallest either. In terms of costs, we are very pleased with the structure we have in the United States, so in terms of sales force, it's there. Obviously, we need to spend some more money to increase awareness of the treatment, and also we need to spend money on training. In Europe, they're slightly different in that our base therapeutic sales force was smaller. Therefore, we need to expand it on a percentage basis slightly more. But at the end of the day, these are not numbers that will be visible through our SG&A spending worldwide. When we have such a base of spending hypothetically, it's not the right number. But if it was $10 million, you wouldn't really notice it."

I'm rather pleased, as I covered in my opening remarks, that despite, for the first time really in 12 years, having to face generics, growing almost in line with the worldwide market of ophthalmology is pretty good while we have to go through that, let's call it, the 12-month phenomenon of post-launch of the generic where you unfortunately get really pushed down, and then it kind of laps itself out, and then you can start recovering off that lower base, so pretty pleased with that. Really, as one could well imagine, the U.S. is growing a little bit thanks to RESTASIS, which is growing like a freight train and then a lot of good growth overseas. Answering your second question, with the prospect for generic latanoprost or generic sort of Xalatan from March, April of next year, we've done a lot of work on this, and the more we do, we can't say there'll be a zero effect on LUMIGAN, but we think it's going to be relatively marginal. So we took [ph] (44:05) rather confident with that given our managed care team isn't just looking at the ceiling. They're out there talking to all the customers on a very, very consistent basis and also are in the process of negotiating the contracts for 2011 already. Second question you had was on SG&A. I certainly pointed to us looking for ways to offset European pricing pressures and the cost of U.S. health care reform, and that goes right across the company whether it's greater efficiency in R&D where we have some really good programs in place that when I see those trends, I don't need to be an optimist to believe it will continue, same coming back to sales and marketing. I think we have very good deployment models. Really, where we're adding people is in particular the emerging markets. That has the greatest rate of increase and then very much at the margin, say, in Europe, where I referenced modest increase in the number of representatives for migraine. And clearly, we need to add some and have already started for the launch of OZURDEX for retina, a highly specialized area with various specialized people. So I would certainly, in conclusion, say that we will look to further fine-tuning SG&A, which is really all about the S part, selling and marketing, and it is our absolute goal in the next couple of years to start bringing down that ratio as we've said for a long time and then marginally increase in percentage R&D because it's all about growing, well, creating the pipeline for the long term."

First of all, clearly, this is a very severely impacted populations, so huge medical need, which any medical director of a managed care organization would recognize, so clearly, need. Second, let's call it just pure economics. Managed care knows that this very severe population frequently end up in the emergency room, and a visit probably costs somewhere between $4,000 and $5,000. So if they can avoid just one emergency room visit, they've already played the Monopoly game in terms of passing go and collecting money. So I think in all our contracts with managed care, they realize there's a real economic benefit from avoidance of emergency room visits. And then thirdly is the issue of drug sparing where a few years ago, the math was a little simpler because at that time, TOPAMAX was not generic. None of the triptanes were generic. So now it gets more complicated to do the math. Are we talking of sparing a generic drug or sparing of a high-cost innovator drug? But still, you can look through averages and realize that there is money to be saved there. So net-net, I would say, Corey, managed care will actually be interested in this even from an economic point of view. Therefore, I do not see any major blockages being put in because, clearly, people that have 15 headache days per month in their history, they have a whole medical file. And it's quite clear, people who are milder can be weeded out very quickly for being inappropriate."

And then second maybe for David, have your thoughts on the long-term potential of LATISSE changed at all?"

Number one, there's still some uncertainty out there with respect to the economy. I made comments during my talk about some improvement, some stability, albeit limited, so we're watching over that with great care. If you think about Europe and Europe pricing, of course, that's something we've chatted about as well. And then you've seen the dollar strengthening that, of course, has some rather substantial impact on us. We're going to manage that. Certainly, on the top line, we talked about our guidance there, and obviously, we're well aware of how it'll impact our bottom line. So those are really the three principal drivers to our decision to hold guidance as is."

I think you can probably tell from my script and my remarks that I think the biggest single driver is women discovering how to use the product more sparingly. Certainly, the practice is quite different than what is in the clinical study and the label. So the good and bad news about that is that it's much cheaper for consumers than they initially thought, and I'm sure physicians by now have worked that out as well, and so it's more accessible. The bad news is in the short term, we now need more ladies to get to the same $100 million or $140 million number that we originally planned. I think then when you look around the world, of course, there's lots of different regulatory situations in different markets. As I reflect upon LATISSE, it's like so many other things I've done in my career. When you create a new category, at the beginning, you think you know a lot, and then you discover all the things you didn't know. This is the great journey of creating a market. But the good news is the product really works. Women really like long eyelashes, and so we just have to keep working and discovering what the answers are to various matters and just keep building this category, and it will be a very major product in Allergan's portfolio."

We're about to start new ones and, of course, that was in the depth of the recession. And Scott and I, we're being very careful not to get ahead of ourselves in the early part of the year. And by the time, June, July came along of 2009, then saying to Scott, okay, now, really start spending quickly. R&D isn't like that. It takes three, four, five, six months to really start spending in an intelligent meaningful way. Now coming back around on obesity, I'm absolutely convinced that there's enormous amount of positive work to be done for LAP-BAND. As I commented, the market of course has been fragile for the last two years. I think it's a matter of waiting and preparing just as the market starts to recover. You should see us really stepping up our efforts, both through public awareness campaigns. I think an awful lot of work has to be done with employers and payers. We have a great data in terms of health economics. You commented indirect competition. I'm personally very skeptical about drugs for obesity. The hurdle for approval is extremely high as you've seen on many different occasions, not just with FDA but also the European agencies. Unfortunately, even once approved, many of these drugs have some quite awkward side effects in terms of people's ability to tolerate them. Then the next sort of chapter would be further innovation from us. Obviously, we'll look to continuing improving LAP-BAND over time, but then we have the ORBERA Gastric Balloon that I commented. And then we also look at other intragastric devices: when might they come to market, what is interesting, and we track all of those technologies very carefully, deciding whether we'd want to purchase them or license them or distribute them. But they must -- it depends on what it is and what the economics might be."

Thank you, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. With a series of important R&D approvals in 2010  both by the FDA and regulatory agencies around the world, a gradual recovery of most major economies favorably impacting our cash-pay Aesthetics businesses and the worst of the impact of generics on our U.S. Ophthalmology business behind us, we're well-positioned for driving strong growth for several years ahead. This puts us in a unique position in our industry to address the impact of incremental full year costs of U.S. healthcare reform and European price cuts and/or increased rebates, which we commented earlier in the year and now estimate at approximately an incremental $100 million for 2011. We're working diligently to absorb these costs. However, this pressure should be carefully considered when considering the earnings power of our business.
Now reviewing the results of the third quarter. Sales increased versus the third quarter of 2009 by 6.3% in local currencies, by 5.7% in U.S. dollars. Our more economically sensitive cash-pay businesses continued on the same track of growth as earlier in the year. Around the world we have not observed any negative growth trends across the quarter even in the U.K. or in the challenged major economies of the eurozone, and we continued to enjoy strong upswings in Latin America and Asia. 
Operating performance was strong, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.78, marking an 11.4% increase versus the third quarter of last year and exceeding our expectations provided in early August. Since then, we announced our settlement with the Department of Justice and also an impairment charge regarding the SANCTURA assets, which led to a GAAP loss of $670.5 million for the quarter. We're glad that we reached a resolution with the government, have this matter behind us and have entered into a five-year corporate integrity agreement. 
The strong non-GAAP earnings growth was driven by good sales growth across the diversified range of products, as well as by a continued gross margin expansion in both the Medical Device and Pharmaceutical lines, and consciously offset by a large increase for R&D of 6.3% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis as we build the strength of our pipeline for the long term. In Q3, we spent less for direct-to-consumer advertising than in the prior year, but they're about the same level of investment year-to-date as in the prior year. 
Since the last earnings call, we have secured some very important regulatory approvals, notably, BOTOX for the prophylaxis of chronic migraine by the U.S. FDA, following the earlier approvals in the U.K., as well as in Estonia and Slovakia. FDA approved LUMIGAN .01% as the first line glaucoma therapy. Health Canada approved RESTASIS, so now our efforts are next directed to making this unique product for therapeutic dry eye available also in Europe. FDA granted the second indication for OZURDEX namely for uveitis. 
On October 27, the Japanese MHLW approved BOTOX for upper and lower limb spasticity. Furthermore, we earned licensed worldwide rights for an ophthalmic allergy product, Vlastikast [ph] [7:44] from VISTAKON, a division of Johnson & Johnson, which is approved by FDA at the end of July. This will enable us to firstly, to reenter the U.S. allergy market just before we expect the arrival of generics of ELESTAT and effectively maintain a competitive position in the significant allergy segment of the worldwide ophthalmics market. Vlastikast [ph] [8:08] as a highly competitive label, indicated QD [ph] for the prevention of itch with a rapid onset of action and program to last all through the day up to 16 hours.
Considering the rapidly expanding retina market, we are clearly focusing all our efforts on OZURDEX and hence took the decision not to commercialize TRIVARIS and have written off the manufacturing asset for $10.6 million. 
Concerning our cooperation with Serenity with their there Nocturnal En [Enurensis] product, Ser-120, the Phase III trials have been completed. The conclusion is that these trials are not sufficient for successful registration. Allergan and Serenity and the process of reviewing the complete trial data to determine what additional trials are indicated to support the development of the program.
Regarding LAP-BAND, we're preparing for U.S. FDA panel in early December regarding a lower body mass index indication.  Given the poor track record of weight-loss drugs, we're anxious to receive approval to extend LAP-BAND to a broader patient population, given the obesity epidemic. 
Finally, we are pleased that we have filed BOTOX for neurogenic detrusor overactivity resulting from overactive bladder or sometimes known as spastic bladder with the FDA. We are confident that urology should be the next major BOTOX franchise.
Regarding BOTOX for chronic migraine, our task is not to extend approvals around the world. We have filed with the European Medicines Agency through the mutual recognition procedure and have also submitted dossiers in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Brazil and a few other Latin American countries. 
Turning to the performance of the individual businesses, I'll commence with Ophthalmic Pharmaceuticals, which showed a continuing good pattern of growth, increasing 7.1% in local currencies and 6.3% in dollars versus the third quarter of 2009.
This Q3 growth number for Allergan, although lower than the 11% worldwide market growth number, reported by IMS Global for Q2, the last quarter for which data is available, is in line with global market growth, excluding the Retina segment. The weak sales are in the U.S. where we are impacted by the authorized generic of off a gun .15% and generics of ACULAR. 
Outside the U.S., all operating regions are growing double-digit, with particularly impressive growth in Asia and Europe. Our focused brands grew strongly thanks, to local currencies. RESTASIS which is mainly U.S. continued very strong put of 23.6%. The LUMIGAN franchise, including GANFORT grew by 19.1%. The ALPHAGAN franchise declined by 4.1% due to the impact of generics in the U.S. and to some extent, Europe, offset by great growth by COMBIGAN. In the U.S., the overall branded market has been affected by generics with STI, [ph] reporting only 1.6% growth in acquisition dollars year-to-date August.
On the other hand, generics are growing 1.3% in acquisition dollars. 
At Allergan, we're prepared well for the arrival of generics. With the rapid growth of ALPHAGAN P 0.1% and COMBIGAN, we have maintained consistently more than 70% of the trailing prescriptions of all bermonadine-containing products [ph]. With the launch of ZYMAXID, we have already converted 43% of the trailing prescriptions in just over four months, and regarding ketorolac, we have kept about 20% of the trailing prescriptions with ACUVAIL. In latter's case [ph], the time between launch of an improved product and multiple generics was too short to save higher share, given inadequate reimbursement. Building on a recent acceleration of LUMIGAN strips, we're excited that we we're able to launch LUMIGAN 0.01% just before the American Academy of Ophthalmology. This product, with comparable efficacy to the original LUMIGAN, but with dramatically lower hyperemia and discontinuation rates, is already enjoying great share gains in Europe and Canada.
Regarding managed-care reimbursement for the LUMIGAN products, we expect similar tiers and coverage in 2011 as in 2010. For RESTASIS, we have plotted a new TV commercial, which is scoring highly with patients regarding awareness and consideration of RESTASIS. In Canada, we started shipping RESTASIS at the end of September and assess this as a major opportunity. LUMIGAN 0.01% with recent additions to provincial formulas in Canada is now reimbursed for 84% of public lines. In Europe, we are enjoying very strong sales growth due to the launch of LUMIGAN 0.01%, which is now available in Germany, the U.K., Sweden, France and Spain, with prescriptions being additive to the original LUMIGAN. 
Generics of Xalatan are now available in Italy and Spain. GANFORT is also enjoying rapid expansion and was recently launched in Turkey. OZURDEX is off to a fast start in Germany and is now also available in the U.K., Ireland, Sweden and Denmark. Overall European sales are furthermore being boosted by the direct sales in Turkey and Poland. 
In Latin America, strong growth is being driven by COMBIGAN, GANFORT, Relestat and OPTIVE. We recently launched a high-potential local product in Brazil, Zypred, a fix combo of ZYMAR and prednisolone. In Asia, high growth is being driven in the rapidly expanding markets in India and Korea, as well as markets in Southeast Asia. In Australia, ALPHAGAN P is now on the national reimburse list called PBS.
Moving on to BOTOX. I will first comment the significance of the FDA chronic migraine approval before commenting performance. Obviously, we're both delighted by the final approval after a long development process and also by the timing of the approval shortly before the American Headache Society meeting at the middle of November. In terms of sales force deployment, the timing is also ideal as we just finished our five-year commitment to GlaxoSmithKline in late September for a co-promoting Amerge and Imitrex STATdose to neurologists. This salesforce capacity has been transitioned to detail BOTOX for chronic migraine to a customer base who we've already been visiting specifically for GSK.
Once again, Allergan is poised to address and create a new market, given the substantial burden of this condition affecting 3.2 million Americans. We'll be alone in this task, as BOTOX is the only focal solution for the prophylaxis of chronic migraine and the only prophylactic solution being actively promoted after the generizisation of TOPAMAX. As has always been the experience with BOTOX therapeutic indications, injector training and product adoption takes time, speeded or slowed by reimbursement conditions.
Given our estimated small existing sales base of BOTOX, either to offer cure with migraine, there's some limited reimbursement by private payers. Just over 10% of private lines and of course, the company with substantial step added, now securing reimbursement and establishing injective fee payment schedules is our next priority in parallel with injector training.
Moving on to comment the BOTOX performance in the quarter. Q3 sales increased versus the same period in 2009 by 4.5% to local currencies and by 4.2% in dollars. Overall, BOTOX Cosmetic and therapeutic combined sales were flat in the U.S., with therapeutic growth being offset by modest sales declines in Aesthetics with Medicis establishing a presence in the market with Dysport and [indiscernible] with Dysport for cervical dystonia. The latter with minimal market share gains.
Outside the U.S., BOTOX is enjoying double-digit growth, precisely in those markets where we are successfully competing with multiple competitors. On a global basis, we estimate in Q2, the last few days for which we have market data, that BOTOX enjoyed 80% market share in a market that grew 10% year-over-year. In the U.S., the gradual pickup of upper limbs spasticity is in accordance with our expectations, as new injectors are trained and referral pathways are established. Regarding the U.S. aesthetics market, we estimate that the market in Q3 is growing double-digit in procedures and that Dysport share appears to be very flat since April with an estimated market share of 16% to procedures in September.
As Dysport is sold at a discount, then it's also something heavily, we estimate that BOTOX still enjoyed a 91% value of share in Q2. Our print campaign for BOTOX called, There's only one BOTOX has been running since May. In Europe, we're pleased that we're only marginally losing market share in a strongly expanding market as Galderma enters the market with Azzalure, and Merz with Xeomin and [indiscernible]. 
Markets In Latin America and Asia are blend, and BOTOX is performing strongly. Regarding facial aesthetics, sales continued to grow very  strongly at 28.1% in local currencies and at 27.6% in dollars, with Allergan growing at 20% or higher in all operating regions and gaining large amounts of share in all regions of the world. Only in those Asian countries where we do not yet have product approvals such as China and Japan are we lagging behind. We have clearly established the JUVÉDERM family as the number one global brand and are further building on its premium value proposition lidocaine-containing products and VOLUMA accounting for an increased part of the mix.
In the facial aesthetics market, Allergan has the ability to act as the locomotive as we can build upon our physician presence with BOTOX to expand our physician customer's procedural offerings through physician training and education to full facial concept. In addition, the recent innovations of lidocaine in volumizing, as well as hydrating formulations have further expanded the attraction of these products to both doctors and their patients. We've invested in JUVÉDERM-branded campaigns in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., France and Germany, as well as in integrated PR campaigns.
Regarding skin care, with most sales being in the U.S., Q3 sales decreased 2.4% in dollars year-over-year. But this sales of $21.7 million were 2.9% lower than in the third quarter of 2009, with inventory builds in a rapidly growing base of prescribers boosting sales in the prior year. Sales were also sequentially lower than the $23.9 million in Q2, although this may be due to summer seasonality which we still cannot accurately assess as we're only two years into the product introduction.
In Canada, we have fulfilled all regulatory requirements and are launching LATISSE for the next few weeks. As our market research shows, high levels of product satisfaction with the product and high levels of patient retention with various to first-time adoption, given cheaper OTC alternatives. For this reason, we're investing in major customer sampling activities in Q4. Obviously, samples affect short-term sales, which is one reason why we have guided to the lower end of our previous full-year range for sales. 
One of the most significant campaigns running from early October to mid-December is a $100 rebate in cash for LATISSE after receiving a BOTOX Cosmetic or JUVÉDERM treatment. Regarding x factory sales of the medical dermatology product within this segment, ACZONE decreased marginally and TAZORAC increased marginally. This was caused by inventory changes, rebates and patient coupons. The more reliable measure would be a market acquisition dollars reported by FDI Bonin [ph]. ACZONE sales increased year-over-year in Q3 by 22.9%, with ACZONE hitting a new market share high in August and TAZORAC growing by 15.7%. 
For breast aesthetics, Q3 sales increased 10.3% in local currencies and 8.6% in dollars. We enjoyed a strong rebound in the U.S., offset by a weak x factory sales overseas. This was a factor of inventory adjustments with distributors in the current year, while market disruptions in markets such as Australia, Mexico and Korea caused in the prior year in advance of changing from a distributor to direct sales model and also changing sourcing to Costa Rica. Hence, the weak overseas sales growth does not reflect any weakness in end market demand. we believe that we have gained some market share in the quarter, both in the U.S., in the augmentation and tissue expansion [ph] categories and internationally. The U.S. and Canadian markets are continuing to adopt the higher cost silicon gel products. We're also continuing to innovate, with the worldwide launch of resterilizable sizers as well as the MAGNA-FINDER device for our tissue expander line. We estimate that the worldwide breast aesthetics market grew 9% in Q2 year-over-year.
Commenting urology, Q3 sales increased 17.6%, a catch-up from the weak Q2 x factory sales with year-to-date sales declining 3.9%. Looking through minor changes in inventory and rebates, acquisition dollars sales increased year-to-date 2.1% with original SANCTURA sales declining 17.1% after the somewhat earlier-than-expected launch of trospium chloride generics at the beginning of September and growth of 6.5% for SANCTURA XR.
Due to lack of performance, primarily in the general practitioner channel, we've terminated our co-promotion agreement with NovaQuest [ph]. Consequently, we have reduced our outlook for sales in the remainder of the year. Now we're awaiting the approval of BOTOX for neurogenic detrusor overactivity towards the end of 2011 to build this business.
Finally, regarding the Obesity Intervention segment, sales declined 8.2% to local currencies and 8.1% in dollars. The decline in U.S. sales was offset by an increase in sales in foreign markets. In the U.S., given high out-of-pocket costs for non-reimbursed LAP-BAND procedures and also high co-pays for reimbursed surgeries, it appears that the bariatric market was correlated with the level of unemployment. Our cash-pay market has continued to decline rapidly during the course of 2010 and now only accounts for about 10% of the brand. Year-to-date for the Reimbursed segment, we estimate that the overall bariatric market declined 7%, with the band market declining 4%. With an estimated 71% share of the band market for the LAP-BAND, we're now at the point where our year-over-year change in share should be minimal going forward, given a stable market share situation in 2010. Outside the U.S., we have had good growth of LAP-BAND and Albara [ph] sales in most markets in Europe, as well as in Canada and parts of Latin America. We recently launched a rapid port supplier, which has eliminated are the sole weakness of our product offering relative to competition. I would now like to pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will provide detailed comments on our financial performance."

During the third quarter of 2010, Allergan generated strong operating results as we experienced good performance across each of our geographic regions. Allergan was again able to overachieve our",1004,"Thanks, David, and good morning, to all of you on the call. During the third quarter of 2010, Allergan generated strong operating results as we experienced good performance across each of our geographic regions. Allergan was again able to overachieve our sales and earnings per share expectation, despite headwinds relating to Europe, pricing pressures, U.S. healthcare reform and the ongoing generic impact to our ALPHAGAN P 0.15% in ACULAR brands. 
Allergan's strong competitive positions across the globe within each of our specialty areas of concentration, along with the quality of and the breadth of our product portfolio, have enabled the company to generate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.78, coming in above the top end of our range of expectations and marking an 11.4% increase over 2009 results for the same quarter. Consistent with prior periods, while producing this quality performance, the company continues to invest into the current and future growth drivers of the business. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q3 2010 gross margin of 85.1% increased 170 basis points when compared to Q3 2009, and Allergan saw a sequential improvement in both its Pharmaceutical and Medical Device margins. This continuing positive gross margin trend has been driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs, with the biggest contribution coming from our breast product line, given our recent change over to a lower-cost manufacturing base in Costa Rica, favorable volume-based manufacturing variances, lower year-over-year inventory provisions and lower royalty expense. The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the third quarter was 39.5%, totaling $470 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2009 were 41.7% and $470 million, respectively. We continue to work diligently to offset the cost of healthcare reforms and impact of rising rebate structure in the U.S., as well as pricing reductions in Europe and therefore, managing Allergan's cost structure in a very thoughtful manner and considering other potential structural changes to our business model. Likewise, consistent with our plan and comments to the investment community, we are recognizing the benefits of leverage in many of our businesses. Our ongoing focus is to direct our investments to the highest yielding products, which have been appropriately risk-adjusted for economic risks and traditional market and execution risks. 
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.3% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $194 million, an increase in spend of approximately $27 million over the third quarter of 2009 and sequentially above the level of spend in the second quarter of 2010 as we continue to fund new projects and invest in our productive and promising Pharmaceutical and Medical Device pipelines. 
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's third quarter operating income ratio increased by 250 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2009. The company's disciplined and selective approach centered on maximizing return while maintaining appropriate future-focused investments has enabled the company to generate this improvement to operating margin performance.
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 45 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 113 days. Allergan continued to maintain exceptional cash flow generation capabilities in the third quarter with operating cash flow after CapEx of approximately $289 million. 
On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow after CapEx totaled approximately $771 million, which compares to $741 million generated in the same period in 2009. At the end of the third quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments and cash and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $3.1 billion and $902 million, respectively. In addition to the contribution of this cash balance from the company's strong cash flow produced during the quarter, Allergan's liquidity position was further strengthened by our issuance of a 10-year note in the amount of $650 million, with the coupon of 3.375 and effective rate of 3.41%. This note was issued to address the potential retiring of our convertible debt, which is puttable and callable in April of 2011. Although, this financing will result in a duplicate interest expense of approximately $5.5 million in our fourth quarter, we believe that the market conditions were ideal and chose to pursue it, realizing that it was the right long-term action and that the company would have to cover the additional cost of this interest expense. It is also worth noting that following the close of the quarter, the company made payments to the DOJ totaling approximately $590 million.
For the fourth quarter of 2010, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,220,000,000 to $1,270,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.88. As a reminder, these expectations assume that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2010, with full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 2010 results. We assume that the renewal of this R&D tax credit has a value of approximately $0.05 of earnings per share. Regarding full year expectations for 2010, we are adjusting our full-year sales expectation to between $4,750,000,000 and $4,800,000,000 and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to between $3.14 and $3.16, which represents growth of between 13% and 14%. For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release.
Our solid results during the third quarter demonstrate the depth and breadth of Allergan's diversified lines of business. Allergan very much prides itself on the disciplined approach taken with respect to how our dollars are spent and what kind of investment returns are required to justify this spending. We will continue to strive towards building on our momentum and effectively executing against our business strategies, further strengthening Allergan as a leader in our selected specialty markets. So with that, operator, I'd like now to open the call to questions."

Of course, I was trying to put that in the context of otherwise, a very favorable position in which we find ourselves. I think another thing that I'd ask you to think about is also our long-term commitment to R&D. I've been very clear over the years that Allergan's performance is all about the long term. And of course, in our case, we're rather pleased that our historic investments in R&D have really well paid off, and just look at the enormous number of approvals. When Scott Whitcup and I talk about this, of course, we're very pleased in all that's been achieved. And of course, it's our job now, if you'd like, to reload the canon, because we're, speaking of Head of R&D and the CEO, we're asking ourselves, what are the products that we're going to be talking about that are going to hopefully just prior to filing, call it 2014, 2015.

That was of the order of $20 million and the exact numbers are there. And of course, in our press release, we set out how much we expended for Turkey. Happily, most of our contracts of more recent vintage are very carefully awarded, so that we have the ability to reacquire distribution rights effectively free of charge with an appropriate notice period. And that indeed was the case for Poland, where we absolutely spent zero. And our partner there has done a great job for us. And in fact, they are now representative beyond Poland, in places like the Ukraine, most of the ex, I'll call them Soviet Republic, using historical term, and even parts of Southern Europe. So they are kind of master distributor arrangement. So net-net, what does that all mean? It means going forward, there should be very little money spent on any of the markets, where we choose to go direct, where we see sufficient economies of scale. Now answering your second question on SG&A, clearly, there is an increasing emphasis on spend x U.S. because in almost all of our businesses, we see higher growth rates outside the United States.

In my opening remarks, I tried to set out what is the starting position, and of course, this has always been the case of BOTOX, where physicians are just ahead of us, it takes us years to catch up on what they are establishing in reality. With an off-label indication. And then of course, our job is to get the product approved on label. I also would like to reemphasize once again, that we assiduously avoid any off-label promotion. That's why I set out the fact that there is a small base that exists and about low teens kind of percentage for project insurers covering BOTOX for really severe migraines. Clearly, Managed Care is going to look at con-combatant use of medications, which will be approved to show that, indeed, patients really do have 15 or more migraine days as a baseline to be considered for the use of this product as a prophylaxis. If we look at timing, there's really two parallel tracks. One is the training of physicians because despite sometimes a lot of enthusiasm by various lectures on BOTOX, there aren't that number of doctors who actually use the product. It is a very much concentrated base of people who are the avant-garde. But we have to go through the normal cycle that we know very well from every single therapeutic indication going all the way back cervical dystonia, and that typically takes 6-plus months in terms of assessing people's interest, getting them to attend training courses, and then the real moment of truth is actually putting their thumb on the syringe and injecting on real life appropriate patients. On the other side, we have reimbursement and that will take a minimum of six months, really more 12 months plus when we look at getting final j codes [ph]. That takes a long, long time and indeed, I'm sure will be operating with temporary J. codes [ph] in interim period. Finally, another major step is just getting established what will be injector fees. So obviously, the cost of our product is well known. You know the cost per vial. The FDA has made life simple for all of us by coming yup with a fixed dose, 155 units. And of course, we're assuming it will just be over close to four treatment sessions per year, just because the label says three months, but we know from practice, as everybody absolutely as regular clock work through the day, well of course not, there's always scheduling problems. So cost of drug is very well known. And now we've got to get very well established with both private insurers and Medicare carriers what should the injection fee be."

There are not so many assets available, I don't know whether this is good or bad, you can take it both ways. Fortunately, the U.S. market is the one that is most transparent, where most technology is available and where markets are transparent, i.e., there are assets that won't comprise and can actually become available. Finding such things in Europe is quite difficult. I think it's due to the history of European companies being really forced into nonspecialist markets. You can think of lots of examples of that, which makes those companies somewhat uninteresting to a company like Allergan. So we will scour the earth, so to speak, whether it be the early-stage assets, you've seen us enter into both purchases, licenses, partnerships or earlier stage assets, and I'm sure we will continue to do that. In terms of therapeutic areas, obviously, we like the areas we're in. But we do look across all over the garden fence to say could there be an adjacent area where, by definition, it has to be specialist. If it's not a limited number of physicians, then we're really not interested because then, our model of very close connectivity with our customer base would no longer apply. Obviously, to the degree there could be some synergies back to our existing products would make it even more interesting. And next answer, if we do go over the fence, it'll be in a very limited way. I can't imagine if we'll ever end up having a dozen specialty areas. That just gets too complicated."

With a series of important R&D approvals in 2010 both by the FDA and regulatory agencies around the world, a gradual recovery of most major economies favorably impacting our cash-pay Aesthetics businesse",2853,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. With a series of important R&D approvals in 2010 both by the FDA and regulatory agencies around the world, a gradual recovery of most major economies favorably impacting our cash-pay Aesthetics businesses and the worst of the impact of generics on our U.S. Ophthalmology business behind us, we're well-positioned for driving strong growth for several years ahead. This puts us in a unique position in our industry to address the impact of incremental full year costs of U.S. healthcare reform and European price cuts and/or increased rebates, which we commented earlier in the year and now estimate at approximately an incremental $100 million for 2011. We're working diligently to absorb these costs. However, these pressures should be carefully considered when considering the earnings power of our business.
Now reviewing the results of the third quarter. Sales increased versus the third quarter of 2009 by 6.3% in local currencies, by 5.7% in U.S. dollars. Our more economically sensitive cash-pay businesses continued on the same track of growth as earlier in the year. Around the world we have not observed any negative growth trends across the quarter even in the U.K. or in the challenged major economies of the eurozone, and we continued to enjoy strong upswings in Latin America and Asia.
Operating performance was strong, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.78, marking an 11.4% increase versus the third quarter of last year and exceeding our expectations provided in early August. Since then, we announced our settlement with the Department of Justice and also an impairment charge regarding the SANCTURA assets, which led to a GAAP loss of $670.5 million for the quarter. We're glad that we reached a resolution with the government, have this matter behind us and have entered into a five-year corporate integrity agreement.
The strong non-GAAP earnings growth was driven by good sales growth across the diversified range of products, as well as by a continued gross margin expansion in both the Medical Device and Pharmaceutical lines, and consciously offset by a large increase for R&D of 6.3% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis as we build the strength of our pipeline for the long term. In Q3, we spent less for direct-to-consumer advertising than in the prior year, but they're about the same level of investment year-to-date as in the prior year.
Since the last earnings call, we have secured some very important regulatory approvals, notably, BOTOX for the prophylaxis of chronic migraine by the U.S. FDA, following the earlier approvals in the U.K., as well as in Estonia and Slovakia. FDA approved LUMIGAN .01% as the first line glaucoma therapy. Health Canada approved RESTASIS, so now our efforts are next directed to making this unique product for therapeutic dry eye available also in Europe. FDA granted the second indication for OZURDEX namely for uveitis [ph].
On October 27, the Japanese MHLW approved BOTOX for upper and lower limb spasticity. Furthermore, we earned licensed worldwide rights for an ophthalmic allergy product, Vlastikast [ph] [7:44] from VISTAKON, a division of Johnson & Johnson, which is approved by FDA at the end of July. This will enable us to firstly, to reenter the U.S. allergy market just before we expect the arrival of generics of ELESTAT and effectively maintain a competitive position in the significant allergy segment of the worldwide ophthalmics market. Vlastikast [ph] [8:08] as a highly competitive label, indicated QD [ph] for the prevention of itch with a rapid onset of action and program to last all through the day up to 16 hours.
Considering the rapidly expanding retina market, we are clearly focusing all our efforts on OZURDEX and hence took the decision not to commercialize TRIVARIS and have written off the manufacturing asset for $10.6 million.
Concerning our cooperation with Serenity with their Nocturnal product, Ser-120, the Phase III trials have been completed. The conclusion is that these trials are not sufficient for successful registration. Allergan and Serenity are in the process of reviewing the complete trial data to determine what additional trials are indicated to support the development of the program.
Regarding LAP-BAND, we're preparing for U.S. FDA panel in early December regarding a lower body mass index indication.  Given the poor track record of weight-loss drugs, we're anxious to receive approval to extend LAP-BAND to a broader patient population, given the obesity epidemic.
Finally, we are pleased that we have filed BOTOX for neurogenic detrusor overactivity resulting from overactive bladder or sometimes known as spastic bladder with the FDA. We are confident that urology should be the next major BOTOX franchise.
Regarding BOTOX for chronic migraine, our task is not to extend approvals around the world. We have filed with the European Medicines Agency through the mutual recognition procedure and have also submitted dossiers in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Brazil and a few other Latin American countries.
Turning to the performance of the individual businesses, I'll commence with Ophthalmic Pharmaceuticals, which showed a continuing good pattern of growth, increasing 7.1% in local currencies and 6.3% in dollars versus the third quarter of 2009.
This Q3 growth number for Allergan, although lower than the 11% worldwide market growth number, reported by IMS Global for Q2, the last quarter for which data is available, is in line with global market growth, excluding the Retina segment. The weak sales are in the U.S. where we are impacted by the authorized generic of off a gun .15% and generics of ACULAR.
Outside the U.S., all operating regions are growing double-digit, with particularly impressive growth in Asia and Europe. Our focused brands grew strongly expressed in local currencies. RESTASIS which is mainly U.S. continued very strong put of 23.6%. The LUMIGAN franchise, including GANFORT grew by 19.1%. The ALPHAGAN franchise declined by 4.1% due to the impact of generics in the U.S. and to some extent, Europe, offset by great growth by COMBIGAN. In the U.S., the overall branded market has been affected by generics with STI, [ph] reporting only 1.6% growth in acquisition dollars year-to-date August. On the other hand, generics are growing 1.3% in acquisition dollars.
At Allergan, we're prepared well for the arrival of generics. With the rapid growth of ALPHAGAN P 0.1% and COMBIGAN, we have maintained consistently more than 70% of the trailing prescriptions of all brimonidine-containing products. With the launch of ZYMAXID, we have already converted 43% of the trailing prescriptions in just over four months, and regarding ketorolac, we have kept about 20% of the trailing prescriptions with ACUVAIL. In the latter case, the time between launch of an improved product and multiple generics was too short to save higher share, given inadequate reimbursement. Building on a recent acceleration of LUMIGAN strips, we're excited that we we're able to launch LUMIGAN 0.01% just before the American Academy of Ophthalmology. This product, with comparable efficacy to the original LUMIGAN, but with dramatically lower hyperemia and discontinuation rates, is already enjoying great share gains in Europe and Canada.
Regarding managed-care reimbursement for the LUMIGAN products, we expect similar tiers and coverage in 2011 as in 2010. For RESTASIS, we have plotted a new TV commercial, which is scoring highly with patients regarding awareness and consideration of RESTASIS. In Canada, we started shipping RESTASIS at the end of September and assess this as a major opportunity. LUMIGAN 0.01% with recent additions to provincial formulas in Canada is now reimbursed for 84% of public lines. In Europe, we are enjoying very strong sales growth due to the launch of LUMIGAN 0.01%, which is now available in Germany, the U.K., Sweden, France and Spain, with prescriptions being additive to the original LUMIGAN.
Generics of Xalatan are now available in Italy and Spain. GANFORT is also enjoying rapid expansion and was recently launched in Turkey. OZURDEX is off to a fast start in Germany and is now also available in the U.K., Ireland, Sweden and Denmark. Overall European sales are furthermore being boosted by the direct sales in Turkey and Poland.
In Latin America, strong growth is being driven by COMBIGAN, GANFORT, Relestat and OPTIVE. We recently launched a high-potential local product in Brazil, Zypred, a fix combo of ZYMAR and prednisolone [ph]. In Asia, high growth is being driven in the rapidly expanding markets in India and Korea, as well as markets in Southeast Asia. In Australia, ALPHAGAN P is now on the national reimburse list called PBS.
Moving on to BOTOX. I will first comment the significance of the FDA chronic migraine approval before commenting performance. Obviously, we're both delighted by the final approval after a long development process and also by the timing of the approval shortly before the American Headache Society meeting at the middle of November. In terms of sales force deployment, the timing is also ideal as we just finished our five-year commitment to GlaxoSmithKline in late September for a co-promoting a merge and Imitrex STATdose to neurologists. This salesforce capacity has been transitioned to detail BOTOX for chronic migraine to a customer base who we've already been visiting specifically for GSK.
Once again, Allergan is poised to address and create a new market, given the substantial burden of this condition affecting 3.2 million Americans. We'll be alone in this task, as BOTOX is the only focal solution for the prophylaxis of chronic migraine and the only prophylactic solution being actively promoted after the generizisation of TOPAMAX. As has always been the experience with BOTOX therapeutic indications, injector training and product adoption takes time, speeded or slowed by reimbursement conditions.
Given our estimated small existing sales base of BOTOX, either to offer cure with migraine, there's some limited reimbursement by private payers. Just over 10% of private lines and of course, the company with substantial step added, now securing reimbursement and establishing injective fee payment schedules is our next priority in parallel with injector training.
Moving on to comment the BOTOX performance in the quarter. Q3 sales increased versus the same period in 2009 by 4.5% to local currencies and by 4.2% in dollars. Overall, BOTOX Cosmetic and therapeutic combined sales were flat in the U.S., with therapeutic growth being offset by modest sales declines in Aesthetics with Medicis establishing a presence in the market with Dysport and [indiscernible] with Dysport for cervical dystonia. The latter with minimal market share gains.
Outside the U.S., BOTOX is enjoying double-digit growth, precisely in those markets where we are successfully competing with multiple competitors. On a global basis, we estimate in Q2, the last few days for which we have market data, that BOTOX enjoyed 80% market share in a market that grew 10% year-over-year. In the U.S., the gradual pickup of upper limbs spasticity is in accordance with our expectations, as new injectors are trained and referral pathways are established. Regarding the U.S. aesthetics market, we estimate that the market in Q3 is growing double-digit in procedures and that Dysport share appears to be very flat since April with an estimated market share of 16% to procedures in September.
As Dysport is sold at a discount, then is also sampling heavily, we estimate that BOTOX still enjoined a 91% value of share in Q2. Our print campaign for BOTOX called, There's only one BOTOX has been running since May. In Europe, we're pleased that we're only marginally losing market share in a strongly expanding market as Galderma enters the market with Azzalure, and Merz with Xeomin and [indiscernible].
Markets In Latin America and Asia are blend, and BOTOX is performing strongly. Regarding facial aesthetics, sales continued to grow very strongly at 28.1% in local currencies and at 27.6% in dollars, with Allergan growing at 20% or higher in all operating regions and gaining large amounts of share in all regions of the world. Only in those Asian countries where we do not yet have product approvals such as China and Japan are we lagging behind. We have clearly established the JUVÉDERM family as the number one global brand and are further building on its premium value proposition lidocaine-containing products and VOLUMA accounting for an increased part of the mix.
In the facial aesthetics market, Allergan has the ability to act as the locomotive as we can build upon our physician presence with BOTOX to expand our physician customer's procedural offerings through physician training and education to full facial concept. In addition, the recent innovations of lidocaine in volumizing, as well as hydrating formulations have further expanded the attraction of these products to both doctors and their patients. We've invested in JUVÉDERM-branded campaigns in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., France and Germany, as well as in integrated PR campaigns.
Regarding skin care, with most sales being in the U.S., Q3 sales decreased 2.4% in dollars year-over-year. But these sales at $21.7 million were 2.9% lower than in the third quarter of 2009, with inventory builds in a rapidly growing base of prescribers boosting sales in the prior year. Sales were also sequentially lower than the $23.9 million in Q2, although this may be due to summer seasonality which we still cannot accurately assess as we're only two years into the product introduction.
In Canada, we have fulfilled all regulatory requirements and are launching LATISSE for the next few weeks. As our market research shows, high levels of product satisfaction with the product and high levels of patient retention with various to first-time adoption, given cheaper OTC alternatives. For this reason, we're investing in major customer sampling activities in Q4. Obviously, samples affect short-term sales, which is one reason why we have guided to the lower end of our previous full-year range for sales.
One of the most significant campaigns running from early October to mid-December is a $100 rebate in cash for LATISSE after receiving a BOTOX Cosmetic or JUVÉDERM treatment. Regarding x factory sales of the medical dermatology product within this segment, ACZONE decreased marginally and TAZORAC increased marginally. This was caused by inventory changes, rebates and patient coupons. The more reliable measure would be a market acquisition dollars reported by FDI Bonin [ph]. ACZONE sales increased year-over-year in Q3 by 22.9%, with ACZONE hitting a new market share high in August and TAZORAC growing by 15.7%.
For breast aesthetics, Q3 sales increased 10.3% in local currencies and 8.6% in dollars. We enjoyed a strong rebound in the U.S., offset by weak x factory sales overseas. This was a factor of inventory adjustments with distributors in the current year, while market disruptions in markets such as Australia, Mexico and Korea caused in the prior year in advance of changing from a distributor to direct sales model and also changing sourcing to Costa Rica. Hence, the weak overseas sales growth does not reflect any weakness in end market demand. We believe that we have gained some market share in the quarter, both in the U.S., in the augmentation and tissue expansion categories and internationally. The U.S. and Canadian markets are continuing to adopt the higher cost silicon gel products. We're also continuing to innovate, with the worldwide launch of re-sterilizable sizers as well as the MAGNA-FINDER device for our tissue expander line. We estimate that the worldwide breast aesthetics market grew 9% in Q2 year-over-year.
Commenting urology, Q3 sales increased 17.6%, a catch-up from the weak Q2 x factory sales with year-to-date sales declining 3.9%. Looking through minor changes in inventory and rebates, acquisition dollars sales increased year-to-date 2.1% with original SANCTURA sales declining 17.1% after the somewhat earlier-than-expected launch of trospium chloride generics at the beginning of September and growth of 6.5% for SANCTURA XR.
Due to lack of performance, primarily in the general practitioner channel, we've terminated our co-promotion agreement with NovaQuest [ph]. Consequently, we have reduced our outlook for sales in the remainder of the year. Now we're awaiting the approval of BOTOX for neurogenic detrusor overactivity towards the end of 2011 to build this business.
Finally, regarding the Obesity Intervention segment, sales declined 8.2% to local currencies and 8.1% in dollars. The decline in U.S. sales was offset by an increase in sales in foreign markets. In the U.S., given high out-of-pocket costs for non-reimbursed LAP-BAND procedures and also high co-pays for reimbursed surgeries, it appears that the bariatric market was correlated with the level of unemployment. Our cash-pay market has continued to decline rapidly during the course of 2010 and now only accounts for about 10% of the brand. Year-to-date for the Reimbursed segment, we estimate that the overall bariatric market declined 7%, with the band market declining 4%. With an estimated 71% share of the band market for the LAP-BAND, we're now at the point where our year-over-year change in share should be minimal going forward, given a stable market share situation in 2010. Outside the U.S., we've had good growth of LAP-BAND and Albara [ph] sales in most markets in Europe, as well as in Canada and parts of Latin America. We recently launched a rapid port supplier, which has eliminated are the sole weakness of our product offering relative to competition.
I would now like to pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will provide detailed comments on our financial performance."

During the third quarter of 2010, Allergan generated strong operating results as we experienced good performance across each of our geographic regions. Allergan was again able to overachieve our",1004,"Thanks, David, and good morning, to all of you on the call. During the third quarter of 2010, Allergan generated strong operating results as we experienced good performance across each of our geographic regions. Allergan was again able to overachieve our sales and earnings per share expectation, despite headwinds relating to Europe, pricing pressures, U.S. healthcare reform and the ongoing generic impact to our ALPHAGAN P 0.15% in ACULAR brands. 
Allergan's strong competitive positions across the globe within each of our specialty areas of concentration, along with the quality of and the breadth of our product portfolio, have enabled the company to generate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.78, coming in above the top end of our range of expectations and marking an 11.4% increase over 2009 results for the same quarter. Consistent with prior periods, while producing this quality performance, the company continues to invest into the current and future growth drivers of the business. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q3 2010 gross margin of 85.1% increased 170 basis points when compared to Q3 2009, and Allergan saw a sequential improvement in both its Pharmaceutical and Medical Device margins. This continuing positive gross margin trend has been driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs, with the biggest contribution coming from our breast product line, given our recent change over to a lower-cost manufacturing base in Costa Rica, favorable volume-based manufacturing variances, lower year-over-year inventory provisions and lower royalty expense. The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the third quarter was 39.5%, totaling $470 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2009 were 41.7% and $470 million, respectively. We continue to work diligently to offset the cost of healthcare reforms and impact of rising rebate structure in the U.S., as well as pricing reductions in Europe and therefore, managing Allergan's cost structure in a very thoughtful manner and considering other potential structural changes to our business model. Likewise, consistent with our plan and comments to the investment community, we are recognizing the benefits of leverage in many of our businesses. Our ongoing focus is to direct our investments to the highest yielding products, which have been appropriately risk-adjusted for economic risks and traditional market and execution risks.
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.3% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $194 million, an increase in spend of approximately $27 million over the third quarter of 2009 and sequentially above the level of spend in the second quarter of 2010 as we continue to fund new projects and invest in our productive and promising Pharmaceutical and Medical Device pipelines.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's third quarter operating income ratio increased by 250 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2009. The company's disciplined and selective approach centered on maximizing return while maintaining appropriate future-focused investments has enabled the company to generate this improvement to operating margin performance.
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 45 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 113 days. Allergan continue to maintain exceptional cash flow generation capabilities in the third quarter with operating cash flow after CapEx of approximately $289 million.
On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow after CapEx totaled approximately $771 million, which compares to $741 million generated in the same period in 2009. At the end of the third quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments and cash and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $3.1 billion and $902 million, respectively. In addition to the contribution of this cash balance from the company's strong cash flow produced during the quarter, Allergan's liquidity position was further strengthened by our issuance of a 10-year note in the amount of $650 million, with the coupon of 3.375 and effective rate of 3.41%. This note was issued to address the potential retiring of our convertible debt, which is puttable and callable in April of 2011. Although, this financing will result in a duplicate interest expense of approximately $5.5 million in our fourth quarter, we believe that the market conditions were ideal and chose to pursue it, realizing that it was the right long-term action and that the company would have to cover the additional cost of this interest expense. It is also worth noting that following the close of the quarter, the company made payments to the DOJ totaling approximately $590 million.
For the fourth quarter of 2010, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,220,000,000 to $1,270,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.88. As a reminder, these expectations assume that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2010, with full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 2010 results. We assume that the renewal of this R&D tax credit has a value of approximately $0.05 of earnings per share. Regarding full year expectations for 2010, we are adjusting our full-year sales expectation to between $4,750,000,000 and $4,800,000,000 and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to between $3.14 and $3.16, which represents growth of between 13% and 14%. For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release.
Our solid results during the third quarter demonstrate the depth and breadth of Allergan's diversified lines of business. Allergan very much prides itself on the disciplined approach taken with respect to how our dollars are spent and what kind of investment returns are required to justify this spending. We will continue to strive towards building on our momentum and effectively executing against our business strategies, further strengthening Allergan as a leader in our selected specialty markets.
So with that, operator, I'd like now to open the call to questions."

That was of the order of $20 million and the exact numbers are there. And of course, in our press release, we set out how much we expended for Turkey. Happily, most of our contracts of more recent vintage are very carefully awarded, so that we have the ability to reacquire distribution rights effectively free of charge with an appropriate notice period. And that indeed was the case for Poland, where we absolutely spent zero. And our partner there has done a great job for us. And in fact, they are now representative beyond Poland, in places like the Ukraine, most of the X, I'll call them Soviet Republic, using historical term, and even parts of Southern Europe. So they are kind of master distributor arrangement. So net-net, what does that all mean? It means going forward, there should be very little money spent on any of the markets, where we choose to go direct, where we see sufficient economies of scale.
Now answering your second question on SG&A, clearly, there is an increasing emphasis on spend x U.S. because in almost all of our businesses, we see higher growth rates outside the United States. I think a sorry reflection upon the state of affairs in this country, and really a reflection of a lot of the squeezing that is going on due to healthcare reform."

In my opening remarks, I tried to set out what is the starting position, and of course, this has always been the case of BOTOX, where physicians are just ahead of us, it takes us years to catch up on what they are establishing in reality. With an off-label indication. And then of course, our job is to get the product approved on label. I also would like to reemphasize once again, that we assiduously avoid any off-label promotion. That's why I set out the fact that there is a small base that exists and about low teens kind of percentage for private insurers covering BOTOX for really severe migraines. Clearly, Managed Care is going to look at con-combatant use of medications, which will be approved to show that, indeed, patients really do have 15 or more migraine days as a baseline to be considered for the use of this product as a prophylaxis. If we look at timing, there's really two parallel tracks. One is the training of physicians because despite sometimes a lot of enthusiasm by various lectures on BOTOX, there aren't that number of doctors who actually use the product. It is a very much concentrated base of people who are the avant-garde. But we have to go through the normal cycle that we know very well from every single therapeutic indication going all the way back cervical dystonia, and that typically takes 6-plus months in terms of assessing people's interest, getting them to attend training courses, and then the real moment of truth is actually putting their thumb on the syringe and injecting on real life appropriate patients.
On the other side, we have reimbursement and that will take a minimum of six months, really more 12 months plus when we look at getting final J codes [ph]. That takes a long, long time and indeed, I'm sure will be operating with temporary J. codes [ph] in interim period. Finally, another major step is just getting established what will be injector fees. So obviously, the cost of our product is well known. You know the cost per vial. The FDA has made life simple for all of us by coming up with a fixed dose, 155 units. And of course, we're assuming it will just be over close to four treatment sessions per year, just because the label says three months, but we know from practice, as everybody absolutely as regular clock work through the day, well of course not, there's always scheduling problems. So cost of drug is very well known. And now we've got to get very well established with both private insurers and Medicare carriers what should the injection fee be."

One of the great fortunes we have at Allergan is the fact that we have this very large backbone business called Ophthalmology.

In fact, like in China, we've kind of been forced to strategically take a pause when we spun off AMO, but now we're back. And we're obviously, we're going to bring back, answering your question, there's really very few companies or products available in these markets. It's much more a case of deciding when it's appropriate for us to take distributor markets direct. And there we're very careful not to divert or defocus our efforts in small markets where we have some really good distributors doing a very fine job for us.

I don't know whether this is good or bad, you can take it both ways. Fortunately, the U.S. market is the one that is most transparent, where most technology is available and where markets are transparent, i.e., there are assets that won't comprise and can actually become available. Finding such things in Europe is quite difficult. I think it's due to the history of European companies being really forced into non-specialist markets. You can think of lots of examples of that, which makes those companies somewhat uninteresting to a company like Allergan. So we will scour the earth, so to speak, whether it be the early-stage assets, you've seen us enter into both purchases, licenses, partnerships or earlier stage assets, and I'm sure we will continue to do that. In terms of therapeutic areas, obviously, we like the areas we're in. But we do look across all over the garden fence to say could there be an adjacent area where, by definition, it has to be specialist. If it's not a limited number of physicians, then we're really not interested because then, our model of very close connectivity with our customer base would no longer apply. Obviously, to the degree there could be some synergies back to our existing products would make it even more interesting. And next answer, if we do go over the fence, it'll be in a very limited way.

One, VOLUMA for the U.S. it's done great elsewhere in the world, and through our Serica acquisition, we're getting some studies lined up to be able to effectively launch that product.

Just getting, if you like, basic toxin manufacturing facilities approved is anything but trivial. And then when one looks at performance, basically, it's kind of almost like an abrasion approach, that it takes a lot of time to get the toxin actually to pass the dermis and do what it's required to do. So as much as there are lots of people who don't like injections, we understand that. The inconvenience of this product due to the time it takes, I'm not sure that it really will do that much even if it's approved one day.

With a series of important R&D approvals in 2010  both by the FDA and regulatory agencies around the world, a gradual recovery of most major economies favorably impacting our cash-pay Aesthetics b",2857,"Great. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. With a series of important R&D approvals in 2010  both by the FDA and regulatory agencies around the world, a gradual recovery of most major economies favorably impacting our cash-pay Aesthetics businesses and the worst of the impact of generics on our U.S. Ophthalmology business behind us, we're well-positioned for driving strong growth for several years ahead. This puts us in a unique position in our industry to address the impact of incremental full year costs of U.S. healthcare reform and European price cuts and/or increased rebates, which we commented earlier in the year and now estimate at approximately an incremental $100 million for 2011. We're working diligently to absorb these costs. However, this pressure should be carefully considered when considering the earnings power of our business.
Now reviewing the results of the third quarter. Sales increased versus the third quarter of 2009 by 6.3% in local currencies, by 5.7% in U.S. dollars. Our more economically sensitive cash-pay businesses continued on the same track of growth as earlier in the year. Around the world we have not observed any negative growth trends across the quarter even in the U.K. or in the challenged major economies of the eurozone, and we continued to enjoy strong upswings in Latin America and Asia. 
Operating performance was strong, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.78, marking an 11.4% increase versus the third quarter of last year and exceeding our expectations provided in early August. Since then, we announced our settlement with the Department of Justice and also an impairment charge regarding the SANCTURA assets, which led to a GAAP loss of $670.5 million for the quarter. We're glad that we reached a resolution with the government, have this matter behind us and have entered into a five-year corporate integrity agreement. 
The strong non-GAAP earnings growth was driven by good sales growth across the diversified range of products, as well as by a continued gross margin expansion in both the Medical Device and Pharmaceutical lines, and consciously offset by a large increase for R&D of 6.3% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis as we build the strength of our pipeline for the long term. In Q3, we spent less for direct-to-consumer advertising than in the prior year, but they're about the same level of investment year-to-date as in the prior year. 
Since the last earnings call, we have secured some very important regulatory approvals, notably, BOTOX for the prophylaxis of chronic migraine by the U.S. FDA, following the earlier approvals in the U.K., as well as in Estonia and Slovakia. FDA approved LUMIGAN .01% as the first line glaucoma therapy. Health Canada approved RESTASIS, so now our efforts are next directed to making this unique product for therapeutic dry eye available also in Europe. FDA granted the second indication for OZURDEX namely for uveitis. 
On October 27, the Japanese MHLW approved BOTOX for upper and lower limb spasticity. Furthermore, we earned licensed worldwide rights for an ophthalmic allergy product, Vlastikast [ph] [7:44] from VISTAKON, a division of Johnson & Johnson, which is approved by FDA at the end of July. This will enable us to firstly, to reenter the U.S. allergy market just before we expect the arrival of generics of ELESTAT and effectively maintain a competitive position in the significant allergy segment of the worldwide ophthalmics market. Vlastikast [ph] [8:08] as a highly competitive label, indicated QD [ph] for the prevention of itch with a rapid onset of action and program to last all through the day up to 16 hours.
Considering the rapidly expanding retina market, we are clearly focusing all our efforts on OZURDEX and hence took the decision not to commercialize TRIVARIS and have written off the manufacturing asset for $10.6 million. 
Concerning our cooperation with Serenity with their there Nocturnal En [Enurensis] product, Ser-120, the Phase III trials have been completed. The conclusion is that these trials are not sufficient for successful registration. Allergan and Serenity and the process of reviewing the complete trial data to determine what additional trials are indicated to support the development of the program.
Regarding LAP-BAND, we're preparing for U.S. FDA panel in early December regarding a lower body mass index indication.  Given the poor track record of weight-loss drugs, we're anxious to receive approval to extend LAP-BAND to a broader patient population, given the obesity epidemic. 
Finally, we are pleased that we have filed BOTOX for neurogenic detrusor overactivity resulting from overactive bladder or sometimes known as spastic bladder with the FDA. We are confident that urology should be the next major BOTOX franchise.
Regarding BOTOX for chronic migraine, our task is not to extend approvals around the world. We have filed with the European Medicines Agency through the mutual recognition procedure and have also submitted dossiers in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Brazil and a few other Latin American countries. 
Turning to the performance of the individual businesses, I'll commence with Ophthalmic Pharmaceuticals, which showed a continuing good pattern of growth, increasing 7.1% in local currencies and 6.3% in dollars versus the third quarter of 2009.
This Q3 growth number for Allergan, although lower than the 11% worldwide market growth number, reported by IMS Global for Q2, the last quarter for which data is available, is in line with global market growth, excluding the Retina segment. The weak sales are in the U.S. where we are impacted by the authorized generic of off a gun .15% and generics of ACULAR. 
Outside the U.S., all operating regions are growing double-digit, with particularly impressive growth in Asia and Europe. Our focused brands grew strongly thanks, to local currencies. RESTASIS which is mainly U.S. continued very strong put of 23.6%. The LUMIGAN franchise, including GANFORT grew by 19.1%. The ALPHAGAN franchise declined by 4.1% due to the impact of generics in the U.S. and to some extent, Europe, offset by great growth by COMBIGAN. In the U.S., the overall branded market has been affected by generics with STI, [ph] reporting only 1.6% growth in acquisition dollars year-to-date August.
On the other hand, generics are growing 1.3% in acquisition dollars. 
At Allergan, we're prepared well for the arrival of generics. With the rapid growth of ALPHAGAN P 0.1% and COMBIGAN, we have maintained consistently more than 70% of the trailing prescriptions of all bermonadine-containing products [ph]. With the launch of ZYMAXID, we have already converted 43% of the trailing prescriptions in just over four months, and regarding ketorolac, we have kept about 20% of the trailing prescriptions with ACUVAIL. In latter's case [ph], the time between launch of an improved product and multiple generics was too short to save higher share, given inadequate reimbursement. Building on a recent acceleration of LUMIGAN strips, we're excited that we we're able to launch LUMIGAN 0.01% just before the American Academy of Ophthalmology. This product, with comparable efficacy to the original LUMIGAN, but with dramatically lower hyperemia and discontinuation rates, is already enjoying great share gains in Europe and Canada.
Regarding managed-care reimbursement for the LUMIGAN products, we expect similar tiers and coverage in 2011 as in 2010. For RESTASIS, we have plotted a new TV commercial, which is scoring highly with patients regarding awareness and consideration of RESTASIS. In Canada, we started shipping RESTASIS at the end of September and assess this as a major opportunity. LUMIGAN 0.01% with recent additions to provincial formulas in Canada is now reimbursed for 84% of public lines. In Europe, we are enjoying very strong sales growth due to the launch of LUMIGAN 0.01%, which is now available in Germany, the U.K., Sweden, France and Spain, with prescriptions being additive to the original LUMIGAN. 
Generics of Xalatan are now available in Italy and Spain. GANFORT is also enjoying rapid expansion and was recently launched in Turkey. OZURDEX is off to a fast start in Germany and is now also available in the U.K., Ireland, Sweden and Denmark. Overall European sales are furthermore being boosted by the direct sales in Turkey and Poland. 
In Latin America, strong growth is being driven by COMBIGAN, GANFORT, Relestat and OPTIVE. We recently launched a high-potential local product in Brazil, Zypred, a fix combo of ZYMAR and prednisolone. In Asia, high growth is being driven in the rapidly expanding markets in India and Korea, as well as markets in Southeast Asia. In Australia, ALPHAGAN P is now on the national reimburse list called PBS.
Moving on to BOTOX. I will first comment the significance of the FDA chronic migraine approval before commenting performance. Obviously, we're both delighted by the final approval after a long development process and also by the timing of the approval shortly before the American Headache Society meeting at the middle of November. In terms of sales force deployment, the timing is also ideal as we just finished our five-year commitment to GlaxoSmithKline in late September for a co-promoting Amerge and Imitrex STATdose to neurologists. This salesforce capacity has been transitioned to detail BOTOX for chronic migraine to a customer base who we've already been visiting specifically for GSK.
Once again, Allergan is poised to address and create a new market, given the substantial burden of this condition affecting 3.2 million Americans. We'll be alone in this task, as BOTOX is the only focal solution for the prophylaxis of chronic migraine and the only prophylactic solution being actively promoted after the generizisation of TOPAMAX. As has always been the experience with BOTOX therapeutic indications, injector training and product adoption takes time, speeded or slowed by reimbursement conditions.
Given our estimated small existing sales base of BOTOX, either to offer cure with migraine, there's some limited reimbursement by private payers. Just over 10% of private lines and of course, the company with substantial step added, now securing reimbursement and establishing injective fee payment schedules is our next priority in parallel with injector training.
Moving on to comment the BOTOX performance in the quarter. Q3 sales increased versus the same period in 2009 by 4.5% to local currencies and by 4.2% in dollars. Overall, BOTOX Cosmetic and therapeutic combined sales were flat in the U.S., with therapeutic growth being offset by modest sales declines in Aesthetics with Medicis establishing a presence in the market with Dysport and [indiscernible] with Dysport for cervical dystonia. The latter with minimal market share gains.
Outside the U.S., BOTOX is enjoying double-digit growth, precisely in those markets where we are successfully competing with multiple competitors. On a global basis, we estimate in Q2, the last few days for which we have market data, that BOTOX enjoyed 80% market share in a market that grew 10% year-over-year. In the U.S., the gradual pickup of upper limbs spasticity is in accordance with our expectations, as new injectors are trained and referral pathways are established. Regarding the U.S. aesthetics market, we estimate that the market in Q3 is growing double-digit in procedures and that Dysport share appears to be very flat since April with an estimated market share of 16% to procedures in September.
As Dysport is sold at a discount, then it's also something heavily, we estimate that BOTOX still enjoyed a 91% value of share in Q2. Our print campaign for BOTOX called, There's only one BOTOX has been running since May. In Europe, we're pleased that we're only marginally losing market share in a strongly expanding market as Galderma enters the market with Azzalure, and Merz with Xeomin and [indiscernible]. 
Markets In Latin America and Asia are blend, and BOTOX is performing strongly. Regarding facial aesthetics, sales continued to grow very  strongly at 28.1% in local currencies and at 27.6% in dollars, with Allergan growing at 20% or higher in all operating regions and gaining large amounts of share in all regions of the world. Only in those Asian countries where we do not yet have product approvals such as China and Japan are we lagging behind. We have clearly established the JUVÉDERM family as the number one global brand and are further building on its premium value proposition lidocaine-containing products and VOLUMA accounting for an increased part of the mix.
In the facial aesthetics market, Allergan has the ability to act as the locomotive as we can build upon our physician presence with BOTOX to expand our physician customer's procedural offerings through physician training and education to full facial concept. In addition, the recent innovations of lidocaine in volumizing, as well as hydrating formulations have further expanded the attraction of these products to both doctors and their patients. We've invested in JUVÉDERM-branded campaigns in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., France and Germany, as well as in integrated PR campaigns.
Regarding skin care, with most sales being in the U.S., Q3 sales decreased 2.4% in dollars year-over-year. But this sales of $21.7 million were 2.9% lower than in the third quarter of 2009, with inventory builds in a rapidly growing base of prescribers boosting sales in the prior year. Sales were also sequentially lower than the $23.9 million in Q2, although this may be due to summer seasonality which we still cannot accurately assess as we're only two years into the product introduction.
In Canada, we have fulfilled all regulatory requirements and are launching LATISSE for the next few weeks. As our market research shows, high levels of product satisfaction with the product and high levels of patient retention with various to first-time adoption, given cheaper OTC alternatives. For this reason, we're investing in major customer sampling activities in Q4. Obviously, samples affect short-term sales, which is one reason why we have guided to the lower end of our previous full-year range for sales. 
One of the most significant campaigns running from early October to mid-December is a $100 rebate in cash for LATISSE after receiving a BOTOX Cosmetic or JUVÉDERM treatment. Regarding x factory sales of the medical dermatology product within this segment, ACZONE decreased marginally and TAZORAC increased marginally. This was caused by inventory changes, rebates and patient coupons. The more reliable measure would be a market acquisition dollars reported by FDI Bonin [ph]. ACZONE sales increased year-over-year in Q3 by 22.9%, with ACZONE hitting a new market share high in August and TAZORAC growing by 15.7%. 
For breast aesthetics, Q3 sales increased 10.3% in local currencies and 8.6% in dollars. We enjoyed a strong rebound in the U.S., offset by a weak x factory sales overseas. This was a factor of inventory adjustments with distributors in the current year, while market disruptions in markets such as Australia, Mexico and Korea caused in the prior year in advance of changing from a distributor to direct sales model and also changing sourcing to Costa Rica. Hence, the weak overseas sales growth does not reflect any weakness in end market demand. we believe that we have gained some market share in the quarter, both in the U.S., in the augmentation and tissue expansion [ph] categories and internationally. The U.S. and Canadian markets are continuing to adopt the higher cost silicon gel products. We're also continuing to innovate, with the worldwide launch of resterilizable sizers as well as the MAGNA-FINDER device for our tissue expander line. We estimate that the worldwide breast aesthetics market grew 9% in Q2 year-over-year.
Commenting urology, Q3 sales increased 17.6%, a catch-up from the weak Q2 x factory sales with year-to-date sales declining 3.9%. Looking through minor changes in inventory and rebates, acquisition dollars sales increased year-to-date 2.1% with original SANCTURA sales declining 17.1% after the somewhat earlier-than-expected launch of trospium chloride generics at the beginning of September and growth of 6.5% for SANCTURA XR.
Due to lack of performance, primarily in the general practitioner channel, we've terminated our co-promotion agreement with NovaQuest [ph]. Consequently, we have reduced our outlook for sales in the remainder of the year. Now we're awaiting the approval of BOTOX for neurogenic detrusor overactivity towards the end of 2011 to build this business.
Finally, regarding the Obesity Intervention segment, sales declined 8.2% to local currencies and 8.1% in dollars. The decline in U.S. sales was offset by an increase in sales in foreign markets. In the U.S., given high out-of-pocket costs for non-reimbursed LAP-BAND procedures and also high co-pays for reimbursed surgeries, it appears that the bariatric market was correlated with the level of unemployment. Our cash-pay market has continued to decline rapidly during the course of 2010 and now only accounts for about 10% of the brand. Year-to-date for the Reimbursed segment, we estimate that the overall bariatric market declined 7%, with the band market declining 4%. With an estimated 71% share of the band market for the LAP-BAND, we're now at the point where our year-over-year change in share should be minimal going forward, given a stable market share situation in 2010. Outside the U.S., we have had good growth of LAP-BAND and Albara [ph] sales in most markets in Europe, as well as in Canada and parts of Latin America. We recently launched a rapid port supplier, which has eliminated are the sole weakness of our product offering relative to competition. I would now like to pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will provide detailed comments on our financial performance.

During the third quarter of 2010, Allergan generated strong operating results as we experienced good performance across each of our geographic regions. Allergan was again able to overachieve our",1004,"Thanks, David, and good morning, to all of you on the call. During the third quarter of 2010, Allergan generated strong operating results as we experienced good performance across each of our geographic regions. Allergan was again able to overachieve our sales and earnings per share expectation, despite headwinds relating to Europe, pricing pressures, U.S. healthcare reform and the ongoing generic impact to our ALPHAGAN P 0.15% in ACULAR brands. 
Allergan's strong competitive positions across the globe within each of our specialty areas of concentration, along with the quality of and the breadth of our product portfolio, have enabled the company to generate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.78, coming in above the top end of our range of expectations and marking an 11.4% increase over 2009 results for the same quarter. Consistent with prior periods, while producing this quality performance, the company continues to invest into the current and future growth drivers of the business. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q3 2010 gross margin of 85.1% increased 170 basis points when compared to Q3 2009, and Allergan saw a sequential improvement in both its Pharmaceutical and Medical Device margins. This continuing positive gross margin trend has been driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs, with the biggest contribution coming from our breast product line, given our recent change over to a lower-cost manufacturing base in Costa Rica, favorable volume-based manufacturing variances, lower year-over-year inventory provisions and lower royalty expense. The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the third quarter was 39.5%, totaling $470 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2009 were 41.7% and $470 million, respectively. We continue to work diligently to offset the cost of healthcare reforms and impact of rising rebate structure in the U.S., as well as pricing reductions in Europe and therefore, managing Allergan's cost structure in a very thoughtful manner and considering other potential structural changes to our business model. Likewise, consistent with our plan and comments to the investment community, we are recognizing the benefits of leverage in many of our businesses. Our ongoing focus is to direct our investments to the highest yielding products, which have been appropriately risk-adjusted for economic risks and traditional market and execution risks. 
Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.3% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $194 million, an increase in spend of approximately $27 million over the third quarter of 2009 and sequentially above the level of spend in the second quarter of 2010 as we continue to fund new projects and invest in our productive and promising Pharmaceutical and Medical Device pipelines. 
Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's third quarter operating income ratio increased by 250 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2009. The company's disciplined and selective approach centered on maximizing return while maintaining appropriate future-focused investments has enabled the company to generate this improvement to operating margin performance.
With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 45 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 113 days. Allergan continued to maintain exceptional cash flow generation capabilities in the third quarter with operating cash flow after CapEx of approximately $289 million. 
On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow after CapEx totaled approximately $771 million, which compares to $741 million generated in the same period in 2009. At the end of the third quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments and cash and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $3.1 billion and $902 million, respectively. In addition to the contribution of this cash balance from the company's strong cash flow produced during the quarter, Allergan's liquidity position was further strengthened by our issuance of a 10-year note in the amount of $650 million, with the coupon of 3.375 and effective rate of 3.41%. This note was issued to address the potential retiring of our convertible debt, which is puttable and callable in April of 2011. Although, this financing will result in a duplicate interest expense of approximately $5.5 million in our fourth quarter, we believe that the market conditions were ideal and chose to pursue it, realizing that it was the right long-term action and that the company would have to cover the additional cost of this interest expense. It is also worth noting that following the close of the quarter, the company made payments to the DOJ totaling approximately $590 million.
For the fourth quarter of 2010, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,220,000,000 to $1,270,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.88. As a reminder, these expectations assume that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2010, with full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 2010 results. We assume that the renewal of this R&D tax credit has a value of approximately $0.05 of earnings per share. Regarding full year expectations for 2010, we are adjusting our full-year sales expectation to between $4,750,000,000 and $4,800,000,000 and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to between $3.14 and $3.16, which represents growth of between 13% and 14%. For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release.
Our solid results during the third quarter demonstrate the depth and breadth of Allergan's diversified lines of business. Allergan very much prides itself on the disciplined approach taken with respect to how our dollars are spent and what kind of investment returns are required to justify this spending. We will continue to strive towards building on our momentum and effectively executing against our business strategies, further strengthening Allergan as a leader in our selected specialty markets. So with that, operator, I'd like now to open the call to questions.

Of course, I was trying to put that in the context of otherwise, a very favorable position in which we find ourselves. I think another thing that I'd ask you to think about is also our long-term commitment to R&D. I've been very clear over the years that Allergan's performance is all about the long term. And of course, in our case, we're rather pleased that our historic investments in R&D have really well paid off, and just look at the enormous number of approvals. When Scott Whitcup and I talk about this, of course, we're very pleased in all that's been achieved. And of course, it's our job now, if you'd like, to reload the canon, because we're, speaking of Head of R&D and the CEO, we're asking ourselves, what are the products that we're going to be talking about that are going to hopefully just prior to filing, call it 2014, 2015.

That was of the order of $20 million and the exact numbers are there. And of course, in our press release, we set out how much we expended for Turkey. Happily, most of our contracts of more recent vintage are very carefully awarded, so that we have the ability to reacquire distribution rights effectively free of charge with an appropriate notice period. And that indeed was the case for Poland, where we absolutely spent zero. And our partner there has done a great job for us. And in fact, they are now representative beyond Poland, in places like the Ukraine, most of the ex, I'll call them Soviet Republic, using historical term, and even parts of Southern Europe. So they are kind of master distributor arrangement. So net-net, what does that all mean? It means going forward, there should be very little money spent on any of the markets, where we choose to go direct, where we see sufficient economies of scale. Now answering your second question on SG&A, clearly, there is an increasing emphasis on spend x U.S. because in almost all of our businesses, we see higher growth rates outside the United States. I think a reflection upon the state of affairs in this country, and really a reflection of a lot of the squeezing that is going on due to healthcare reform.

In my opening remarks, I tried to set out what is the starting position, and of course, this has always been the case of BOTOX, where physicians are just ahead of us, it takes us years to catch up on what they are establishing in reality. With an off-label indication. And then of course, our job is to get the product approved on label. I also would like to reemphasize once again, that we assiduously avoid any off-label promotion. That's why I set out the fact that there is a small base that exists and about low teens kind of percentage for project insurers covering BOTOX for really severe migraines. Clearly, Managed Care is going to look at con-combatant use of medications, which will be approved to show that, indeed, patients really do have 15 or more migraine days as a baseline to be considered for the use of this product as a prophylaxis. If we look at timing, there's really two parallel tracks. One is the training of physicians because despite sometimes a lot of enthusiasm by various lectures on BOTOX, there aren't that number of doctors who actually use the product. It is a very much concentrated base of people who are the avant-garde. But we have to go through the normal cycle that we know very well from every single therapeutic indication going all the way back cervical dystonia, and that typically takes 6-plus months in terms of assessing people's interest, getting them to attend training courses, and then the real moment of truth is actually putting their thumb on the syringe and injecting on real life appropriate patients. On the other side, we have reimbursement and that will take a minimum of six months, really more 12 months plus when we look at getting final j codes [ph]. That takes a long, long time and indeed, I'm sure will be operating with temporary J. codes [ph] in interim period. Finally, another major step is just getting established what will be injector fees. So obviously, the cost of our product is well known. You know the cost per vial. The FDA has made life simple for all of us by coming yup with a fixed dose, 155 units. And of course, we're assuming it will just be over close to four treatment sessions per year, just because the label says three months, but we know from practice, as everybody absolutely as regular clock work through the day, well of course not, there's always scheduling problems. So cost of drug is very well known. And now we've got to get very well established with both private insurers and Medicare carriers what should the injection fee be.

There are not so many assets available, I don't know whether this is good or bad, you can take it both ways. Fortunately, the U.S. market is the one that is most transparent, where most technology is available and where markets are transparent, i.e., there are assets that won't comprise and can actually become available. Finding such things in Europe is quite difficult. I think it's due to the history of European companies being really forced into nonspecialist markets. You can think of lots of examples of that, which makes those companies somewhat uninteresting to a company like Allergan. So we will scour the earth, so to speak, whether it be the early-stage assets, you've seen us enter into both purchases, licenses, partnerships or earlier stage assets, and I'm sure we will continue to do that. In terms of therapeutic areas, obviously, we like the areas we're in. But we do look across all over the garden fence to say could there be an adjacent area where, by definition, it has to be specialist. If it's not a limited number of physicians, then we're really not interested because then, our model of very close connectivity with our customer base would no longer apply. Obviously, to the degree there could be some synergies back to our existing products would make it even more interesting. And next answer, if we do go over the fence, it'll be in a very limited way. I can't imagine if we'll ever end up having a dozen specialty areas. That just gets too complicated.

With a series of important R&D approvals in 2010  both by the FDA and regulatory agencies around the world, a gradual recovery of most major economies favorably impacting our cash-pay Aesthetics",2857," Great. Thank you, Jim. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. With a series of important R&D approvals in 2010  both by the FDA and regulatory agencies around the world, a gradual recovery of most major economies favorably impacting our cash-pay Aesthetics businesses and the worst of the impact of generics on our U.S. Ophthalmology business behind us, we're well-positioned for driving strong growth for several years ahead. This puts us in a unique position in our industry to address the impact of incremental full year costs of U.S. healthcare reform and European price cuts and/or increased rebates, which we commented earlier in the year and now estimate at approximately an incremental $100 million for 2011. We're working diligently to absorb these costs. However, this pressure should be carefully considered when considering the earnings power of our business.
 Now reviewing the results of the third quarter. Sales increased versus the third quarter of 2009 by 6.3% in local currencies, by 5.7% in U.S. dollars. Our more economically sensitive cash-pay businesses continued on the same track of growth as earlier in the year. Around the world we have not observed any negative growth trends across the quarter even in the U.K. or in the challenged major economies of the eurozone, and we continued to enjoy strong upswings in Latin America and Asia.
 Operating performance was strong, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.78, marking an 11.4% increase versus the third quarter of last year and exceeding our expectations provided in early August. Since then, we announced our settlement with the Department of Justice and also an impairment charge regarding the SANCTURA assets, which led to a GAAP loss of $670.5 million for the quarter. We're glad that we reached a resolution with the government, have this matter behind us and have entered into a five-year corporate integrity agreement.
 The strong non-GAAP earnings growth was driven by good sales growth across the diversified range of products, as well as by a continued gross margin expansion in both the Medical Device and Pharmaceutical lines, and consciously offset by a large increase for R&D of 6.3% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis as we build the strength of our pipeline for the long term. In Q3, we spent less for direct-to-consumer advertising than in the prior year, but they're about the same level of investment year-to-date as in the prior year.
 Since the last earnings call, we have secured some very important regulatory approvals, notably, BOTOX for the prophylaxis of chronic migraine by the U.S. FDA, following the earlier approvals in the U.K., as well as in Estonia and Slovakia. FDA approved LUMIGAN .01% as the first line glaucoma therapy. Health Canada approved RESTASIS, so now our efforts are next directed to making this unique product for therapeutic dry eye available also in Europe. FDA granted the second indication for OZURDEX namely for uveitis.
 On October 27, the Japanese MHLW approved BOTOX for upper and lower limb spasticity. Furthermore, we earned licensed worldwide rights for an ophthalmic allergy product, Vlastikast [ph] [7:44] from VISTAKON, a division of Johnson & Johnson, which is approved by FDA at the end of July. This will enable us to firstly, to reenter the U.S. allergy market just before we expect the arrival of generics of ELESTAT and effectively maintain a competitive position in the significant allergy segment of the worldwide ophthalmics market. Vlastikast [ph] [8:08] as a highly competitive label, indicated QD [ph] for the prevention of itch with a rapid onset of action and program to last all through the day up to 16 hours.
 Considering the rapidly expanding retina market, we are clearly focusing all our efforts on OZURDEX and hence took the decision not to commercialize TRIVARIS and have written off the manufacturing asset for $10.6 million.
 Concerning our cooperation with Serenity with their there Nocturnal En [Enurensis] product, Ser-120, the Phase III trials have been completed. The conclusion is that these trials are not sufficient for successful registration. Allergan and Serenity and the process of reviewing the complete trial data to determine what additional trials are indicated to support the development of the program.
 Regarding LAP-BAND, we're preparing for U.S. FDA panel in early December regarding a lower body mass index indication.  Given the poor track record of weight-loss drugs, we're anxious to receive approval to extend LAP-BAND to a broader patient population, given the obesity epidemic.
 Finally, we are pleased that we have filed BOTOX for neurogenic detrusor overactivity resulting from overactive bladder or sometimes known as spastic bladder with the FDA. We are confident that urology should be the next major BOTOX franchise.
 Regarding BOTOX for chronic migraine, our task is not to extend approvals around the world. We have filed with the European Medicines Agency through the mutual recognition procedure and have also submitted dossiers in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Brazil and a few other Latin American countries.
 Turning to the performance of the individual businesses, I'll commence with Ophthalmic Pharmaceuticals, which showed a continuing good pattern of growth, increasing 7.1% in local currencies and 6.3% in dollars versus the third quarter of 2009.
 This Q3 growth number for Allergan, although lower than the 11% worldwide market growth number, reported by IMS Global for Q2, the last quarter for which data is available, is in line with global market growth, excluding the Retina segment. The weak sales are in the U.S. where we are impacted by the authorized generic of off a gun .15% and generics of ACULAR.
 Outside the U.S., all operating regions are growing double-digit, with particularly impressive growth in Asia and Europe. Our focused brands grew strongly thanks, to local currencies. RESTASIS which is mainly U.S. continued very strong put of 23.6%. The LUMIGAN franchise, including GANFORT grew by 19.1%. The ALPHAGAN franchise declined by 4.1% due to the impact of generics in the U.S. and to some extent, Europe, offset by great growth by COMBIGAN. In the U.S., the overall branded market has been affected by generics with STI, [ph] reporting only 1.6% growth in acquisition dollars year-to-date August.
 On the other hand, generics are growing 1.3% in acquisition dollars.
 At Allergan, we're prepared well for the arrival of generics. With the rapid growth of ALPHAGAN P 0.1% and COMBIGAN, we have maintained consistently more than 70% of the trailing prescriptions of all bermonadine-containing products [ph]. With the launch of ZYMAXID, we have already converted 43% of the trailing prescriptions in just over four months, and regarding ketorolac, we have kept about 20% of the trailing prescriptions with ACUVAIL. In latter's case [ph], the time between launch of an improved product and multiple generics was too short to save higher share, given inadequate reimbursement. Building on a recent acceleration of LUMIGAN strips, we're excited that we we're able to launch LUMIGAN 0.01% just before the American Academy of Ophthalmology. This product, with comparable efficacy to the original LUMIGAN, but with dramatically lower hyperemia and discontinuation rates, is already enjoying great share gains in Europe and Canada.
 Regarding managed-care reimbursement for the LUMIGAN products, we expect similar tiers and coverage in 2011 as in 2010. For RESTASIS, we have plotted a new TV commercial, which is scoring highly with patients regarding awareness and consideration of RESTASIS. In Canada, we started shipping RESTASIS at the end of September and assess this as a major opportunity. LUMIGAN 0.01% with recent additions to provincial formulas in Canada is now reimbursed for 84% of public lines. In Europe, we are enjoying very strong sales growth due to the launch of LUMIGAN 0.01%, which is now available in Germany, the U.K., Sweden, France and Spain, with prescriptions being additive to the original LUMIGAN.
 Generics of Xalatan are now available in Italy and Spain. GANFORT is also enjoying rapid expansion and was recently launched in Turkey. OZURDEX is off to a fast start in Germany and is now also available in the U.K., Ireland, Sweden and Denmark. Overall European sales are furthermore being boosted by the direct sales in Turkey and Poland.
 In Latin America, strong growth is being driven by COMBIGAN, GANFORT, Relestat and OPTIVE. We recently launched a high-potential local product in Brazil, Zypred, a fix combo of ZYMAR and prednisolone. In Asia, high growth is being driven in the rapidly expanding markets in India and Korea, as well as markets in Southeast Asia. In Australia, ALPHAGAN P is now on the national reimburse list called PBS.
 Moving on to BOTOX. I will first comment the significance of the FDA chronic migraine approval before commenting performance. Obviously, we're both delighted by the final approval after a long development process and also by the timing of the approval shortly before the American Headache Society meeting at the middle of November. In terms of sales force deployment, the timing is also ideal as we just finished our five-year commitment to GlaxoSmithKline in late September for a co-promoting Amerge and Imitrex STATdose to neurologists. This salesforce capacity has been transitioned to detail BOTOX for chronic migraine to a customer base who we've already been visiting specifically for GSK.
 Once again, Allergan is poised to address and create a new market, given the substantial burden of this condition affecting 3.2 million Americans. We'll be alone in this task, as BOTOX is the only focal solution for the prophylaxis of chronic migraine and the only prophylactic solution being actively promoted after the generizisation of TOPAMAX. As has always been the experience with BOTOX therapeutic indications, injector training and product adoption takes time, speeded or slowed by reimbursement conditions.
 Given our estimated small existing sales base of BOTOX, either to offer cure with migraine, there's some limited reimbursement by private payers. Just over 10% of private lines and of course, the company with substantial step added, now securing reimbursement and establishing injective fee payment schedules is our next priority in parallel with injector training.
 Moving on to comment the BOTOX performance in the quarter. Q3 sales increased versus the same period in 2009 by 4.5% to local currencies and by 4.2% in dollars. Overall, BOTOX Cosmetic and therapeutic combined sales were flat in the U.S., with therapeutic growth being offset by modest sales declines in Aesthetics with Medicis establishing a presence in the market with Dysport and [indiscernible] with Dysport for cervical dystonia. The latter with minimal market share gains.
 Outside the U.S., BOTOX is enjoying double-digit growth, precisely in those markets where we are successfully competing with multiple competitors. On a global basis, we estimate in Q2, the last few days for which we have market data, that BOTOX enjoyed 80% market share in a market that grew 10% year-over-year. In the U.S., the gradual pickup of upper limbs spasticity is in accordance with our expectations, as new injectors are trained and referral pathways are established. Regarding the U.S. aesthetics market, we estimate that the market in Q3 is growing double-digit in procedures and that Dysport share appears to be very flat since April with an estimated market share of 16% to procedures in September.
 As Dysport is sold at a discount, then it's also something heavily, we estimate that BOTOX still enjoyed a 91% value of share in Q2. Our print campaign for BOTOX called, There's only one BOTOX has been running since May. In Europe, we're pleased that we're only marginally losing market share in a strongly expanding market as Galderma enters the market with Azzalure, and Merz with Xeomin and [indiscernible].
 Markets In Latin America and Asia are blend, and BOTOX is performing strongly. Regarding facial aesthetics, sales continued to grow very  strongly at 28.1% in local currencies and at 27.6% in dollars, with Allergan growing at 20% or higher in all operating regions and gaining large amounts of share in all regions of the world. Only in those Asian countries where we do not yet have product approvals such as China and Japan are we lagging behind. We have clearly established the JUVÉDERM family as the number one global brand and are further building on its premium value proposition lidocaine-containing products and VOLUMA accounting for an increased part of the mix.
 In the facial aesthetics market, Allergan has the ability to act as the locomotive as we can build upon our physician presence with BOTOX to expand our physician customer's procedural offerings through physician training and education to full facial concept. In addition, the recent innovations of lidocaine in volumizing, as well as hydrating formulations have further expanded the attraction of these products to both doctors and their patients. We've invested in JUVÉDERM-branded campaigns in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., France and Germany, as well as in integrated PR campaigns.
 Regarding skin care, with most sales being in the U.S., Q3 sales decreased 2.4% in dollars year-over-year. But this sales of $21.7 million were 2.9% lower than in the third quarter of 2009, with inventory builds in a rapidly growing base of prescribers boosting sales in the prior year. Sales were also sequentially lower than the $23.9 million in Q2, although this may be due to summer seasonality which we still cannot accurately assess as we're only two years into the product introduction.
 In Canada, we have fulfilled all regulatory requirements and are launching LATISSE for the next few weeks. As our market research shows, high levels of product satisfaction with the product and high levels of patient retention with various to first-time adoption, given cheaper OTC alternatives. For this reason, we're investing in major customer sampling activities in Q4. Obviously, samples affect short-term sales, which is one reason why we have guided to the lower end of our previous full-year range for sales.
 One of the most significant campaigns running from early October to mid-December is a $100 rebate in cash for LATISSE after receiving a BOTOX Cosmetic or JUVÉDERM treatment. Regarding x factory sales of the medical dermatology product within this segment, ACZONE decreased marginally and TAZORAC increased marginally. This was caused by inventory changes, rebates and patient coupons. The more reliable measure would be a market acquisition dollars reported by FDI Bonin [ph]. ACZONE sales increased year-over-year in Q3 by 22.9%, with ACZONE hitting a new market share high in August and TAZORAC growing by 15.7%.
 For breast aesthetics, Q3 sales increased 10.3% in local currencies and 8.6% in dollars. We enjoyed a strong rebound in the U.S., offset by a weak x factory sales overseas. This was a factor of inventory adjustments with distributors in the current year, while market disruptions in markets such as Australia, Mexico and Korea caused in the prior year in advance of changing from a distributor to direct sales model and also changing sourcing to Costa Rica. Hence, the weak overseas sales growth does not reflect any weakness in end market demand. we believe that we have gained some market share in the quarter, both in the U.S., in the augmentation and tissue expansion [ph] categories and internationally. The U.S. and Canadian markets are continuing to adopt the higher cost silicon gel products. We're also continuing to innovate, with the worldwide launch of resterilizable sizers as well as the MAGNA-FINDER device for our tissue expander line. We estimate that the worldwide breast aesthetics market grew 9% in Q2 year-over-year.
 Commenting urology, Q3 sales increased 17.6%, a catch-up from the weak Q2 x factory sales with year-to-date sales declining 3.9%. Looking through minor changes in inventory and rebates, acquisition dollars sales increased year-to-date 2.1% with original SANCTURA sales declining 17.1% after the somewhat earlier-than-expected launch of trospium chloride generics at the beginning of September and growth of 6.5% for SANCTURA XR.
 Due to lack of performance, primarily in the general practitioner channel, we've terminated our co-promotion agreement with NovaQuest [ph]. Consequently, we have reduced our outlook for sales in the remainder of the year. Now we're awaiting the approval of BOTOX for neurogenic detrusor overactivity towards the end of 2011 to build this business.
 Finally, regarding the Obesity Intervention segment, sales declined 8.2% to local currencies and 8.1% in dollars. The decline in U.S. sales was offset by an increase in sales in foreign markets. In the U.S., given high out-of-pocket costs for non-reimbursed LAP-BAND procedures and also high co-pays for reimbursed surgeries, it appears that the bariatric market was correlated with the level of unemployment. Our cash-pay market has continued to decline rapidly during the course of 2010 and now only accounts for about 10% of the brand. Year-to-date for the Reimbursed segment, we estimate that the overall bariatric market declined 7%, with the band market declining 4%. With an estimated 71% share of the band market for the LAP-BAND, we're now at the point where our year-over-year change in share should be minimal going forward, given a stable market share situation in 2010. Outside the U.S., we have had good growth of LAP-BAND and Albara [ph] sales in most markets in Europe, as well as in Canada and parts of Latin America. We recently launched a rapid port supplier, which has eliminated are the sole weakness of our product offering relative to competition. I would now like to pass over to Jeff Edwards, who will provide detailed comments on our financial performance.

During the third quarter of 2010, Allergan generated strong operating results as we experienced good performance across each of our geographic regions. Allergan was again able to overachieve our",1004," Thanks, David, and good morning, to all of you on the call. During the third quarter of 2010, Allergan generated strong operating results as we experienced good performance across each of our geographic regions. Allergan was again able to overachieve our sales and earnings per share expectation, despite headwinds relating to Europe, pricing pressures, U.S. healthcare reform and the ongoing generic impact to our ALPHAGAN P 0.15% in ACULAR brands.
 Allergan's strong competitive positions across the globe within each of our specialty areas of concentration, along with the quality of and the breadth of our product portfolio, have enabled the company to generate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.78, coming in above the top end of our range of expectations and marking an 11.4% increase over 2009 results for the same quarter. Consistent with prior periods, while producing this quality performance, the company continues to invest into the current and future growth drivers of the business. A reconciliation of all of the adjustments to GAAP earnings is set out in our earnings release.
 Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments and amortization of acquired intangibles, Allergan's Q3 2010 gross margin of 85.1% increased 170 basis points when compared to Q3 2009, and Allergan saw a sequential improvement in both its Pharmaceutical and Medical Device margins. This continuing positive gross margin trend has been driven primarily by improved year-over-year standard costs, with the biggest contribution coming from our breast product line, given our recent change over to a lower-cost manufacturing base in Costa Rica, favorable volume-based manufacturing variances, lower year-over-year inventory provisions and lower royalty expense. The non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses to product net sales ratio for the third quarter was 39.5%, totaling $470 million. The comparable ratio and expense value for the same period in 2009 were 41.7% and $470 million, respectively. We continue to work diligently to offset the cost of healthcare reforms and impact of rising rebate structure in the U.S., as well as pricing reductions in Europe and therefore, managing Allergan's cost structure in a very thoughtful manner and considering other potential structural changes to our business model. Likewise, consistent with our plan and comments to the investment community, we are recognizing the benefits of leverage in many of our businesses. Our ongoing focus is to direct our investments to the highest yielding products, which have been appropriately risk-adjusted for economic risks and traditional market and execution risks.
 Non-GAAP research and development expenses were 16.3% of product net sales for the quarter, totaling $194 million, an increase in spend of approximately $27 million over the third quarter of 2009 and sequentially above the level of spend in the second quarter of 2010 as we continue to fund new projects and invest in our productive and promising Pharmaceutical and Medical Device pipelines.
 Excluding the effects of non-GAAP adjustments, Allergan's third quarter operating income ratio increased by 250 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2009. The company's disciplined and selective approach centered on maximizing return while maintaining appropriate future-focused investments has enabled the company to generate this improvement to operating margin performance.
 With respect to our balance sheet, consolidated Allergan days sales outstanding was 45 days, while consolidated Allergan inventory days on hand was 113 days. Allergan continued to maintain exceptional cash flow generation capabilities in the third quarter with operating cash flow after CapEx of approximately $289 million.
 On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow after CapEx totaled approximately $771 million, which compares to $741 million generated in the same period in 2009. At the end of the third quarter, Allergan's cash and short-term investments and cash and short-term investments net of debt positions totaled approximately $3.1 billion and $902 million, respectively. In addition to the contribution of this cash balance from the company's strong cash flow produced during the quarter, Allergan's liquidity position was further strengthened by our issuance of a 10-year note in the amount of $650 million, with the coupon of 3.375 and effective rate of 3.41%. This note was issued to address the potential retiring of our convertible debt, which is puttable and callable in April of 2011. Although, this financing will result in a duplicate interest expense of approximately $5.5 million in our fourth quarter, we believe that the market conditions were ideal and chose to pursue it, realizing that it was the right long-term action and that the company would have to cover the additional cost of this interest expense. It is also worth noting that following the close of the quarter, the company made payments to the DOJ totaling approximately $590 million.
 For the fourth quarter of 2010, Allergan estimates product net sales in the range of $1,220,000,000 to $1,270,000,000 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.88. As a reminder, these expectations assume that the U.S. R&D tax credit will be renewed in the fourth quarter of 2010, with full year retroactive benefit impacting Q4 2010 results. We assume that the renewal of this R&D tax credit has a value of approximately $0.05 of earnings per share. Regarding full year expectations for 2010, we are adjusting our full-year sales expectation to between $4,750,000,000 and $4,800,000,000 and our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to between $3.14 and $3.16, which represents growth of between 13% and 14%. For your information, expectations for other lines of the income statement and specific product sales expectations are included in our earnings release.
 Our solid results during the third quarter demonstrate the depth and breadth of Allergan's diversified lines of business. Allergan very much prides itself on the disciplined approach taken with respect to how our dollars are spent and what kind of investment returns are required to justify this spending. We will continue to strive towards building on our momentum and effectively executing against our business strategies, further strengthening Allergan as a leader in our selected specialty markets. So with that, operator, I'd like now to open the call to questions.

In my opening remarks, all that I attempted to point out was, when you're doing your models, don't forget that there are considerable pressures in terms of taxes, rebates and price decreases. Of course, I was trying to put that in the context of otherwise, a very favorable position in which we find ourselves. I think another thing that I'd ask you to think about is also our long-term commitment to R&D. I've been very clear over the years that Allergan's performance is all about the long term. And of course, in our case, we're rather pleased that our historic investments in R&D have really well paid off, and just look at the enormous number of approvals. When Scott Whitcup and I talk about this, of course, we're very pleased in all that's been achieved. And of course, it's our job now, if you'd like, to reload the canon, because we're, speaking of Head of R&D and the CEO, we're asking ourselves, what are the products that we're going to be talking about that are going to hopefully just prior to filing, call it 2014, 2015.

It means going forward, there should be very little money spent on any of the markets, where we choose to go direct, where we see sufficient economies of scale. Now answering your second question on SG&A, clearly, there is an increasing emphasis on spend x U.S. because in almost all of our businesses, we see higher growth rates outside the United States. I think a reflection upon the state of affairs in this country, and really a reflection of a lot of the squeezing that is going on due to healthcare reform.

In my opening remarks, I tried to set out what is the starting position, and of course, this has always been the case of BOTOX, where physicians are just ahead of us, it takes us years to catch up on what they are establishing in reality. With an off-label indication. And then of course, our job is to get the product approved on label. I also would like to reemphasize once again, that we assiduously avoid any off-label promotion. That's why I set out the fact that there is a small base that exists and about low teens kind of percentage for project insurers covering BOTOX for really severe migraines. Clearly, Managed Care is going to look at con-combatant use of medications, which will be approved to show that, indeed, patients really do have 15 or more migraine days as a baseline to be considered for the use of this product as a prophylaxis. If we look at timing, there's really two parallel tracks. One is the training of physicians because despite sometimes a lot of enthusiasm by various lectures on BOTOX, there aren't that number of doctors who actually use the product. It is a very much concentrated base of people who are the avant-garde. But we have to go through the normal cycle that we know very well from every single therapeutic indication going all the way back cervical dystonia, and that typically takes 6-plus months in terms of assessing people's interest, getting them to attend training courses, and then the real moment of truth is actually putting their thumb on the syringe and injecting on real life appropriate patients. On the other side, we have reimbursement and that will take a minimum of six months, really more 12 months plus when we look at getting final j codes [ph]. That takes a long, long time and indeed, I'm sure will be operating with temporary J. codes [ph] in interim period. Finally, another major step is just getting established what will be injector fees. So obviously, the cost of our product is well known. You know the cost per vial. The FDA has made life simple for all of us by coming yup with a fixed dose, 155 units. And of course, we're assuming it will just be over close to four treatment sessions per year, just because the label says three months, but we know from practice, as everybody absolutely as regular clock work through the day, well of course not, there's always scheduling problems. So cost of drug is very well known. And now we've got to get very well established with both private insurers and Medicare carriers what should the injection fee be.

One of the great fortunes we have at Allergan is the fact that we have this very large backbone business called Ophthalmology. And because of our history in Ophthalmology, we've been present in the majority of these markets for a very, very long period of time. I would say, the most recent adds have been the ones we've talked about earlier, i.e. parts of Eastern Europe, Turkey and parts of Asia as well. In fact, like in China, we've kind of been forced to strategically take a pause when we spun off  AMO, but now we're back. And we're obviously, we're going to bring back, answering your question, there's really very few companies or products available in these markets. It's much more a case of deciding when it's appropriate for us to take distributor markets direct. And there we're very careful not to divert or defocus our efforts in small markets where we have some really good distributors doing a very fine job for us. So there's no, if you like, cookie-cutter approach that one size fits all, very thoughtful in terms of where can we add value. And that really goes back to answering one of the prior question, which is really to make our expansions in these markets. We will spend very little balance sheet money, and I think it's much more a case of the model such as lastikaft [ph], here we are in licensing an allergy drug from VISTAKON J&J worldwide. And then as always, our job is then to register this product in allergy markets that are of sufficient size, scale and attractiveness. And then just the normal rollout that typically our products are available in AT or so markets around the world.

There are not so many assets available, I don't know whether this is good or bad, you can take it both ways. Fortunately, the U.S. market is the one that is most transparent, where most technology is available and where markets are transparent, i.e., there are assets that won't comprise and can actually become available. Finding such things in Europe is quite difficult. I think it's due to the history of European companies being really forced into nonspecialist markets. You can think of lots of examples of that, which makes those companies somewhat uninteresting to a company like Allergan. So we will scour the earth, so to speak, whether it be the early-stage assets, you've seen us enter into both purchases, licenses, partnerships or earlier stage assets, and I'm sure we will continue to do that. In terms of therapeutic areas, obviously, we like the areas we're in. But we do look across all over the garden fence to say could there be an adjacent area where, by definition, it has to be specialist. If it's not a limited number of physicians, then we're really not interested because then, our model of very close connectivity with our customer base would no longer apply. Obviously, to the degree there could be some synergies back to our existing products would make it even more interesting. And next answer, if we do go over the fence, it'll be in a very limited way. I can't imagine if we'll ever end up having a dozen specialty areas. That just gets too complicated.

So there's my significant push pulls that you would ask about. I don't see anything dramatic next year. It's going to be mostly volume-based absorption-based improvements.

We also are making a big investment in the sustained release, which would be a paradigm shift. Number two is the retina pipeline. It's clearly, a growing area within ophthalmology, our key space still. And so OZURDEX for diabetic microedema which is really the big OZURDEX indication is in finishing up Phase III. And I and the team spent a lot of time looking at what other retina products we can slate in. Third on the Allergan medical side, we have a couple of things. One, VOLUMA for the U.S. It's done great elsewhere in the world, and through our Serica acquisition, we're getting some studies lined up to be able to effectively launch that product. And then finally, through our business development, we have a couple of partnerships. And so, for example, on the urology space, apaziquone for bladder cancer in Phase III would be something eventually, when the data are out, we'll start talking about it a little bit more.

That'll be the way I'd approach it.

And so the answer is, I can't think of any real exception, very clear, that payers will pay for two vials, i.e. 200 units, even though the indicated dose is 155. Maybe I'll cover the one on Revans [ph]. This is a product, obviously, we followed for years now. I think the pathway to approval probably is more difficult than most people perceive. Just getting, if you like, basic toxin manufacturing facilities approved, is anything but trivial. And then when one looks at performance, basically, it's kind of almost like an abrasion approach, that it takes a lot of time to get the toxin actually to pass the dermis and do what it's required to do. So as much as there are lots of people who don't like injections, we understand that. The inconvenience of this product due to the time it takes, I'm not sure that it really will do that much even if it's approved one day. And I think to some degree, would address the different segment of the market. So I don't really see it as something that would necessarily, if you like, be a take-away from the existing market. I think it would be a new niche that would, if you like, be grafted on to the existing marketplace.
