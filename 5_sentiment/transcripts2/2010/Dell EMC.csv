There are lot of positives in today's results, and as we start the call, I wanted to highlight a few for you. EMC showed good progress through 2009 and ended the year with very solid growth in",3794,"Thanks, Tony. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. There are lot of positives in today's results, and as we start the call, I wanted to highlight a few for you. EMC showed good progress through 2009 and ended the year with very solid growth in Q4 with revenues of $4.1 billion, up 17% from Q3 '09, non-GAAP EPS of $0.33, up 43% and free cash flow of $793 million, up 6%. These quarter results provide a good example of the resiliency in our model with revenues up 2% over Q4 '08 demonstrating good profit leverage with non-GAAP EPS of 6% and solid free cash flow generation of 2%. Within these results, our EMC Information Infrastructure business had a good quarter with $3.5 billion of revenue, up 15% sequentially and $0.28 of non-GAAP EPS, up 40% from Q3. On a year-on-year basis, non-GAAP EPS was up 12% on flat revenue, a result that clearly shows the success of our cost-transformation efforts. As previously announced, VMware also had a strong fourth quarter, contributing $607 million of revenue, and almost $0.05 of non-GAAP EPS to EMC and showed very good growth from Q3. Given the tough global economic conditions and an IT spending environment down across the board, EMC performed well as we move through 2009. Our vision, strategy and most importantly, the hard work and sacrifice of EMC team has enabled our company to come out of the year with business momentum and very well-positioned to grow and gain share in 2010 and beyond.It is especially worthy to note that even in this economic [ph] climates, the consolidated Q4 revenues, Q4 non-GAAP operating margin, Q4 non-GAAP EPS and Q4 free cash flow results were all records for EMC. In other words, EMC is coming out of the worst global recession we've seen in our best financial shape ever. We think this is truly impressive.Beyond the financial metrics, we have accomplished a lot in 2009. We maintained good focus on our golden opportunity despite numerous economic and market distractions. We stayed close to customers and helped them through a tough time while other vendors cut back. We rolled out new market leading products with the best quality in our history. We successfully implemented our biggest cost-transformation program ever and strengthened our operational and financial position. We used our financial strength wisely to continue to invest in R&D and to make strategic acquisitions, both of which will contribute to our ongoing success. And we improved our customer satisfaction and loyalty metrics at an important time when customers are looking to solidify their true business partners. While 2009 was a tough year, EMC achieved a lot of good things and exited the year in a very strong position.So moving to the agenda for today's call, I will start off by making some comments about the Q4 spending environment, our business outlook for 2010 and then discuss some more specific details from our Q4 results. Overall, the environment in 2009 turned out pretty much as we anticipated, and showed reasonable stability at the end of the year. While there's still uncertainty as customers evaluate their own business prospects and plans, we do expect 2010 to be better than 2009. Joe will spend some time discussing the 2010 environment in his comments.  More than that [ph] is that we currently see IT spending growing between 3% and 5% in 2010.  Given the compelling dynamics we see in our target markets, we continue to expect EMC's total addressable market to grow faster than IT overall, probably something near 6% to 8%. And lastly, given EMC's strategic focus on the shift of private cloud and our leadership position in the most important opportunities such as storage tiering, virtualization security, next-generation backup etc., we believe that EMC is poised to grow even fast and gain share.As a result, we currently anticipate 2010 consolidated revenues of approximately $16 billion, up 14% and we expect significant leverage with non-GAAP operating margins of 20% and non-GAAP EPS of approximately $1.12, up over 24% from last year. This projected growth demonstrates the strength of our unique strategic positioning, ability to gain share and the earnings leverage inherent in our leaner financial model. Given what we see in the markets and our understanding of customer spend plans, we currently expect our quarterly revenue contribution in 2010 to follow reasonably normal seasonal patterns.Now let's take a closer look at some of the financial highlights from the fourth quarter. EMC information infrastructure revenues were $3.5 billion, up 15% sequentially and flat year-to-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.28, up 40% quarter-on-quarter and up 12% from last year, very good leverage in a very tough year.  Within this overall numbers, information infrastructure product revenues were almost $2.4 billion, up 20% quarter-to-quarter and information infrastructure services revenues were bit over $1.1 billion, up 7% sequentially.  Free cash flow was $554 million. Looking at the geographic results from our Information Infrastructure business, our revenues from North America represented about 56% of total and were up a solid 13% sequentially and down 1% from Q4 2008. EMEA and Latin America both have strong sequential growth, up 23% and 17% respectively from Q3 and both were up around 1% year-on-year. APJ also improved from Q3 and was up 6%. The BRIC + 13 countries continue to show strength, up 14% quarter-on-quarter and 5% year-on-year. A very positive data point is that these markets were also up 1% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and this is encouraging to see.Looking at results from the businesses within information infrastructure, Q4 information storage revenues were $3.1 billion, up 16% sequentially. Overall, we're seeing an increase in net new implementations as customers are looking to put in place infrastructure to support their virtual environments.  As part of these investments, we continue to see very strong growth in the adoption of tiered storage, utilizing solid states and SATA drives. In addition, the recent introduction of our fully automated storage tiering software known as FAST is a compelling and unique capability that is enabling customers to improve efficiency via storage tiering across more of their environments. Overall, we believe that demand will continue to strengthen for our broad and deep storage portfolio as customers look to deploy more efficient, flexible and cost-effective technology.In the high end, Symmetrix revenues were up 13% sequentially, a very good result as the V-max continues its positive ramp. The introduction of FAST is also driving more rapid adoption of both SSD and SATA drives in Symmetrix, as customers look to take advantage of the unique value of V-max-based storage tiering. The ramp of this new product is proceeding very well. It's clearly extending our lead in the high-end storage market and is very well positioned as customers invest in their cloud infrastructures.Not only is the V-max very successful in the more traditional high-end markets where the Symmetrix has always done well, but its scalable architecture and unique capabilities are receiving a very good response in new-use cases such as Internet hosting. For example, in Q4, we won a V-Max deal to completely replace a competitor at one of our biggest customers, a major telco-based hosting provider.Now let's take a look at the Mid-Tier business, including our Celerra and CLARiiON product families. Within this, CLARiiON revenues were up 15% sequentially, a nice acceleration over Q3 growth. Direct and Channel business [ph] continue to be about 75% of total CLARiiON revenues.  Within the CLARiiON results, the Dell-EMC co-branded CLARiiON OEM revenues were up 27% sequentially, and represented about 16% of total CLARiiON revenues.Our Celerra NAS business continues to be a great performer, posting the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year revenue growth in Q4, with revenues up over 50%. Our unified products combined our best-of-breed [indiscernible] capabilities without sacrificing performance in either environment, and our success  here continues to set pace in the industry. In Q3, we are number one in the market with 46% share according to IDC and given our outstanding performance, it's pretty clear we gained share again in Q4. As example of our success here, we recently beaten NetApp and others for a large deal, including 1.4 petabytes of unified storage at a major New York-based stock exchange. This market shift towards unified storage is a very important trend in the mid-tier that I'll talk a little bit more about later on.Our newly formed backup recovery system division which we call BRS have fantastic results again this quarter. In fact, Data Domain and Avamar were each up over 50% year-on-year in Q4. With BRS, I'm happy to say that Data Domain were ahead of plan in its first full quarter as part of the EMC family. The excellent focus and execution by the teams had led to the continued growth and success of these businesses. As an example of the growth potential synergy within this business, we added 600 new customers in the quarter with 300 of these being net new to EMC.  Given the growth, this business is clearly very strategic to customers and EMC is also the acknowledged leader in this important area. As an indicator of our strength and market leadership, in the forthcoming IDC survey, respondents chose either an EMC or Data Domain primary branded [ph] deduplication solution at nearly double the rate of the next nearest vendor. This means that we have almost twice as much mind share as anyone else in this great market and we show the ability to capture it.Taking a look at a few other storage related businesses, our Mozy Cloud-based Backup business is now managing over 25 terabytes of customer data, and launched services this quarter in conjunction with partners, Cox, McAfee and Vodafone. This year, Mozy will also expand beyond online backup through a broad set of personal cloud services. In addition, Iomega, our custom and small-business focused operation is seeing an increasing customer demand for backup and protection and in Q4, shipped over one exabyte of storage, more than double the capacity shipped last Q4. Iomega continues to roll out new and compelling products as highlighted by winning an Editor's Choice Award with the vClone products at CES. And by the fact that the Iomega brand is one of the most popular storage solutions at Apple stores.In total, the EMC Storage business finished 2009 with very good momentum due to great products compelling solutions and focused execution by the team. Importantly, we believe that we are poised to  really extend our lead this year for three additional reasons: To move to virtualized data centers, the implementation of next-gen backup and recovery and the evolution of unified storage. Let me spend a few moments to highlight each of these trends with you.First of all, the virtualization of the data center is beginning in earnest, as customers are looking to move towards a private cloud, and EMC is absolutely best positioned to benefit from this. Some recent survey results from Goldman Sachs really highlight these facts. As you can see in the first chart, customers are looking to put a lot of incremental spending towards next-generation technologies this year. And this survey shows over two thirds of these customers will move at least 20% of their data centers in this direction by the end of 2010.  Obviously, a major factor of this next-gen technology is server virtualization. And not only is VMware the leader in this space but EMC is the clear storage vendor of choice in virtualized service environments. As you can see on the next chart, EMC is preferred by 38% of the survey participants and with more than twice the mind share of the next closest competitor. And, I might add, over three times as much mind share of the smaller vendor who has been making a lot of noise about this topic lately. I think that puts rhetoric to rest. And finally, as virtualized storage becomes more prevalent with custom environments, EMC is once again at the forefront with 34% of customers surveyed, saying they would choose EMC when they implement storage virtualization technology. As you can see, not only does EMC already have 50% more mind share than the next vendor, you can also expect us to make several announcements throughout 2010 that will extend our lead in this important area.The second major trend is the rapid implementation of next-gen backup and recovery capabilities. The benefits of this solution are becoming well-known including simplicity, efficiency, flexibility, manageability and cost savings, so customer demand is very high. This is also a vastly underpenetrated opportunity. In the same IDC survey I mentioned earlier, the survey also indicates that only 22% of respondents have implemented deduplication for backup data. Obviously, we are already seeing great success here and with the leading products in both forms of data deduplication with Data Domain and Avamar with tremendous mind share in the market and a clearly underpenetrated opportunity, we should be able to drive a lot of growth here.The third trend is that the market is moving towards more of a unified storage approach in the mid-tier, this year and into the future. In other words, customer requirements for flexibility and best-of-breed performance are propelling the desire for products that truly unify the best capabilities to manage block, file and object information. Although previously mentioned, our current unified products based upon a leading SAN and NAS technologies continue to set the pace of this market, growing faster than any other company. Unified stores have become one of the hottest product areas in the mid-tier market. EMC is in the lead here and you can expect several more important announcements from this year and beyond that will extend our capabilities in this area. So EMC's information storage sits in an intersection of some of the most important trends in IT. As customers begin their journey towards a private cloud, we are focused upon helping them make the transition at their own pace. Without product portfolio, solutions and partnerships, EMC is uniquely able to help solve their problems today while at the same time helping customers position themselves to meet their needs of tomorrow. And as you can see from our Q4 results and some of the recent success stories, we're certainly delivering what customers are looking for. We are confident we'll gain share because EMC has the best, the broadest and the most integrated storage portfolio to meet customers' needs, both now and in the future.Our RSA security revenues in Q4 were $164 million, up 7% sequentially. This business is executing well this year. Even in a tough environment, growth is positive in 2009 and finished the year up 4% overall as information-centric security continues to be a top customer priority. RSA's strategy to offer built-in information-centric security rather than bolted-on, perimeter-based security have served us well, as the industry is clearly moving on our direction. Not only have we utilized this expertise to augment the security capability of products throughout EMC, this focus has also led to new alliances with partners seeking to seamlessly improve the security of their offerings. A good clarification [ph] point is the qualification by VMware of SecureID for Virtual Desktops. We also continue to extend the lead in our information security products. For example, we have integrated DLP, an adaptive authentication into enVision, our SIEM products. Now enVision, not only marks a [ph] security event but can also tell what type of data has been affected by the event. In addition, we've extended it's capability across both physical and virtual IT infrastructures and this is a true unique capability that we built into a highly differentiated VCE Vblock offering. Finally, the recent acquisition of Archer, a leading company in the enterprise governance, risk and compliance market further extends our strategy to offer complete security solutions.Revenues from our content management and archiving division in Q4 of $208 million, up a strong 17% from Q3. This division was recognized as a leader in enterprise content management by several industry firms recently. In Q4, EMC's CMA division was positioned by Gartner in its ECM Market Leader Quadrant which recognizes companies demonstrating broad platform support, a presence in multiple regions, strong channel partners and good customer support. And early this month, Forrester recognized EMC's content management division's market leadership for its broad range of capabilities and strengths in document managements, document imaging and capture and records management. The assets in CMA's portfolio should serve us well as customers resume [ph] spending on applications that will streamline processing and enable efficient access to content.In Q4, EMC's Global Services business continued its solid performance and revenues grew 7% sequentially. Overall, we saw a recovery in our Consulting business which tends to be somewhat of a leading indicator of customers' IT plans. It's good news that we're seeing interest in investments for growth, the opportunities and integrations as opposed to what used to be mostly a focus on cost cutting.  Our professional and technical consultants are well-positioned and would be effective in helping customers to manage their various initiatives including virtual data center investments.Now turning to some highlights on the income statement.  Q4 information infrastructure non-GAAP gross margins were 55.3%, and operating margins were 21.9%. Both metrics improved sequentially, and showing especially strong year-on-year improvements from Q4 2008 non-GAAP gross margin of 52.5% and operating margin of 18.1%. For the year, non-GAAP gross margins were 52.3% and operating margins were 16.3%. This compares quite well with 2008 non-GAAP gross margins of 52.7% and operating margin of 16.6% that was achieved off a much higher revenue base. This is an excellent result and highlights our successful cost reduction efforts and is a great example of a new leverage inherent in our new financial model.  In fact, these 2009 full-year operating margins are even more impressive given they include around $55 million of transition investments and about $30 million of incremental investments in our Cloud Infrastructure and Services business.  Without these investments, non-GAAP operating margins actually would have been up versus 2008. Clearly, our cost-transformation efforts this year are paying off, and we certainly exceeded our target of $450 million in savings. We're truly moving our model to a new level of efficiency and I'd like to thank everyone at EMC for the hard work and dedication in achieving these results.Now turning to a few highlights from our consolidated results.  Total Q4 consolidated revenues were approximately $4.1 billion, up about 17% sequentially, and up 2% year-on-year. On a constant currency basis, revenues were almost flat with last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.33 and free cash flow was $793 million. Free cash flow this quarter is almost $100 million higher than Q4 non-GAAP net income. This year, we generated a record $2.6 billion in free cash flow. This is about $760 million greater than cumulative 2009 non-GAAP net income and over $40 million higher than the free cash flow in 2008. We are very pleased with the strong free cash flow generation we have achieved this year. And we continue to focus on driving free cash flow higher than non-GAAP net income.In 2009, the non-GAAP combination of interest income, interest expense and other income was a net $66 million expense. For 2010, we expect this non-operating expense to be approximately $90 million due to lower interest rates, higher non-cash interest expense and our share of historic [ph] losses in Acadia. The non-GAAP tax rate was 19% for Q4 and for the full-year 2009. We currently expect the non-GAAP tax rate in 2010 to be around 20%. Q4 consolidated operating cash flow was $1 billion. A few balance sheet items impacted Q4 operating cash flows including deferred revenues, which were $3.6 billion, inventory turns which was 7.7 and DSOs which were 47 days. All very good, given the current economic climate.We ended Q4 with $9.4 billion in cash and investments. As you may recall last quarter, we announced the plan to reorganize our international operations. While our business benefits of this plan were laid out in our announcement in November, a by-product of this reorganization was the transfer of approximately $1.3 billion from our International businesses to our domestic operations. At quarter end, approximately $4.1 billion of our cash and investments were held domestically, $2.8 billion overseas and an additional $2.5 billion was at VMware. Financial flexibility is a critical strength competitive edge for EMC, particularly in this unpredictable economy. Our financial strength allows us to continue to invest in our business during all times of economic cycles and you can expect us to continue this practice in 2010. In addition, we're able to return capital to our shareholders via buybacks. And I'm pleased to announce that we have EMC board approval for a $1 billion EMC share buyback.It is a great accomplishment for EMC to have successfully weathered the worst recession in decades and to be exiting the year in our best operational and financial position ever. The combination of EMC's vision, strategy, leading products and solutions, strong partnerships, increasingly efficient business model, great people and solid execution has made EMC stronger, more agile and more profitable. As we all know, well-run companies are continually facing the trade offs among trying to gain share, investing for the future and showing improving profitability. And while the relative folks among these three tends to ebb and flow over time, depending upon the environment, the ultimate goal is always to show progress along all three metrics.At EMC in particular, we're continually trying to optimize the trade-offs among these three objectives and in 2009, we were successful in putting in place an operational foundation that will enable us to efficiently manage the business along these three important goals. As a result, looking to 2010, we are very pleased that we'll be delivering meaningful progress towards all three objectives. To be specific, 14% top-line growth in 2010 will certainly result in significant share gains across our business. In 2010, we will invest $50 million in the future of our businesses as we continue our successful cost-transformation program. We will also accelerate the investments in our product development by increasing R&D investments by approximately 20%. And we'll continue to show profit margin improvements as we reap the benefits of our ongoing cost-transformation efforts, disciplined spending and increasingly efficient operating model. As a result, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to be 20% in 2010, a 260 basis point increase over 2009. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to grow over 24% versus 2009. I think you'll agree, serious leverage. To sum it all up, we're excited about our opportunities and we're confident in our ability to deliver a solid year, including the triple play of market share gains, investment in the future and income leverage. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe."

Now I'd like to begin by welcoming everyone to today's. call. Thank you for joining us and thank you for your interest in EMC. Looking back to Q4, I was very pleased with our overall results. Certainly the demand for storage was strong, esp",1299,"Thanks, David. Now I'd like to begin by welcoming everyone to today's. call. Thank you for joining us and thank you for your interest in EMC. Looking back to Q4, I was very pleased with our overall results. Certainly the demand for storage was strong, especially in the areas of next-generation backup to disk with integrated deduplication technologies, for storage systems that support virtualized and cloud environments, for unified storage that effectively [ph] features Fibre Channel SAN, IP SAN and NAS architectures, for storage that supports mass consolidation and business continuity and for storage that is custom-built for the SOHO market. In other words, storage opportunities in which EMC leads with innovative products, technology, solutions and services.Also, you heard from VMware yesterday, the demand for virtualization was very strong. As our customers continue to make solid progress in recovering from the effects of the great recession, they are demanding faster and better returns on their IT investment, while striving to be more environmentally conscious. They are turning to VMware and virtualization technologies in record numbers.And Q4 demand for technologies and solutions that help customers assure they are implementing and adhering to good governance principles and policies while minimizing risk was strong. This helped drive our RSA Security in our Information Management businesses. In fact, our RSA business produced year-on-year growth in each and every quarter throughout 2009. Additionally, I was very pleased with the very warm market reception our private cloud, vision, strategy and product road map and partner ecosystem has received. This bodes well for our future and it gives us confidence in our ability to grow and take market share going forward. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the global workforce of EMC and VMware.  Our team was selfless accepting and even volunteering for a 5% pay reduction to help us minimize layoffs keeping it strong, not only in 2009 but for the future. They focused on and stayed closer than ever to our customers. They were and are innovative and they executed our strategy and business plan exceedingly well. Again, thank you all very much.Looking forward into 2010, we expect the economic recovery to continue and GDP growth to be in the low single digits worldwide. Despite this prediction for continued economic recovery there is still some caution and potential for choppiness as job recovery lags. As David says on the back of this recovery, we expect overall IT spending to return to growth. Our best estimate is between 3% and 5%. We expect the storage market to grow in the 6% to 7% range and the market for security and virtualization to be in the mid-teens to low 20s. And as our 2010 outlook demonstrates, we expect to grow faster than the markets we serve take share and produce leverage. To make it clear, the 2010 forecast David gave you for consolidated EMC revenue of $16 billion, a non-GAAP EPS of $1.12 is in fact our management plan as approved by our Board of Directors. That our upcoming February meeting, the Board will add a free cash flow metric to our 2010 plan.So a question that must be on your minds is what gives us confidence we can achieve our 2010 goals. Well, first and foremost, we have a very strong product line up and product cycle that is going for us throughout 2010. Also, analyst survey after analyst survey points out that the number one hardware infrastructure spending priority for CIOs in 2010 is storage. And when the CEOs were asked what areas in storage are most important backup to this with data duplication, storage consolidation, unified storage, tin provisioning, tiering of storage and business continuity showed to be consistently high priorities. Again, areas where EMC is the leader and very importantly, these surveys had EMC gaining share. Likewise, software surveys had virtualization as a top IT spending priority for 2010 and CIOs surveys picked VMware as a number share gainer here. Also, security and Governance, Risk and Compliance, GRC were mentioned as top 10 priorities and again EMC was on a share gainers list. And lastly, what gives us optimism in 2010 is a deep belief EMC people have worldwide in our ability to help our customers to succeed. We'll give us optimism for the longer term not only in 2010 but well beyond is our focus on several rapidly emerging multi-billion-dollar markets which we believe present double-digit market growth opportunities for EMC. Our first and largest billion dollar plus opportunities is helping customers transform their current data centers into fully virtualized, fully automated dynamic flexible data centers or application workloads are truly policy- and service-level driven. While significantly lowering total costs as much as 40% lower than today's data center environments. We call these initiatives helping our customers build their own internal or private cloud.Our second mega opportunity is to work with our service provider and telco partners and help them stand up and build up their public clouds using the same technology as enterprise and commercial customers will use in building out their private clouds. This will allow enterprise customers to federate some of their workload with these external service provider clouds resulting in even better infrastructure utilization. Additionally, we will team with our service provider partners to have greater access to the SMB [small and midsize business] market. EMC will also run a set of applications as a service on top of our service provider partner public clouds. Applications like DC backup as a service, storage as service, archive as a service, elements of content management security as a service, desktop as a service and the potential list goes on and on.Our third multi-billion-dollar market opportunity is around virtualizing client devices. This V-client [ph] initiative benefits customers by allowing them to more efficiently provision users once not for each of their multiple continuously changing devices. This means not only better simpler management but better security and protection from viruses that provides a lower TCO [total cost of ownership]. Our fourth massive billion dollar plus opportunity is for EMC to lead customers to the next generation of backup recovery in archive solutions. We sized this at approximately $10 billion. This market at about $10 billion in 2009. It is extremely fragmented with EMC being a market leader. The opportunity here stems from the continuing sea of data management that customers need to better manage and protect. The attributes of automated tiered storage coupled with the best of breed data duplication technologies are the keys to success here. We are absolutely accelerate in the move to backup and recovery from tape to disk.To compete in these four rapidly emerging multi-billion-dollar opportunities, innovative technologies around virtualization. Technology like a fully functioned data center OS that incorporates a new higher level of automation management and security. Technology for federated information storage and technology that provides much more efficient and effective backup and archiving to disk the de-duplication. In other words, key innovative technology that EMC and VMware have and lead in today and are investing in heavily for the future. To further show we capitalize on these four mega opportunities before us, we are rapidly building a crest [ph] to our top-tier partners. We have indeed technology partners, distribution partners, service system integration and outsourcing partners and service providers. In short, our ecosystem will be second to none. In closing, we believe we have a compelling vision and strategy, one that is right for 2010 and well beyond, leading technology, product solutions and services and support, world-class partners and we have the leadership and a deep belief throughout our 43,000 people around the world that we can and will win. Thanks, again, and I would now like to turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call."

Couple of things really, if you look -- perhaps, the best way you look at gross margins is probably look sequentially.

But also, some good work in the field to make sure that -- while it's a very tough pricing environment we're charging intuitively for value. But if you look sequentially, what we saw was a nice improvements in both the part margins and services margins. In both cases, principally volume driven as we see additional leverage in the model as volume starts to pick up again. So that's the biggest driver, a little bit of FX impacts sequentially but mainly both parts and services margins picked up sequentially because of volume."

You saw the benefits of that happening in Q4 where on the EMC II we saw operating margins close to 22% which is much higher than we've seen for any recent period of time. So we really believe we put that cost structure in place so we can generate much more leverage on incremental revenues, but also as you said earlier we can produce that leverage whilst continue to top our investment. So if you think about revenue growth next year at 14%, R&D growth at 20 points of growth and obviously we're showing a much higher investment back into R&D. And just before I hand it over to Joe and talk about sort of what we're going to be investing in, this year you made a comment that R&D looks a little less robust and I think that's -- when you're looking at the change in year-on-year growth or decline in R&D dollars versus SG&A dollars that in turn is being impacted by a number of things including software capitalization, transition expense and acquisitions. And if you could pull those three out, the year-on-year decline in those lines actually much closer than they look on the financial statements.

And of course, as we really get to this next generation of how we take this cloud computing and really bring it. The internal or private cloud markets is going to be a big, big, big opportunity for us on how we really execute on that is phenomenal. And then the reception of the combination of the Data Domain and Avamar products there's nothing short of exceptional. So I would say those are the things and markets and opportunities for us that come to the top of my mind."

There are lot of positives in today's results, and as we start the call, I wanted to highlight a few for you. EMC showed good progress through 2009 and ended the year with very solid growth in Q4 with revenues of $4.1 billion, up 17% from Q3 '09, non-GAAP EPS of $0.33, up 43% and free cash flow of $793 million, up 6%. These quarter results provide a good example of the resiliency in our model with revenues up 2% over Q4 '08 demonstrating good profit leverage with non-GAAP EPS of 6% and solid free cash flow generation of 2%. Within these results, our EMC Information Infrastructure business had a good quarter with $3.5 billion of revenue, up 15% sequentially and $0.28 of non-GAAP EPS, up 40% from Q3. On a year-on-year basis, non-GAAP EPS was up 12% on flat revenue, a result that clearly shows the success of our cost-transformation efforts. As previously announced, VMware also had a strong fourth quarter, contributing $607 million of revenue, and almost $0.05 of non-GAAP EPS to EMC and showed very good growth from Q3. Given the tough global economic conditions and an IT spending environment down across the board, EMC performed well as we move through 2009. Our vision, strategy and most importantly, the hard work and sacrifice of EMC team has enabled our company to come out of the year with business momentum and very well-positioned to grow and gain share in 2010 and beyond.It is especially worthy to note that even in this economic [ph] climates, the consolidated Q4 revenues, Q4 non-GAAP operating margin, Q4 non-GAAP EPS and Q4 free cash flow results were all records for EMC. In other words, EMC is coming out of the worst global recession we've seen in our best financial shape ever. We think this is truly impressive.Beyond the financial metrics, we have accomplished a lot in 2009. We maintained good focus on our golden opportunity despite numerous economic and market distractions. We stayed close to customers and helped them through a tough time while other vendors cut back. We rolled out new market leading products with the best quality in our history. We successfully implemented our biggest cost-transformation program ever and strengthened our operational and financial position. We used our financial strength wisely to continue to invest in R&D and to make strategic acquisitions, both of which will contribute to our ongoing success. And we improved our customer satisfaction and loyalty metrics at an important time when customers are looking to solidify their true business partners. While 2009 was a tough year, EMC achieved a lot of good things and exited the year in a very strong position.So moving to the agenda for today's call, I will start off by making some comments about the Q4 spending environment, our business outlook for 2010 and then discuss some more specific details from our Q4 results. Overall, the environment in 2009 turned out pretty much as we anticipated, and showed reasonable stability at the end of the year. While there's still uncertainty as customers evaluate their own business prospects and plans, we do expect 2010 to be better than 2009. Joe will spend some time discussing the 2010 environment in his comments.  More than that [ph] is that we currently see IT spending growing between 3% and 5% in 2010.  Given the compelling dynamics we see in our target markets, we continue to expect EMC's total addressable market to grow faster than IT overall, probably something near 6% to 8%. And lastly, given EMC's strategic focus on the shift of private cloud and our leadership position in the most important opportunities such as storage tiering, virtualization security, next-generation backup etc., we believe that EMC is poised to grow even fast and gain share.As a result, we currently anticipate 2010 consolidated revenues of approximately $16 billion, up 14% and we expect significant leverage with non-GAAP operating margins of 20% and non-GAAP EPS of approximately $1.12, up over 24% from last year. This projected growth demonstrates the strength of our unique strategic positioning, ability to gain share and the earnings leverage inherent in our leaner financial model. Given what we see in the markets and our understanding of customer spend plans, we currently expect our quarterly revenue contribution in 2010 to follow reasonably normal seasonal patterns.Now let's take a closer look at some of the financial highlights from the fourth quarter. EMC information infrastructure revenues were $3.5 billion, up 15% sequentially and flat year-to-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.28, up 40% quarter-on-quarter and up 12% from last year, very good leverage in a very tough year.  Within this overall numbers, information infrastructure product revenues were almost $2.4 billion, up 20% quarter-to-quarter and information infrastructure services revenues were bit over $1.1 billion, up 7% sequentially.  Free cash flow was $554 million. Looking at the geographic results from our Information Infrastructure business, our revenues from North America represented about 56% of total and were up a solid 13% sequentially and down 1% from Q4 2008. EMEA and Latin America both have strong sequential growth, up 23% and 17% respectively from Q3 and both were up around 1% year-on-year. APJ also improved from Q3 and was up 6%. The BRIC + 13 countries continue to show strength, up 14% quarter-on-quarter and 5% year-on-year. A very positive data point is that these markets were also up 1% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and this is encouraging to see.Looking at results from the businesses within information infrastructure, Q4 information storage revenues were $3.1 billion, up 16% sequentially. Overall, we're seeing an increase in net new implementations as customers are looking to put in place infrastructure to support their virtual environments.  As part of these investments, we continue to see very strong growth in the adoption of tiered storage, utilizing solid states and SATA drives. In addition, the recent introduction of our fully automated storage tiering software known as FAST is a compelling and unique capability that is enabling customers to improve efficiency via storage tiering across more of their environments. Overall, we believe that demand will continue to strengthen for our broad and deep storage portfolio as customers look to deploy more efficient, flexible and cost-effective technology.In the high end, Symmetrix revenues were up 13% sequentially, a very good result as the V-max continues its positive ramp. The introduction of FAST is also driving more rapid adoption of both SSD and SATA drives in Symmetrix, as customers look to take advantage of the unique value of V-max-based storage tiering. The ramp of this new product is proceeding very well. It's clearly extending our lead in the high-end storage market and is very well positioned as customers invest in their cloud infrastructures.Not only is the V-max very successful in the more traditional high-end markets where the Symmetrix has always done well, but its scalable architecture and unique capabilities are receiving a very good response in new-use cases such as Internet hosting. For example, in Q4, we won a V-Max deal to completely replace a competitor at one of our biggest customers, a major telco-based hosting provider.Now let's take a look at the Mid-Tier business, including our Celerra and CLARiiON product families. Within this, CLARiiON revenues were up 15% sequentially, a nice acceleration over Q3 growth. Direct and Channel business [ph] continue to be about 75% of total CLARiiON revenues.  Within the CLARiiON results, the Dell-EMC co-branded CLARiiON OEM revenues were up 27% sequentially, and represented about 16% of total CLARiiON revenues.Our Celerra NAS business continues to be a great performer, posting the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year revenue growth in Q4, with revenues up over 50%. Our unified products combined our best-of-breed [indiscernible] capabilities without sacrificing performance in either environment, and our success  here continues to set pace in the industry. In Q3, we are number one in the market with 46% share according to IDC and given our outstanding performance, it's pretty clear we gained share again in Q4. As example of our success here, we recently beaten NetApp and others for a large deal, including 1.4 petabytes of unified storage at a major New York-based stock exchange. This market shift towards unified storage is a very important trend in the mid-tier that I'll talk a little bit more about later on.Our newly formed backup recovery system division which we call BRS have fantastic results again this quarter. In fact, Data Domain and Avamar were each up over 50% year-on-year in Q4. With BRS, I'm happy to say that Data Domain were ahead of plan in its first full quarter as part of the EMC family. The excellent focus and execution by the teams had led to the continued growth and success of these businesses. As an example of the growth potential synergy within this business, we added 600 new customers in the quarter with 300 of these being net new to EMC.  Given the growth, this business is clearly very strategic to customers and EMC is also the acknowledged leader in this important area. As an indicator of our strength and market leadership, in the forthcoming IDC survey, respondents chose either an EMC or Data Domain primary branded [ph] deduplication solution at nearly double the rate of the next nearest vendor. This means that we have almost twice as much mind share as anyone else in this great market and we show the ability to capture it.Taking a look at a few other storage related businesses, our Mozy Cloud-based Backup business is now managing over 25 terabytes of customer data, and launched services this quarter in conjunction with partners, Cox, McAfee and Vodafone. This year, Mozy will also expand beyond online backup through a broad set of personal cloud services. In addition, Iomega, our custom and small-business focused operation is seeing an increasing customer demand for backup and protection and in Q4, shipped over one exabyte of storage, more than double the capacity shipped last Q4. Iomega continues to roll out new and compelling products as highlighted by winning an Editor's Choice Award with the vClone products at CES. And by the fact that the Iomega brand is one of the most popular storage solutions at Apple stores.In total, the EMC Storage business finished 2009 with very good momentum due to great products compelling solutions and focused execution by the team. Importantly, we believe that we are poised to  really extend our lead this year for three additional reasons: To move to virtualized data centers, the implementation of next-gen backup and recovery and the evolution of unified storage. Let me spend a few moments to highlight each of these trends with you.First of all, the virtualization of the data center is beginning in earnest, as customers are looking to move towards a private cloud, and EMC is absolutely best positioned to benefit from this. Some recent survey results from Goldman Sachs really highlight these facts. As you can see in the first chart, customers are looking to put a lot of incremental spending towards next-generation technologies this year. And this survey shows over two thirds of these customers will move at least 20% of their data centers in this direction by the end of 2010.  Obviously, a major factor of this next-gen technology is server virtualization. And not only is VMware the leader in this space but EMC is the clear storage vendor of choice in virtualized service environments. As you can see on the next chart, EMC is preferred by 38% of the survey participants and with more than twice the mind share of the next closest competitor. And, I might add, over three times as much mind share of the smaller vendor who has been making a lot of noise about this topic lately. I think that puts rhetoric to rest. And finally, as virtualized storage becomes more prevalent with custom environments, EMC is once again at the forefront with 34% of customers surveyed, saying they would choose EMC when they implement storage virtualization technology. As you can see, not only does EMC already have 50% more mind share than the next vendor, you can also expect us to make several announcements throughout 2010 that will extend our lead in this important area.The second major trend is the rapid implementation of next-gen backup and recovery capabilities. The benefits of this solution are becoming well-known including simplicity, efficiency, flexibility, manageability and cost savings, so customer demand is very high. This is also a vastly under-penetrated opportunity. In the same IDC survey I mentioned earlier, the survey also indicates that only 22% of respondents have implemented deduplication for backup data. Obviously, we are already seeing great success here and with the leading products in both forms of data deduplication with Data Domain and Avamar with tremendous mind share in the market and a clearly under-penetrated opportunity, we should be able to drive a lot of growth here.The third trend is that the market is moving towards more of a unified storage approach in the mid-tier, this year and into the future. In other words, customer requirements for flexibility and best-of-breed performance are propelling the desire for products that truly unify the best capabilities to manage block, file and object information. Although previously mentioned, our current unified products based upon a leading SAN and NAS technologies continue to set the pace of this market, growing faster than any other company. Unified stores have become one of the hottest product areas in the mid-tier market. EMC is in the lead here and you can expect several more important announcements from this year and beyond that will extend our capabilities in this area. So EMC's information storage sits in an intersection of some of the most important trends in IT. As customers begin their journey towards a private cloud, we are focused upon helping them make the transition at their own pace. Without product portfolio, solutions and partnerships, EMC is uniquely able to help solve their problems today while at the same time helping customers position themselves to meet their needs of tomorrow. And as you can see from our Q4 results and some of the recent success stories, we're certainly delivering what customers are looking for. We are confident we'll gain share because EMC has the best, the broadest and the most integrated storage portfolio to meet customers' needs, both now and in the future.Our RSA security revenues in Q4 were $164 million, up 7% sequentially. This business is executing well this year. Even in a tough environment, growth is positive in 2009 and finished the year up 4% overall as information-centric security continues to be a top customer priority. RSA's strategy to offer built-in information-centric security rather than bolted-on, perimeter-based security have served us well, as the industry is clearly moving on our direction. Not only have we utilized this expertise to augment the security capability of products throughout EMC, this focus has also led to new alliances with partners seeking to seamlessly improve the security of their offerings. A good clarification [ph] point is the qualification by VMware of SecureID for Virtual Desktops. We also continue to extend the lead in our information security products. For example, we have integrated DLP, an adaptive authentication into enVision, our SIEM products. Now enVision, not only marks a [ph] security event but can also tell what type of data has been affected by the event. In addition, we've extended it's capability across both physical and virtual IT infrastructures and this is a true unique capability that we built into a highly differentiated VCE Vblock offering. Finally, the recent acquisition of Archer, a leading company in the enterprise governance, risk and compliance market further extends our strategy to offer complete security solutions.Revenues from our content management and archiving division in Q4 of $208 million, up a strong 17% from Q3. This division was recognized as a leader in enterprise content management by several industry firms recently. In Q4, EMC's CMA division was positioned by Gartner in its ECM Market Leader Quadrant which recognizes companies demonstrating broad platform support, a presence in multiple regions, strong channel partners and good customer support. And early this month, Forrester recognized EMC's content management division's market leadership for its broad range of capabilities and strengths in document managements, document imaging and capture and records management. The assets in CMA's portfolio should serve us well as customers resume [ph] spending on applications that will streamline processing and enable efficient access to content.In Q4, EMC's Global Services business continued its solid performance and revenues grew 7% sequentially. Overall, we saw a recovery in our Consulting business which tends to be somewhat of a leading indicator of customers' IT plans. It's good news that we're seeing interest in investments for growth, the opportunities and integrations as opposed to what used to be mostly a focus on cost cutting.  Our professional and technical consultants are well-positioned and would be effective in helping customers to manage their various initiatives including virtual data center investments.Now turning to some highlights on the income statement.  Q4 information infrastructure non-GAAP gross margins were 55.3%, and operating margins were 21.9%. Both metrics improved sequentially, and showing especially strong year-on-year improvements from Q4 2008 non-GAAP gross margin of 52.5% and operating margin of 18.1%. For the year, non-GAAP gross margins were 52.3% and operating margins were 16.3%. This compares quite well with 2008 non-GAAP gross margins of 52.7% and operating margin of 16.6% that was achieved off a much higher revenue base. This is an excellent result and highlights our successful cost reduction efforts and is a great example of a new leverage inherent in our new financial model.  In fact, these 2009 full-year operating margins are even more impressive given they include around $55 million of transition investments and about $30 million of incremental investments in our Cloud Infrastructure and Services business.  Without these investments, non-GAAP operating margins actually would have been up versus 2008. Clearly, our cost-transformation efforts this year are paying off, and we certainly exceeded our target of $450 million in savings. We're truly moving our model to a new level of efficiency and I'd like to thank everyone at EMC for the hard work and dedication in achieving these results.Now turning to a few highlights from our consolidated results.  Total Q4 consolidated revenues were approximately $4.1 billion, up about 17% sequentially, and up 2% year-on-year. On a constant currency basis, revenues were almost flat with last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.33 and free cash flow was $793 million. Free cash flow this quarter is almost $100 million higher than Q4 non-GAAP net income. This year, we generated a record $2.6 billion in free cash flow. This is about $760 million greater than cumulative 2009 non-GAAP net income and over $40 million higher than the free cash flow in 2008. We are very pleased with the strong free cash flow generation we have achieved this year. And we continue to focus on driving free cash flow higher than non-GAAP net income.In 2009, the non-GAAP combination of interest income, interest expense and other income was a net $66 million expense. For 2010, we expect this non-operating expense to be approximately $90 million due to lower interest rates, higher non-cash interest expense and our share of historic [ph] losses in Acadia. The non-GAAP tax rate was 19% for Q4 and for the full-year 2009. We currently expect the non-GAAP tax rate in 2010 to be around 20%. Q4 consolidated operating cash flow was $1 billion. A few balance sheet items impacted Q4 operating cash flows including deferred revenues, which were $3.6 billion, inventory turns which was 7.7 and DSOs which were 47 days. All very good, given the current economic climate.We ended Q4 with $9.4 billion in cash and investments. As you may recall last quarter, we announced the plan to reorganize our international operations. While our business benefits of this plan were laid out in our announcement in November, a by-product of this reorganization was the transfer of approximately $1.3 billion from our International businesses to our domestic operations. At quarter end, approximately $4.1 billion of our cash and investments were held domestically, $2.8 billion overseas and an additional $2.5 billion was at VMware. Financial flexibility is a critical strength competitive edge for EMC, particularly in this unpredictable economy. Our financial strength allows us to continue to invest in our business during all times of economic cycles and you can expect us to continue this practice in 2010. In addition, we're able to return capital to our shareholders via buybacks. And I'm pleased to announce that we have EMC board approval for a $1 billion EMC share buyback.It is a great accomplishment for EMC to have successfully weathered the worst recession in decades and to be exiting the year in our best operational and financial position ever. The combination of EMC's vision, strategy, leading products and solutions, strong partnerships, increasingly efficient business model, great people and solid execution has made EMC stronger, more agile and more profitable. As we all know, well-run companies are continually facing the trade offs among trying to gain share, investing for the future and showing improving profitability. And while the relative folks among these three tends to ebb and flow over time, depending upon the environment, the ultimate goal is always to show progress along all three metrics.At EMC in particular, we're continually trying to optimize the trade-offs among these three objectives and in 2009, we were successful in putting in place an operational foundation that will enable us to efficiently manage the business along these three important goals. As a result, looking to 2010, we are very pleased that we'll be delivering meaningful progress towards all three objectives. To be specific, 14% top-line growth in 2010 will certainly result in significant share gains across our business. In 2010, we will invest $50 million in the future of our businesses as we continue our successful cost-transformation program. We will also accelerate the investments in our product development by increasing R&D investments by approximately 20%. And we'll continue to show profit margin improvements as we reap the benefits of our ongoing cost-transformation efforts, disciplined spending and increasingly efficient operating model. As a result, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to be 20% in 2010, a 260 basis point increase over 2009. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to grow over 24% versus 2009. I think you'll agree, serious leverage. To sum it all up, we're excited about our opportunities and we're confident in our ability to deliver a solid year, including the triple play of market share gains, investment in the future and income leverage. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe."

Looking back to Q4, I was very pleased with our overall results. Certainly the demand for storage was strong, especially in the areas of next-generation backup to disk with integrated deduplication technologies, for storage systems that support virtualized and cloud environments, for unified storage that effectively [ph] features Fibre Channel SAN, IP SAN and NAS architectures, for storage that supports mass consolidation and business continuity and for storage that is custom-built for the SOHO market. In other words, storage opportunities in which EMC leads with innovative products, technology, solutions and services.Also, you heard from VMware yesterday, the demand for virtualization was very strong. As our customers continue to make solid progress in recovering from the effects of the great recession, they are demanding faster and better returns on their IT investment, while striving to be more environmentally conscious. They are turning to VMware and virtualization technologies in record numbers.And Q4 demand for technologies and solutions that help customers assure they are implementing and adhering to good governance principles and policies while minimizing risk was strong. This helped drive our RSA Security in our Information Management businesses. In fact, our RSA business produced year-on-year growth in each and every quarter throughout 2009. Additionally, I was very pleased with the very warm market reception our private cloud, vision, strategy and product road map and partner ecosystem has received. This bodes well for our future and it gives us confidence in our ability to grow and take market share going forward. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the global workforce of EMC and VMware.  Our team was selfless accepting and even volunteering for a 5% pay reduction to help us minimize layoffs keeping it strong, not only in 2009 but for the future. They focused on and stayed closer than ever to our customers. They were and are innovative and they executed our strategy and business plan exceedingly well. Again, thank you all very much.Looking forward into 2010, we expect the economic recovery to continue and GDP growth to be in the low single digits worldwide. Despite this prediction for continued economic recovery there is still some caution and potential for choppiness as job recovery lags. As David says on the back of this recovery, we expect overall IT spending to return to growth. Our best estimate is between 3% and 5%. We expect the storage market to grow in the 6% to 7% range and the market for security and virtualization to be in the mid-teens to low 20s. And as our 2010 outlook demonstrates, we expect to grow faster than the markets we serve take share and produce leverage. To make it clear, the 2010 forecast David gave you for consolidated EMC revenue of $16 billion, a non-GAAP EPS of $1.12 is in fact our management plan as approved by our Board of Directors. That our upcoming February meeting, the Board will add a free cash flow metric to our 2010 plan.So a question that must be on your minds is what gives us confidence we can achieve our 2010 goals. Well, first and foremost, we have a very strong product line up and product cycle that is going for us throughout 2010. Also, analyst survey after analyst survey points out that the number one hardware infrastructure spending priority for CIOs in 2010 is storage. And when the CEOs were asked what areas in storage are most important backup to this with data duplication, storage consolidation, unified storage, tin provisioning, tiering of storage and business continuity showed to be consistently high priorities. Again, areas where EMC is the leader and very importantly, these surveys had EMC gaining share. Likewise, software surveys had virtualization as a top IT spending priority for 2010 and CIOs surveys picked VMware as a number share gainer here. Also, security and Governance, Risk and Compliance, GRC were mentioned as top 10 priorities and again EMC was on a share gainers list. And lastly, what gives us optimism in 2010 is a deep belief EMC people have worldwide in our ability to help our customers to succeed. We'll give us optimism for the longer term not only in 2010 but well beyond is our focus on several rapidly emerging multi-billion-dollar markets which we believe present double-digit market growth opportunities for EMC. Our first and largest billion dollar plus opportunities is helping customers transform their current data centers into fully virtualized, fully automated dynamic flexible data centers or application workloads are truly policy- and service-level driven. While significantly lowering total costs as much as 40% lower than today's data center environments. We call these initiatives helping our customers build their own internal or private cloud.Our second mega opportunity is to work with our service provider and telco partners and help them stand up and build up their public clouds using the same technology as enterprise and commercial customers will use in building out their private clouds. This will allow enterprise customers to federate some of their workload with these external service provider clouds resulting in even better infrastructure utilization. Additionally, we will team with our service provider partners to have greater access to the SMB [small and midsize business] market. EMC will also run a set of applications as a service on top of our service provider partner public clouds. Applications like DC backup as a service, storage as service, archive as a service, elements of content management security as a service, desktop as a service and the potential list goes on and on.Our third multi-billion-dollar market opportunity is around virtualizing client devices. This V-client [ph] initiative benefits customers by allowing them to more efficiently provision users once not for each of their multiple continuously changing devices. This means not only better simpler management but better security and protection from viruses that provides a lower TCO [total cost of ownership]. Our fourth massive billion dollar plus opportunity is for EMC to lead customers to the next generation of backup recovery in archive solutions. We sized this at approximately $10 billion. This market at about $10 billion in 2009. It is extremely fragmented with EMC being a market leader. The opportunity here stems from the continuing sea of data management that customers need to better manage and protect. The attributes of automated tiered storage coupled with the best of breed data duplication technologies are the keys to success here. We are absolutely accelerate in the move to backup and recovery from tape to disk.To compete in these four rapidly emerging multi-billion-dollar opportunities, innovative technologies around virtualization. Technology like a fully functioned data center OS that incorporates a new higher level of automation management and security. Technology for federated information storage and technology that provides much more efficient and effective backup and archiving to disk the de-duplication. In other words, key innovative technology that EMC and VMware have and lead in today and are investing in heavily for the future. To further show we capitalize on these four mega opportunities before us, we are rapidly building a crest [ph] to our top-tier partners. We have indeed technology partners, distribution partners, service system integration and outsourcing partners and service providers. In short, our ecosystem will be second to none. In closing, we believe we have a compelling vision and strategy, one that is right for 2010 and well beyond, leading technology, product solutions and services and support, world-class partners and we have the leadership and a deep belief throughout our 43,000 people around the world that we can and will win. Thanks, again, and I would now like to turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call."

But also, some good work in the field to make sure that -- while it's a very tough pricing environment we're charging intuitively for value. But if you look sequentially, what we saw was a nice improvements in both the part margins and services margins. In both cases, principally volume driven as we see additional leverage in the model as volume starts to pick up again. So that's the biggest driver, a little bit of FX impacts sequentially but mainly both parts and services margins picked up sequentially because of volume."

You saw the benefits of that happening in Q4 where on the EMC II we saw operating margins close to 22% which is much higher than we've seen for any recent period of time. So we really believe we put that cost structure in place so we can generate much more leverage on incremental revenues, but also as you said earlier we can produce that leverage whilst continue to top our investment. So if you think about revenue growth next year at 14%, R&D growth at 20 points of growth and obviously we're showing a much higher investment back into R&D. And just before I hand it over to Joe and talk about sort of what we're going to be investing in, this year you made a comment that R&D looks a little less robust and I think that's -- when you're looking at the change in year-on-year growth or decline in R&D dollars versus SG&A dollars that in turn is being impacted by a number of things including software capitalization, transition expense and acquisitions. And if you could pull those three out, the year-on-year decline in those lines actually much closer than they look on the financial statements.

So we're up close to three quarters total mix this quarter coming from V-max versus DMX and yes, because of the design of the V-max. It does inherently -- particularly now we got up to our higher volumes of production levels, cost us less on a per box or per capacity basis. Therefore, margins are better and that is one of the reasons why you saw our margin uptick as well in Q3 to Q4. The mix shifting from about a level of 50% of total to close to 75% helped us a little bit as we move through the progression between the two quarters."

These results speak to the strength of our leadership position in some of the most important areas of IT and to the power of our operational model.
We clearly executed on our triple play. We gained market share, we invested for the future and we improved profitability. We’re confident that we will continue to execute in all three of these areas going forward.
Within these numbers, each of our two businesses had excellent results. Our EMC Information Infrastructure business had a great quarter with $3.3 billion in revenue up 22% year on year and $0.21 of non-GAAP EPS almost double our EPS from last Q1. VMware also had a great quarter contributing $632 million of revenue up 34% year on year and $0.05 of non-GAAP EPS to EMC. Customers are increasing recognizing that VMware is the strategic layer on which to build their next generation cloud data centers.
I’ll start off this morning by making some comments about the Q1 spending environment, why EMC is thriving and then I’ll discuss some details from our Q1 results. There are three major factors contributed to our excellent revenue performance this quarter. First of all, based upon what we saw in the marketplace, we think IT spending looks to be on track with what we’ve been expecting, up around 3% to 5% this year. In addition, customer activity and commentary is consistent with the view that our addressable market will be up around 6% to 8% this year.
A second factor this quarter was the continuation of some pent up demand that we saw in Q4. EMC Information Infrastructure business the strength is concentrated in the US storage business especially in financial services. While it’s difficult to quantify it was certainly a positive. As a result of these two factors, we think growth in IT spending and our target marketplace in 2010 will end up at the higher end of our projected ranges.
Third, and most important, we expect to gain a significant amount of share this year and it seems pretty clear we’re off to a good start in this regard. EMC grew faster than our target market for a number of reasons including our expanding role as a trusted partner with customers, our leading technology in several of the hottest areas of IT today, our proven support and service to back up the technology, and our compelling vision and ability to execute on this vision.
As a result, we’re increasingly the best guide for customer’s journeys to private cloud and we believe this competitive advantage is the major factor enabling us to show strong growth and gain share. And it positions us well to continue to gain share going forward.
Given this unique combination of strategic market and technology advantages we now anticipate 2010 consolidated revenues of $16.5 billion up 18%, non-GAAP operating margin of 20% to 21% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.18 up 31% from last year.
Now let’s take a closer look at some of the financial highlights from the first quarter. As I mentioned, EMC Information Infrastructure revenues were $3.3 billion up 22% year on year. Non-GAAP earnings per share for EMC II were $0.21 up 91% from last year. Free cash flow was a very strong $819 million up 66%.
Within these overall numbers, strong demand for our Information Infrastructure products generated revenues of $2.2 billion up 27% from last year while Information Infrastructure services were $1.1 billion up 13%. The fact that products were so much better than services is an encouraging sign that customers are moving forward with their infrastructure investments.
EMC Information Infrastructure operating performance for the quarter was also very strong. Non-GAAP gross margins were 53.4% and non-GAAP operating margins were 17.8% in Q1. These substantial year on year improvements stem from higher volumes, a better prospects and the measures we’ve taken to lower and streamline our cost structure.
Looking at the revenue results from each of the businesses within Information Infrastructure, Q1 Information Storage revenues were $2.9 billion up 24%. As always, information growth continued to be a key driver. We also saw customers beginning new projects in their existing traditional infrastructures. I looked at both of these was continued growth in the number of customers that are moving to virtual data center infrastructures. All three of these drivers benefited us in the quarter as EMC is a trusted partner not only for customer’s requirements today but also going forward as they embark on their own journeys to a private cloud.
In the high end, Symmetrix product revenues were up 28% year on year. Our V-Max transition is essentially complete. Customers are eager to benefit from its more efficient flexible and cost effective technology and we’re clearly gaining share. Today’s applications required architecture scales with their business needs. 
In Q1 one of the largest software companies in the world chose V-Max for its ability to scale capacity and performance and to support critical online applications. The combination of proven reliability along with cost effective storage tiering utilizing fiber channel, solid state, and stated drives provided this customer with the best value.
Now turning to the Mid-tier, over the last few years we’ve seen a shift in the way customers utilize mid-tier storage. The rapidly changing business environment in this tier increasingly requires the adaptability of multi-protocol systems and growing virtualized serve environment intensify the need for these dynamic storage capabilities. 
As a result, customers are increasingly looking for mid-tier storage that’s capable of supporting multiple information types and communication protocols. We have been lock set with customers throughout this transition. For years we’ve been the technology leader in the mid-tier for these capabilities and we began to combine some of them when we introduced our market leading unified products in 2006.
While we haven’t previously disclosed our overall mid-tier revenues today we’re expanding our reporting to help you track our progress here. In Q1 our mid-tier storage product revenues were $800 million and grew a very robust 32% year on year. This amounts to a $3.2 billion annualized run rate from our mid-tier product revenues alone. This annualized number is quite conservative as it does not include support, updates or other services revenue and is being annualized based on our seasonally smallest quarter.
We gained share in the mid-tier due to the breadth and depth of our portfolio and the world class service and support to back it up. Let me give you a couple of examples from Q1 of how we’re winning in this space. A large medical services company was looking for unified storage, replication, disaster recovery, backup and recovery, the duplication and path managements. We won this multi million dollar deal again NetApp on the strength of our mid-tier portfolio as well as our replication and recovery capabilites within the customers clustered VMware environments.
Another win was a global online content services provider who selected EMC over NetApp for a couple of reasons. EMC’s superior role to usable efficiency resulting in lower total cost ownership and compelling duplication and VMware integration. 
Our relationship with Dell strengthened in the quarter and we were pleased to announce an expansion of our partnership to include additional mid-tier products. Channel partners including Dell are extremely important to our ongoing success in the mid-tier and we’re very focused on expanding these partnerships. 
Our efforts here have really paid off as EMC was recently named 2010 CRN Channel Champion. Channels were a big contributor to our mid-tier business at approximately 75% of our mid-tier product revenues in Q1.
It should also be noted that our mid-tier revenues are more weighted towards the high end of the mid-tier markets. We’re excited about the opportunity to expand our footprint into the faster growing low end of the mid-tier and are mobilizing the people, investing in the products, and engaging the partners to make this happen.
Our success in the high end of the mid-tier is driven by our ability to satisfy customer’s needs today no matter where they are on their journey to the private cloud. EMC has been leading the charge on most of the important new technology and information infrastructure today. These include virtualization data centers, SSDs and automated storage tiering, and next generation backup and recovery.
As our biggest most immediate and most important growth opportunity, the evolution to fully virtualized data centers is where we’re focusing the majority of our efforts. Fundamental to the virtualized data centers is the creation and integration of virtual servers and virtual storage infrastructures. Clearly we are far and away the leader on the service side with VMware. In addition, our unique vision around the virtualization of the information storage infrastructure is resonating with the industry and you can expect to hear more from us soon on how we’re going to make this happen.
We also continue to lead the charge in virtualization infinity across our product set both directions. In other words, we are unique in being able to see and manage from storage to virtual machine and from virtual machine to storage and the connections continue to grow. These capabilities are key to new way of thinking about data center design and no company is as well positioned as EMC to help customers.
Our fully automated storage tiering software, known as FAST completed its first quarter availability in Q1 including double digit penetration rates in the high end. Customers clearly see the value proposition of having the right data in the right place at the right time. Turning this advanced capability into a feature across our fall solution set further extends our competitive advantage as customers prefer to buy from a partner with a comprehensive solution as opposed to buying point products.
Our backup recovery systems business performed ahead of our high expectations. In fact, Data domain and Avamar each accelerated over 100% growth in the quarter. The synergy between these two is key to the acceleration here and these businesses are certainly growing faster than any other duplication technology in the markets. It’s great to see this business systematically capitalize upon opportunities worldwide over EMC’s existing accounts and with net new customers as well.
In other storage areas, online backup solution Mozy continued its strategy in the quarter to build its customer base via service providers, adding Comcast to an already long list of partners. Iomega continued to thrive on the unrelenting demand from customers wanting plug and play storage for all their media types. In addition, we’re seeing increased demand from small and medium businesses that want easy to use network storage.
In sum, EMC storage business in the quarter outperformed our expectations due to our ability to provide leading edge technology in a comprehensive solution that is supported by our world class of services organization. There is no vendor with a broad and innovative technology solutions set, the depth of experience and a proven track record to provide information infrastructures that can safely and securely transition customers data centers at their own pace to private clouds.
Our RSA security revenues in Q1 were $161 million up 13% year on year as information centric security remains a key customer priority. There are several noteworthy events for RSA this quarter including RSA annual marquee security conference and the acquisition of Archer. Delegate’s attendance at the RSA conference was up 25% from last year attesting to the growing importance of IT security. The addition of Archer’s governance, risk and compliance technology complements our existing DLP and envision S-I-E-M tools to create one security management platform. The resulting level of visibility shines a welcome security and compliance spotlight into both physical and virtualized environments.
In addition, in Q1 RSA Archer, VMware, and Intel introduced a concept for compliance security and control down to the most fundamental layers of multi-tenant virtualized infrastructure. This is an important early step to help accelerate the growth of x-general clouds. With the addition of Archer, RSA is now the leader in every area in which it competes; authentication, IT GRC, DLP, S-I-E-M and web fraud detection.
Revenues from our concept management and archiving division in Q1 were $178 million up 2% from Q1 ’09. We saw increased customer activity with new license growth up 8%, a higher number of big deals done in Q4 and a strong pipeline exiting Q1. Our XEP composition platform for management which is unique in the industry, is garnering a lot of customer interest. In fact, a major European national health system has standardized upon XEP for its health records.
A sharper focus on partnerships is also expanding CMAs growth opportunities in 2010. These include our recently announced partnership with FatWire to improve web content management as well as a new relationship with SAP to provide a number of SAP focused ECM solutions, the first of which we plan to announce in the next few weeks.
EMC’s global services business once again showed strong results in the quarter with revenues up 13% over last year’s Q1. Our professional and technical services are doing well and our consulting business continues to outperform, benefiting from customers transitions to virtual data center architectures. In fact, EMC consulting expertise was key to winning the first phase of a long term collaboration with a 4100 defense contractor to accelerate transformation of their data centers to a service oriented private cloud model. Such an undertaking requires deep expertise in cloud strategy and architecture as well as the infrastructure products that are being purpose built for such environments. This is why they chose EMC.
Our partnership with Cisco continues to gain momentum. In Q1 our VCE coalition was up and running. Its focus on helping customers accelerate their move to cloud infrastructures has really struck a cord and interest has been outstanding. Customers are already in production with V-Blocks and will soon be rolling out a lower end version of the V-Block. Over the next few months you will see exciting announcements from both systems integrators and service providers leveraging the work of this coalition of best of breed technology companies.
Now turning to a few highlights from our consolidated results; including both our Information Infrastructure and Virtual Infrastructure businesses. As I mentioned, the EMC Information Infrastructure business has revenues of $3.3 billion, non-GAAP operating margins of 17.8%, and contributed non-GAAP EPS of $0.21 and free cash flow of $819 million. The VMware Virtual Infrastructure business had revenues of $632 million, non-GAAP operating margins of 28.1%, and contributed non-GAAP EPS of $0.05 and free cash flow of $291 million.
Together our two businesses had total Q1 consolidated revenues of approximately $3.9 billion, up 23% year on year, non-GAAP operating margins of 19.5% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion, $561 million higher than Q1 non-GAAP net income. These consolidated results represent the combined power of Virtual Infrastructure and Information Infrastructure. Together we’re moving forward on a shared vision and strategic direction. Additionally, through complementary efforts we’re increasing affinity between the Virtual and Information Infrastructures.
This strategic alignment positions us well to execute our triple play to gain market share, to invest in the future, and to improve profitability. As you can see, from our revised 2010 revenue growth guidance of 18% we intent to grow substantially faster than our target market in gained share. 
Second, we’re investing for the future. We continue to plan to expand our R&D spend by 20% over last year and we’re further adding to our sales capability worldwide, particularly in emerging markets and the commercial and S&B markets. We now plan to implement a broad base annual compensation review to reward and retain our workforce which has been outstanding throughout what has been a very challenging period.
Third, these increased investments; notwithstanding, we expect to further improve profitability. We now expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin for 2010 to reach between 20% and 21% representing a substantial increase over the levels seen from the past several years.
Now a few housekeeping items. Currency added 240 basis point to the year on year revenue growth on a consolidated basis. The Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was 22%, higher than expected as renewal of the US R&D tax credit has not yet been passed. We still expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be around 20% as we project the tax rate will occur later this year, possibly as lat as the fourth quarter. Q1 consolidated operating cash flow was $1.3 billion up 53%. The improvements generated these strong results include better revenues which were $4 billion, inventory turns which were eight times, and DSOs which were 40 days.
Due to the improvements in our stock price we now expect our fully diluted share count for the year to be around 2.15 billion, the difference from the 2.12 billion we disclosed in January is primarily due to the impact of our convertible debt.
We ended Q1 with $10.2 billion in cash and investments; of this a total of $6.2 billion was held in the US with the remainder overseas. In the quarter, we used $176 million of our cash to buy back 10 million shares of EMC stock and spent approximately $290 million on acquisitions. 
The program we announced last month to maintain our position in VMware as an approximately 80% majority ownership underscore the important of VMware’s role in the EMC’s strategic direction. We believe maintaining EMC’s ownership in VMware at this level enables us to continue to achieve our original objectives for the publicly offering this stock and also maximized for EMC shareholders over the long term. To this goal, EMC purchased approximately $100 million of VMware stock in Q1.
Now looking at our best of breed technologies portfolio our long standing presence in data centers worldwide and a customer trust we have earned, we believe there is no company better positioned to guide customers along their journey to their private cloud and there is no doubt that’s exactly where customers are heading.
As this recent survey shows, almost every single CIO spending priority this year is either on technology imports customers on the path to the private cloud or is a benefit of having a private cloud. The first step to building a private cloud is server virtualization and capturing the full benefits of server virtualization requires advanced automation and management capabilities designed for these environments. This is where VMware stands alone.
Customers are embracing the new security paradigms that are necessary for private cloud infrastructures to proliferate. As you saw in the quarter, EMC, RSA and VMware are working hard together with partners like Intel on approaches to information centric security that will accelerate the adoption of private cloud infrastructures.
Customer interest in cloud computing is really picking up. At EMC our strategy to bridge internal private clouds and external public clouds is spot on. 
The ability to virtualize storage infrastructure enables the necessary new remote computer models required for private clouds. EMC has introduced several innovative new offerings in this space and in the very near future will introduce virtual storage technology that will enable customers to use distance as an asset rather than see it as a constraint.
The need for desktop virtualization is gaining momentum. A virtualized foundation like V-Sphere on the back end enables the scalability and seamlessness of use that are critical to a successful enterprise roll out of VDI. 
On priorities like labor optimization efficiency and green computing all of these are byproducts of operating a private cloud infrastructure.
All this indicates is that customers are quickly discovering that the key to a competitive edge they need to do things differently to transform the aging traditional infrastructures into the more cost effective agile new models for IT that are now possible. EMC and VMware together are leading the charge in making these new compute models a reality. No other company has the proven or market leading technology, services, and support that we do. No other company is as squarely aligned to these priorities and no other company has a vision and ability to execute on this vision.
I’ll now turn the call over to Joe.

We had record Q1 revenues, record Q1 net income, and record Q1 free cash flow. I might add, these results mark the second consecutive quarter in which we announced record quarterly results, proof that our strategy, coupled with our focus and strength in storage, virtualization, security, and information and content management is resonating very well with our customers.
Clearly, at an apple to apples year on year growth rate of 20% this Q1 we are growing significantly faster than the markets we serve, in other words we are taking share. As always, what propels any company in any industry is excellence in execution. To that end I would like to thank the more than 43,500 people of EMC and VMware across the globe for their dedication to our customers, for their skill, hard work, and teamwork they exhibit every day. Congratulations to all of you on these strong results.
As David has indicated, in Q1 IT spending patters were so much stronger than normal as customers caught up with some pent up demand from last year’s cut backs. Other positives for their customers have firm IT budgets in place and they are investing in IT to gain productivity both to help contain costs and to enhance revenues.
As an example, we saw this global strength in our flagship Symmetrix line. In addition, we had good visibility and predictability throughout the quarter, and experienced a good flow or calendarization of orders, much better than the experience in first half 2009. While we remain cautious about the pace of recovery, we are optimistic and have confidence in our ability to exceed our goals for this year as is evidenced in our enhanced 2010 guidance David just shared with you.
What gives us this confidence in our ability to continue to grow and take share is our focus on four multi-billion dollar markets, all of which or currently are and will continue to exhibit extremely rapid double digit growth for many years to come. Each one has the potential to be a billion dollar plus revenue opportunity for EMC.
Our first and largest opportunity is help CIOs transform their data centers into private clouds. The attribute of a private clouds that this will give CIOs the ability to truly offer their internal and external customers IT as a service. IT as a service is an IT environment where application workloads are truly policy and service level driven. IT as a service is an IT environment that is far more automated, flexible, and dynamic than today’s data center environment. IT as a service is an IT environment that advanced security, availability, and control to a higher level. IT as a service is an IT environment that will deliver significantly lower costs.
Our second billion dollar plus opportunity is help service providers and telcos build out their public clouds using virtualization, storage, and security and information management technologies. We will bring the same private cloud attributes in technologies to our service providers and telco partners as they build out their public clouds. 
This will allow them to attract application workloads from our enterprise and commercial customers and by adding a suite of applications they will be able to have full IT service offerings to attack markets such as SNB and public sector. Additionally, EMC will offer our service partners several application choices like PC backup and storage as a service. 
Our third multi billion dollar opportunity is for EMC to the clear leader in next generation backup recovery and archive solutions. As a proof point of the opportunity here, the actual Q1 results from just the data domain and Avamar product and services already represents $1 billion in revenue on an annualized run rate basis. This is especially impressive when you consider that these products represent new growth areas for EMC. For the record, we do expect Q2, Q3, and Q4 results for data domain Avamar solutions to show sequential improvement.
To top things off in this category we have other offerings like network or for backup, those source one product family for compliant archiving and our family of FISK libraries.
Our fourth massive opportunity is around virtualizing client devices. We will bring to this market the benefits of virtualization and centralized management, the protection of centralized storage and enhanced information management. With a new and better way to secure information while lowering total costs. In short, we’ll help our customers embrace and get the maximum value from the rapid advancing choices that are now happening in client devices while lowering their total TCO.
This V client market, while quite small right now is extremely active as numerous customers are engaged in proof of concepts. Additionally, we see early adopters experiencing solid results. These are clear signs, to steal the phrase, that this is going to be big.
Collectively in these four mega growth opportunities we have division, the leading technologies and virtualization and security and storage for block, file and object data, and for the next generation of backup recovery and archive solutions. We have the people and the expertise to help customers and service providers make this transition. We have the partner ecosystem in place to succeed and very importantly we have the trust and permission of our customers to play in these markets.
We are convinced that continuing our focus on these four growth markets along with continued investments in innovative technology and exceptional people; we can maintain a long term double digit revenue growth rate. 
Thanks again for joining us today. I’ll now turn it over to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today’s call.

If you look at how we guided, obviously our $16.5 billion guidance is a very strong revenue number, it’s an 18% revenue growth. If you pull it apart you’ll see that because the pent up demand we’re expecting Q1 to be higher than a usual percentage of the total. We’re expecting to move to a more seasonal pattern after Q1 which would mean essentially you wouldn’t see quite as big a jump, in fact Q2 might near flattish compared to Q1 and then expect a more seasonal progression from that point going forward.

Of course the two big things with V-Max is the fact, the way we’ve planned this from the beginning to really optimize the use of flash drives and then our FAST technology which tiers storage automatically so whether it puts it on, it’s dramatically different cost structure whether it puts it on a flash drive a 15K, fiber channel drive, or a two terabyte SATA drive or two terabyte SATA drive duped, there are very different cost profiles for the customers.
Therefore a customer can set a policy and let us just move the data automatically. Of course as we have thousands of customers and now have over a petabyte of data this automation is what has to happen, that’s what one of the basic tenants would be of the private cloud its becoming, so that you’ve got to trust the automation to help you get the productivity and that trust is there in Symmetrix and I think that’s the big reason it did well.

The area that is a little different from what you may have expected is if you look at our services component of gross margin which you can get to either with the results or by pulling out VMware what you’ll see is a fairly large decline sequentially in the services gross margin for a few factors.
One is we are building up our consulting and professional services business that has a lower margin mix and that was a high percentage of the business. Also on the services side bear in mind we reinstated the 5% salary cuts. This quarter we had some fringe adjustments and a couple of other things happening to the services side. The services gross margin sequentially was a little bit down more than it would have been or more than it was, for example from the last Q4 to Q1, that’s perhaps the difference between what you’re expecting and your margin model.

There will be some blurring but that being said, I still think you’ll see the two distinct tiers for the long term.

I'm pleased to report that EMC started the year with very solid results in Q1, with revenues of $3.9 billion, up 23% from Q1 '09, non-GAAP EPS of $0.26, up 63% and free cash flow of $1.1 bill",3366,"Thanks, Tony. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that EMC started the year with very solid results in Q1, with revenues of $3.9 billion, up 23% from Q1 '09, non-GAAP EPS of $0.26, up 63% and free cash flow of $1.1 billion, also up 63%. These results speak to the strength of our leadership position in some of the most important areas of IT and to the power of our operational model. We clearly executed on our triple play. We gained market share, we invested for the future and we improved profitability. We're confident that we'll continue to execute in all three of these areas going forward.
Within these numbers, each of our two businesses have excellent results. Our EMC Information Infrastructure business had a great quarter, with $3.3 billion in revenue, up 22% year-on-year, and $0.21 non-GAAP EPS, almost double our EPS from last Q1. VMware also had a great quarter, contributing $632 million of revenue, up 34% year-on-year, and $0.05 of non-GAAP EPS to EMC. Customers are increasingly recognizing that VMware is the strategic layer on which to build their next-generation cloud data centers.
I'll start off this morning by making some comments about the Q1 spending environment, why EMC is thriving, and then I'll discuss some details from our Q1 results. 
There are three major factors that contributed to our excellent revenue performance this quarter. First of all, based upon what we saw in the marketplace, we think IT spending looks to be on track with what we've been expecting, up around 3% to 5% this year. In addition, customer activity and commentary is consistent with a view that our addressable market will be up around 6% to 8% this year. A second factor this quarter was the continuation of some pent-up demand that we saw in Q4. For EMC's Information Infrastructure business, this strength was concentrated in the U.S. storage business, especially in financial services. And while it's difficult to quantify, it was certainly a positive. As a result of these two factors, we think growth in IT spending in our target marketplace in 2010 will end up at the higher end of our projected ranges. 
Third and most important, we expect to gain a significant amount of share this year, and it seems pretty clear we're off to a good start in this regard. EMC grew faster than our target market for a number of reasons, including our expanding role as a trusted partner with customers, our leading technology in several of the hottest areas of IT today, our proven support and service that back up this technology and our compelling vision and ability to execute on this vision. As a result, we are increasingly the best guide for customer's journey for private cloud, and we believe this competitive advantage is a major factor enabling us to show strong growth and gain share. And it positions us well to continue to gain share going forward.
Given this unique combination of strategic market and technology advantages, we now anticipate 2010 consolidated revenues of $16.5 billion, up 18%, non-GAAP operating margins of 20% to 21% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.18, up 31% from last year.
Now let's take a closer look at some of the financial highlights from the first quarter. As I mentioned, EMC Information Infrastructure revenues were $3.3 million, up 22% year-on-year, non-GAAP earnings per share for EMC II was $0.21, up 91% from last year. Free cash flow was a very strong $819 million, up 66%. Within these overall numbers, strong demand for our Information Infrastructure products generated revenues of $2.2 billion, up 27% from last year, while Information Infrastructure Services were $1.1 billion, up 13%. The fact that products were so much better than services is an encouraging sign that customers are moving forward with their infrastructure investments.
EMC Information Infrastructure operating performance for the quarter was also very strong. Non-GAAP gross margins were 53.4%, and non-GAAP operating margins were 17.8% in Q1. The substantial year-on-year improvement stemmed from higher volumes, our better prospects and the measures we’ve taken to lower and streamline our cost structure.
Looking to the revenue results from each of the businesses within Information Infrastructure, Q1 Information Storage revenues were $2.9 billion, up 24%. As always, information growth continued to be a key driver. We also saw our customers beginning new projects in their existing traditional infrastructures. Added to both these was continued growth in the number of customers that are moving to virtual data center infrastructures. All three of these drivers benefited us in the quarter, as EMC is a trusted partner not only for customers’ requirements today, but also going forward as they embark on their own journeys to a private cloud.
In the high end, Symmetrix product revenues were up 28% year-on-year. Our V-Max transition is essentially complete. Customers are eager to benefit from its more efficient, flexible and cost-effective technology, and we're clearly gaining share. Today's applications require architecture that scales with the business needs. In Q1, one of the largest software companies in the world chose V-Max for its ability to scale capacity and performance and to support critical online applications. The combination of proven reliability, along with cost-effective storage tiering utilizing Fibre Channel, Solid State and SATA Drives, provided this customer with the best value.
Now turning to the mid-tier. Over the last few years, we've seen a shift in the way customers utilize mid-tier storage. The rapidly changing business environment in this tier increased the required adaptability of multi-protocol systems. And growing virtualized server environments intensify the need for these dynamic storage capabilities. As a result, customers are increasingly looking for mid-tier storage that’s capable of supporting multiple information types and communication protocols. We have been in lockstep with customers throughout this transition. For years we've been the acknowledged leader in the mid-tier for these capabilities, and we began to combine some of them when we introduced our market-leading unified products in 2006.
While we haven't previously disclosed our overall mid-tier revenues, today we're expanding our reporting to help you track our progress here. In Q1, our mid-tier storage product revenues were $800 million and grew a very robust 32% year-on-year. This amounts to a $3.2 billion annualized run rate from our mid-tier product revenues alone. This annualized number is quite conservative, as it does not include support, updates or other services revenues, and is being annualized based on our seasonally smallest quarter.
We gained share in the mid-tier due to the breadth and depth of our portfolio and the world-class service and support to back it up. Let me give you a couple of examples from Q1 of how we’re winning in this space. A large medical services company was looking for unified storage, replication, disaster recovery, backup and recovery, deduplication and path managements. We won this multimillion-dollar deal against NetApp on the strength of our mid-tier portfolio, as well as our replication and recovery capabilities within the customer’s clustered VMware environment.
Another win was a global online content services provider who selected EMC over NetApp for a couple of reasons: EMC’s superior raw-to-usable efficiency resulting in lower total cost of ownership, and compelling deduplication and VMware integration. 
Our relationship with Dell strengthened in the quarter, and we were pleased to announce an expansion of our partnership to include additional mid-tier products. Channel partners, including Dell, are extremely important to our ongoing success in the mid-tier, and we’re very focused on expanding these partnerships. Our efforts here have really paid off, as EMC was recently named 2010 CRN [ChannelWeb] Channel Champion. Channels were a big contributor to our mid-tier business, and approximately 75% of our mid-tier product revenues in Q1.
It should also be noted that our mid-tier revenues are more weighted toward the high end of the mid-tier markets. We’re excited about the opportunity to expand our footprint into the faster-growing low end of the mid-tier, and are mobilizing the people, investing in the products and engaging the partners to make this happen.
Our success in the high end and mid-tier is driven by our ability to satisfy customers' needs today no matter where they are on their journey to the private cloud. EMC has been leading the charge of most of the important new technologies in information infrastructure today. These include virtualization data centers, SSDs with automated storage tiering and next-generation backup and recovery.
As our biggest, most immediate and most important growth opportunity, the evolution to fully-virtualized centers is where we're focusing the majority of our efforts. Fundamental to virtualized data centers is the creation and integration of virtual servers and virtual storage infrastructures. Clearly, we are far and away the leader on the service side with VMware. In addition, our unique vision around the virtualization of the Information Storage Infrastructure is resonating with the industry, and you can expect to hear more from us soon on how we're going to make this happen. 
We also continued to lead the charge in virtualization affinity across our product set in both directions. In other words, we are unique in being able to see and manage from storage to virtual machine and from virtual machine to storage, and the connections continue to grow. These capabilities are key to new ways of thinking about data center design, and no company is as well-positioned as EMC to help customers.
Our Fully Automated Storage Tiering software, known as FAST, completed its first quarter availability in Q1, including double-digit penetration rates in the high end. Customers clearly see the value proposition of having the right data in the right place at the right time. And turning this advanced capability into a feature across our full solutions set further extends our competitive advantage, as customers prefer to buy from a partner with a comprehensive solution as opposed to buying point products.
Our Backup Recovery Systems business performed ahead of our high expectations. In fact, Data Domain and Avamar each accelerated over 100% growth in the quarter. The synergy between these two is key to the acceleration here, and these businesses are certainly growing faster than any other deduplication technology in the markets. It's great to see this business systematically capitalizing upon opportunities worldwide, both within EMC's existing accounts and with net new customers as well.
In other storage areas, our online backup solution, Mozy, continued its strategy in the quarter to build its customer base via service providers, adding Comcast to an already long list of partners. Iomega continued to thrive in the unrelenting demand from customers wanting plug-and-play storage for all their media types. In addition, we are seeing increased demand from small and medium businesses that want easy-to-use network storage.
In sum, EMC storage business in the quarter outperformed our expectations due to our ability to provide leading-edge technology in a comprehensive solution that is supported by our world-class services organization. There is no vendor with a broad and innovative technology solutions desk, the depth of experience and a proven track record to provide information infrastructures that can safely and securely transition customers' data centers at their own pace to private clouds.
Our RSA Security revenues in Q1 were $161 million, up 13% year-on-year, as information-centric security remains a key customer priority. There were several noteworthy events in RSA this quarter, including RSA's annual Marquis security conference and the acquisition of Archer. Delegates’ attendance at the RSA conference was up 25% from last year, attesting to the growing importance of IT security. The addition of Archer's governance, risk and compliance technology, complements our existing DLP and enVision FIM [ph] tools to create one security management platform. The resulting level of visibility shines a welcome security and compliance spotlight into both physical and virtualized environments. 
In addition, in Q1, RSA Archer, VMware and Intel introduced a proof of concepts for compliance, security and control down to the most fundamental layers of multi-tenant virtualized infrastructure. This is an important early step to help accelerate the growth of external clouds. With the addition of Archer, RSA is now the leader in every area in which it competes: authentication, IT GRC, DLP, FIM [ph] and web fraud detection.
Revenues from our Web Content Management and Archiving division in Q1 were $178 million, up 2% in Q1 '09.  We saw increased customer activity with new license growth up 8%, a higher number of big deals done in Q4 and a strong pipeline exiting Q1. Our xCP composition platform for case and management, which is unique in the industry, is garnering a lot of customer interest. In fact, a major European national health system, has standardized upon xCP for its health records. 
A sharper focus on partnerships is also expanding CMA's growth opportunities in 2010. These include our recently announced partnership with FatWire to improve web content management, as well as a new relationship with SAP to provide a number of SAP-focused ECM solutions, the first of which we plan to announce in the next few weeks.
EMC's global services business once again showed strong results for the quarter, with revenues up 13% over last year's Q1. Our professional and technical services are doing well, and our consulting business continues to outperform, benefiting from customers’ transitions from virtual data center architectures. In fact, EMC consulting expertise was key to winning the first phase of a long-term collaboration with a Fortune 100 defense contractor to accelerate the transformation of their data centers to a service-oriented private cloud model. Such an undertaking requires deep expertise in cloud strategy and architecture, as well as the infrastructure products that have been purpose-built for such environments. That is why they chose EMC.
Our partnership with Cisco continues to gain momentum. In Q1, our VCE [Virtual Computing Environment] coalition was up and running. Its focus on helping customers their move to cloud infrastructures has really struck a chord, and interest has been outstanding. Customers are already in production with Vblocks and we’ll soon be rolling out a lower-end version of the Vblock. Over the next few months, you will see exciting announcements from both systems integrators and service providers leveraging the work of this coalition of best-of-breed technology companies.
Now, turning to a few highlights from our consolidated results, including both our Information Infrastructure and Virtual Infrastructure businesses. As I mentioned, the EMC Information Infrastructure business had revenues of $3.3 billion, non-GAAP operating margins of 17.8% and contributed non-GAAP EPS of $0.21 and free cash flow of $819 million. The VMware Virtual Infrastructure business had revenues of $632 million, non-GAAP operating margins of 28.1% and contributed non-GAAP EPS of $0.05 and free cash flow of $291 million. Together, our two businesses had total Q1 consolidated revenues of approximately $3.9 billion, up 23% year-on-year, non-GAAP operating margins of 19.5% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion, $561 million higher than Q1 non-GAAP net income.
These consolidated results represent the combined power of virtual infrastructure and information infrastructure. Together, we're moving forward under a shared vision and strategic direction. Additionally, through complementary efforts, we're increasing affinity between the virtual and information infrastructures. This strategic alignment positions us well to execute our triple play to gain market share, to invest in the future and to improve profitability. As you can see from our revised 2010 revenue growth guidance of 18%, we intend to grow substantially faster than our target market and gain share. 
Second, we're investing for the future. We continue to plan to expand our R&D spend by 20% over last year, and we are further adding to our sales capability worldwide, particularly in the emerging markets and the commercial and F&B [ph] markets. And we now plan to implement a broad-based annual compensation review to reward and retain our workforce, which is been outstanding throughout what has been a very challenging period. 
Third, these increased investments notwithstanding, we expect to further improve profitability. We now expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin for 2010 to reach between 20% and 21%, representing a substantial increase over the levels seen for the past several years.
Now a few housekeeping items. Currency added 240 basis points to the year-on-year revenue growth on a consolidated basis. The Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was 22%, higher than expected, as a renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit has not yet been passed. We still expect our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be around 20%, as we project that the tax rate will occur later this year, possibly as late as the fourth quarter. Q1 consolidated operating cash flow was $1.3 billion, up 53%. The improvements that generated this strong result include deferred revenues, which were $4 billion, inventory trims, which were 8x and DSOs which were 40 days.
Due to improvements in our stock price, we now expect our fully-diluted share count for the year to be around $2.15 billion. The difference from the $2.12 billion we disclosed in January is primarily due to the impact of our convertible debt. 
We ended Q1 with $10.2 billion in cash and investments. Of this, a total of $6.2 billion was held in the U.S., with the remainder overseas. In the quarter, we used $176 million of our cash to buy back 10 million shares of EMC stock and spent approximately $290 million on acquisitions. 
The program we announced last month to maintain our position in the VMware, at an approximately 80% majority ownership, underscores the importance of VMware's role in EMC’s strategic direction. We believe maintaining EMC’s ownership in VMware at this level enables us to continue to achieve our original objectives for publicly offering the stock and also maximize value for EMC shareholders over the long-term. To this goal, EMC purchased approximately $100 million of VMware stock in Q1.
Now looking at our best-of-breed technology and services portfolio, our long-standing presence in data centers worldwide and the customer trust we have earned, we believe there is no company better positioned to guide customers along their journey to the private cloud, and there is no doubt that's exactly where customers are heading. 
As this recent survey shows, almost every single CIO spending prior to this year is either on technology that puts customers on the path to the private cloud or is a benefit of having a private cloud. The first step to building a private cloud is server virtualization. And capturing the full benefits of server virtualization requires a vast automation of management capabilities designed for these environments. This is where VMware stands alone. Customers are embracing the new security paradigms that are necessary for private cloud infrastructures to proliferate. As we saw in the quarter, EMC, RSA and VMware are working hard, together with partners like Intel on approaches to information-centric security to accelerate the adoption of private cloud infrastructures. 
Customer interest in cloud computing is really picking up. At EMC, our strategy to bridge internal private clouds and external public clouds is spot-on. The ability to virtualize storage infrastructure enables the necessary new remote computing models required for private clouds. EMC has introduced several innovative new offerings in this space, and in the very near future will introduce virtual storage technology that will enable customers to use distance as an asset rather than see it as a constraint. 
The need for desktop virtualization is gaining momentum. A virtualized foundation like vSphere on the back-end enables the scalability and seamlessness of use that are critical to a successful enterprise rollout of VDI. On priorities like labor optimization, efficiency and green computing, all these are byproducts of operating a private cloud infrastructure. 
What all this indicates is that customers are quickly discovering that to keep their competitive edge, they need to do things differently. They need to transform their aging traditional infrastructures into the more cost-effective agile new models for IT that are now possible. EMC and VMware together are leading the charge in making these new computer models a reality. No other company has the proven or market-leading technology services and support that we do. No other company is as squarely aligned to these priorities, and no other company has the vision and ability to execute on this vision. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe."

I'd like to begin by welcoming everyone to today's conference call. As always, thank you very much for your interest in EMC. Overall, I was very pleased with our Q1 results. In fact, this Q1 was the best first quarter in EMC's histo",963,"Well, thanks, David. I'd like to begin by welcoming everyone to today's conference call. As always, thank you very much for your interest in EMC. 
Overall, I was very pleased with our Q1 results. In fact, this Q1 was the best first quarter in EMC's history. We had record Q1 revenues, record Q1 net income and record Q1 free cash flow. And I might add, these results marked the second consecutive quarter in which we announced record quarterly results, proof that our strategy, coupled with our focus and strength in storage virtualization, security and information and content management is resonating very well with our customers.
Clearly, at an apples-to-apples, year-on-year growth rate of 20% this Q1, we are growing significantly faster than the markets we serve. In other words, we are taking share. And as always, what propels any company in any industry is excellence in execution. To that end, I would like to thank the more than 43,500 people of EMC and VMware across the globe for their dedication to our customers, for their skill, hard work and teamwork they exhibit every day. Congratulations to all of you on these strong results.
As David has indicated, in Q1, IT spending patterns were so much stronger than normal, as customers caught up with some pent-up demand from last year's cutbacks. Other positives, that customers have firm IT budgets in place, and they are investing in IT to gain productivity, both to help contain costs and to enhance revenues. As an example, we saw this global strength in our flagship Symmetrix product line. 
In addition, we had good visibility and predictability throughout quarter and experienced a good flow for calendarization of orders, much better than we experienced in the first half of 2009. And while we remain cautious about the pace of recovery, we are optimistic and have confidence in our ability to exceed our goals for this year, as is evidenced in our enhanced 2010 guidance that David just shared with you. What gives us this confidence in our ability to continue to grow and take share is our focus on four multi-billion dollar markets, all of which, or currently are, and will continue to exhibit extremely rapid double-digit growth for many years to come. And each one has the potential to be a billion-dollar-plus revenue opportunity for EMC.
Our first and largest opportunity is to help CIOs transform their data centers into private clouds. The key attribute of a private cloud that this will give CIOs the ability to truly offer their internal and external customers IT-as-a-service. IT-as-a-service is an IT environment where application workloads are truly policy- and service-level driven. IT-as-a-service is an IT environment that is far more automated, flexible and dynamic than today's data center environment. IT-as-a-service is an IT environment that advances security, availability and control to a higher level. And IT-as-a-service is an IT environment that will deliver significantly lower costs.
Our second billion-dollar-plus opportunity is to help service providers and telcos build out their public clouds using virtualization, storage, security and information management technologies. We will bring the same private cloud attributes and technologies to our service provider and telco partners as they build out their public clouds. This will allow them to attract application workloads from our enterprise and commercial customers, and by adding a suite of applications, they will be able to have full IT service offerings to attack markets such as SMB and public sector. Additionally, EMC will offer our service partners several applications choicees like PC backup and Storage as a Service.
Our third multi-billion-dollar opportunity is for EMC to be the clear leader in next-generation backup recovery and archive solutions. As a proof point of the opportunity here, the actual Q1 results from just the Data Domain and Avamar and product services already represents $1.0 billion in revenue on an annualized run-rate basis. This is especially impressive when you consider that these products represent new growth areas for EMC. And for the record, we do expect Q2, Q3 and Q4 results for Data Domain and Avamar solutions to show sequential improvement. 
And to top things off in this category, we have other offerings like NetWorker for backup, the SourceOne product family for compliant archiving and our family of FSP [ph] libraries.
Our fourth massive opportunity is around virtualizing client devices. We will bring to this market the benefits of virtualization and centralized management, the protection of centralized storage and enhanced information management, with a new and better way to secure information while lowering total costs. In short, we will help our customers embrace and get the maximum value from the rapid advances in choices that are now happening in client devices, while lowering their total TCO. This deep client market, while quite small right now, is extremely active as numerous customers are engaged in proof of concepts. Additionally, we see early adopters experiencing solid results. These are clear signs, to steal a phrase, that this is going to be big.
Collectively, in these four mega-growth opportunities, we have the vision, the leading technologies in virtualization, in security, in storage for block, file and object data and for the next generation of backup recovery and archive solutions. We have the people and the expertise to help customers and service providers make this transition. We have the partner ecosystem in place to succeed. And very importantly, we have the trust and permission of our customers to play in these markets.
We are convinced that continuing our focus on these four growth markets, along with continued investments in innovative technology and in exceptional people, we can maintain our long-term double-digit revenue growth rate. 
Thanks again for joining us today. I'll now turn it over to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call."

We really are not anticipating a lot of that pent-up demand kind of running forward into the rest of the year. If you kind of look at how we guided, obviously our $16.5 billion guidance is a very strong revenue number. It's an 18% revenue growth, but if you kind of pull it apart, you'll see that because of pent-up demand, we're expecting Q1 to be higher than a usual percentage of the total. So we're expecting to move to a more seasonal pattern kind of after Q1, which would mean essentially that you wouldn't see quite as big a jump. In fact, Q2 might be near or flattish compared to Q1, and then expect a more seasonal progression from that point going forward."

We are -- you can see the private cloud when you heard their conference call yesterday and their thing.

Public cloud community strategy is to watch and participate and have the best technology as this growing business for the Virtual Desktop and virtual client emerges. So those are all common strategies. So it's important that we work them together. Obviously, we continue to let, to work VMware in a very open fashion so that others can continue to play. And that will continue to be the case. And, of course, EMC on the back of that, which is good for today's environments and good for tomorrow's cloud environments, the next-generation backup recovery that we add. So keeping that stake is incredibly important, and that's exactly what we're going to do. Secondly, as we have those four great -- probably one of the first times in my life that I had four opportunities this big hitting me at once. So our best, I believe, our best return on value for customers is to make sure we take the right moves and continue to invest in technology through our own R&D. So how we were a little -- it's going to ramp up, we are going to share increase our R&D this year to 20%. We are going to continue to buy companies, both in VMware and in EMC. And that'll be the primary focus for the cash and to get great returns for the shareholders. And we continue to focus on what David calls the triple play. We want to hit -- in the short term, we want to hit, we want to make sure that we continue to grow and take share. We want to make sure that we continue to invest for the long-term and capitalizing opportunities. So we want to do all three."

I mean, these are very different cost profiles on the customer, and therefore our customer can set a policy and let us just move the data automatically.

The area that you're probably -- is a little different from what you may have expected is, if you look at the services component of gross margin, which you can get to either with the standalone results or by pulling out VMware, what you’ll see is a fairly large decline sequentially in the services gross margin for a few factors. One is we are building up our Consulting and Professional Services business. That has a lower margin mix and that was a high percentage of the business. And also on the services side, bear in mind we reinstated the 5% salary cuts this quarter. We had some fringe adjustments and a couple of other things happening to the services side.

We, for sure, are seeing customers that would've bought a mid-tier product just saying, “Okay, now that SIEM has this degree of scalability” -- because this new SIEM is unique in that it scales up like every other did, but it also scales out. So you could scale these things out fairly inexpensively and by sometimes by taking that approach at adding a low-tier, say, SATA drives in it and using software like FAST, it can compete very, very effectively with mid-tier. So you are right, it does -- and that is one of the reasons for SIEM's, one of the reasons for SIEM’s high growth this quarter. So there will be some blurring. But that being said, I still think you’ll still see the two, these two distinct mid-tiers for the long-term. And I do expect that the mid-tier has the ability, especially as we get into the lower mid-tier, where the higher growth is today, that we're not a strong player in yet, but will be.

I'm pleased to report that EMC started the year with very solid results in Q1, with revenues of $3.9 billion, up 23% from Q1 '09, non-GAAP EPS of $0.26, up 63% and free cash flow of $1.1 bill",3365,"Thanks, Tony. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that EMC started the year with very solid results in Q1, with revenues of $3.9 billion, up 23% from Q1 '09, non-GAAP EPS of $0.26, up 63% and free cash flow of $1.1 billion, also up 63%. These results speak to the strength of our leadership position in some of the most important areas of IT and to the power of our operational model. We clearly executed on our triple play. We gained market share, we invested for the future and we improved profitability. We're confident that we'll continue to execute in all three of these areas going forward.
Within these numbers, each of our two businesses have excellent results. Our EMC Information Infrastructure business had a great quarter, with $3.3 billion in revenue, up 22% year-on-year, and $0.21 non-GAAP EPS, almost double our EPS from last Q1. VMware also had a great quarter, contributing $632 million of revenue, up 34% year-on-year, and $0.05 of non-GAAP EPS to EMC. Customers are increasingly recognizing that VMware is the strategic layer on which to build their next-generation cloud data centers.
I'll start off this morning by making some comments about the Q1 spending environment, why EMC is thriving, and then I'll discuss some details from our Q1 results. 
There are three major factors that contributed to our excellent revenue performance this quarter. First of all, based upon what we saw in the marketplace, we think IT spending looks to be on track with what we've been expecting, up around 3% to 5% this year. In addition, customer activity and commentary is consistent with a view that our addressable market will be up around 6% to 8% this year. A second factor this quarter was the continuation of some pent-up demand that we saw in Q4. For EMC's Information Infrastructure business, this strength was concentrated in the U.S. storage business, especially in financial services. And while it's difficult to quantify, it was certainly a positive. As a result of these two factors, we think growth in IT spending in our target marketplace in 2010 will end up at the higher end of our projected ranges. 
Third and most important, we expect to gain a significant amount of share this year, and it seems pretty clear we're off to a good start in this regard. EMC grew faster than our target market for a number of reasons, including our expanding role as a trusted partner with customers, our leading technology in several of the hottest areas of IT today, our proven support and service that back up this technology and our compelling vision and ability to execute on this vision. As a result, we are increasingly the best guide for customer's journey for private cloud, and we believe this competitive advantage is a major factor enabling us to show strong growth and gain share. And it positions us well to continue to gain share going forward.
Given this unique combination of strategic market and technology advantages, we now anticipate 2010 consolidated revenues of $16.5 billion, up 18%, non-GAAP operating margins of 20% to 21% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.18, up 31% from last year.
Now let's take a closer look at some of the financial highlights from the first quarter. As I mentioned, EMC Information Infrastructure revenues were $3.3 million, up 22% year-on-year, non-GAAP earnings per share for EMC II was $0.21, up 91% from last year. Free cash flow was a very strong $819 million, up 66%. Within these overall numbers, strong demand for our Information Infrastructure products generated revenues of $2.2 billion, up 27% from last year, while Information Infrastructure Services were $1.1 billion, up 13%. The fact that products were so much better than services is an encouraging sign that customers are moving forward with their infrastructure investments.
EMC Information Infrastructure operating performance for the quarter was also very strong. Non-GAAP gross margins were 53.4%, and non-GAAP operating margins were 17.8% in Q1. The substantial year-on-year improvement stemmed from higher volumes, our better prospects and the measures we’ve taken to lower and streamline our cost structure.
Looking to the revenue results from each of the businesses within Information Infrastructure, Q1 Information Storage revenues were $2.9 billion, up 24%. As always, information growth continued to be a key driver. We also saw our customers beginning new projects in their existing traditional infrastructures. Added to both these was continued growth in the number of customers that are moving to virtual data center infrastructures. All three of these drivers benefited us in the quarter, as EMC is a trusted partner not only for customers’ requirements today, but also going forward as they embark on their own journeys to a private cloud.
In the high end, Symmetrix product revenues were up 28% year-on-year. Our V-Max transition is essentially complete. Customers are eager to benefit from its more efficient, flexible and cost-effective technology, and we're clearly gaining share. Today's applications require architecture that scales with the business needs. In Q1, one of the largest software companies in the world chose V-Max for its ability to scale capacity and performance and to support critical online applications. The combination of proven reliability, along with cost-effective storage tiering utilizing Fibre Channel, Solid State and SATA Drives, provided this customer with the best value.
Now turning to the mid-tier. Over the last few years, we've seen a shift in the way customers utilize mid-tier storage. The rapidly changing business environment in this tier increased the required adaptability of multi-protocol systems. And growing virtualized server environments intensify the need for these dynamic storage capabilities. As a result, customers are increasingly looking for mid-tier storage that’s capable of supporting multiple information types and communication protocols. We have been in lockstep with customers throughout this transition. For years we've been the acknowledged leader in the mid-tier for these capabilities, and we began to combine some of them when we introduced our market-leading unified products in 2006.
While we haven't previously disclosed our overall mid-tier revenues, today we're expanding our reporting to help you track our progress here. In Q1, our mid-tier storage product revenues were $800 million and grew a very robust 32% year-on-year. This amounts to a $3.2 billion annualized run rate from our mid-tier product revenues alone. This annualized number is quite conservative, as it does not include support, updates or other services revenues, and is being annualized based on our seasonally smallest quarter.
We gained share in the mid-tier due to the breadth and depth of our portfolio and the world-class service and support to back it up. Let me give you a couple of examples from Q1 of how we’re winning in this space. A large medical services company was looking for unified storage, replication, disaster recovery, backup and recovery, deduplication and path managements. We won this multimillion-dollar deal against NetApp on the strength of our mid-tier portfolio, as well as our replication and recovery capabilities within the customer’s clustered VMware environment.
Another win was a global online content services provider who selected EMC over NetApp for a couple of reasons: EMC’s superior raw-to-usable efficiency resulting in lower total cost of ownership and compelling deduplication and VMware integration. 
Our relationship with Dell strengthened in the quarter, and we were pleased to announce an expansion of our partnership to include additional mid-tier products. Channel partners, including Dell, are extremely important to our ongoing success in the mid-tier, and we’re very focused on expanding these partnerships. Our efforts here have really paid off, as EMC was recently named 2010 CRN [ChannelWeb] Channel Champion. Channels were a big contributor to our mid-tier business, at approximately 75% of our mid-tier product revenues in Q1.
It should also be noted that our mid-tier revenues are more weighted toward the high end of the mid-tier markets. We’re excited about the opportunity to expand our footprint into the faster-growing low end of the mid-tier, and are mobilizing the people, investing in the products and engaging the partners to make this happen.
Our success in the high end and mid-tier is driven by our ability to satisfy customers' needs today no matter where they are on their journey to the private cloud. EMC has been leading the charge of most of the important new technologies in information infrastructure today. These include virtualization data centers, SSDs with automated storage tiering and next-generation backup and recovery.
As our biggest, most immediate and most important growth opportunity, the evolution to fully virtualized data centers is where we're focusing the majority of our efforts. Fundamental to virtualized data centers is the creation and integration of virtual servers and virtual storage infrastructures. Clearly, we are far and away the leader on the service side with VMware. In addition, our unique vision around the virtualization of the Information Storage infrastructure is resonating with the industry, and you can expect to hear more from us soon on how we're going to make this happen. 
We also continued to lead the charge in virtualization affinity across our product set in both directions. In other words, we are unique in being able to see and manage from storage to virtual machine and from virtual machine to storage, and the connections continue to grow. These capabilities are key to new ways of thinking about data center design, and no company is well positioned as EMC to help customers.
Our Fully Automated Storage Tiering software, known as FAST, completed its first quarter availability in Q1, including double-digit penetration rates in the high end. Customers clearly see the value proposition of having the right data in the right place at the right time. And turning this advanced capability into a feature across our full solution set further extends our competitive advantage, as customers prefer to buy from a partner with a comprehensive solution as opposed to buying point products.
Our Backup Recovery Systems business performed ahead of our high expectations. In fact, Data Domain and Avamar each accelerated over 100% growth in the quarter. The synergy between these two is key to the acceleration here, and these businesses are certainly growing faster than any other deduplication technology in the markets. It's great to see this business systematically capitalizing upon opportunities worldwide, both within EMC's existing accounts and with net new customers as well.
In other storage areas, our online backup solution, Mozy, continued its strategy in the quarter to build its customer base via service providers, adding Comcast to an already long list of partners. Iomega continued to thrive in the unrelenting demand from customers wanting plug-and-play storage for all their media types. In addition, we are seeing increased demand from small and medium businesses that want easy-to-use network storage.
In sum, EMC storage business in the quarter outperformed our expectations due to our ability to provide leading-edge technology in a comprehensive solution that is supported by our world-class services organization. There is no vendor with a broad and innovative technology solutions desk, the depth of experience and a proven track record to provide information infrastructures that can safely and securely transition customers' data centers at their own pace to private clouds.
Our RSA Security revenues in Q1 were $161 million, up 13% year-on-year, as information-centric security remains a key customer priority. There were several noteworthy events in RSA this quarter, including RSA's annual Marquis security conference and the acquisition of Archer. Delegates’ attendance at the RSA conference was up 25% from last year, attesting to the growing importance of IT security. The addition of Archer's governance, risk and compliance technology, complements our existing DLP and enVision SIEM tools to create one security management platform. The resulting level of visibility shines a welcome security and compliance spotlight into both physical and virtualized environments. 
In addition, in Q1, RSA Archer, VMware and Intel introduced a proof of concepts for compliance, security and control down to the most fundamental layers of multi-tenant virtualized infrastructure. This is an important early step to help accelerate the growth of external clouds. With the addition of Archer, RSA is now the leader in every area in which it competes: authentication, IT GRC, DLP, SIEM and web fraud detection.
Revenues from our Web Content Management and Archiving division in Q1 were $178 million, up 2% in Q1 '09.  We saw increased customer activity with new license growth up 8%, a higher number of big deals done in Q4 and a strong pipeline exiting Q1. Our xCP composition platform for case and management, which is unique in the industry, is garnering a lot of customer interest. In fact, a major European national health system, has standardized upon xCP for its health records. 
A sharper focus on partnerships is also expanding CMA's growth opportunities in 2010. These include our recently announced partnership with FatWire to improve web content management, as well as a new relationship with SAP to provide a number of SAP-focused ECM solutions, the first of which we plan to announce in the next few weeks.
EMC's global services business once again showed strong results for the quarter, with revenues up 13% over last year's Q1. Our professional and technical services are doing well, and our consulting business continues to outperform, benefiting from customers’ transitions from virtual data center architectures. In fact, EMC consulting expertise was key to winning the first phase of a long-term collaboration with a Fortune 100 defense contractor to accelerate the transformation of their data centers to a service-oriented private cloud model. Such an undertaking requires deep expertise in cloud strategy and architecture, as well as the infrastructure products that have been purpose-built for such environments. That is why they chose EMC.
Our partnership with Cisco continues to gain momentum. In Q1, our VCE [Virtual Computing Environment] coalition was up and running. Its focus on helping customers their move to cloud infrastructures has really struck a chord, and interest has been outstanding. Customers are already in production with Vblocks and we’ll soon be rolling out a lower-end version of the Vblock. Over the next few months, you will see exciting announcements from both systems integrators and service providers leveraging the work of this coalition of best-of-breed technology companies.
Now, turning to a few highlights from our consolidated results, including both our Information Infrastructure and Virtual Infrastructure businesses. As I mentioned, the EMC Information Infrastructure business had revenues of $3.3 billion, non-GAAP operating margins of 17.8% and contributed non-GAAP EPS of $0.21 and free cash flow of $819 million. The VMware Virtual Infrastructure business had revenues of $632 million, non-GAAP operating margins of 28.1% and contributed non-GAAP EPS of $0.05 and free cash flow of $291 million. Together, our two businesses had total Q1 consolidated revenues of approximately $3.9 billion, up 23% year-on-year, non-GAAP operating margins of 19.5% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion, $561 million higher than Q1 non-GAAP net income.
These consolidated results represent the combined power of virtual infrastructure and information infrastructure. Together, we're moving forward under a shared vision and strategic direction. Additionally, through complementary efforts, we're increasing affinity between the virtual and information infrastructures. This strategic alignment positions us well to execute our triple play to gain market share, to invest in the future and to improve profitability. As you can see from our revised 2010 revenue growth guidance of 18%, we intend to grow substantially faster than our target market and gain share. 
Second, we're investing for the future. We continue to plan to expand our R&D spend by 20% over last year, and we are further adding to our sales capability worldwide, particularly in the emerging markets and the commercial and SMB markets. And we now plan to implement a broad-based annual compensation review to reward and retain our workforce, which is been outstanding throughout what has been a very challenging period. 
Third, these increased investments notwithstanding, we expect to further improve profitability. We now expect consolidated non-GAAP operating margin for 2010 to reach between 20% and 21%, representing a substantial increase over the levels seen for the past several years.
Now a few housekeeping items. Currency added 240 basis points to the year-on-year revenue growth on a consolidated basis. The Q1 non-GAAP tax rate was 22%, higher than expected, as a renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit has not yet been passed. We still expect our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be around 20%, as we project that the tax rate will occur later this year, possibly as late as the fourth quarter. Q1 consolidated operating cash flow was $1.3 billion, up 53%. The improvements that generated this strong result include deferred revenues, which were $4 billion, inventory trims, which were 8x and DSOs which were 40 days.
Due to improvements in our stock price, we now expect our fully-diluted share count for the year to be around $2.15 billion. The difference from the $2.12 billion we disclosed in January is primarily due to the impact of our convertible debt. 
We ended Q1 with $10.2 billion in cash and investments. Of this, a total of $6.2 billion was held in the U.S., with the remainder overseas. In the quarter, we used $176 million of our cash to buy back 10 million shares of EMC stock and spent approximately $290 million on acquisitions. 
The program we announced last month to maintain our position in the VMware, at an approximately 80% majority ownership, underscores the importance of VMware's role in EMC’s strategic direction. We believe maintaining EMC’s ownership in VMware at this level enables us to continue to achieve our original objectives for publicly offering the stock and also maximize value for EMC shareholders over the long-term. To this goal, EMC purchased approximately $100 million of VMware stock in Q1.
Now looking at our best-of-breed technology and services portfolio, our long-standing presence in data centers worldwide and the customer trust we have earned, we believe there is no company better positioned to guide customers along their journey to the private cloud, and there is no doubt that's exactly where customers are heading. 
As this recent survey shows, almost every single CIO spending prior to this year is either on technology that puts customers on the path to the private cloud or is a benefit of having a private cloud. The first step to building a private cloud is server virtualization. And capturing the full benefits of server virtualization requires a vast automation of management capabilities designed for these environments. This is where VMware stands alone. Customers are embracing the new security paradigms that are necessary for private cloud infrastructures to proliferate. As we saw in the quarter, EMC, RSA and VMware are working hard, together with partners like Intel on approaches to information-centric security to accelerate the adoption of private cloud infrastructures. 
Customer interest in cloud computing is really picking up. At EMC, our strategy to bridge internal private clouds and external public clouds is spot-on. The ability to virtualize storage infrastructure enables the necessary new remote computing models required for private clouds. EMC has introduced several innovative new offerings in this space, and in the very near future will introduce virtual storage technology that will enable customers to use distance as an asset rather than see it as a constraint. 
The need for desktop virtualization is gaining momentum. A virtualized foundation like vSphere on the back-end enables the scalability and seamlessness of use that are critical to a successful enterprise rollout of VDI. On priorities like labor optimization, efficiency and green computing, all these are byproducts of operating a private cloud infrastructure. 
What all this indicates is that customers are quickly discovering that to keep their competitive edge, they need to do things differently. They need to transform their aging traditional infrastructures into the more cost-effective agile new models for IT that are now possible. EMC and VMware together are leading the charge in making these new computer models a reality. No other company has the proven or market-leading technology services and support that we do. No other company is as squarely aligned to these priorities, and no other company has the vision and ability to execute on this vision. 
I'll now turn the call over to Joe."

Clearly, at an apples-to-apples, year-on-year growth rate of 20% this Q1, we are growing significantly faster than the markets we serve. In other words, we are taking share. And as always, what propels any company in any industry is excellence in execution. To that end, I would like to thank the more than 43,500 people of EMC and VMware across the globe for their dedication to our customers, for their skill, hard work and teamwork they exhibit every day. Congratulations to all of you on these strong results.
As David has indicated, in Q1, IT spending patterns were so much stronger than normal, as customers caught up with some pent-up demand from last year's cutbacks. Other positives, that customers have firm IT budgets in place, and they are investing in IT to gain productivity, both to help contain costs and to enhance revenues. As an example, we saw this global strength in our flagship Symmetrix product line. 
In addition, we had good visibility and predictability throughout quarter and experienced a good flow for calendarization of orders, much better than we experienced in the first half of 2009. And while we remain cautious about the pace of recovery, we are optimistic and have confidence in our ability to exceed our goals for this year, as is evidenced in our enhanced 2010 guidance that David just shared with you. What gives us this confidence in our ability to continue to grow and take share is our focus on four multi-billion dollar markets, all of which, or currently are, and will continue to exhibit extremely rapid double-digit growth for many years to come. And each one has the potential to be a billion-dollar-plus revenue opportunity for EMC.
Our first and largest opportunity is to help CIOs transform their data centers into private clouds. The key attribute of a private cloud that this will give CIOs the ability to truly offer their internal and external customers IT-as-a-service. IT-as-a-service is an IT environment where application workloads are truly policy- and service-level driven. IT-as-a-service is an IT environment that is far more automated, flexible and dynamic than today's data center environment. IT-as-a-service is an IT environment that advances security, availability and control to a higher level. And IT-as-a-service is an IT environment that will deliver significantly lower costs.
Our second billion-dollar-plus opportunity is to help service providers and telcos build out their public clouds using virtualization, storage, security and information management technologies. We will bring the same private cloud attributes and technologies to our service provider and telco partners as they build out their public clouds. This will allow them to attract application workloads from our enterprise and commercial customers. And by adding a suite of applications, they will be able to have full IT service offerings to attack markets such as SMB and public sector. Additionally, EMC will offer our service partners several applications so choices like PC backup and Storage as a Service.
Our third multi-billion-dollar opportunity is for EMC to be the clear leader in next-generation backup recovery and archive solutions. As a proof point of the opportunity here, the actual Q1 results from just the Data Domain and Avamar product services already represents $1.0 billion in revenue on an annualized run-rate basis. This is especially impressive when you consider that these products represent new growth areas for EMC. And for the record, we do expect Q2, Q3 and Q4 results for Data Domain and Avamar solutions to show sequential improvement.  And to top things off in this category, we have other offerings like NetWorker for backup, the SourceOne product family for compliant archiving and our family of Disk libraries.
Our fourth massive opportunity is around virtualizing client devices. We will bring to this market the benefits of virtualization and centralized management, the protection of centralized storage and enhanced information management, with a new and better way to secure information while lowering total costs. In short, we will help our customers embrace and get the maximum value from the rapid advances in choices that are now happening in client devices, while lowering their total TCO. This deep client market, while quite small right now, is extremely active as numerous customers are engaged in proof of concepts. Additionally, we see early adopters experiencing solid results. These are clear signs, to steal a phrase, that this is going to be big.
Collectively, in these four mega-growth opportunities, we have the vision, the leading technologies in virtualization, in security, in storage for block, file and object data and for the next generation of backup recovery and archive solutions. We have the people and the expertise to help customers and service providers make this transition. We have the partner ecosystem in place to succeed. And very importantly, we have the trust and permission of our customers to play in these markets.
We are convinced that continuing our focus on these four growth markets, along with continued investments in innovative technology and in exceptional people, we can maintain our long-term double-digit revenue growth rate. 
Thanks again for joining us today. I'll now turn it over to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call."

We really are not anticipating a lot of that pent-up demand kind of running forward into the rest of the year. If you kind of look at how we guided, obviously our $16.5 billion guidance is a very strong revenue number. It's an 18% revenue growth, but if you kind of pull it apart, you'll see that because of pent-up demand, we're expecting Q1 to be higher than a usual percentage of the total. So we're expecting to move to a more seasonal pattern kind of after Q1, which would mean essentially that you wouldn't see quite as big a jump. In fact, Q2 might be near or flattish compared to Q1, and then expect a more seasonal progression from that point going forward."

We are -- you can see the private cloud when you heard their conference call yesterday and their thing.

Public cloud community strategy is to watch and participate and have the best technology as this growing business for the Virtual Desktop and virtual client emerges. So those are all common strategies. So it's important that we work them together. Obviously, we continue to let, to work VMware in a very open fashion so that others can continue to play. And that will continue to be the case. And, of course, EMC on the back of that, which is good for today's environments and good for tomorrow's cloud environments, the next-generation backup recovery that we add. So keeping that stake is incredibly important, and that's exactly what we're going to do. Secondly, as we have those four great -- probably one of the first times in my life that I had four opportunities this big hitting me at once. So our best, I believe, our best return on value for customers is to make sure we take the right moves and continue to invest in technology through our own R&D. So how we were a little -- it's going to ramp up, we are going to share increase our R&D this year to 20%. We are going to continue to buy companies, both in VMware and in EMC. And that'll be the primary focus for the cash and to get great returns for the shareholders. And we continue to focus on what David calls the triple play. We want to hit -- in the short term, we want to hit, we want to make sure that we continue to grow and take share. We want to make sure that we continue to invest for the long-term and capitalizing opportunities. So we want to do all three."

But I think the big story is V-Max, the adoption and the opportunity that V-Max gives us. And, of course, the two big things with V-Max is the fact, the way we’ve planned this from the beginning to really optimize the use of flash drives and then our FAST technology, which tiers storage automatically. So whether it puts it on dramatically different cost structure, whether it puts it on a flash drive, say a 15K Fibre Channel drive or a two terabyte SATA drive or two terabyte SATA drive, de-duped.  I mean, these are very different cost profiles on the customer, and therefore our customer can set a policy and let us just move the data automatically. And, of course, as we have thousands of customers that now have over a petabyte of data, this automation is what has to happen. I mean, that's what kind of one of the basic tenets of even of private cloud. It’s becoming -- so that you got to trust the automation to help you get the productivity and that trust is there in Symmetrix. And I think that's the big reason it did well. And also, to be fair, Symmetrix did benefit from some of the pent-up demand from last year's hiatus, so to speak."

The area that you're probably -- is a little different from what you may have expected is, if you look at the services component of gross margin, which you can get to either with the stand-alone results or by pulling out VMware, what you’ll see is a fairly large decline sequentially in the services gross margin for a few factors. One is we are building up our Consulting and Professional Services business. That has a lower margin mix and that was a high percentage of the business. And also on the services side, bear in mind we reinstated the 5% salary cuts this quarter. We had some fringe adjustments and a couple of other things happening to the services side. So the services gross margin sequentially was a little bit down more than it would've been or more than it was, for example, from the last Q4 to Q1.

We, for sure, are seeing customers that would've bought a mid-tier product just saying, “Okay, now that SIEM has this degree of scalability” -- because this new SIEM is unique in that it scales up like every other did, but it also scales out. So you could scale these things out fairly inexpensively and by sometimes by taking that approach at adding a low-tier, say, SATA drives in it and using software like FAST, it can compete very, very effectively with mid-tier. So you are right, it does -- and that is one of the reasons for SIEM's, one of the reasons for SIEM’s high growth this quarter. So there will be some blurring.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report that EMC had another good quarter due to strong demand for our market leading solutions, our solid business model and great execution by the team. There are",3143,"Thanks Tony. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report that EMC had another good quarter due to strong demand for our market leading solutions, our solid business model and great execution by the team. There are many highlights this quarter including record Q2 revenues of over $4 billion, up 24% and record Q2 non-GAAP net income of $596 million, up 66%, non-GAAP EPS of $0.28, up a robust 56%. Our storage business was up 21%.
VMware grew revenue 48% over last year. Free cash flow was $1.6 billion for the first half, up 47% and non-GAAP operating margin of 20.7% improved a 120 bits sequentially. Once again we achieved our triple play. We gained market share, invested for the future, and improved profitability. Within our consolidated revenue which is up 24% we saw excellent growth storage as I mentioned, up 21% year-on-year. Security revenue grew 18%. Our information intelligence group revenue was roughly flat and VMware revenue grew an impressive 48%.
Now let's take a closer look at some of the details within these business units. Within storage in the high end, Symmetrix product revenues were up 32% year-on-year as customers are embracing the capabilities of our high end solution. As the most powerful scalable storage solution on the market today V-Max clearly addresses customers needs as they build out their private cloud infrastructures. Our fully automated storage tiering software known as FAST is driving higher rate of SSD and ATA based storage in these systems, resulting in huge performance and cost improvements for our customers.
As anticipated, following the introduction of FAST, we have seen penetration rates continue to rise in terms of SSD capacity per system, percentage of systems shift with SSD and the proportion of systems being shipped with FAST. The combination of SSD and ATA drives with FAST software yields a solution with performance, scalability and cost effectiveness that's unmatched by our competitors.
Our VPLEX platform, which we announced in May, is a net new opportunity and it's proving to be a unique differentiator that is resonating with customers. Its technology is very complementary to tiered storage as the combination of tiering with the mobility from VPLEX creates entirely new usage models that's an ideal virtual storage infrastructure for the private cloud.
As we said with virtualization we're apt to consolidate it onto one server and then could be mobilized over many servers. Virtual storage creates an elastic tool of storage within which you can tier data and with VPLEX move data across arrays within and between data centers.
Our technology lead also extends to our mid-tier storage offerings. As you will recall, last quarter we expanded our disclosure to give you better insight into our progress in the mid-tier overall taking into account the mix shift occurring among our mid-tier products.
The many used cases mobile technology that’s available in the mid-tier have driven customers to demand ease of use and simplicity as well as the right technology for the right job. The strength and breadth of our technology portfolio helps to satisfy these customer requirements better than anyone else. Our approach is to continue to invest in our market leading log file and object storage products while converging technologies and products where it makes sense for simplicity and efficiency. 
This ongoing strategy resulted in mid-tier product growth in Q2 increasing to 33% year-on-year. Sequential growth was 12%. This is very good growth especially given the fact that the majority of our mid-tier revenue currently comes from the high end of the mid-tier markets.
In addition to being the overall leader in mid-tier storage, EMC continues to be the leader in the more mature private channel only mid-tier markets. While fiber, while the fiber channel market is very important, we are also seeing higher growth opportunities in other areas of the mid-tier.
Some of this growth is in the form of a mix shift from traditional fiber only products to next generation products like our very successful D-Dupe products and the fast growing unified multiprotocol NS Celerra offerings we introduced a few years ago.
For example what might have traditionally been a CLARiiON Disk Library sale might now be a date of demand D-Dupe deal. As the mid-tier market continues to evolve we're in lockstep with customers making the transition to next generation solutions.
What really sets our mid-tier solutions apart is our technology edge coupled with simplicity and efficiency and this is driving our growth across the mid tier. EMC is considerably more efficient from a capacity standpoint versus competitive solutions and we guarantee it.
EMC enables better scalability to customers wanting to add capacity while retaining high-performance and high storage utilization levels. EMC is optimized for virtual environments in ways that make a notable difference to the customer resulting EMC being the clear storage vendor choice in virtualized environments.
Much of this preference is due to the efforts we've made to have the best integration with VMware virtual environments. For example, EMC is the only storage vendor to full support the four VMware storage APIs, for vCenter Site Recovery Manager, Data Protection, Multipathing and the just introduced Array Integration API. EMC puts more effort and resources into tight-integration and customers can tell the difference.
Today, EMC has far and away the largest installed base in VMware environments and according to a spending intention survey recently conducted by major independent analyst firm, VMware customers are more than twice as likely to choose EMC for storage than any other vendor.
As you know, software functionality is increasingly the key to competitive differentiation in the mid-tier and this quarter we'll be shipping exiting new next-gen software technologies that further extend the capabilities of our market leading CLARiiON and Celerra platforms. Since announcing these technologies that EMC rolled in May, customer anticipation has been very high as it offers a set of functionalities that no other vendor can match.
We're releasing a major step forward in management with Unisphere with an advanced and easy to interface to manage both Celerra and CLARiiON. We're building on our unique FAST technology in the mid-tier with FAST V2, which delivers sub-LUN performance analysis and data relocation.
We're providing customers with a new capability called FAST Cache, enabling customers to utilize solid state storage to increase cache size for burst requirements and we're introducing block compression for primary storage which yields an average of 50% improvement in storage consumption.
So to summarize our position in the mid-tier, first of all EMC is already the acknowledged leader in the traditional mid-tier SAN and NAS environments. Secondly, EMC is also leading in some of the most important new technologies such a D-Dupe, unified storage and virtualization affinity. And third, EMC continues to add major next-generation software functions that further extend our technological lead.
When you put it all together, EMC is the only company at this position to cross the mid-tier. Our competitive edge continues to grow and as a result it's pretty clear that EMC should be able continue to gain share in the mid-tier.
Before moving on, I know there has been a lot of interest in our strategy around our unified product family. So let me clarify this a bit for you. For a number of viewers, we've offered multi-protocol storage on one hardware platform, namely SAN, both fiber channel and iCSCI0: and NAS in the box, and this multi-protocol Celerra, this multi-protocol NS Celerra, has been one of our fastest growing products ever since.
As I already said, in a few weeks we're releasing a single management interface, Unisphere for our block and file functionalities. What we're maintaining is our market leading SAN and NAS technologies that have been optimized for different data requirements customers have because one size does not fit all when it comes to these requirements.
In essence NS Celerra now has best of breed file-and-block functionality via advanced next generation software including a single management interface, fast cache, D-Dupe and compression on one common high performance hardware platform. This combination presents a most cost effective, most reliable and easy to use unified solution whilst retaining the native functionalities that customers value.
I might also add that we have recently integrated Atmos with Celerra adding object capabilities to our flagship unified storage platform. And as I mentioned earlier, our success in the mid-tier has come principally from the higher end of the market.
We plan to extend our success in the mid-tier to the faster growing lower end of the market with a new product family featuring EMC's market leading technologies, a price that will be very competitive in this space. As such we are also investing in the right people, the right partners to aggressively market this new family which we expect formally introduce very early, next year.
Our backup recovery systems business had another stellar quarter and continue overachieve against plans in Q2. When we acquired Data Domain a year ago, we had a pretty good idea of the power that could be unleashed by combining their data de-duplication technology with Avamar and our sensitive customer reach and in Q2 revenue from Avamar and Data Domain continue to grow from the $1 billion revenue run-rate we reported last quarter. There is great demand for this simple and efficient next generation backup technology because it addresses one of the biggest paying points in the data center.
We acquired over 350 new Data Domain customers in Q2 alone and more than 200 Avamar customers. Our BRS division continues to make strides against competitors with a release earlier this week of several new capabilities, including a new mid-range system that leverages Nehalem technology to drive high levels of performance and capacity, a de-duplication expansion option for EMC disk library for mainframe and increased scalability of the EMC disk library series. In short, this division is performing very well and the acquisition of the Data Domain completed a year ago this Friday has a ratio in [Cell-3] one of our best ever.
Clearly we are gaining share in storage and the reasons for that are straightforward. Customers are not only seeking out larger trusted vendors with established track records but they want a partner with a clear road map, innovative products and a breadth of capabilities for taking full advantage of cloud efficiencies going forward. EMC fits the bill in both areas.
Our RSA security revenue growth accelerates in Q2 to 18% year-on-year, coming in at $173 million. We saw strength across the board in security. Archer is driving and we're benefiting from the combination of its audit capabilities with our security information and event management and data loss prevention technologies. More than ever deal discussions are taking place at the CIO and CISO level together as customers seek security that is built and round bolted on.
Our data centric approach is especially resent with customers and security will enable us for broader adoption of cloud infrastructures. Accordingly we continue to invest to leverage our unique position and take advantage of the immense opportunity to secure these next-gen infrastructures.
Our information intelligence group formerly known as content management archiving reporting revenues of $178 million, relatively flat from the last years Q2. Our xCP composition platform and our e-discovery solutions are resonating well with customers. VMware revenue within EMC grew 48% year-on-year to $673 million. This Q2 record revenue was driven by strength across geographies, products and customer segments from SMB up through the enterprise.
Virtualization of the server infrastructure is the first step towards cloud computing and it's clear that customers are laying the foundation for their cloud architectures with VMware. This is not surprising, given the gains and flexibility efficiency in cost savings that cloud architectures offer and the fact that VMware technology is several generations ahead of competitors.
Our four business units together represent the combined power of information and virtual infrastructures. The same fundamental shift in IT is driving the success of each and together we continue to move forward under a shared vision and strategic direction to fully capture the opportunities that bounds over the next several years as customers embark on a journey to private cloud.
Our VCE coalition is addressing its mission to accelerate the proliferation of cloud infrastructures. Customers are eager to start realizing the benefits of reduced cost and improved business agility. They are looking to VCE as a means to get there because it provides a way to significantly reduce risks, costs and time to value with ready to deploy cloud infrastructures.
A recent survey by Data Monitor and UBS indicated that the VCE coalition is far and way the preferred solution for data sensor modernization. Our consulting business also continues to thrive by guiding customers transitions to virtual data center architectures as EMC is a trusted advisor within the enterprise that enables customers to move forward with confidence.
As the only player offering virtual server and virtual storage infrastructures, coupled with advanced IT security and compliance in information intelligence, EMC is squarely focused on helping customers make this transaction to next generation private and public clouds.
Let me now give you a bit more color about what else happened in the quarter looking at our geos. All our geographies contributed to year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter with revenue up 28% in North America, 18% in EMEA, 20% in APJ and 22% in Latin America. In North America we did see some weakness in federal governments that was more than offset by growth in financial services, CME and the commercial markets.
Our International mix stood at 47% in Q2 with the largest portion of foreign revenue coming from Europe. Within Europe there was some weakness in Spain, Portugal and Greece and this was more than offset by strength in the U.K., France, Northern Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia.
Our growth in APJ was led by strength in India and China. Our force in the brick for 13 emerging markets is yielding good growth again with future revenue growth of over 30%. And as you can see EMC is a global company with operation in dozens of countries. Internationally we do some business in dollars and come in local currieries. Some local currency businesses is hedged and some is not and in some markets we have local pricing plans and not in others.
Given these and other factors, non-dollar currency effects are obviously a complex internal equation and pretty much impossible to calculate from an external perspective. So given your interest in this topic, I will try to net out the impact for your modeling purposes. While currency was neutral to our results in Q2, based on where rates were at June 30, we expect the currency will now be a 1 point head win for the full year 2010.
Now let's take a look at some the income statement balance sheet items, I'm Q2, EMC reported non-GAAP gross margin of 60.1%, non-GAAP operating margin of 20.7%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.28. Free cash flow for the last 12 months was $3.1 billion, up over 20% in the comparable period, and about $800 million higher than trailing 12 months non-GAAP net income. 
The excellent growth across this metrics demonstrate improvements we've made to our business model over the last couple of years are yielding a resulting the results we expected. The Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. We now expect a full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be close to 21%. This increase is due to high expected contribution of profits from the U.S. due to currency a well as some other factors. 
We do still expect the U.S. R&D tax credit to take effect later this year. DSOs came in 45 days, compared to 52 for the second quarter of 2009. Inventory turns were 8.2, compared to 7.8 a year ago, and deferred revenue is up nearly $100 million from last quarter. We ended the quarter with $10.8 billion of cash; of this a total $6.2 billion was held in the U.S. with the remainder overseas. 
We spent $341 million in the quarter buying back 18.6 million shares of EMC stock almost twice our Q1 level bringing it up to over $500 million on EMC share repurchases so far this year. We still expect to spend a $1 billion on EMC stock for the end of the year. In addition, EMC spent $99 million buying VMware shares, and VMware spent $130 million buying back VMware shares.
Our VMware business is a key enabler to making our cloud vision a reality. While customer transition to the cloud is underway, the majority of the journey lies ahead of us, which is why we see the purchases of EMC and VMware's excellent investments. As we look to the second half of 2010, our expectations to economic growth and IT spending for the full-year really haven’t changed that much. 
IT spending still looks to be up around 3 to 5% with addressable market stronger, up around 6 to 8%. As the beginning of the year, we said we expected a economic recovery would be moderate with some bumps in the road, and this is what we've seen. There are a few factors we didn't specifically anticipate, so it's the relative weakness of the euro and pound, a high projected tax rate and more cautious government spending in the U.S. and Europe, and we obviously monitoring the impact of this very closely. 
However, in spite these challenges, based on the level of customer interest in our strategy and solutions combined with the strength of our businesses including storage in VMware we now expect what we would like to see our previous outlook of $16.5 billion of revenue and $1.18 in non-GAAP EPS in 2010.
Our Q2 results indicates that we are on the right track strategically and executing well on our triple play. We see no reason why we cannot continue to maintain this triple play over the long-term. When thinking about this, it is worth noting that since we start expanding, EMC's addressable markets in 2004, EMC's growth is impressive with annual average revenue growth of 12% and annual average non-GAAP EPS growth of 19%. This is excellent performance over the six year period which included the '08, and '09 recession. 
So today, our strategy is clear. The business model and operating model are in place. Our investments continue to pay off, and the private cloud opportunity is very big. EMC has never been better positioned for success than it is right now and as a result we believe we can continue to deliver double-digit revenue and double-digit earning growth for the next several years. I'll now turn the call over to Joe who will provide some color on what we're seeing in 2010, and explain why we are confident about double-digit growth going forward. Joe?

I would like to begin by adding my welcome to all of you who are attending today's conference call, thanks for joining us.Overall, I was very pleased with our performance in Q2. We posted solid year-over-year and sequential growth nu",1419,"Well, thanks David. I would like to begin by adding my welcome to all of you who are attending today's conference call, thanks for joining us.
Overall, I was very pleased with our performance in Q2. We posted solid year-over-year and sequential growth numbers while establishing EMC and VMware as thought leader in the next major wave of computing, mainly the transformation of IT to IT as a service, commonly called cloud computing.
This success would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the more than 45,000 people of EMC and VMware around the world. I want to thank them for their leadership and congratulate them on their accomplishments.
I believe the top question on your mind has to be around the pockets of uncertainty that seem to pop up around the world and their affect on the global economy, and more specifically, how does will manifest itself in IT spending going forward. As we have said before, we at EMC expected and planned for our recovery in 2010, but we always believe it would be choppy. So, perhaps the best way to look at IT spending trends is by geography.
The U.S. market continues to be good with good prospects. Our customers here are investing in information technologies to increase their levels of productivity while managing risk with a maniacal focus on maintaining solid compliance with their policies, best practices and laws of the land while ensuring proper governance and oversight.
Turning to the international markets; in Europe, we are seeing moderate growth in IT spend, except in Southern Europe, we're definitely seen slowdown in IT purchases. In Latin America, the Middle-East, Africa, China, Southeast Asia and selected Eastern European countries, IT spending is robust and is exhibiting very solid double-digit growth. And lastly in Japan, we've seen that spending is now improving a bit.
And as David has already said, we were not affected by currency rates in Q2, but we most likely will be in the second half of this year. I want to make it clear however, that with only 47% of our revenues coming from the international markets, I truly believe we have ample opportunity for solid international growth despite likely currency fluctuations.
We at EMC believe that international revenues should make up well over 50% of our total revenues and we are squarely focused on investing in this growth opportunity for EMC. Of importance to global markets to virtualization storage, data protection and data security markets were consolidating EMC as the leader. We'll continue to grow faster in the IT market as a whole.
And again what adds confidence to this growth statement is the thought leadership, innovations and strong product mode of roadmap we have in the next new way of IT, cloud computing. It is our firm belief that cloud computing will happen in both enterprise IT shops as customers transform the IT datacenters into private clouds as well as in the service provider community, we build out an extensive number of very large public clouds.
These transformations will give CIOs the capabilities to offer their customers whether they are internal customers or external customers, the mass of benefits of IT as a service, namely the ability to run applications, more flexibly at a lower cost, while assuring that the attendant policies and service levels are here too.
To assure, we capitalize on this master cloud opportunity, consolidated EMC is focused in our technology and go to-market resources on providing our customers with a path, a measured journey to the private cloud. First and foremost, VMware is advancing its leading virtualization technologies into a full fledge, next generation data center cloud operating system with innovative and integrated, management, automation and orchestration software.
Last week’s introduction of VSphere 4.1 is a major deliverable towards that goal. VM also uniquely automates both existing applications as well as reaching out to the new wave development communities that tend to develop applications in a framework context. A powerful benefit to customers as a journey to the private cloud.
VMware also has a significant technology play in bringing their virtualization technology to client devices allowing for the provisioning of an individual user rather than provisioning the constantly changing C of new devices that seem to come out as almost daily.
On the information side, EMC is focused on storing, managing, protecting and securing the incredible amount of new digital information that this world continues to create with price performance levels that the future cloud world will demand.
IDC in a recent White Paper estimated that the amount of digital information that is created will grow remarkable, a remarkable 44 times during 2009 and 2020. EMC is heavily investing in innovative information technologies like V-Max, a new category storage that scales both up and out, or bring unmatched cost performance functionality and reliability. Technologies like unified storage or converged fiber channel, SAN, NAS and iSCSI environments again featuring leading functionality for mid-tier storage platforms.
We are investing in game changing cloud technologies like VPLEX our Virtual Storage product. VPLEX provides new capabilities like active/active data over distance and information federation across cloud data centers.
Since most of the new information has been created as object base, EMC is investing heavily on special like cloud storage for this important category of information storage software called Atmos.
We are investing in technologies like FAST or fully automated storage tiering that moves data automatically and constantly with the policy and service levels our customer choose between flash drives, fiber channel drives, SATA drives and SSD drives were the data is de-duplicated and compressed fastest and short innovative technology that assures ultra-high performance when called for will also optimize the total system for lowest cost.
We are investing in technologies for data protection, changing the backup paradigm from slow unpredictable backup the tape to the backup the disk with best in class data de-duplication and compression technologies to offer customers speed of recovery, reliability recovery and low cost.
We are investing in technologies that secure data itself and access to the data while assuring stellar, GRC metrics. A quick preview of things to come is later this year. We released the capability to encrypt data at rest on array itself. That’s fully integrated with RSA's key management software that is most cost effective and has very high performance, and lastly we are investing heavily in our customers to gain value from their information, to help our customers gain value from their information. Greenplum our most recent acquisition provides organization with real time insight from vast amounts of data.
Greenplum’s unique naturally parallel scale out architecture provides the ability to handle big data and delivers information intelligence in real time. We also continue to extend our Documentum's to offer portfolios to help our customers to better leverage information that is vital to their business.
With our new document xCP platform we are enabling companies to move from traditional and complex enterprise concept management applications to far more flexible case management applications.
In short, xCP dramatically reduces the amount of custom code that is typically required, thus saving customer’s time and money. 
Another important piece of our cloud strategy is the deep partnership and alliances that we have built with other leading IT companies. Partners like Cisco via our VCE coalition. And I'm happy to report that under the leadership of Michael Capellas, VCE reception by our customers has been nothing short of remarkable and Vblocks sales are well ahead of plan.
I'm also pleased to report that our partnership with Dell is back on track, and is very strategic to both companies. Our Q2 mid-tier storage revenues were roughly flat year-on-year with Dell, and we fully expect to have year-on-year mid-tier growth with them in the second half.
Our partnerships with system integrators such as Accenture, CSC, Capgemini, Wipro, TCS and Deloitte and others continue to grow strategically and tactically. And lastly, on the service provider front we are building a number of very deep alliances and we will be talking to you soon about our initiatives and plans here.
In summary, EMC is executing very well in today’s IT market. We have a strong product and technology portfolio and the go-to-market prowess to create the opportunities that the next wave of IT cloud computing will offer. Thus I reaffirm our belief that we can achieve double-digit growth rates over the long-term.
Let me now turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today’s call.

So, that is a factor, during the call in Q2 we were back to regularly normal seasonality, we mentioned that we saw some earlier seasonality in Q1 because of some kind of spillover, but I think what we saw in Q2 was a more normal demand environment, I think we really put our over achievements down to the fact that people just had a better appetite for our products and services because they are just satisfying customers paying points well.
So, I think those accounts the key factors, I think one of the biggest differences that you mentioned before from were we were in April was that currency head wins.

And as David said, governments around the world as they try to -- kind of reign in their spending a bit. So, we kind of have one good work from column A and one kind of negative trend from column B and I actually think they are both true. So, I do think that the government will make a massive play there is much more efficient way in and much more flexible way to do IT instead of cloud and we will benefit from that.
And on the other said as the government cuts back in its day-to-day spending, you get hurt by that side.

Let me say two things. The number that David gave you that was little bit over 21% growth year-on-year is the way to look at it because you really as David said our sales force is good and has a lot of sway with customers and for sure we would have sold some more of our own devices like CLARiiON and disk library, which now we are forcing and it's setting our sales force to shift data to the main product. So, the best way to look at this is apples-to-apples is assuming we owned Data Domain a year ago, and we obviously do own them today. 
That difference in growth all in mid-tier right, which is meeting the product only is over 21%, so it's very solid growth and it's real growth. The second question you're asking is you want more color I think on what our plans are for mid-tier refresh. We started and worked incredibly successfully with -- when we announced, before we announced VPLEX. What we did is put out a big piece of the software to bake into our then DMX-4 line, so that you're not announcing all new software and all new hardware at the same time. 
We basically, like that model so much, and customers adopted it so much. We are doing the same thing now. So, what you just saw and David took you through FAST Cache Unisphere several other, and there is a pretty good laundry list of products, that is the new operating system that will be on the refreshed hardware products. We told you, David just told you that our new low-end, right, our new low-end will be introduced in Q1, all right? We also told you the fastest growing piece at mid-tier by far is and I mean by far is the low-end. 
So, we are very optimistic about this new low-end, and that the impact it's going to have.

Also, I have talked you about our triple play where we want to have a balance between gain market share, investing for the future and improving profitability. We said the over long-term we will be focused on being able to deliver all three of those. There will be some balance between anyone over a period of time but overtime, we plan to deliver all three. So, we do have an eye upon expanding operating margins overtime but also we talked about a significant investment in cloud software, repositioning so we can position ourselves to our public and private clouds. So, we'll have a balance between all three.
We've committed also over the next few years, we'll give at least double-digit revenue and double-digit earnings growth. So, I think we've given a number of indicators to say that we are suppose to follow, but we were certainly not going backwards and we will overtime be able to expand our operating margins as well. It's really balanced and we’ll play that balance carefully and we'll communicate to you where we are any point in time in that balance.

121729,109403582,68198,"EMC Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-21-2010",2010-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Dell EMC","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report that EMC had another good quarter due to strong demand for our market-leading solutions, our solid business model and great execution by the team. There a",3092,"Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report that EMC had another good quarter due to strong demand for our market-leading solutions, our solid business model and great execution by the team. There are many highlights this quarter including record future revenues of over $4 billion, up 24%, and record Q2 non-GAAP net income of $596 million, up 66%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.28, up a robust 56%. Our Storage business was up 21%. VMware revenue, 48% over last year. Free cash flow was $1.6 billion for the first half, up 47%, and non-GAAP operating margin of 20.7% improved 120 bps sequentially.
Once again, we achieved our triple play. We gained market share, invested for the future and improved profitability. Within our consolidated revenue, which is up 24%, we saw excellent growth storage, as I mentioned, of 21% year-on-year. Security revenue grew 18%. Our Information Intelligence Group revenue was roughly flat and VMware revenue grew an impressive 48%.
Now let's take a closer look at some of the details in these business units. Within Storage in the high end, Symmetrix part revenues were up 32% year-on-year, as customers are embracing the capabilities of a high-end solution. As the most powerful and scalable storage solution on the market today, VMAX clearly addresses customer's needs as they build-out their Private Cloud infrastructures.
Our Fully Automated Storage Tiering software known as FAST, is driving higher rates of SSD and ATA-base storage in these systems, resulting in huge performance and cost improvements for our customers.
As anticipated, following the introduction of FAST, we've seen penetration rates continue to rise in terms of SSD capacity per system, percentage of systems shipped with SSD and the proportion of systems being shipped with FAST. The combination of SSD and ATA drives with FAST software yield a solution with performance, scalability and cost effectiveness that's unmatched by our competitors.
Our VPLEX platform, which we announced in May, is a net new opportunity and it's proving to be a unique differentiator that is resonating with customers. Its technology is very complementary to Tiered Storage, as the combination of tiering with the mobility from VPLEX creates entirely new usage models that's on our deal Virtual Storage infrastructure for the Private Cloud. As we see the virtualization, where apps are consolidated onto one server and then could be mobilized over many servers, Virtual Storage creates an elastic pool of storage wherein which you can tier data and with VPLEX, move data across arrays within and between data centers.
Our technology lead also extends to our mid-tier storage offerings. As you will recall, last quarter, we expanded our disclosure to give you better insight into our progress in the mid-tier overall, taking into account the mix shift occurring among the our mid-tier products. Though many use case [ph] as the multi-technologies available in the mid-tier have driven customers to demand ease-of-use and simplicity, as well as the right technology for the rights job. The strength and breadth of our Technology portfolio help to satisfy these customer requirements better than anyone else. Our approach is to continue to invest in our market leading block file and object storage products while converging technologies and products where it makes sense for simplicity and efficiency. This ongoing strategy resulted in mid-tier product growth in Q2, increasing to 33% year-on-year. Sequential growth was 12%. This is very good growth, especially given the fact that majority of mid-tier revenue currently comes from the high end of the mid-tier markets. 
In addition to being the overall leader in mid-tier storage, EMC continues to be the leader in the more mature Fibre Channel-only mid-tier markets. While the Fibre Channel market is very important, we're also seeing higher growth opportunities in other areas of the mid-tier. Some of this growth is in the form of a mix shift from traditional Fibre-only products to next-generation products like our very successful dedupe products and the fast-growing unified, multi-protocol NS Celerra offerings we introduced a few years ago.
For example, what might have been a traditionally been a CLARiiON Disk Library sale might now be a Data Domain dedupe deal. Now as the mid-tier market continues to evolve, we enlocks that with customers making the transition to next-generation solutions. What really sets our mid-tier solutions apart is our technology edge, coupled with simplicity and efficiency and this is driving our growth across the mid-tier.
EMC is considerably more efficient from a capacity standpoint versus competitive solutions, and we guarantee it. EMC enables better scalability as customers wanted to add capacity while retaining high performance and high storage utilization levels. EMC is optimized for virtual environments in ways that make a noticeable difference to the customers resulting in EMC being the clear storage vendor choice for virtualized environments. Much of this preference is due to the efforts we've made to have the best integration with VMware virtual environments. For example, EMC is the only storage band that fully support the four VMware storage APIs for vCenter Site Recovery Manager, Data Protection, Multi- passing and the just-introduced Array Integration API.
EMC puts more effort and resources into this tight integration and customers can tell the difference. Today, EMC has far and away to launch installed base in VMware environments. And according to a Spending Intention Survey recently conducted by major independent analyst firm, VMware customers are more than twice as likely to choose EMC to storage than any other vendor.
As you know, software functionality is increasingly the key to competitive differentiation in the mid-tier. And this quarter, we'll be shipping exciting, new, next-gen software technologies the further extend the capabilities of our market-leading CLARiiON and Celerra platforms. Since announcing these technologies at EMC World in May, customer anticipation has been very high, as they offer set of functionalities that no other vendor can match. We're releasing a major step toward in management with Unisphere with an advanced and easy-to-use interface to manage both Celerra and CLARiiON. We're building on our unique FAST technology in the mid-tier with FAST v2, which delivers several on performance analysis and data relocation. We're providing customers with a new capability called FAST Cache, enabling customers to utilize solid-state storage that increase cache size adverse requirements. And we're introducing lock compression for primary storage which yields an average of 50% improvement in storage consumption.
So to summarize our position in the mid-tier, first of all, EMC is already the technology leader in the traditional mid-tier stand in that environments. Secondly, EMC is also leading in some of the most important new technologies such as dedupe Unified Storage and Virtualization Infinity. And third, EMC continues to add major next-generation software functions that further extend our technological lead.
When you put it altogether, EMC is the only company that's positioned across the mid-tier. Our competitive edge continues to grow and as a result, it's pretty clear that EMC should be able to continue to gain share in the mid-tier.
Before moving on, I know there's been a lot of interest in our strategy around our unified product family. Let me clarify this a bit for you. For a number of years, we've offered multi-protocol storage on one hardware platform, namely SAN, both Fibre Channel and iSCSI and NAS in a box. And this multi-protocol Celerra, this multi-protocol NS Celerra has been one of our fastest-growing products ever since. 
As I already said, in a few weeks, we're releasing single management interface, Unisphere, for our block and file functionalities. What we're maintaining is our market leading SAN and NAS technologies have been optimized for the different data requirements customers have because one size does not fit all when it comes to this requirements.
In essence, NS Celerra now has best-of-breed, file-and-block functionality with advance next-generation software including a single management interface, FAST Cache, dedupe and compression on one common high-performance hardware platform. This combination presents the most cost effective, most reliable and easy-to-use unified solution while retaining the native functionalities that customers value.
I might also add that we've recently integrated Atmos with Celerra, having object capabilities to our flagship Unified Storage Platform.
And as I mentioned earlier, after success of the mid-tier has come principally from the higher end of the market. We plan to extend our success in the mid-tier for the faster growing, lower end of the market with a new product family featuring EMC's market-leading technologies, our prices will be very competitive in this space. As such, we're also investing in the right people, the right partners to aggressively market this new family, which we expect to formally introduce very early next year.
Our Backup Recovery Systems business had another stellar quarter and continue to overachieve against plan in Q2. When we acquired Data Domain a year ago, we had a pretty good idea of the power that could be unleashed by combining their data deduplication technology with Avamar and our extensive customer reach. And in Q2, revenue from Avamar and Data Domain continue to grow from the billion-dollar revenue run rate we reported last quarter. There is great demand for the simple and efficient next-generation backup technology because it addresses one of the biggest paying points in the data center. We acquired over 350 new Data Domain customers in Q2 alone and more than 200 new Avamar customers.
Our BOF division continues to make strides against competitors with the release earlier this weak with several new capabilities including a new midrange system, that leverages Nehalem technology to drive high levels of performance and capacity, a deduplication expansion option for EMC Disk Library for mainframe and increased scalability of the EMC Disk Library series. In short, this division is performing very well and the acquisition of Data Domain completed a year ago this Friday has already shown itself to be one of our best ever.
Clearly, we are gaining share in storage. And the reasons there is straightforward. Customers are not only seeking out larger trusted vendors with established track records, but they want a partner with a clear roadmap, innovative products and a breadth of capabilities to taking full advantage of cloud efficiencies going forward. EMC fits the bill in both areas.
Our RSA Security revenue growth accelerates in Q2 to 18% year-on-year, coming in at $173 million. We saw strength across the board in security. R/3 is thriving, and we're benefiting from the combination of its auditing capabilities, with our security information and event management and data loss prevention technologies. More than ever, deal discussions' taking place at the CIO and CISO level together as customers seek security that is built-in rather bolted on. Our data-centric approach is especially resonant with customers and security has enabled us for broader adoption of cloud infrastructures. Accordingly, what we continue to invest and leverage our unique position and take advantage of the immense opportunity to secure these next-gen infrastructures.
Our Information Intelligence Group, formerly known as Content Management and Archiving reported revenues of $178 million, relatively flat from last year's Q2. Our xCP Composition Platform and our eDiscovery Solutions are resonating well with customers.
VMware revenue within EMC grew 48% year-on-year to $673 million. This Q2 record revenue was driven by strength across geographies, products and customer segments from SMB up through the enterprise. Virtualization of the server infrastructure is the first step towards cloud computing, and it's clear that customers are laying the foundation for their cloud architectures with VMware. This is not surprising given the gains and flexibility, efficiency and cost savings that cloud architectures offer, and the fact that VMware technology is several generations ahead of competitors.
Our four business years together represent a combined power of information and virtual infrastructures. The same fundamental shift in IT is driving the success of each. And together, we continue to move forward under shared vision and strategic direction that fully capture the opportunity to bounce over the next several years as customers embark on a journey to Private Cloud. Our VCE coalition is addressing its mission to accelerate the proliferation of cloud infrastructures. Customers eager to start realizing the benefits, reduce cost and improve business' agility. They're looking to VCE as a means to get there because it provides a way to significantly reduce risks, costs and time to value with ready-to-deploy could infrastructures.
A recent survey by Data Monitor and UBS indicates that the VCE coalition is far and away the preferred solution for data center modernization.
Our Consulting business also continues to thrive by guiding customers' transition to virtual data center architectures as EMC is a trusted advisor within the enterprise that enables customers to report with confidence.
As the only player offering virtual server and virtual storage infrastructures, coupled with advanced IT Security and Compliance and Information Intelligence, EMC is squarely focused on helping customers make this transition to next-generation  Private and Public Clouds.
Let me now give you a bit more color about what else happened in the quarter looking at our Geos. All our geographies contributed to year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter, with revenue up 28% in North America, 18% in EMEA, 20% in APJ and 22% in Latin America. In North America, we did see some weakness in federal governments that was more than offset by growth international services, GME and the commercial markets. 
Our international mix stood at 47% in Q2 with the largest portion of foreign revenue coming from Europe. Within Europe, there was a weakness in Spain, Portugal and Greece. And this was more than offset by strength in the UK, France, Northern Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia. Our growth in APJ was led by strength in India and China. Our focus on the BRIC + 13 Emerging Markets is yielding good growth again, with future revenue growth of over 30%.
So as you can see, EMC is a global company with operation in dozens of countries. Internationally, we do some business in dollars and some in local currencies. Some local currency business is hedged and some is not. And in some markets, we have local pricing plans and not another's. Given these and other factors, non-dollar currency effect, obviously, a complex internal equation and pretty much impossible to calculate for an X-deal prospective. So given your interest in this topic, I will try to net out the impact for your modeling purposes. While currency was neutral to our results in Q2, based on where rates were at June 30, we expect the currency will now be a one-point headwind for the full year 2010.
Now let's take a look at some of the income statement and balance sheet items. In Q2, EMC reported non-GAAP gross margin of 60.1%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 20.7% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.28. Free cash flow for last 12 months was $3.1 billion, up over 20% from the comparable period and about $800 million higher than trailing 12-month non-GAAP net income. The excellent growth across these metrics demonstrates the improvements we've made to our business model over the last couple years are yielding the results we expected.
The Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. We now expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be close to 21%. This increase is due to higher expected contribution of profits from the U.S. due to currency, as well as some other factors. We do still expect the U.S. R&D tax rate take effect later this year.
DSOs came at 45 days compared to 52 for second quarter of 2009, inventory turns were 8.2 compared to 7.8 a year ago and deferred revenue is up nearly $100 million from last quarter.
We ended the quarter with $10.8 billion of cash. Of this, a total of $6.2 billion was held in the U.S. with the remainder overseas. We spent $341 million in the quarter buying 18.6 million shares of EMC stock, almost twice our Q1 level, bringing us up to over $500 million on EMC share repurchases so far this year. We still expect to spend $1 billion on EMC stock by the end of the year. In addition, EMC spent $99 million buying VMware shares, and VMware spent $130 million buying back VMware shares. Our VMware business is a key enabler that's making our cloud vision a reality.
While customers transition to Cloud is underway, the majority of the journey lies ahead of us, which is why we see the purchases of EMC and VMware as excellent investments.
As we look through the second half of 2010, our expectations to economic growth in IT spending for the full year really haven't changed that much. IT spending still looks to be up around 3% to 5% with our addressable market stronger, up around 6% to 8%. At the beginning of the year, we said we expect the economic recovery will be moderate with some bumps in the road, and that is what we're seeing. There are a few factors we didn't specifically anticipate such  the relative weakness of the euro and pound, our higher-projected tax rates and more cautious government spending in the U.S. and Europe. And we're obviously managing the impact of these very closely. However, in spite these challenges based upon the level of customer interest in our strategy and solutions, combined with the strength of our business including Storage and VMware, we now expect that we will exceed our previous outlook of $16.5 billion of revenue and $1.18 in non-GAAP EPS in 2010. 
Our Q2 results indicate that we are on the right track strategically in executing well on our triple play. We see no reason why we cannot continue to maintain this triple play over the long term. When thinking about this, it is worth noting that since we saw the expanding EMC's addressable markets in 2004, EMC's growth is impressive, with annual average revenue growth of 12% and annual average non-GAAP EPS growth of 19%. This is excellent performance over a six-year period, which included the '08 and '09 recession.
But today, our strategy is clear. The business model and operating model are in place. Our investments continue to pay off, and the Private Cloud opportunity is very big. EMC has never been better positioned for success than it is right now. And as a result, we believe we can continue to deliver double-digit revenue and double-digit earning growth for the next several years. 
I will now turn the call over to Joe, who'll provide some more color on what we're seeing in 2010 and explain why we're confident about double-digit growth going forward. Joe?"

Thanks for joining us. 
Overall, I was very pleased with our performance in Q2. We posted solid year-over-year and sequential growth numbers, while establishing EMC and VMware as a thought leader in the next major wave of computing, mainly the transformation of IT to IT as a service, commonly called cloud computing.
This success would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the more than 45,000 people of EMC and VMware around the world. I'd like to thank them for their leadership and congratulate them on their accomplishments. I believe the top question on your mind has to be around the pockets of uncertainty that seem to pop up around the world and their effect on the global economy, and more specifically, how this will manifest itself in IT spending going forward.
As we have said before, EMC expected and planned for a recovery in 2010, but we always believed it would be choppy. So perhaps the best way to look at IT spending trends is by geography. U.S. market continues to be good with good prospects. Our customers here are investing in information technologies to increase their levels of productivity, while managing risk with a maniacal focus on maintaining stellar compliance with their policies, best practices and laws in land while insuring proper governance and oversight. 
Turning to the international markets, in Europe, we are seeing moderate growth in IT spend. Except in southern Europe where we're definitely seeing a slowdown in IT purchases. In Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, China, Southeast Asia and in selected Eastern European countries, IT spending is robust and is exhibiting very solid double-digit growth. And lastly, in Japan, we are seeing that spending is now improving a bit. 
And as David has already said, we were not affected by currency rates in Q2, but we most likely will be in the second half of this year. I want to make it clear, however, that with only 47% of our revenues coming from international markets, I truly believe we have ample opportunity for solid international growth despite likely currency fluctuations. We at EMC believe that international revenues should make up well over 50% of our total revenues and we're squarely focused on and investing in this growth opportunity for EMC.
Of importance, the global markets through virtualization, storage, data protection and data security, markets were consolidating EMC as the leader. We'll continue to grow faster in the IT market as a whole. And again, where it adds confidence to this growth statement is the thought leadership, innovations, and a strong product roadmap we have in the next new wave of IT cloud computing.
It is our firm belief that cloud computing will happen in both enterprise IT shops as customers transform the IT data centers into Private Clouds, as well as in the service-provided community, we will build out an extensive number of very large Public Clouds. These transformations will give CIOs the capabilities to offer their customers, whether they are internal customers or external customers, the massive benefits of IT as a service, namely the ability to run applications more flexibly at a lower cost while ensuring that the intended policies and service levels are adhered to.
To assure we capitalize on this massive broad opportunity, consolidated EMC's is focusing our technology and go-to market resources on providing our customers with the path, a measured journey to the Private Cloud. First and foremost, VMware is out advancing its leading virtualization technologies into a full-fledged next-generation data center cloud operating system with innovative and integrated management automation and orchestration software. Last week's introduction of  vSphere 4.1 is a major deliverable towards that goal. VM also uniquely automates both existing applications, as well as reaching out to the new wave development communities that tend to develop application in the framework context, a powerful benefit to customers as they journey through the Private Cloud. VMware also has the significant technology playing in bringing their virtualization technology to client devices, allowing for the provisioning of an individual, a user, rather than provision in constantly-changing sea of new devices that seem to come out as almost daily.
On the information side, EMC is focused on storing, managing, protecting and securing the incredible amount of new digital information that this world continues to create, with price performance levels that the future cloud world will demand. IDC, in a recent white paper, estimated that the amount of digital information that is created will grow a remarkable 44x between 2009 and 2020. 
EMC is heavily investing in innovative information technologies like VMAX, a new category storage that scales both up and out, offering unmatched cross-performance, functionality and reliability. Technologies like unified storage for converge fiber channel, SAN, NAS, and iSCSl environment, again, featuring leading functionality for mid-tier storage platforms. We are investing in game changing cloud technologies like VPLEX, our virtual storage product. VPLEX provides new capabilities like active/active data over distance and information federation across cloud data centers.
Since most of new information that is being created is object-phased, EMC is investing heavily on specialized cloud storage for this important category of information storage software called Atmos. We are investing in technologies like FAST, or Fully Automated Storage Tiering, that moves data automatically and in concert with the policy and service levels our customers choose between flash drives, fiber channel drives, SATA drives and SATA drives where the data is deduplicated and compressed. FAST is insured, innovative technology that assures ultra high performance when called for, will also optimize the total system for the lowest cost.
We are investing in technologies for data protection. Changing the backup paradigm from slow, unpredictable backup to tape to backup to disk with best-in-class data deduplication and compression technologies to offer customers speed of recovery, reliability recovery and low cost. We are investing in technologies that secure the data itself and access to the data while assuring stellar GRC metrics. 
A quick preview of things to come later this year. We will release the capability to encrypt data-at-rest on the array itself. That's fully integrated with RSA's key management software that is both cost effective and has very high performance. And lastly, we are investing heavily in our customers to gain value from their information -- to help our customers gain value from their information. Greenplum, our most recent acquisition, provides organizations of real time insight from vast amounts of data. Greenplum's unique massively-parallel, scale-out architecture provides the ability to handle big data and delivers information intelligence in real time. 
We will also continue to extend our Documentum software portfolio to help our customers better leverage information that is vital to their business. With our new Documentum xCP [xCelerated Composition Platform] platform, we are enabling companies to move from traditional and complex enterprise content management applications to far more flexible case management applications. In short, xCP dramatically reduces the amount of custom code that is typically required, thus saving customers time and money. 
Another important piece of our cloud strategy is the deep partnership and alliances that we have built with other leading IT companies. Partners like Cisco via our VCE [Virtual Computing Environment] coalition. And I am happy to report that under the leadership of Michael Capellas, VCE's reception by our customers has been nothing short of remarkable, and Vblock sales are well ahead of plan.
I'm also pleased to report that our partnership with Dell is back on track and is very strategic to both companies. Our Q2 mid-tier storage revenues were roughly flat year-on-year with Dell, and we fully expect to have year-on-year mid-tier growth with them in the second half. Our partnerships with system integrators such as Accenture, CSC, Capgemini, Wipro, TCS [Tata Consultancy Services] and Deloitte and others continue to grow strategically and tactically. And lastly, on the service provider front, we are building a number of very deep alliances, and we will be talking to you soon about our initiatives and plans here.
In summary, EMC is executing very well today's IT market. We have a strong product and technology portfolio and the go-to-market prowess to create the opportunities that the next wave of IT, cloud computing will offer. Thus, I reaffirm our belief that we can achieve double-digit growth rates over the long term. 
Let me now turn it back to Tony to moderate the Q&A portion of today's call."

So what you just saw and David took you through FAST Cache, Flash, Unisphere, several other pretty good laundry list of products. That is the new operating system that will be on the refresh hardware products. David just told you that our new low end will be introduced in Q1. We also told you that the fastest growing piece of mid-tier by far, and I mean by far, is the low end. So we are very optimistic about this new low end and the impact it's going to have. So last piece you want to know is when are we going to introduce the high end in mid-tier. I got to have some surprises, so I'm not going to give you that one. But again, software first. We told you when we're going to do the low end, and I like our position in the mid-tier and I think it's going to continue to get stronger and stronger."

We are there today, and I think that's excellent progress and obviously is a result of what we've done in terms of mix and cost management and a whole bunch of good things across the business. Also, I've talked to you about our triple play where we want to have a balance between gaining market share, investing for the future and improving profitability. And we said over the long term, we will be focused on being able to deliver all three of those. There will be some balance between any one over a period of time. But over time, we plan to deliver all three. So we do have an eye upon expanding operating margins over time. But also we talked about a significant investment in cloud software repositioning so we can position ourselves throughout the public and private clouds, so we will have a balance between all three. We've committed also over the next few years, we'll give you at least double-digit revenue and double-digit earnings growth. So I think we've given you a number of indicators to say that we are focus upon all three. We're certainly not going backwards, and we will, over time, be able to expand our operating margins as well. It's really a balance, and we'll play that balance carefully and we'll communicate to you where we are at any point in time in that balance."

121729,109403582,68237,"EMC Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-21-2010",2010-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Dell EMC","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report that EMC had another good quarter due to strong demand for our market-leading solutions, our solid business model and great execution by the team. There a",3094,"Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report that EMC had another good quarter due to strong demand for our market-leading solutions, our solid business model and great execution by the team. There are many highlights this quarter including record future revenues of over $4 billion, up 24%, and record Q2 non-GAAP net income of $596 million, up 66%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.28, up a robust 56%. Our Storage business was up 21%. VMware revenue, 48% over last year. Free cash flow was $1.6 billion for the first half, up 47%, and non-GAAP operating margin of 20.7% improved 120 bps sequentially.
Once again, we achieved our triple play. We gained market share, invested for the future and improved profitability. Within our consolidated revenue, which is up 24%, we saw excellent growth storage, as I mentioned, of 21% year-on-year. Security revenue grew 18%. Our Information Intelligence Group revenue was roughly flat and VMware revenue grew an impressive 48%.
Now let's take a closer look at some of the details in these business units. Within Storage in the high end, Symmetrix part revenues were up 32% year-on-year, as customers are embracing the capabilities of a high-end solution. As the most powerful and scalable storage solution on the market today, VMAX clearly addresses customer's needs as they build-out their Private Cloud infrastructures.
Our Fully Automated Storage Tiering software known as FAST, is driving higher rates of SSD and ATA-base storage in these systems, resulting in huge performance and cost improvements for our customers.
As anticipated, following the introduction of FAST, we've seen penetration rates continue to rise in terms of SSD capacity per system, percentage of systems shipped with SSD and the proportion of systems being shipped with FAST. The combination of SSD and ATA drives with FAST software yield a solution with performance, scalability and cost effectiveness that's unmatched by our competitors.
Our VPLEX platform, which we announced in May, is a net new opportunity and it's proving to be a unique differentiator that is resonating with customers. Its technology is very complementary to Tiered Storage, as the combination of tiering with the mobility from VPLEX creates entirely new usage models that's on our deal Virtual Storage infrastructure for the Private Cloud. As we see the virtualization, where apps are consolidated onto one server and then could be mobilized over many servers, Virtual Storage creates an elastic pool of storage wherein which you can tier data and with VPLEX, move data across arrays within and between data centers.
Our technology lead also extends to our mid-tier storage offerings. As you will recall, last quarter, we expanded our disclosure to give you better insight into our progress in the mid-tier overall, taking into account the mix shift occurring among the our mid-tier products. The many use cases of multiple technologies available in the mid-tier have driven customers to demand ease of use and simplicity, as well as the right technology for the rights job. 
The strength and breadth of our Technology portfolio help to satisfy these customer requirements better than anyone else. Our approach is to continue to invest in our market leading block file and object storage products while converging technologies and products where it makes sense for simplicity and efficiency. This ongoing strategy resulted in mid-tier product growth in Q2, increasing to 33% year-on-year. Sequential growth was 12%. This is very good growth, especially given the fact that majority of mid-tier revenue currently comes from the high end of the mid-tier markets. 
In addition to being the overall leader in mid-tier storage, EMC continues to be the leader in the more mature Fibre Channel-only mid-tier markets. While the Fibre Channel market is very important, we're also seeing higher growth opportunities in other areas of the mid-tier. Some of this growth is in the form of a mix shift from traditional Fibre-only products to next-generation products like our very successful dedupe products and the fast-growing unified, multi-protocol NS Celerra offerings we introduced a few years ago.
For example, what might have been a traditionally been a CLARiiON Disk Library sale might now be a Data Domain dedupe deal. Now as the mid-tier market continues to evolve, we enlocks that with customers making the transition to next-generation solutions. What really sets our mid-tier solutions apart is our technology edge, coupled with simplicity and efficiency and this is driving our growth across the mid-tier.
EMC is considerably more efficient from a capacity standpoint versus competitive solutions, and we guarantee it. EMC enables better scalability as customers wanted to add capacity while retaining high performance and high storage utilization levels. EMC is optimized for virtual environments in ways that make a noticeable difference to the customers resulting in EMC being the clear storage vendor choice for virtualized environments. Much of this preference is due to the efforts we've made to have the best integration with VMware virtual environments. For example, EMC is the only storage band that fully support the four VMware storage APIs for vCenter Site Recovery Manager, Data Protection, Multi- passing and the just-introduced Array Integration API.
EMC puts more effort and resources into this tight integration and customers can tell the difference. Today, EMC has far and away to launch installed base in VMware environments. And according to a Spending Intention Survey recently conducted by major independent analyst firm, VMware customers are more than twice as likely to choose EMC to storage than any other vendor.
As you know, software functionality is increasingly the key to competitive differentiation in the mid-tier. And this quarter, we'll be shipping exciting, new, next-gen software technologies the further extend the capabilities of our market-leading CLARiiON and Celerra platforms. Since announcing these technologies at EMC World in May, customer anticipation has been very high, as they offer set of functionalities that no other vendor can match. We're releasing a major step toward in management with Unisphere with an advanced and easy-to-use interface to manage both Celerra and CLARiiON. We're building on our unique FAST technology in the mid-tier with FAST v2, which delivers several on performance analysis and data relocation. We're providing customers with a new capability called FAST Cache, enabling customers to utilize solid-state storage that increase cache size adverse requirements. And we're introducing lock compression for primary storage which yields an average of 50% improvement in storage consumption.
So to summarize our position in the mid-tier, first of all, EMC is already the technology leader in the traditional mid-tier stand in that environments. Secondly, EMC is also leading in some of the most important new technologies such as dedupe Unified Storage and Virtualization Infinity. And third, EMC continues to add major next-generation software functions that further extend our technological lead.
When you put it altogether, EMC is the only company that's positioned across the mid-tier. Our competitive edge continues to grow and as a result, it's pretty clear that EMC should be able to continue to gain share in the mid-tier.
Before moving on, I know there's been a lot of interest in our strategy around our unified product family. Let me clarify this a bit for you. For a number of years, we've offered multi-protocol storage on one hardware platform, namely SAN, both Fibre Channel and iSCSI and NAS in a box. And this multi-protocol Celerra, this multi-protocol NS Celerra has been one of our fastest-growing products ever since. 
As I already said, in a few weeks, we're releasing single management interface, Unisphere, for our block and file functionalities. What we're maintaining is our market leading SAN and NAS technologies have been optimized for the different data requirements customers have because one size does not fit all when it comes to this requirements.
In essence, NS Celerra now has best-of-breed, file-and-block functionality with advance next-generation software, including a single management interface, FAST Cache, dedupe and compression on one common high-performance hardware platform. This combination presents the most cost-effective, most reliable and easy-to-use unified solution while retaining the native functionalities that customers value. I might also add that we've recently integrated Atmos with Celerra, adding object capabilities to our flagship unified storage platform.
And as I mentioned earlier, our success in the mid-tier has come principally from the higher end of the market. We plan to extend our success in the mid-tier to the faster-growing lower end of the market with a new product family, featuring EMC's market-leading technologies, our prices will be very competitive in this space. As such, we're also investing in the right people, the right partners to aggressively market this new family, which we expect to formally introduce very early next year.
Our Backup Recovery Systems business had another stellar quarter and continue to overachieve against plan in Q2. When we acquired Data Domain a year ago, we had a pretty good idea of the power that could be unleashed by combining their data deduplication technology with Avamar and our extensive customer reach, and in Q2, revenue from Avamar and Data Domain continue to grow from the billion-dollar revenue run rate we reported last quarter. 
There is great demand for this simple and efficient next-generation backup technology because it addresses one of the biggest pain points in the data center. We acquired over 350 new Data Domain customers in Q2 alone and more than 200 new Avamar customers.
Our BRS division continues to make strides against competitors with the release earlier this week of several new capabilities, including a new midrange system that leverages Nehalem technology to drive high levels of performance and capacity, a deduplication expansion option for EMC Disk Library for mainframe, an increased scalability of the EMC Disk Library series. In short, this division is performing very well and the acquisition of Data Domain completed a year ago this Friday has already shown itself to be one of our best ever.
Clearly, we are gaining share in storage, and the reasons for this is straightforward. Customers are not only seeking out larger trusted vendors with established track records, but they want a partner with a clear roadmap, innovative products and a breadth of capabilities for taking full advantage of cloud efficiencies going forward. EMC fits the bill in both areas.
Our RSA Security revenue growth accelerates in Q2 to 18% year-on-year, coming in at $173 million. We saw strength across the board in security. R/3 is thriving, and we're benefiting from the combination of its audit capabilities with our security information and event management and data loss prevention technologies. More than ever, deal discussions taking place at the CIO and CISO level together as customers seek security that is built in rather than bolted on. Our data-centric approach is especially resonant with customers, as security is an enabler for broad adoption of cloud infrastructures. Accordingly, what we continue to invest and leverage our unique position and take advantage of the immense opportunity to secure these next-gen infrastructures.
Our Information Intelligence Group, formerly known as Content Management and Archiving reported revenues of $178 million, relatively flat from last year's Q2. Our xCP Composition Platform and our eDiscovery Solutions are resonating well with customers.
VMware revenue within EMC grew 48% year-on-year to $673 million. This Q2 record revenue was driven by strength across geographies, products and customer segments from SMB up through the enterprise. Virtualization of the server infrastructure is the first step towards cloud computing, and it's clear that customers are laying the foundation for their cloud architectures with VMware. This is not surprising given the gains and flexibility, efficiency and cost savings that cloud architectures offer, and the fact that VMware technology is several generations ahead of competitors.
Our four business years together represent a combined power of information and virtual infrastructures. The same fundamental shift in IT is driving the success of each. And together, we continue to move forward under shared vision and strategic direction that fully capture the opportunity to bounce over the next several years as customers embark on a journey to Private Cloud. Our VCE coalition is addressing its mission to accelerate the proliferation of cloud infrastructures. Customers eager to start realizing the benefits, reduce cost and improve business' agility. They're looking to VCE as a means to get there because it provides a way to significantly reduce risks, costs and time to value with ready-to-deploy could infrastructures.
A recent survey by Data Monitor and UBS indicates that the VCE coalition is far and away the preferred solution for data center modernization.
Our Consulting business also continues to thrive by guiding customers' transition to virtual data center architectures as EMC is a trusted advisor within the enterprise that enables customers to report with confidence.
As the only player offering virtual server and virtual storage infrastructures, coupled with advanced IT Security and Compliance and Information Intelligence, EMC is squarely focused on helping customers make this transition to next-generation  Private and Public Clouds.
Let me now give you a bit more color about what else happened in the quarter looking at our Geos. All our geographies contributed to year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter, with revenue up 28% in North America, 18% in EMEA, 20% in APJ and 22% in Latin America. In North America, we did see some weakness in federal governments that was more than offset by growth international services, GME and the commercial markets. 
Our international mix stood at 47% in Q2 with the largest portion of foreign revenue coming from Europe. Within Europe, there was a weakness in Spain, Portugal and Greece. And this was more than offset by strength in the UK, France, Northern Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia. Our growth in APJ was led by strength in India and China. Our focus on the BRIC + 13 Emerging Markets is yielding good growth again, with future revenue growth of over 30%.
So as you can see, EMC is a global company with operation in dozens of countries. Internationally, we do some business in dollars and some in local currencies. Some local currency business is hedged and some is not. And in some markets, we have local pricing plans and not another's. Given these and other factors, non-dollar currency effect, obviously, a complex internal equation and pretty much impossible to calculate for an X-deal prospective. So given your interest in this topic, I will try to net out the impact for your modeling purposes. While currency was neutral to our results in Q2, based on where rates were at June 30, we expect the currency will now be a one-point headwind for the full year 2010.
Now let's take a look at some of the income statement and balance sheet items. In Q2, EMC reported non-GAAP gross margin of 60.1%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 20.7% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.28. Free cash flow for last 12 months was $3.1 billion, up over 20% from the comparable period and about $800 million higher than trailing 12-month non-GAAP net income. The excellent growth across these metrics demonstrates the improvements we've made to our business model over the last couple years are yielding the results we expected.
The Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. We now expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be close to 21%. This increase is due to higher expected contribution of profits from the U.S. due to currency, as well as some other factors. We do still expect the U.S. R&D tax rate take effect later this year.
DSOs came at 45 days compared to 52 for second quarter of 2009, inventory turns were 8.2 compared to 7.8 a year ago and deferred revenue is up nearly $100 million from last quarter.
We ended the quarter with $10.8 billion of cash. Of this, a total of $6.2 billion was held in the U.S. with the remainder overseas. We spent $341 million in the quarter buying 18.6 million shares of EMC stock, almost twice our Q1 level, bringing us up to over $500 million on EMC share repurchases so far this year. We still expect to spend $1 billion on EMC stock by the end of the year. In addition, EMC spent $99 million buying VMware shares, and VMware spent $130 million buying back VMware shares. Our VMware business is a key enabler that's making our cloud vision a reality.
While customers transition to Cloud is underway, the majority of the journey lies ahead of us, which is why we see the purchases of EMC and VMware as excellent investments.
As we look through the second half of 2010, our expectations to economic growth in IT spending for the full year really haven't changed that much. IT spending still looks to be up around 3% to 5% with our addressable market stronger, up around 6% to 8%. At the beginning of the year, we said we expect the economic recovery will be moderate with some bumps in the road, and that is what we're seeing. There are a few factors we didn't specifically anticipate such  the relative weakness of the euro and pound, our higher-projected tax rates and more cautious government spending in the U.S. and Europe. And we're obviously managing the impact of these very closely. However, in spite these challenges based upon the level of customer interest in our strategy and solutions, combined with the strength of our business including Storage and VMware, we now expect that we will exceed our previous outlook of $16.5 billion of revenue and $1.18 in non-GAAP EPS in 2010. 
Our Q2 results indicate that we are on the right track strategically in executing well on our triple play. We see no reason why we cannot continue to maintain this triple play over the long term. When thinking about this, it is worth noting that since we saw the expanding EMC's addressable markets in 2004, EMC's growth is impressive, with annual average revenue growth of 12% and annual average non-GAAP EPS growth of 19%. This is excellent performance over a six-year period, which included the '08 and '09 recession.
But today, our strategy is clear. The business model and operating model are in place. Our investments continue to pay off, and the Private Cloud opportunity is very big. EMC has never been better positioned for success than it is right now. And as a result, we believe we can continue to deliver double-digit revenue and double-digit earning growth for the next several years. 
I will now turn the call over to Joe, who'll provide some more color on what we're seeing in 2010 and explain why we're confident about double-digit growth going forward. Joe?"
121729,109403582,68237,"EMC Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-21-2010",2010-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Dell EMC","Executives","Thanks, David.

Thanks for joining us. 
Overall, I was very pleased with our performance in Q2. We posted solid year-over-year and sequential growth numbers, while establishing EMC and VMware as a thought leader in the next major wave of computing, mainly the transformation of IT to IT as a service, commonly called cloud computing.
This success would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the more than 45,000 people of EMC and VMware around the world. I'd like to thank them for their leadership and congratulate them on their accomplishments. I believe the top question on your mind has to be around the pockets of uncertainty that seem to pop up around the world and their effect on the global economy, and more specifically, how this will manifest itself in IT spending going forward.
As we have said before, EMC expected and planned for a recovery in 2010, but we always believed it would be choppy. So perhaps the best way to look at IT spending trends is by geography. U.S. market continues to be good with good prospects. Our customers here are investing in information technologies to increase their levels of productivity, while managing risk with a maniacal focus on maintaining stellar compliance with their policies, best practices and laws in land while insuring proper governance and oversight. 
Turning to the international markets, in Europe, we are seeing moderate growth in IT spend. Except in southern Europe where we're definitely seeing a slowdown in IT purchases. In Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, China, Southeast Asia and in selected Eastern European countries, IT spending is robust and is exhibiting very solid double-digit growth. And lastly, in Japan, we are seeing that spending is now improving a bit. 
And as David has already said, we were not affected by currency rates in Q2, but we most likely will be in the second half of this year. I want to make it clear, however, that with only 47% of our revenues coming from international markets, I truly believe we have ample opportunity for solid international growth despite likely currency fluctuations. We at EMC believe that international revenues should make up well over 50% of our total revenues and we're squarely focused on and investing in this growth opportunity for EMC.
Of importance, the global markets through virtualization, storage, data protection and data security, markets were consolidating EMC as the leader. We'll continue to grow faster in the IT market as a whole. And again, where it adds confidence to this growth statement is the thought leadership, innovations, and a strong product roadmap we have in the next new wave of IT cloud computing.
It is our firm belief that cloud computing will happen in both enterprise IT shops as customers transform the IT data centers into Private Clouds, as well as in the service-provided community, we will build out an extensive number of very large Public Clouds. These transformations will give CIOs the capabilities to offer their customers, whether they are internal customers or external customers, the massive benefits of IT as a service, namely the ability to run applications more flexibly at a lower cost while ensuring that the intended policies and service levels are adhered to.
To assure we capitalize on this massive broad opportunity, consolidated EMC's is focusing our technology and go-to market resources on providing our customers with the path, a measured journey to the Private Cloud. First and foremost, VMware is out advancing its leading virtualization technologies into a full-fledged next-generation data center cloud operating system with innovative and integrated management automation and orchestration software. Last week's introduction of  vSphere 4.1 is a major deliverable towards that goal. VM also uniquely automates both existing applications, as well as reaching out to the new wave development communities that tend to develop application in the framework context, a powerful benefit to customers as they journey through the Private Cloud. VMware also has the significant technology playing in bringing their virtualization technology to client devices, allowing for the provisioning of an individual, a user, rather than provision in constantly-changing sea of new devices that seem to come out as almost daily.
On the information side, EMC is focused on storing, managing, protecting and securing the incredible amount of new digital information that this world continues to create, with price performance levels that the future cloud world will demand. IDC, in a recent white paper, estimated that the amount of digital information that is created will grow a remarkable 44x between 2009 and 2020. 
EMC is heavily investing in innovative information technologies like VMAX, a new category storage that scales both up and out, offering unmatched cross-performance, functionality and reliability. Technologies like unified storage for converge fiber channel, SAN, NAS, and iSCSl environment, again, featuring leading functionality for mid-tier storage platforms. We are investing in game changing cloud technologies like VPLEX, our virtual storage product. VPLEX provides new capabilities like active/active data over distance and information federation across cloud data centers.
Since most of new information that is being created is object-phased, EMC is investing heavily on specialized cloud storage for this important category of information storage software called Atmos. We are investing in technologies like FAST, or Fully Automated Storage Tiering, that moves data automatically and in concert with the policy and service levels our customers choose between flash drives, fiber channel drives, SATA drives and SATA drives where the data is deduplicated and compressed. FAST is insured, innovative technology that assures ultra high performance when called for, will also optimize the total system for the lowest cost.
We are investing in technologies for data protection. Changing the backup paradigm from slow, unpredictable backup to tape to backup to disk with best-in-class data deduplication and compression technologies to offer customers speed of recovery, reliability recovery and low cost. We are investing in technologies that secure the data itself and access to the data while assuring stellar GRC metrics. 
A quick preview of things to come later this year. We will release the capability to encrypt data-at-rest on the array itself. That's fully integrated with RSA's key management software that is both cost effective and has very high performance. And lastly, we are investing heavily in our customers to gain value from their information -- to help our customers gain value from their information. Greenplum, our most recent acquisition, provides organizations of real time insight from vast amounts of data. Greenplum's unique massively-parallel, scale-out architecture provides the ability to handle big data and delivers information intelligence in real time. 
We will also continue to extend our Documentum software portfolio to help our customers better leverage information that is vital to their business. With our new Documentum xCP [xCelerated Composition Platform] platform, we are enabling companies to move from traditional and complex enterprise content management applications to far more flexible case management applications. In short, xCP dramatically reduces the amount of custom code that is typically required, thus saving customers time and money. 
Another important piece of our cloud strategy is the deep partnership and alliances that we have built with other leading IT companies. Partners like Cisco via our VCE [Virtual Computing Environment] coalition. And I am happy to report that under the leadership of Michael Capellas, VCE's reception by our customers has been nothing short of remarkable, and Vblock sales are well ahead of plan.
I'm also pleased to report that our partnership with Dell is back on track and is very strategic to both companies. Our Q2 mid-tier storage revenues were roughly flat year-on-year with Dell, and we fully expect to have year-on-year mid-tier growth with them in the second half. Our partnerships with system integrators such as Accenture, CSC, Capgemini, Wipro, TCS [Tata Consultancy Services] and Deloitte and others continue to grow strategically and tactically. And lastly, on the service provider front, we are building a number of very deep alliances, and we will be talking to you soon about our initiatives and plans here.
In summary, EMC is executing very well today's IT market. We have a strong product and technology portfolio and the go-to-market prowess to create the opportunities that the next wave of IT, cloud computing will offer. Thus, I reaffirm our belief that we can achieve double-digit growth rates over the long term.

Obviously, on an absolute basis year-on-year, the currency impact is bigger than that. But compared to where we thought we were back in April, the currency change is about $150 million because we thought for the full year we'd be roughly flat back then. So that is a factor. During the quarter in Q2, we're back to regularly normal seasonality. We mentioned that we saw some earlier seasonality in Q1 because of some kind of spillover. But I think what we saw in Q2 was a more normal demand environment. I mean, I think we really put our overachievement down the fact that people just got an appetite for all our products and services because they're just satisfying customers paying points as well. So I think those are kind of the obvious [ph] key facts. I think one of the biggest differences that you mentioned before from where we were in April was about currency headwinds."

I mean, the number that David gave you, that little bit over 21% growth year-on-year, is the way to look at it because as David said, our sales force is good and has a lot of sway with customers. And for sure, we would've sold some more of our own devices like CLARiiON Disk Libraries, which now, we're forcing and it's setting our sales force to ship the Data Domain product. So the best way to look a this is, apples-to-apples, is assuming we own Data Domain a year ago, and we obviously do own them today, that difference in growth all in mid-tier, which is maybe in the product only is over 21%. So it's very solid growth, and it's real growth. The second question you're asking is you want more color, I think, on what our plans are for our mid-tier refresh. We have started and worked incredibly successfully when we announced -- before we announced VPLEX, what we did is put out a big piece of the software to bake it in to our then DMX-4 line, so that you're not announcing all new software and all new hardware at the same time. We basically like that model so much, and customers adopted it so much, we're doing the same thing now. So what you just saw and David took you through, FAST Cache, Flash, Unisphere, several other -- pretty good laundry list of products, that is the new operating system that will be on the refresh hardware products. We told you, David just told you that our new low end will be introduced in Q1, alright. We also told you that the fastest growing piece of mid-tier by far, and I mean by far, is the low end. So we are very optimistic about this new low end and the impact it's going to have. So last piece you want to know is when are we going to introduce the high end of mid-tier. I got to have some surprises in life, so I'm not going to give you that one, but again, software first. We told you when we're going to do the low end. And I like our position in the mid-tier, and I think it's going to continue to get stronger and stronger."

But over time, we plan to deliver all three. So we do have an eye upon expanding operating margins over time. But also we talked about a significant investment in cloud software repositioning so we can position ourselves throughout the public and private clouds, so we will have a balance between all three. We've committed also over the next few years, we'll give you at least double-digit revenue and double-digit earnings growth. So I think we've given you a number of indicators to say that we are focus upon all three.

121729,109403582,68308,"EMC Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-21-2010",2010-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Dell EMC","Executives","Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report that EMC had another good quarter due to strong demand for our market-leading solutions, our solid business model and great execution by the team. There a",3115,"Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report that EMC had another good quarter due to strong demand for our market-leading solutions, our solid business model and great execution by the team. There are many highlights this quarter including record future revenues of over $4 billion, up 24%, and record Q2 non-GAAP net income of $596 million, up 66%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.28, up a robust 56%. Our Storage business was up 21%. VMware grew revenue 48% over last year. Free cash flow was $1.6 billion for the first half, up 47%, and non-GAAP operating margin of 20.7% improved 120 bps sequentially.
Once again, we achieved our triple play. We gained market share, invested for the future and improved profitability. Within our consolidated revenue, which is up 24%, we saw excellent growth storage, as I mentioned, of 21% year-on-year. Security revenue grew 18%. Our Information Intelligence Group revenue was roughly flat and VMware revenue grew an impressive 48%.
Now let's take a closer look at some of the details within these business units. Within Storage in the high end, Symmetrix product revenues were up 32% year-on-year, as customers are embracing the capabilities of a high-end solution. As the most powerful and scalable storage solution on the market today, VMAX clearly addresses customers' needs as they build-out their Private Cloud infrastructures.
Our Fully Automated Storage Tiering software known as FAST, is driving higher rates of SSD and ATA-based storage in these systems, resulting in huge performance and cost improvements for our customers.
As anticipated, following the introduction of FAST, we've seen penetration rates continue to rise in terms of SSD capacity per system, percentage of systems shipped with SSD and the proportion of systems being shipped with FAST. The combination of SSD and ATA drives with FAST software yield a solution with performance, scalability and cost effectiveness that's unmatched by our competitors.
Our VPLEX platform, which we announced in May, is a net new opportunity and it's proving to be a unique differentiator that is resonating with customers. Its technology is very complementary to tiered storage, as the combination of tiering with the mobility from VPLEX creates entirely new usage models that's on our ideal Virtual Storage infrastructure for the Private Cloud. As we see the virtualization, where apps are consolidated onto one server and then could be mobilized over many servers, Virtual Storage creates an elastic pool of storage, within which you can tier data and with VPLEX, move data across arrays within and between data centers.
Our technology lead also extends to our mid-tier storage offerings. As you will recall, last quarter, we expanded our disclosure to give you better insight into our progress in the mid-tier overall, taking into account the mix shift occurring among the our mid-tier products. The many use cases of multiple technologies available in the mid-tier have driven customers to demand ease of use and simplicity, as well as the right technology for the right job. 
The strength and breadth of our technology portfolio help to satisfy these customer requirements better than anyone else. Our approach is to continue to invest in our market leading block, file and object storage products while converging technologies and products where it makes sense for simplicity and efficiency. This ongoing strategy resulted in mid-tier product growth in Q2, increasing to 33% year-on-year. Sequential growth was 12%. This is very good growth, especially given the fact that the majority of our mid-tier revenue currently comes from the high end of the mid-tier markets. 
In addition to being the overall leader in mid-tier storage, EMC continues to be the leader in the more mature Fibre Channel-only mid-tier markets. While the Fibre Channel market is very important, we're also seeing higher growth opportunities in other areas of the mid-tier. Some of this growth is in the form of a mix shift from traditional Fibre-only products to next-generation products like our very successful dedupe products and the fast-growing unified, multi-protocol NS Celerra offerings we introduced a few years ago.
For example, what might have been a traditionally been a CLARiiON Disk Library sale might now be a Data Domain dedupe deal. Now as the mid-tier market continues to evolve, we're in lockstep with customers making the transition to next-generation solutions. What really sets our mid-tier solutions apart is our technology edge, coupled with simplicity and efficiency, and this is driving our growth across the mid-tier.
EMC is considerably more efficient from a capacity standpoint versus competitive solutions, and we guarantee it. EMC enables better scalability for customers wanting to add capacity while retaining high performance and high storage utilization levels. EMC is optimized for virtual environments in ways that make a noticeable difference to the customer, resulting in EMC being the clear storage vendor choice in virtualized environments. Much of this preference is due to the efforts we've made to have the best integration with VMware virtual environments. For example, EMC is the only storage vendor that fully support the four VMware storage APIs: for vCenter Site Recovery Manager; Data Protection; Multipathing; and the just-introduced Array Integration API.
EMC puts more effort and resources into this tight integration and customers can tell the difference. Today, EMC has far and away the largest installed base in VMware environments. And according to a Spending Intention Survey recently conducted by a major independent analyst firm, VMware customers are more than twice as likely to choose EMC to storage than any other vendor.
As you know, software functionality is increasingly the key to competitive differentiation in the mid-tier. And this quarter, we'll be shipping exciting, new, next-gen software technologies that further extend the capabilities of our market-leading CLARiiON and Celerra platforms. Since announcing these technologies at EMC World in May, customer anticipation has been very high, as they offer a set of functionalities that no other vendor can match. 
We're releasing a major step forward in management with Unisphere with an advanced and easy-to-use interface to manage both Celerra and CLARiiON. We're building on our unique FAST technology in the mid-tier with FAST v2, which delivers sub-LUN performance analysis and data relocation. We're providing customers with a new capability called FAST Cache, enabling customers to utilize solid-state storage that increase cache size for burst requirements. And we're introducing block compression for primary storage, which yields an average of 50% improvement in storage consumption.
So to summarize our position in the mid-tier, first of all, EMC is already the technology leader in the traditional mid-tier SAN [Storage Area Network] and NAS [Network Attached Storage] environments. Secondly, EMC is also leading in some of the most important new technologies such as dedupe, Unified Storage and virtualization affinity. And third, EMC continues to add major next-generation software functions that further extend our technological lead.
When you put it altogether, EMC is the only company that's positioned across the mid-tier. Our competitive edge continues to grow and as a result, it's pretty clear that EMC should be able to continue to gain share in the mid-tier.
Before moving on, I know there's been a lot of interest in our strategy around our Unified product family. Let me clarify this a bit for you. For a number of years, we've offered multi-protocol storage on one hardware platform, namely SAN, both Fibre Channel and iSCSI and NAS in a box. And this multi-protocol Celerra, this multi-protocol NS Celerra has been one of our fastest-growing products ever since. 
As I already said, in a few weeks, we're releasing single management interface, Unisphere, for our block and file functionalities. What we're maintaining is our market leading SAN and NAS technologies have been optimized for the different data requirements customers have because one size does not fit all when it comes to this requirements.
In essence, NS Celerra now has best-of-breed, file-and-block functionality with advance next-generation software, including a single management interface, FAST Cache, dedupe and compression on one common high-performance hardware platform. This combination presents the most cost-effective, most reliable and easy-to-use unified solution whilst retaining the native functionalities that customers value. I might also add that we've recently integrated Atmos with Celerra, adding object capabilities to our flagship Unified storage platform.
And as I mentioned earlier, our success in the mid-tier has come principally from the higher end of the market. We plan to extend our success in the mid-tier to the faster-growing lower end of the market with a new product family, featuring EMC's market-leading technologies, our prices will be very competitive in this space. As such, we're also investing in the right people, the right partners to aggressively market this new family, which we expect to formally introduce very early next year.
Our Backup Recovery Systems business had another stellar quarter and continue to overachieve against plan in Q2. When we acquired Data Domain a year ago, we had a pretty good idea of the power that could be unleashed by combining their data deduplication technology with Avamar and our extensive customer reach, and in Q2, revenue from Avamar and Data Domain continue to grow from the billion-dollar revenue run rate we reported last quarter. 
There is great demand for this simple and efficient next-generation backup technology because it addresses one of the biggest pain points in the data center. We acquired over 350 new Data Domain customers in Q2 alone and more than 200 new Avamar customers.
Our BRS division continues to make strides against competitors with the release earlier this week of several new capabilities, including a new midrange system that leverages Nehalem technology to drive high levels of performance and capacity, a deduplication expansion option for EMC Disk Library for mainframe, an increased scalability of the EMC Disk Library series. In short, this division is performing very well and the acquisition of Data Domain completed a year ago this Friday has already shown itself to be one of our best ever.
Clearly, we are gaining share in storage, and the reasons for this is straightforward. Customers are not only seeking out larger trusted vendors with established track records, but they want a partner with a clear roadmap, innovative products and a breadth of capabilities for taking full advantage of cloud efficiencies going forward. EMC fits the bill in both areas.
Our RSA Security revenue growth accelerates in Q2 to 18% year-on-year, coming in at $173 million. We saw strength across the board in security. R/3 is thriving, and we're benefiting from the combination of its audit capabilities with our security information and event management and data loss prevention technologies. More than ever, deal discussions are taking place at the CIO and CISO level together as customers seek security that is built in rather than bolted on. Our data-centric approach is especially resonant with customers, as security is an enabler for broad adoption of cloud infrastructures. Accordingly, what we continue to invest and leverage our unique position and take advantage of the immense opportunity to secure these next-gen infrastructures.
Our Information Intelligence Group, formerly known as Content Management and Archiving reported revenues of $178 million, relatively flat from last year's Q2. Our xCP Composition Platform and our eDiscovery Solutions are resonating well with customers.
VMware revenue within EMC grew 48% year-on-year to $673 million. This Q2 record revenue was driven by strength across geographies, products and customer segments from SMB up through the enterprise. Virtualization of the server infrastructure is the first step towards cloud computing, and it's clear that customers are laying the foundation for their cloud architectures with VMware. This is not surprising given the gains in flexibility, efficiency and cost savings that cloud architectures offer, and the fact that VMware technology is several generations ahead of competitors.
Our four business years together represent a combined power of information and virtual infrastructures. The same fundamental shift in IT is driving the success of each. And together, we continue to move forward under a shared vision and strategic direction that fully capture the opportunity to bounce over the next several years as customers embark on a journey to Private Cloud. 
Our VCE coalition is addressing its mission to accelerate the proliferation of cloud infrastructures. Customers are eager to start realizing the benefits, reduce cost and improve business' agility. They're looking to VCE as a means to get there because it provides a way to significantly reduce risks, costs and time to value with ready-to-deploy cloud infrastructures. A recent survey by Data Monitor and UBS indicates that the VCE coalition is far and away the preferred solution for data center modernization.
Our Consulting business also continues to thrive by guiding customers' transitions to virtual data center architectures, as EMC is a trusted advisor within the enterprise that enables customers to move forward with confidence.
As the only player offering virtual server and virtual storage infrastructures, coupled with advanced IT security and compliance and information intelligence, EMC is squarely focused on helping customers make this transition to next-generation  Private and Public Clouds.
Let me now give you a bit more color about what else happened in the quarter looking at our geos. All our geographies contributed to year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter, with revenue up 28% in North America, 18% in EMEA, 20% in APJ and 22% in Latin America. In North America, we did see some weakness in federal governments that was more than offset by growth in financial services, CME and the commercial markets. 
Our international mix stood at 47% in Q2 with the largest portion of foreign revenue coming from Europe. Within Europe, there was a weakness in Spain, Portugal and Greece. And this was more than offset by strength in the UK, France, Northern Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia. Our growth in APJ was led by strength in India and China. Our focus on the BRIC plus 13 emerging markets is yielding good growth again, with future revenue growth of over 30%.
So as you can see, EMC is a global company with operation in dozens of countries. Internationally, we do some business in dollars and some in local currencies. Some local currency business is hedged and some is not. And in some markets, we have local pricing plans and not in others. Given these and other factors, non-dollar currency effect are obviously a complex internal equation and pretty much impossible to calculate from external  perspective. So given your interest in this topic, I will try to net out the impact for your modeling purposes. While currency was neutral to our results in Q2, based on where rates were at June 30, we expect the currency will now be a one-point headwind for the full year 2010.
Now let's take a look at some of the income statement and balance sheet items. In Q2, EMC reported non-GAAP gross margins of 60.1%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 20.7% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.28. Free cash flow for the last 12 months was $3.1 billion, up over 20% from the comparable period and about $800 million higher than trailing 12-month non-GAAP net income. The excellent growth across these metrics demonstrates the improvements we've made to our business model over the last couple years are yielding the results we expected.
The Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 24%. We now expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be close to 21%. This increase is due to higher expected contribution of profits from the U.S. due to currency, as well as some other factors. We do still expect the U.S. R&D tax rate take effect later this year.
DSOs came in at 45 days compared to 52 for the second quarter of 2009, inventory turns were 8.2 compared to 7.8 a year ago and deferred revenue is up nearly $100 million from last quarter.
We ended the quarter with $10.8 billion of cash. Of this, a total of $6.2 billion was held in the U.S. with the remainder overseas. We spent $341 million in the quarter buying back 18.6 million shares of EMC stock, almost twice our Q1 level, bringing us up to over $500 million on EMC share repurchases so far this year. We still expect to spend $1 billion on EMC stock by the end of the year. In addition, EMC spent $99 million buying VMware shares, and VMware spent $130 million buying back VMware shares. Our VMware business is a key enabler to making our cloud vision a reality.
While customers transitions to cloud is underway, the majority of the journey lies ahead of us, which is why we see the purchases of EMC and VMware as excellent investments.
As we look through the second half of 2010, our expectations to economic growth in IT spending for the full year really haven't changed that much. IT spending still looks to be up around 3% to 5% with our addressable market stronger, up around 6% to 8%. At the beginning of the year, we said we expect the economic recovery will be moderate with some bumps in the road, and this is what we're seeing. There are a few factors we didn't specifically anticipate, such as the relative weakness of the euro and pound, our higher-projected tax rates and more cautious government spending in the U.S. and Europe. And we're obviously monitoring the impact of these very closely. However, in spite these challenges, based upon the level of customer interest in our strategy and solutions, combined with the strength of our business including Storage and VMware, we now expect that we will exceed our previous outlook of $16.5 billion of revenue and $1.18 in non-GAAP EPS in 2010. 
Our Q2 results indicate that we are on the right track strategically in executing well on our triple play. We see no reason why we cannot continue to maintain this triple play over the long term. When thinking about this, it is worth noting that since we saw the expanding EMC's addressable markets in 2004, EMC's growth is impressive, with annual average revenue growth of 12% and annual average non-GAAP EPS growth of 19%. This is excellent performance over a six-year period, which included the '08 and '09 recession.
But today, our strategy is clear. The business model and operating model are in place. Our investments continue to pay off, and the Private Cloud opportunity is very big. EMC has never been better positioned for success than it is right now. And as a result, we believe we can continue to deliver double-digit revenue and double-digit earning growth for the next several years. 
I will now turn the call over to Joe, who'll provide some more color on what we're seeing in 2010 and explain why we're confident about double-digit growth going forward. Joe?"

I'd like to begin by adding my welcome to all of you who are attending today's conference call. Thanks for joining us. Overall, I was very pleased with our performance in Q2. We posted solid year-over-year and sequential growth numb",1427,"Well, thanks, David. I'd like to begin by adding my welcome to all of you who are attending today's conference call. Thanks for joining us. 
Overall, I was very pleased with our performance in Q2. We posted solid year-over-year and sequential growth numbers, while establishing EMC and VMware as a thought leader in the next major wave of computing, mainly the transformation of IT to IT as a service, commonly called cloud computing.
This success would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the more than 45,000 people of EMC and VMware around the world. I'd like to thank them for their leadership and congratulate them on their accomplishments. I believe the top question on your mind has to be around the pockets of uncertainty that seem to pop up around the world and their effect on the global economy, and more specifically, how this will manifest itself in IT spending going forward.
As we have said before, we at EMC expected and planned for a recovery in 2010, but we always believed it would be choppy. So perhaps the best way to look at IT spending trends is by geography. U.S. market continues to be good with good prospects. Our customers here are investing in information technologies to increase their levels of productivity, while managing risk with a maniacal focus on maintaining stellar compliance with their policies, best practices and laws of the land while insuring proper governance and oversight. 
Turning to the international markets, in Europe, we are seeing moderate growth in IT spend, except in southern Europe where we're definitely seeing a slowdown in IT purchases. In Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, China, Southeast Asia and in selected Eastern European countries, IT spending is robust and is exhibiting very solid double-digit growth. And lastly, in Japan, we are seeing that spending is now improving a bit. 
And as David has already said, we were not affected by currency rates in Q2, but we most likely will be in the second half of this year. I want to make it clear, however, that with only 47% of our revenues coming from the international markets, I truly believe we have ample opportunity for solid international growth despite likely currency fluctuations. We at EMC believe that international revenues should make up well over 50% of our total revenues and we're squarely focused on and investing in this growth opportunity for EMC.
Of importance, the global markets for virtualization, storage, data protection and data security, markets were consolidating EMC as the leader. We'll continue to grow faster in the IT market as a whole. And again, what adds confidence to this growth statement is the thought leadership, innovations and strong product roadmap we have in the next new wave of IT cloud computing.
It's our firm belief that cloud computing will happen in both enterprise IT shops, as customers transform their IT data centers into Private Clouds, as well as in the service provider community, we will build out an extensive number of very large Public Clouds. These transformations will give CIOs the capabilities to offer their customers, whether they are internal customers or external customers, to the massive benefits of IT as a service, namely the ability to run applications more flexibly at a lower cost while assuring that the intended policies and service levels are adhered to.
To assure we capitalize on this master cloud opportunity, consolidated EMC is focusing our technology and go-to market resources on providing our customers with a path, a measured journey to the Private Cloud. First and foremost, VMware is  advancing its leading virtualization technologies into a full-fledged next-generation data center cloud operating system, with innovative and integrated management automation and orchestration software. 
Last week's introduction of vSphere 4.1 is a major deliverable towards that goal. VM also uniquely automates both existing applications, as well as reaching out to the new wave development communities that tend to develop application in the framework context, a powerful benefit to customers as they journey to the Private Cloud. VMware also has a significant technology play in bringing their virtualization technology to client devices, allowing for the provisioning of an individual, a user, rather than provisioning the constantly changing sea of new devices that seem to come out as almost daily.
On the information side, EMC is focused on storing, managing, protecting and securing the incredible amount of new digital information that this world continues to create, with price performance levels that the future cloud world will demand. IDC, in a recent White Paper, estimated that the amount of digital information that is created will grow a remarkable, a remarkable 44x between 2009 and 2020. 
EMC is heavily investing in innovative information technologies like VMAX, a new category storage that scales both up and out, offering unmatched cost performance, functionality and reliability. Technologies like Unified Storage for converged Fibre Channel, SAN, NAS, and iSCSl environment, again, featuring leading functionality for mid-tier storage platforms. We are investing in game changing cloud technologies like VPLEX, our virtual storage product. VPLEX provides new capabilities like active-active data over distance and information federation across cloud data centers.
Since most of new information that is being created is object-based, EMC is investing heavily on special like cloud storage for this important category of information storage software called Atmos. We are investing in technologies like FAST, or Fully Automated Storage Tiering, that moves data automatically and in concert with the policy and service levels our customers choose between flash drives, Fibre Channel drives, SATA drives and SATA drives where the data is deduplicated and compressed. FAST is insured, innovative technology that assures ultra-high performance when called for, will also optimize the total system for lowest cost.
We are investing in technologies for data protection. Changing the backup paradigm from slow, unpredictable backup the tape to backup the disk with best-in-class data deduplication and compression technologies to offer customers speed of recovery, reliability recovery and low cost. We are investing in technologies that secure the data itself and access to the data while assuring stellar GRC metrics. 
A quick preview of things to come is later this year. We will release the capability to encrypt data-at-rest on the array itself. That's fully integrated with RSA's key management software that is both cost effective and has very high performance. And lastly, we are investing heavily in our customers to gain value from their information -- to help our customers gain value from their information. 
Greenplum, our most recent acquisition, provides organizations of real time insight from the vast amounts of data. Greenplum's unique massively-parallel, scale-out architecture provides the ability to handle big data and delivers information intelligence in real time. 
We will also continue to extend our Documentum software portfolio to help our customers better leverage information that is vital to their business. With our new Documentum xCP [xCelerated Composition Platform] platform, we are enabling companies to move from traditional and complex enterprise content management applications to far more flexible case management applications. In short, xCP dramatically reduces the amount of custom code that is typically required, thus saving customers time and money. 
Another important piece of our cloud strategy is the deep partnership and alliances that we have built with other leading IT companies. Partners like Cisco via our VCE [Virtual Computing Environment] coalition. And I am happy to report that under the leadership of Michael Capellas, VCE's reception by our customers has been nothing short of remarkable, and Vblock sales are well ahead of plan.
I'm also pleased to report that our partnership with Dell is back on track and is very strategic to both companies. Our Q2 mid-tier storage revenues were roughly flat year-on-year with Dell, and we fully expect to have year-on-year mid-tier growth with them in the second half. Our partnerships with system integrators such as Accenture, CSC, Capgemini, Wipro, TCS [Tata Consultancy Services] and Deloitte and others continue to grow strategically and tactically. And lastly, on the service provider front, we are building a number of very deep alliances, and we will be talking to you soon about our initiatives and plans here.
In summary, EMC is executing very well in today's IT market. We have a strong product and technology portfolio and the go-to-market prowess to create the opportunities that the next wave of IT, cloud computing will offer.

So it's very solid growth, and it's real growth. The second question you're asking is you want more color, I think, on what our plans are for our mid-tier refresh. We have started and worked incredibly successfully when we announced -- before we announced VPLEX, what we did is put out a big piece of the software to bake it in to our then DMX-4 line, so that you're not announcing all new software and all new hardware at the same time. We basically like that model so much, and customers adopted it so much, we're doing the same thing now. So what you just saw and David took you through, FAST Cache, Flash, Unisphere, several other -- pretty good laundry list of products, that is the new operating system that will be on the refresh hardware products. We told you, David just told you that our new low end will be introduced in Q1, alright. We also told you that the fastest growing piece of mid-tier by far, and I mean by far, is the low end. So we are very optimistic about this new low end and the impact it's going to have. So last piece you want to know is when are we going to introduce the high end of mid-tier. I got to have some surprises in life, so I'm not going to give you that one, but again, software first. We told you when we're going to do the low end.

We've committed also over the next few years, we'll give you at least double-digit revenue and double-digit earnings growth.

We continue to execute on our triple play, with strong double-digit growth in storage security and virtualization, it's clear we continue to gain share in these key areas of the markets, areas where we are already the market leader. With the announcements of VMWare View 4.5, storage efficiency technologies like FAST v2 and FAST Cache and the acquisition of Greenplum, it's clear we're investing for the future and more importantly, these investments are bearing fruits. And with non-GAAP gross operating margins of 40 and 80 basis points, respectively quarter-on-quarter, we continue to improve profitability.
We expect to continue this triple play over the long term because how well we position ourselves to capitalize on the fundamental shift to cloud computing. Now let me start by taking a few minutes to discuss what's driving our good results.
The industry generally agrees the shift to cloud architecture is no longer a question of if, but of when. The answer is, it's happening now, albeit at different speeds with different companies. But all companies go through the same three phases to transform their traditional physical infrastructures to true cloud architectures and to take full advantage of the ability to offer IT as a service. 
Phase I is the virtualization of IT-owned applications, which also requires simple, efficient VM integrate storage. Phase II is a virtualization of business-critical applications. This is where SOAs around performance, availability, workload mobility, recoverability and security really matter. Phase III realize the full benefit of cloud by taking advantages of phases one and two, together with IT automation provisioning and chargeback to offer IT infrastructure as a service for the entire enterprise. It's at this phase that you have an elastic cloud that compute networking storage resources and also seamlessly storing on compatible public cloud services where it makes sense.
So let's look at what EMC offers for each one of these phases. The first phase typically tends to involve small deployments. Typically it involves the IT department's virtualizing applications they own and manage. For these implementations, which require virtualization and simple and efficient storage, EMC has VMware's vSphere on our unified storage products. 
With the majority of customers currently at this first phase, our unified storage frontline has grown rapidly, and also benefiting from this trend is the mid-tier as well. Where we really distinguishing ourselves in this space is with efficiency technologies like SSDs, FAST and FAST Cache as well as with high integration with VMware. For example, one well-known online brokerage firm in the quarter selected EMC's unified product in large part because of FAST Cache. Its ability to extraordinary performance to address unexpected workload spikes could not be matched by either of the other two vendors competing for this deal.
In the second phase, where virtualization extends to business-critical applications, SLA become very important. In fact, customers are telling us they want better SLAs after they virtualize. Also, if customer selected to deploy business-critical applications on enterprise storage for high SLAs in the physical world, they're not going to deploy them on mid-tier as they virtualize. 
In the second phase, customers look to technologies from VMware like vCenter AppSpeed and vSphere Storage and Network IO Control to help control performance SLAs at the application storage and network levels. Likewise, they demanded the storage infrastructure extend these capabilities and support these SLAs. For example, EMC's FAST storage I/O control to deliver industry-leading distributed resource scheduling for storage making enterprise apps perform 2.5X better for the same cost. Customers also looked at things like VMAX, VPLEX, reduplication and security to meet these SLA deeper in the infrastructure. In Phase I, a ray-based, not on replicate is suitable for backup. 
But in Phase II, tight integration of high-performance backup like EMCs Avamar with vStorage APIs and with this sensor provides much higher service levels. For example, in Q3, a large manufacturing customer who wanted to reduce space and power consumption in the data center and at the same time, virtualize their servers and desktops selected VMAX. We won another deal at a well-known global cosmetics company. 
In this case, the customer is expanding into VMware implementation and will use active-active VM type [ph] (21:31) with VPLEX to raise availability and federate across data centers at distance. These are great examples of a sophisticated enterprise class technology acquired in this phase and in these cases, it happened to be technology our competitors could not match. In fact, in Phase II implementations, larger competitors tend not to have all necessary best of breed technology and our mid-tier competitors don't have the portfolio to really provide a full solution.
Phase III is when you really get the IT as a service. This involves things like integrated SACs, management up and down from physical to virtual and use as monitoring, all of which EMC offers. Of these e-coalition enables hybrid clouds with Vblocks, our UIM, Unified Infrastructure Manager, office cross to main provisioning change and configuration management. vCloud director often saw provisioning of those machines in a multi-tense environment and VPLEX facilitates seamless data mobility between Private Clouds and external providers. 
Illustrating this, a very large pharmaceutical company this quarter decided it was taking them to long to provision their various machines and turn to EMC. Now on the influence as for your road map, they're moving forward with Vblock, with VMAX, UIM and will use VPLEX with active-active data center architecture.
For these examples demonstrate is that, that does not tend to be anyone typical cloud deal. A Company's infrastructure requirements are as varied as the companies themselves. This is why it's so important to have a broad and deep range of proxy services and as each company develops its cloud infrastructure roadmap, the industry can meet their needs through every phase of the departmental to enterprisewide, from tier zero to the back of an archive.
Now a common question in the investor community is, ""Whose storage works best in virtualized environments?"" We think the best way to find out is to go ask customers which vendors they trust. As you can see from the results of these surveys, which come from several sources, EMC consistently rises to the top when it comes to providing infrastructure virtualized environments. Now there is one smaller competitor claiming to have a lead in virtualized environments but the fact simply don't bear out. Rather know it tends to be the bigger more established companies with broader offerings that come in behind EMC. Customers realize that the journey through a cloud infrastructure can be complex, requiring a broad range of products and services. As a result, they go with companies like EMC that can provide more.
Public Cloud providers are ultimately building the infrastructure on EMC for a number of reasons: With virtualization being the foundation for public cloud service, VMware is key. With a vast amount of data being stored and managed by Public Cloud providers, scalability is critical. For example, V-Max's X86-Based scale architecture offers us [indiscernible] (24:33) by scale. With both intensities security is critical and the ability to attest to that security is just as important particularly for a public Cloud provider. 
RSA's cloud security solution offers us accountability. And enterprise customers need data mobility for true seamless hybrid cloud and VPLEX enables the advanced federation of resources into an output enterprise. 
This quarter we announced that several service providers are taking advantage of these technologies for offering public cloud services to their clients, and this number continues to ramp. Joe will give you more color on some of these wins in his comments.
The various example I've referenced are just a few of the deals we closed in Q3 with customers looking to start or continue to build out their Cloud infrastructures, both private and public. Our Q3 cloud wins span verticals, including governments, healthcare, media, manufacturing, energy, services and academia and, all of our frontlines across VMware security and storage, including high end and mid-tier block and file.
Now let me give you a sense of what's behind our strong results. Let's look at the numbers in more detail. Revenue in the quarter grew 20% to $4.2 billion in Q3. The increase in [indiscernible] (25:49) customers received from our proxy services is driving improvement to our business, with non-GAAP gross margin of 60.5%, up 40 basis points sequentially. 
This improvement was driven primarily by higher storage spot margins, thanks to the faster growth of our higher-margin storage products. Ongoing operating improvements help drive non-GAAP operating margins of 21.5%, up 80 basis points sequentially, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.30 up from $0.28 last quarter and from $0.23 a year ago. Free cash flow is strong and year-to-date was $2.2 billion or 22% and $427 million greater than our non-GAAP net income for the same period. 
We ended the quarter with $10.5 billion in cash, of this, a total of $6.2 billion was held in the U.S. which remained overseas. We spent $500 million on acquisitions in the quarter and $283 million buying back 15 million shares of EMC stock, bringing us to $800 million on EMC share repurchases so far this year. We still expect to spend $1 billion on EMC stock by the end of the year. In addition, EMC spent $92 million buying VMware shares and VMware spent $131 million on VMware shares. looking at VMware's pivotal role as the Cloud data Center operating system of the future, we feel strongly these relatively small purchases maintain our ownership level on excellent long-term investments.
Now looking at our geographies. We saw a bounced double-digit growth around the world, with strongest growth in our BRIC + 13 emerging markets. Joe will provide some more color here. The negative impact of currency on a year-on-year revenue growth in Q3 was 60 basis points, assuming rates stay at September 30 levels, there should be no impact on currency on our full year revenue results. Now turning to a few details about our various products and services. Overall storage-related revenues grew 16% with or without acquisition effects. We believe that we continue to gain share in key segments of the storage market. We are the number one storage, due in large part to our technology leadership. And this is what continues to define us today. We are the leader in the most important technologies in infrastructure. 
For example, we were the first to introduce SSD in enterprise storage and the automated curing software to leverages. The ability to marry solid state and spinning drives lead to enormous performance and efficiency improvements. We unveiled this disruptive technology almost three years ago, and we're clearly benefiting from our leadership here in both high end and mid-tier storage systems.
This past quarter, we continue to reap the benefits of our innovation. As our Symmetrix front revenues were up a robust 23%. The VMAX architecture leverages standard X86 processing, it's highly scalable in terms of both performance and capacity and includes advanced advanced, high-value functionality like virtual provisioning and FAST. 
It is this capabilities which are driving our gains, not only in the traditional high-end deployments but also in large consolidation place, Private Cloud infrastructures and increasingly Public Cloud environments. I think that this success in brand tradition of Symmetrix leads many to think just in terms of traditional client storage. And of course we continue to set the pace there. 
However, I would encourage you to think more broadly regarding how this new architecture has been designed to be on a new pursuit [ph] (29:29) for the new information requirements of virtual infrastructures and cloud environments. It's this combination of our existing leadership position and the rapid penetration of these new cloud-focused environments that's driving our strong results.
A great example of this success is a Q3 win at a major global healthcare company. In this deal, VMAX's virtual provisioning and FAST, with the ability to tier to standard drives were key features as this enable the customer to increase utilization, simplify their environment and reduce CapEx and OpEx. In this case, where the customer was deploying VMware, our competitor required three times the amount of hardware to perform equivalently to two VMAX extensions. This is a clear example of how VMAX is winning in large VMware consolidations. In this case, the customer wants a storage system that can support 2,500 virtual machines growing to 6,000.
In fact, VMAX has proved itself to be so cost-effective and flexible that in many instances, customers are consolidating multiple mid-tier storage platforms on to one VMAX. This is happening with both EMC and competitive midtier storage platforms. As a couple of proved points, we swept the floor of a midtier competitive product with the VMAX at the global healthcare customer I just mentioned and also in another win among the world's leading media and entertainment companies. As customers are moving toward the cloud, EMC is best able to help them along every step of the journey and these are just two more examples.
Our midtier Storage business continue to show good growth again in Q3, increasing 22% year-on-year. The software capability we announced last quarter for our CLARiiON and Celerra platforms, Unisphere, FAST v2 and FAST Cache and block compressure from primary storage are being embraced by customers. The standard system shipping with emphasis in the midtier continues to increase, helped in part by the availability of FAST v2
And FAST Cache. 
These features was definitely a factor in several of the deals we won this quarter, including were we bid out a midtier competitor in a well-known West Coast University. In addition, we won a project to remove an encumbent midtier product and we also beat two other vendors at a well-known US-based retailer, based upon the strength of our VMware integration and significantly better capacity utilization.
Another key benefit of the breadth and depth of EMC's business is that we have a leadership position in some of the hottest areas of technology today. These technology products acts as wonderful door openers for EMC. This was the case in a recent government project, where we leveraged data domain relationship to highlight the CLARiiON capabilities in a VMware environment. CLARiiON integration with VMware was the deciding factor in the purchase of several CLARiiON systems as initial footprints in the deployment of a larger [ph] (32:35) scale for several petabytes. That's in addition to the large data domain purchases happening this quarter. This is just one great example of the synergy and success of our model.
Our Backup Recovery Systems business continues to grow at a high pace. We expect BRS is extraordinary growth opportunity to play out for a long time. This will clearly lead toward success with BRS, as the clear leader in the space, but will also drive additional opportunities for EMC to help customers in other ways.
As we announced last week, we've added a new division and a whole new set of opportunities to our portfolio. Greenplum, which we announced in July, is the foundation of our new Data Computing Product division. Its first new product, the EMC Greenplum data computing appliance, offers the industry's best price/performance ratio, 3X more scalability and up to 4X as many database cores than competitive systems and data input speed up to 5X out of our competitors. Our DCA integrates database, compute and storage into an enterprise class, easy-to-implement system that can meet petabyte scale big data requirements. We are very excited to pursue this incremental market opportunity by offering yet another leading edge solution to customers, as they increasingly seek the best analytic tools to derive business values from their massive volumes of data.
Our RSA security revenue growth accelerated in Q3 to 22% year-on-year. Our GRC and SIEM products did well as the customers new way to manage their multitude of discreet security devices. The combination of these capabilities enables customers to have an easy-to-use governance layer that could oversee and manage other security products throughout their environments. 
As security and compliance become increasingly important to all customers, as more infrastructures move towards the cloud, this unique governance and management way is a key differentiator and enabler in the marketplace. This was the reason we want an important security operation center project out of very large financial services customer this quarter. Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was relatively flat against last year's Q3. The xCP platform continues to be very popular in IEG1 [ph] (34:57) of significant new customers in the quarter.
Clearly the rollout of virtual infrastructures in the buildout of private and public clouds drove the strong growth of VMware in the quarter, up 46%. The experiments [ph](35:11) around VWworld with over 17,000 attendees is a great example of the impact VMware has on the industry. At VMworld we made a number of announcements, including vCloud Director, VMWare View 4.5, vShield and shield and vFabric. 
We also a number of announcements around how other EMC products are being integrated with VMware, including Unified Infrastructure Management version 2, which when deployed with vCloud Director and Vblock, essentially a vCloud in a box. Other announcements included EMC storage infrastructure with secure authentication, which when combined with View 4.5 sets a storage efficiency record of $38 per client, the best in the market due to this high integration of all this various technologies. We also announced a strong RSA VMware cloud security and compliance solution, another industry first that will help ease the security concerns of customers as they move towards the cloud.
Because virtualization is the foundation of cloud computing, a key to success with VMware is bringing the virtual infrastructure and the information infrastructure together. And while we encourage others to work with VMware, we work harder as anyone else to integrate the virtual and information infrastructures. With over 60 different integration points now between EMC and VMware, including support for full the VMware APIs we lead in VMware integration. 
Recognizing the differences, such as high integration makes in performance, a global medical technology company purchased both the CLARiiON and Celerra systems in the quarter. It was a combination of the VM plug-ins Unified architectures and features like FAST and FAST Cache, all for one vendor that drove this deal for us. Our results this quarter and for the last several, are great indicators of the strength of our strategy and business model. The boost in cloud is underway, all of IT is moving in this direction and while customers are moving their spending toward these two architectures at varying speeds, the tidal wave of change is definitely real. 
We are leading in the hottest areas of the move to the cloud and we have the broadest portfolio across all the key customer requirements from virtualization to storage, to security, to information governance. And while we cannot control the economy or IT spending, we believe that we'll certainly continue to grow and gain share due to our leadership position in this rapidly growing opportunity.
So looking at the environments. The opportunity ahead, our unique competitive position and the strength of our strategy and model, we are once again raising our expectations to 2010. We now expect to achieve $16.9 billion in revenue, non-GAAP operating margins of 21% to 22% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.25. These reflects revenue growth of 20% and EPS growth of 39%, very robust growth and even better leverage.
As you can see, strong growth with leverage in investments have been a standard for us since 2004 and with the results and outlook we're reporting today, it's clear we're continuing on this trajectory. But what's most exciting is that the fundamental shift to cloud architecture is only in the early stages and we believe we are better suited than anyone else to capitalize on this trend as it unfolds over the next several years. We fully expect that the triple play of share growth, investment for the future and financial leverage we're delivering this year can be maintained over the long term.
So in summary, our strategy is clear, the business and operating model are in place, our investments continue to pay off and the cloud opportunity is very big. As a result, we expect to continue to deliver double-digit revenue and double-digit earnings growth for the next few years. I will now turn the call over to Joe, who'll provide some more color on the quarter and what we see through the end of the year. Joe?"

As always, thank you for your interest in EMC.
As Tony said, I am currently in Beijing and thus, actively participating in today's earnings call from approximately 6,000 miles away from my colleagues, but I trust the marvels of communication technologies will make the mechanics of this call appear seamless.
Overall, I was very pleased with our performance in Q3. In fact, our top line revenue was the best in EMC's history, as we posted solid growth on both the year-on-year and sequential basis. I am also proud to report that we continue to create leverage in our P&L while investing in the future. To this end, in Q3 we added approximately 1,700 professionals to consolidate EMC in the areas of sales, emerging high-growth markets, R&D and VMware. Our goal is to develop more innovative products and maintain strong growth.
And most importantly, we established EMC and VMware as clear thought leaders with substantial momentum in private, public and hybrid cloud computing. We firmly believe cloud computing, which enables IT as a service, is the next big transformational wave that is shaping the Information Technology landscape. Our success in Q3 would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the 47,000 people of EMC and VMware around the world. I want to thank them for their leadership and congratulate them on their accomplishments.
I would now like to make a few comments on the global economy and more importantly, our view on IT spending trends. On the economic front, on a consolidated global basis, we continue to see a slow recovery albeit with a few bumps on the road, pretty much in line with what we have been saying all year and looking forward we expect this trend to continue. Closer to home in IT spending terms, we are seeing real strength in rapid growing and emerging geographies. 
Moderate growth in the U.S., Japan, most of Europe, albeit with a bit of choppiness in a few countries and solid growth in countries such as Australia, Canada, Mexico and South Africa. Additionally across all markets, the very good news is that the demand for virtualization, information storage, information protection and information security and governance, areas where EMC/VMware is the leader, are growing considerably faster than the IT average. This as evidenced by the fact that in Q3 we grew on a year-on-year basis 21% in the U.S., 28% in APJ, 22% in constant currency, 14% in Europe, 19% in constant currency and approximately 30% in emerging markets. This bounced geographic growth demonstrates that we are focused on IT markets that are growing much faster than the IT as a start market as a whole, and more importantly we are clearly taking share.
Additionally, we drove this demand as the ever continuing growth of information and the innovative uses of this information by our customers as they drive for higher and higher levels of productivity on meeting the mandate for risk mitigation and adheres to proper governance and compliance policies. With as to our confidence in our future is the thought leadership, innovations and strong product roadmap we have in a new big wave of IT of cloud computing. It's our firm belief that cloud computing will transform enterprise IT shops as the customers migrate their IT data centers into private clouds. This transformation will also happen in the search provider community as they build out an extensive number of very large enterprise class public clouds.
Additionally, the actualization of Private and Public Cloud computing will provide our customers a massive benefit, mainly the ability to run applications more flexibly, with a lot more automation and a significantly lower cost while assuring the attendant policies and service levels are adhered to. But even lower cost and more flexibility can be achieved as customers take advantage of both Private and Public cloud computing by federating or operating their various application loads between their own Private clouds and the Public clouds of their chosen service provider partners. We call this cloud implementation, the hybrid cloud. 
I assure you the vast majority of our R&D budgets, our acquisitions, our go-to-market motions and the buildout of our partner ecosystem, is aimed at leading and winning in this game-changing hybrid cloud opportunity. The importance of having a world-class partner ecosystem cannot be overstated. I firmly believe no one IT company could possibly possess all the active resources to go it alone. And very importantly, every single customer I speak with once, in fact, demands best of breed and choice. To this end, our partnership with Cisco is deepening and our VCE coalition is gaining significant momentum in the market. As proof, I am again pleased to report that our Vblock sales are well ahead of plan.
Our partnership with systems integrators, such as Accenture, CSC, Capgemini, Wipro, TCS, Deloitte and others continues to grow strategically and tactically. And last, on our service provider front, we are building a number of very deep alliances with many of the leading telcos and service providers around the world. 
In Q3 we announced partnerships with the following companies: France Telecom's Orange Business Services, SingTels Alphawest, Saudi Telecom, Cable & Wireless and Terremark. And you can expect many more announcements over the coming weeks and months. In summary, EMC is executing well in today's IT market. 
We have a great product and technology portfolio and a go-to-market prowess to capture the opportunity that the private, public and hybrid cloud computing wave offers. Thus, I reaffirm our belief that we can achieve double-digit growth rates over the long term, and to help you better understand why we are so confident in our future, we will host an investor and analyst day in Q1. I'd now like to turn it back to Tony to moderate today's portion of the Q&A portion of today's call."

In terms of cross selling, some nice opportunities I mentioned, for example, in my prepared comments where we'd cross-sold into a data domain count, a large CLARiiON project that's going to scale up to kind of like type scale, and of course there's good BRS opportunities into the EMC accounts.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report that EMC had another great quarter.

I'm very pleased to report that EMC had another great quarter. We achieved record revenues of over $4.2 billion, up 20%, record Q3 non-GAAP net income of $649 million, up 35%, non-GAAP EPS of $0.30, up 30%, record year-to-date free cash flow of $2.2 billion, up 22% and non-GAAP operating margin up 21.5%, up 80 basis points sequentially.
We continue to execute on our triple play, with strong double-digit growth in storage security and virtualization, it's clear we continue to gain share in these key areas of the markets, areas where we are already the market leader. With the announcements of VMWare View 4.5, storage efficiency technologies like FAST v2 and FAST Cache and the acquisition of Greenplum, it's clear we're investing for the future and more importantly, these investments are bearing fruits. And with non-GAAP gross operating margins of 40 and 80 basis points, respectively quarter-on-quarter, we continue to improve profitability.
We expect to continue this triple play over the long term because how well we position ourselves to capitalize on the fundamental shift to cloud computing. Now let me start by taking a few minutes to discuss what's driving our good results.
The industry generally agrees the shift to cloud architecture is no longer a question of if, but of when. The answer is, it's happening now, albeit at different speeds with different companies. But all companies go through the same three phases to transform their traditional physical infrastructures to true cloud architectures and to take full advantage of the ability to offer IT as a service. 
Phase I is the virtualization of IT-owned applications, which also requires simple, efficient VM integrate storage. Phase II is a virtualization of business-critical applications. This is where SOAs around performance, availability, workload mobility, recoverability and security really matter. Phase III realize the full benefit of cloud by taking advantages of phases one and two, together with IT automation provisioning and chargeback to offer IT infrastructure as a service for the entire enterprise. It's at this phase that you have an elastic cloud of computer networking storage resources and also seamlessly storing on compatible public cloud service where it makes sense.
So let's look at what EMC offers for each one of these phases. The first phase typically tends to involve small deployments. Typically it involves the IT department's virtualizing applications they own and manage. For these implementations, which require virtualization and simple and efficient storage, EMC has VMware's vSphere on our unified storage products. 
With the majority of customers currently at this first phase, our unified storage frontline has grown rapidly, and also benefiting from this trend is the mid-tier as well. Where we really distinguishing ourselves in this phase is with efficiency technologies like SSDs, FAST and FAST Cache as well as with high integration with VMware. For example, one well-known online brokerage firm in the quarter selected EMC's unified product in large part because of FAST Cache. Its ability to extraordinary [ph] performance to address unexpected workload spikes could not be matched by either of the other two vendors competing for this deal.
In the second phase, where virtualization extends to business-critical applications, SLA become very important. In fact, customers are telling us they want better SLAs after they virtualize. Also, if customer selected to deploy business-critical applications on enterprise storage for high SLAs in the physical world, they're not going to deploy them on mid-tier as they virtualize. 
In the second phase, customers look to technologies from VMware like vCenter AppSpeed and vSphere Storage and Network IO Control to help control performance SLAs at the application storage and network levels. Likewise, they demanded the storage infrastructure extend these capabilities and support these SLAs. For example, EMC's FAST works with storage I/O control to deliver industry-leading distributed resource scheduling for storage making enterprise apps perform 2.5X better for the same cost. Customers also looked at things like VMAX, VPLEX, reduplication and security to meet these SLA deeper in the infrastructure. In Phase I, array-based, Snap and replicate is suitable for backup. 
But in Phase II, tight integration of high-performance backup like EMCs Avamar with vStorage APIs and with vSensor provides much higher service levels. For example, in Q3, a large manufacturing customer who wanted to reduce space and power consumption in the data center and at the same time, virtualize their servers and desktops selected VMAX. We won another deal at a well-known global cosmetics company. 
In this case, the customer is expanding into VMware implementation and will use active-active VM type portation [ph] with VPLEX to raise availability and federate across data centers at distance. These are great examples of a sophisticated enterprise class technology acquired in this phase and in these cases, it happened to be technology our competitors could not match. In fact, in Phase II implementations, larger competitors tend not to have all necessary best of breed technology and our mid-tier competitors don't have the portfolio to really provide a full solution.
Phase III is when you really get the IT as a service. This involves things like integrated SACs, management up and down from physical to virtual and use as monitoring, all of which EMC offers. Of these e-coalition enables hybrid clouds with Vblocks, our UIM, Unified Infrastructure Manager, office cross to main provisioning change and configuration management. vCloud director often self provisioning of those machines in a multi-tense environment and VPLEX facilitates seamless data mobility between Private Clouds and external providers. 
Illustrating this, a very large pharmaceutical company this quarter decided it was taking them to long to provision their various machines and turn to EMC. Now on the influence their freer road map, they're moving forward with Vblock, with VMAX, UIM and will use VPLEX with active-active data center architecture.
What these examples demonstrate is that, that does not tend to be any one typical cloud deal. A Company's infrastructure requirements are as varied as the companies themselves. This is why it's so important to have a broad and deep range of proxy services and as each company develops its cloud infrastructure roadmap, the industry can meet their needs through every phase of the departmental to enterprise-wide, from tier zero to the back of an archive.
Now a common question in the investor community is, ""Whose storage works best in virtualized environments?"" We think the best way to find out is to go ask customers which vendors they trust. As you can see from the results of these surveys, which come from several sources, EMC consistently rises to the top when it comes to providing infrastructure virtualized environments. Now there is one smaller competitor claiming to have a lead in virtualized environments but the fact simply don't bear out. Rather know it tends to be the bigger more established companies with broader offerings that come in behind EMC. Customers realize that the journey through a cloud infrastructure can be complex, requiring a broad range of products and services. As a result, they go with companies like EMC that can provide more.
Public Cloud providers are ultimately building the infrastructure on EMC for a number of reasons: With virtualization being the foundation for public cloud service, VMware is key. With a vast amount of data being stored and managed by Public Cloud providers, scalability is critical. For example, V-Max's X86-Based scale architecture offers us a petabyte scale. With both intensities security is critical and the ability to attest to that security is just as important particularly for a public Cloud provider. 
RSA's cloud security solution offers us accountability. And enterprise customers need data mobility for true seamless hybrid cloud and VPLEX enables the advanced federation of resources into an out of the enterprise. 
This quarter we announced that several service providers are taking advantage of these technologies for offering public cloud services to their clients, and this number continues to ramp. Joe will give you more color on some of these wins in his comments.
The various example I've referenced are just a few of the deals we closed in Q3 with customers looking to start or continue to build out their Cloud infrastructures, both private and public. Our Q3 cloud wins span verticals, including governments, healthcare, media, manufacturing, energy, services and academia and, all of our frontlines across VMware security and storage, including high end and mid-tier block and file.
Now let me give you a sense of what's behind our strong results. Let's look at the numbers in more detail. Revenue in the quarter grew 20% to $4.2 billion in Q3. The increase in value customers received from our proxy services is driving improvement to our business, with non-GAAP gross margin of 60.5%, up 40 basis points sequentially. 
This improvement was driven primarily by higher storage spot margins, thanks to the faster growth of our higher-margin storage products. Ongoing operating improvements help drive non-GAAP operating margins of 21.5%, up 80 basis points sequentially, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.30 up from $0.28 last quarter and from $0.23 a year ago. Free cash flow is strong and year-to-date was $2.2 billion or 22% and $427 million greater than our non-GAAP net income for the same period. 
We ended the quarter with $10.5 billion in cash, of this, a total of $6.2 billion was held in the U.S. which remained overseas. We spent $500 million on acquisitions in the quarter and $283 million buying back 15 million shares of EMC stock, bringing us to $800 million on EMC share repurchases so far this year. We still expect to spend $1 billion on EMC stock by the end of the year. In addition, EMC spent $92 million buying VMware shares and VMware spent $131 million on VMware shares. Looking at VMware's pivotal role as the Cloud data Center operating system of the future, we feel strongly these relatively small purchases maintain our ownership level on excellent long-term investments.
Now looking at our geographies. We saw a bounced double-digit growth around the world, with strongest growth in our BRIC + 13 emerging markets. Joe will provide some more color here. The negative impact of currency on a year-on-year revenue growth in Q3 was 60 basis points, assuming rates stay at September 30 levels, there should be no impact on currency on our full year revenue results. Now turning to a few details about our various products and services. Overall storage-related revenues grew 16% with or without acquisition effects. We believe that we continue to gain share in key segments of the storage market. We are the number one storage, due in large part to our technology leadership. And this is what continues to define us today. We are the leader in the most important technologies in infrastructure. 
For example, we were the first to introduce SSD in enterprise storage and the automated curing software to leverages. The ability to marry solid state and spinning drives lead to enormous performance and efficiency improvements. We unveiled this disruptive technology almost three years ago, and we're clearly benefiting from our leadership here in both high end and mid-tier storage systems.
This past quarter, we continue to reap the benefits of our innovation. As our Symmetrix spot revenues were up a robust 23%. The VMAX architecture leverages standard X86 processing, it's highly scalable in terms of both performance and capacity and includes advanced, high-value functionality like virtual provisioning and FAST. 
It is these capabilities which are driving our gains, not only in the traditional high-end deployments but also in large consolidation place, Private Cloud infrastructures and increasingly Public Cloud environments. I think that this success in brand tradition of Symmetrix leads many to think just in terms of traditional client storage. And of course we continue to set the pace there. 
However, I would encourage you to think more broadly regarding how this new architecture has been designed to be ideally strategic for the new information requirements of virtual infrastructures and cloud environments. It's this combination of our existing leadership position and the rapid penetration of these new cloud-focused environments that's driving our strong results.
A great example of this success is a Q3 win at a major global healthcare company. In this deal, VMAX's virtual provisioning and FAST, with the ability to tier to standard drives were key features as this enable the customer to increase utilization, simplify their environment and reduce CapEx and OpEx. In this case, where the customer was deploying VMware, our competitor required three times the amount of hardware to perform equivalently to two VMAX engines. This is a clear example of how VMAX is winning in large VMware consolidations. In this case, the customer wants a storage system that can support 2,500 virtual machines growing to 6,000.
In fact, VMAX has proven itself to be so cost-effective and flexible that in many instances, customers are consolidating multiple mid-tier storage platforms on to one VMAX. This is happening with both EMC and competitive midtier storage platforms. As a couple of proved points, we swept the floor of a midtier competitor’s product with the VMAX at the global healthcare customer I just mentioned and also in another win among the world's leading media and entertainment companies. As customers are moving toward the cloud, EMC is best able to help them along every step of the journey and these are just two more examples.
Our midtier Storage business continued to show good growth again in Q3, increasing 22% year-on-year. The software capability we announced last quarter for our CLARiiON and Celerra platforms, Unisphere, FAST v2 and FAST Cache and block compressor from primary storage are being embraced by customers. The standard system shipping with emphasis in the midtier continues to increase, helped in part by the availability of FAST v2 and FAST Cache. 
These features was definitely a factor in several of the deals we won this quarter, including where we bid out a midtier competitor in a well-known West Coast University. In addition, we won a project to remove an incumbents’ midtier product and we also beat two other vendors at a well-known US-based retailer, based upon the strength of our VMware integration and significantly better capacity utilization.
Another key benefit of the breadth and depth of EMC's business is that we have a leadership position in some of the hottest areas of technology today. These technology products acts as wonderful door openers for EMC. This was the case in a recent government project, where we leveraged data domain relationship to highlight the CLARiiON capabilities in a VMware environment. CLARiiON integration with VMware was the deciding factor in the purchase of several CLARiiON systems as initial footprints in the deployment that would eventually scale to several petabytes. That's in addition to the large data domain purchases happening this quarter. This is just one great example of the synergy and success of our model.
Our Backup Recovery Systems business continues to grow at a high pace. We expect BRS is extraordinary growth opportunity to play out for a long time. This will clearly lead toward success with BRS, as the clear leader in the space, but will also drive additional opportunities for EMC to help customers in other ways.
As we announced last week, we've added a new division and a whole new set of opportunities to our portfolio. Greenplum, which we announced in July, is the foundation of our new Data Computing Products division. Its first new product, the EMC Greenplum data computing appliance, offers the industry's best price/performance ratio, 3X more scalability and up to 4X as many database cores than competitive systems and data input speed up to 5X that of our competitors. Our DCA integrates database, compute and storage into an enterprise class, easy-to-implement system that can meet petabyte scale big data requirements. We are very excited to pursue this incremental market opportunity by offering yet another leading edge solution to customers, as they increasingly seek the best analytic tools to derive business values from their massive volumes of data.
Our RSA security revenue growth accelerated in Q3 to 22% year-on-year. Our GRC and SIEM products did well as the customers’ new way to manage their multitude of discreet security devices. The combination of these capabilities enables customers to have an easy-to-use governance layer that could oversee and manage other security products throughout their environments. 
As security and compliance become increasingly important to all customers, as more infrastructures move towards the cloud, this unique governance and management layer is a key differentiator and enabler in the marketplace. This was the reason we want an important security operation center project out of very large financial services customer this quarter. Revenue from our Information Intelligence Group was relatively flat against last year's Q3. The xCP platform continues to be very popular in IEG1 in a number of significant new customers in the quarter.
Clearly the rollout of virtual infrastructures in the build out of private and public clouds drove the strong growth of VMware in the quarter, up 46%. The experiments [ph](35:11) around VMworld with over 17,000 attendees is a great example of the impact VMware has on the industry. At VMworld we made a number of announcements, including vCloud Director, VMWare View 4.5, vShield and vFabric. 
We also a number of announcements around how other EMC products are being integrated with VMware, including Unified Infrastructure Management version 2, which when deployed with vCloud Director and Vblock, scraped off [ph] essentially a vCloud in a box. Other announcements included EMC storage infrastructure with secure authentication, which when combined with View 4.5 sets a storage efficiency record of $38 per client, the best in the market due to this high integration of all this various technologies. We also announced a strong RSA VMware cloud security and compliance solution, another industry first that will help ease the security concerns of customers as they move towards the cloud.
Because virtualization is the foundation of cloud computing, a key to success with VMware is bringing the virtual infrastructure and the information infrastructure together. And while we encourage others to work with VMware, we work hard as anyone else to integrate the virtual and information infrastructures. With over 60 different integration points now between EMC and VMware, including support for all the VMware APIs we lead in VMware integration. 
Recognizing the difference such as high integration makes in performance, a global medical technology company purchased both the CLARiiON and Celerra systems in the quarter. It was a combination of the VM plug-ins Unified architectures and features like FAST and FAST Cache, all for one vendor that drove this deal for us. Our results this quarter and for the last several, are great indicators of the strength of our strategy and business model. The boost in cloud is underway, all of IT is moving in this direction and while customers are moving their spending toward these two architectures at varying speeds, the tidal wave of change is definitely real. 
We are leading in the hottest areas of the move to the cloud and we have the broadest portfolio across all the key customer requirements from virtualization to storage, to security, to information governance. And while we cannot control the economy or IT spending, we believe that we'll certainly continue to grow and gain share due to our leadership position in this rapidly growing opportunity.
So looking at the environments. The opportunity ahead, our unique competitive position and the strength of our strategy and model, we are once again raising our expectations to 2010. We now expect to achieve $16.9 billion in revenue, non-GAAP operating margins of 21% to 22% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.25. This reflects revenue growth of 20% and EPS growth of 39%, very robust growth and even better leverage.
As you can see, strong growth with leverage in investments have been a standard for us since 2004 and with the results and outlook we're reporting today, it's clear we're continuing on this trajectory. But what's most exciting is that the fundamental shift to cloud architecture is only in the early stages and we believe we are better suited than anyone else to capitalize on this trend as it unfolds over the next several years. We fully expect that the triple play of share growth, investment for the future and financial leverage we're delivering this year can be maintained over the long term.
So in summary, our strategy is clear, the business and operating model are in place, our investments continue to pay off and the cloud opportunity is very big. As a result, we expect to continue to deliver double-digit revenue and double-digit earnings growth for the next few years. I will now turn the call over to Joe, who'll provide some more color on the quarter and what we see through the end of the year. Joe?"

As always, thank you for your interest in EMC.
As Tony said, I am currently in Beijing and thus, actively participating in today's earnings call from approximately 6,000 miles away from my colleagues, but I trust the marvels of communication technologies will make the mechanics of this call appear seamless.
Overall, I was very pleased with our performance in Q3. In fact, our top line revenue was the best in EMC's history, as we posted solid growth on both the year-on-year and sequential basis. I am also proud to report that we continue to create leverage in our P&L while investing in the future. To this end, in Q3 we added approximately 1,700 professionals to consolidate EMC in the areas of sales, emerging high-growth markets, R&D and VMware. Our goal is to develop more innovative products and maintain strong growth.
And most importantly, we established EMC and VMware as clear thought leaders with substantial momentum in private, public and hybrid cloud computing. We firmly believe cloud computing, which enables IT as a service, is the next big transformational wave that is shaping the Information Technology landscape. Our success in Q3 would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the 47,000 people of EMC and VMware around the world. I want to thank them for their leadership and congratulate them on their accomplishments.
I would now like to make a few comments on the global economy and more importantly, our view on IT spending trends. On the economic front, on a consolidated global basis, we continue to see a slow recovery albeit with a few bumps in the road, pretty much in line with what we have been saying all year and looking forward we expect this trend to continue. Closer to home in IT spending terms, we are seeing real strength in rapid growing and emerging geographies. 
Moderate growth in the U.S., Japan, most of Europe, albeit with a bit of choppiness in a few countries, and solid growth in countries such as Australia, Canada, Mexico and South Africa. Additionally across all markets, the very good news is that the demand for virtualization, information storage, information protection and information security and governance, areas where EMC/VMware is the leader, are growing considerably faster than the IT average. This as evidenced by the fact that in Q3 we grew on a year-on-year basis 21% in the U.S., 28% in APJ, 22% in constant currency, 14% in Europe, 19% in constant currency and approximately 30% in emerging markets. This bounced geographic growth demonstrates that we are focused on IT markets that are growing much faster than the IT as our market as a whole, and more importantly we are clearly taking share.
Additionally, we drove this demand as the ever continuing growth of information and the innovative uses of this information by our customers as they drive for higher and higher levels of productivity on meeting the mandate for risk mitigation and adheres to proper governance and compliance policies. What adds to our confidence in our future is the thought leadership, innovations and strong product roadmap we have in a new big wave of IT of cloud computing. It's our firm belief that cloud computing will transform enterprise IT shops as the customers migrate their IT data centers into private clouds. This transformation will also happen in the search provider community as they build out an extensive number of very large enterprise class public clouds.
Additionally, the actualization of Private and Public Cloud computing will provide our customers a massive benefit, mainly the ability to run applications more flexibly, with a lot more automation and a significantly lower cost while assuring the attendant policies and service levels are adhered to. But even lower cost and more flexibility can be achieved as customers take advantage of both Private and Public cloud computing by federating or operating their various application loads between their own Private clouds and the Public clouds of their chosen service provider partners. We call this cloud implementation, the hybrid cloud. 
I assure you the vast majority of our R&D budgets, our acquisitions, our go-to-market motions and the build out of our partner ecosystem, is aimed at leading and winning in this game-changing hybrid cloud opportunity. The importance of having a world-class partner ecosystem cannot be overstated. I firmly believe no one IT company could possibly possess all the IT resources to go it alone. And very importantly, every single customer I speak with once, in fact, demands best of breed and choice. To this end, our partnership with Cisco is deepening and our VCE coalition is gaining significant momentum in the market. As proof, I am again pleased to report that our Vblock sales are well ahead of plan.
Our partnership with systems integrators, such as Accenture, CSC, Capgemini, Wipro, TCS, Deloitte and others continues to grow strategically and tactically. And last, on our service provider front, we are building a number of very deep alliances with many of the leading telcos and service providers around the world. 
In Q3 we announced partnerships with the following companies: France Telecom's Orange Business Services, SingTels Alphawest, Saudi Telecom, Cable & Wireless and Terremark. And you can expect many more announcements over the coming weeks and months. In summary, EMC is executing well in today's IT market. 
We have a great product and technology portfolio and a go-to-market prowess to capture the opportunity that the private, public and hybrid cloud computing wave offers. Thus, I reaffirm our belief that we can achieve double-digit growth rates over the long term, and to help you better understand why we are so confident in our future, we will host an investor and analyst day in Q1. I'd now like to turn it back to Tony to moderate today's portion of the Q&A portion of today's call."

Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report that EMC had another great quarter. We achieved record revenues of over $4.2 billion up 20%. Record Q3 non-GAAP net income of $649 million up 35%. Non-GAAP EP",3501,"Thanks, Tony. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. I'm very pleased to report that EMC had another great quarter. We achieved record revenues of over $4.2 billion up 20%. Record Q3 non-GAAP net income of $649 million up 35%. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.30 up 30%. Record year-to-date free cash flow of $2.2 billion up 22% and non-GAAP operating margin of 21.5% of 80 basis points sequentially. 
We continue to execute on triple play with strong double-digit growth in storage security and virtualization, it's clear we continue to gain share in these key areas of the market, areas where we're already the market leader. With the announcements of VMware View 4.5, storage efficiency technologies like Fast B2, Fast cash and the acquisition of Greenplum it's clear we're investing for the future but more importantly these investments are bearing fruit and with non-GAAP gross and operating margins up 40,80 basis points respectively quarter on quarter we continue to improve profitability. We expect to continue this triple play over the long term because of how well we position ourselves to capitalize on the fundamental shift of Cloud computing. 
Now let me start by taking a few minutes to discuss what's driving our good results. The industry generally agrees that the shift to cloud architectures is no longer a question of if but when. The answer is it's happening now albeit at different speeds for different companies but all companies go through the same three phases to transform their traditional physical infrastructures to true cloud architectures and to take full advantage of the ability to offer IT as a service. Phase I is the virtualization of IT owned applications which also requires simple, efficient VM integrate storage.
Phase II is a virtualization of business critical applications. This is where SLA's around performance, availability, workload availability, recoverability and security really matter. Phase III realizes the full benefit of Cloud by taking advantages of Phases I and II together with IT automation, provisioning and chargeback to offer IT infrastructure as a service for the entire enterprise. It's at this phase that you have an elastic cloud of compute networking storage and resources and are also seamlessly drawing on compatible public cloud services where it makes sense. 
So, let’s look at what EMC offers for each one of these phases. The first phase typically tends to involves small deployments. Typically, it involves the IT departments virtualizing applications they own and manage. For these implementations, which require virtualization, and simple and efficient storage, EMC has VMware's vSphere and our unified storage products. With the majority of customers currently in this first phase our unified storage frontlines has grown rapidly and others are benefiting from this trend in the mid tier as well. Where we're really distinguishing ourselves in this phase is with efficiency technologies like SSC's and Fast Cash as well as with tight integration with VMware. For example, one well know online brokerage firm in the quarter selected EMC's unified storage in large part because of the fast cash. It's an ability to accelerate performance to address unexpected workload spikes, could not be matched by either of the other two vendors competing for this deal. 
In the second phase were virtualization extends to business critical applications SLA has become very important. In fact, customers are telling us they want ?? after they virtualize. Also, if customers selected to deploy business critical applications on enterprise storage for high SLA's in the physical world they're not going to deploy them on mid tier as they virtualize. In the second phase customers look to technologies from VMware like ?? apps speed and vSphere storage and network IO control to help control performance ?? of the applications storage and network levels. Likewise, they demand that their storage infrastructure extend these capabilities and support these SLA's. For example, EMC's fast works for storage IO control to deliver industry leading distributed resource scheduling for storage making enterprise apps perform 2 1/2 times better for the same cost. 
Customers also look to things like VMAX, VFlex duplication and security to meet these SLA deeper in the infrastructure. In Phase I a ray based snap on replicate is suitable for backup but in Phase II tight integration of high performance backup like EMC's Avamar with Vstorage API's and with the sensor provides much higher service levels. For example in Q3, a large manufacturing customer who wanted to reduce space and power consumption in a data sensor and at the same time virtualize as servers and desktops selected VMAX. 
We won another deal at a well-known global cosmetics company. In this case, the customer is expanding its VMware implementation and will use active active VM teleportation with VFlex to raise availability and federate across data sensors at distance. These are great examples of a sophisticated enterprise class technology required in this phase and in these cases, it happened to be technology our competitors could not match. In fact, in Phase II implementations larger competitors tend not to have all of their three best ?? technology and our mid tier competitors don't have the portfolio to reproved a full solution.
Phase III is when you really get to IT as a service. This involves things like integrate stacks, management up and down from physical to virtual and usage monitoring, all of which EMC offers. Our vSolution enables hybrid clouds with Vblocks. Our UIM, Unified Infrastructure Manager offers across domain provisioning, change and configuration managements. VCloud director offers self-provisioning of virtual machines in a multi?? environment and VPLEX facilitates seamless data mobility between private clouds and external providers. Illustrating this, a very large pharmaceutical company this quarter decided it was taking them too long to provision their virtual machines and turned to EMC. Now as an implement to, they're moving forward with Vblock, VMAX, UM and will use VPLEX for an active active datacenter architecture. What these examples demonstrate is that there does not tend to be any one typical cloud deal. Company’s infrastructure requirements are as varied as the companies themselves. This is why it's very important for them to have a broad and deep range of products' and services and as each company develops, its cloud infrastructure roadmap EMC can meet their needs through every phase from the departmental to enterprise wide from Tier 0 to the backup of an archive. 
Now a common question in the investor community is whose storage works best in virtualized environments? We think the best way to find out is to go ask customers which vendor they trust. As you can see from the results of these surveys, which come from separate sources, EMC consistently rises to the top when it comes to providing infrastructure for virtualized environments. Now there is one smaller competitor that claims to have a lead in virtualized environments but the facts simply don't bear it up. Rather note it tends to be the bigger, more established companies with broader offerings that come in behind EMC. Customers realize that the journey to a cloud infrastructure can be complex requiring a broad range of process services. As a result, they go with companies like EMC that can provide more. 
Public cloud providers are also building an infrastructure on EMC for a number of reasons. With virtualization, being the foundation for public cloud service VMware is key. With the vast amounts of data being stored and managed by public cloud provider’s scalability is critical. For example VMAX’s X86-based scale architecture offers this at pedabyte scale. With multi ? securities critical and the ability to attest to that security is just as important particularly for a public cloud provider. RSA's cloud security solution offers this accountability. As enterprise customers need data mobility for true, seamless, hybrid cloud and VPLEX enables the advance federation of resources into and out of the enterprise. 
This quarter we announced that several service providers are taking advantage of these technologies to offering public cloud services to their clients and this number continues to ramp. Joe will give you more color on some of these winds in his comments. The various examples I referenced are just a few of the deals we closed in Q3 with customers looking to start or continue to build out their cloud infrastructures both private and public. Our Q3 cloud winds stand verticals including government, healthcare, media, manufacturing, energy, services and academia and all of our frontline across VMware, security and storage including high-end and mid tier ? and ?.
Now I've given you a sense of what’s behind our strong results lets look at the numbers in more detail. Revenue in the quarter grew 20% to $4.2 billion in Q3. The increase in value customers received from our products and services is driving improvements to our business with non-GAAP gross margin of 60.5% up 40 basis points sequentially. This improvement was driven primarily by higher storage prop' margins thanks to the faster growth of our higher storage margin products. Ongoing operating improvements helped drive non-GAAP operating margins of 21.5% up 80 basis points sequentially and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.30 up from $0.28 last quarter and from $0.23 a year ago. Free cash flow is strong and year-to-date was $2.2 billion of 22% and $427 million greater than on non-GAAP income for the same period. We ended the quarter with $10.5 billion in cash, of this a total of $6.2 billion was held in the U.S. with reminder overseas. We spent $500 million on acquisitions in the quarter and $283 million buying back 15 million shares of EMC stock bringing us to $800 million on EMC share reproaches so far this year. We still expect to spend $1 billion on EMC stock by the end of the year. In addition, EMC spent $92 million buying VMware shares and VMware spent $131 million on VMware shares.
Looking at VMware’s pivotal role as a cloud data operating system of the future we feel strongly that these relatively small purchases to maintain our ownership level are an excellent long-term investment. Now looking at our geographies we saw a balanced double-digit growth around the world with strongest growth in our brickell 13 emerging markets. Joe will provide some more color here. The negative impact of currency on a year-over-year revenue growth was 60 basis points. Assuming rates stay at September 30 levels there should not be impact on currency on our full revenue results. 
Now turning to a few details about our various products and services, overall storage related revenues grew 16% with or without acquisition affects. We believe that we continue to gain shares in key segments of the storage markets. We are the number one storage due in large part to our technology leadership and this is what continues to define us today. We are the leader in the most important technologies in ? infrastructure. For example we were the first to introduce SSD's in enterprise storage and the automated ? software to leverages. The ability to ?? solid state and spinning drives leads to enormous performance and efficiency in improvements. We unveiled the ? technology almost three years ago and we're clearly benefiting from our leadership here in both high end and mid tier storage systems. 
This past quarter we continue to reap the benefits of our innovation as our symmetric part revenues were up a robust 23%. The VMAX architecture leverages standard X86 processing is highly scalable in terms of both performance and capacity and includes advanced high valued functionality like virtual provisioning and fast and as these capabilities which are driving our gains not only in the traditional high end deployments but also in large consolidation plays, private cloud infrastructures and increasingly public cloud environments. I think that the success in brand tradition of symmetric leads many to think just in terms of traditional clients storage and of course we continue to set the pace there. However, I would encourage you to think more broadly regarding how this new architecture has been designed to be ideally suited for the new information requirements of virtual infrastructures and cloud environments. It's this combination of our existing leadership position and the rapid penetration of these new cloud focused environments that's driving our strong results. 
A great example of this success is a Q3 win at a major global healthcare company. In this deal VMAX's virtual provisioning and fast with the ability to tier to drives were key features as these enabled the customer to increase utilization, simplify their environment and reduce CapEx and OpEx. In this case where the customer was deploying VMware, our competitor required three times the amount of hardware to perform equivalently to two VMAX engines. This is a clear example of how VMAX is winning in large consolidations. In this case the customer wanted the storage system that could support 2500 virtual machines growing to 6,000. In fact VMAX has proved itself to be so cost effective and flexible that in many instances customers have consolidated multiple mid tier storage platforms onto one VMAX. This is happening with both EMC and competitive mid tier storage platforms. 
As a couple of proof points we swept the floor of a mid tier competitors products with the VMAX at the global healthcare customer I just mentioned and also in another win of one of the world's leading media and entertainment companies. As customers are moving towards the cloud, EMC is best able to help them along every step of the journey and these are just two more examples. Our mid tier storage business continued to show good growth again in Q3 increasing 22% year-on-year. The software capabilities we announced last quarter for our client and Solaris platforms Unisphere, Fast V2, Fast Cash and Block Compression for primary storage are being embraced by customers. The percentage of systems shipping with ? in the mid tier continues to increase helped in part by the availability of Fast V2 and Fast Cash. These features were definitely a factor in several of the deals we won this quarter including where we beat out a mid tier competitor in a well-known West Coast university. In addition, we won a project to remove an incumbents mid tier products and we also beat two other vendors at a well-known U.S. based retailer based upon the strength of our VMware integration and significantly better capacity utilization. 
Another key benefit of the breadth and depth of EMC's business is that we have a leadership position in some of the hottest areas of technology today. These technologies and products act as wonderful door openers for EMC. This was the case in a recent government project where we leveraged data domains relationships to highlight client capabilities in our VMware environments. Client integration with VMware was a deciding factor in the purchase of several client systems as initial footprints in a deployment that will eventually scale to several pedebytes. That's in addition to the large data domain purchases happening in this quarter. This is just one great example of the synergy and success of our model. 
Our backup recovery systems business continues to grown at a high pace. We expect VRS's extraordinary growth opportunities to play out for a long time. This will clearly lead to more success for VRS as a clear leader in the space but it will also drive additional opportunities for EMC to help their customers in other ways. As we announced last week we've added a new division and a whole new set of opportunities to our portfolio. Greenplum, which we announced in July, is a foundation of our new data computing products division. It's first new products that EMC Greenplum data computing appliance offers the industries best priced performance ratio, three times more scalability and up to four times ? calls of competitive systems and data input speed of up to five times that of our competitors. 
Our DCA integrates database, compute and storage into an enterprise class. Each ? system that can meet pedabyte scale big data requirements. We are very excited to pursue this incremental market opportunity by offering yet another leading edge solution to customers as they increasingly seek the best analytical tools to derive business values from the massive volumes of data. Our RSA security revenue growth accelerated in Q3 22% year-on-year. Our GRC and NFIM products did well as customers need a way to marriage their multitude of discreet security devices. The combination of these capabilities enables customers to have an easy to use governance layer that can oversee a marriage other security products throughout their environments. As security and compliance become increasingly important to all customers as more infrastructures move towards the cloud this unique governance and marriage layer is a key differentiator and enabler in the market place. This was the reason we won an important security operations ? project at a very large management services customer this quarter. Revenue from our informational intelligence group was relatively flat against last year's Q3. 
The XEP platform continues to be very popular and IAG1 did a number of significant new customers during the quarter. Clearly the rollouts of virtual infrastructures and the build out of private and public clouds drove a strong growth of VMware in the quarter up 46%.   
The  (inaudible) around VMworld with over 17,000 attendees is a great example of the impact VMware has on the industry. At VMworld we made a number of announcements including vCloud Director, VMware View 4.5, vShield and Vfabric. We also made a number of announcements around how other EMC products are being integrated with VMware including Unified Infrastructure Manager Version II which when deployed with vCloud Director and vBlocks creates what's essentially a vCloud in a box. 
Other announcements include an EMC storage infrastructure with secure authentication which when combined with View 4.5 that the storage efficiency record of $38 per client the best in the market due to tight integration of all these various technologies. We also announced a strong VMware cloud security and compliance solution, another industry first that will help ease the security concerns of customers as they move towards the cloud. Because socialization is the foundation of cloud computing a key to success with VMware is bringing the virtual infrastructure and info infrastructure together and while we encourage others to work with VMware we work harder than anyone else to integrate the virtual and information infrastructures. With over 60 different integration points now between EMC and VMware including support for all the VMware API's we lead in VMware integration. 
Recognizing the difference such tight integration makes in performance a global medical technology company purchased both client and Solaris systems in the quarter. It was a combination of the VM plug-ins, unified architectures and features like Fast Cash all for one vendor that drove this deal for us. 
Our results this quarter and for the last several are great indicators of the strength of our strategy and business model. The move to cloud is underway. All of IT is moving in this direction and while customers are moving they're spending towards these new architectures at various speeds the tidal wave of change is definitely real. We are leading in the hottest areas of the move to the cloud and we have the broadest portfolio across all the key customer requirements to virtualization, storage to security information governance and while we cannot control all the economy or IT spending we believe that we will Certainly continue to grow and gain share due to our leadership position in this rapidly growing opportunity. 
So, looking at the environment the opportunity ahead, our unique competitive position and the strength of our strategy and model we are once again raising our expectation2 for 2010. We now expect to achieve $16.9 billion in revenue, non-GAAP operating margins of 21 to 22% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.25. This reflects revenue growth of 20% and EPS growth of 39%, a very robust growth and even better leverage. As you can see strong growth in leverage and investments have been the standard for us since 2004 and with the results and outlook we reported today it's clear we're continuing on this trajectory but what's most exciting is that the fundamental shift the cloud architectures is only in the early stages and we believe we are better suited than anyone else to capitalize on this trend as it unfolds over the next several years. We fully expect that the triple play of shared growth, investment for the future and financial leverage we're delivering this year can be maintained over the long term. 
So in summary our strategies clear, the business and operating model are in place, our investments continue to pay off and the cloud opportunities are very big. As a result we expect to continue to deliver double-digit revenue and double-digit earnings growth for the next few years. I'll now turn the call over to Joe who'll provide some more color on the quarter and what we see through the end of the year. Joe?

As always, thank  you for your interest in EMC. As Tony said, I am currently in Beijing and thus actively participating in today's earning call from approximately 6,000 miles",986,"Thanks, David and a warm welcome to everyone attending today's conference call. As always, thank  you for your interest in EMC. As Tony said, I am currently in Beijing and thus actively participating in today's earning call from approximately 6,000 miles away from my colleagues but I trust the marvels of communication technology will make the mechanics of this call appear seamless. 
Overall, I was very pleased with our performance in Q3. In fact, our top line revenue was the best in EMC's history as we posted solid growth on both the year-on-year sequential basis. I am also proud to report that we continue to create leverage in our P&L while investing in the future. To this end in Q3 we added approximately 1700 professionals to consolidate at EMC in the areas of Sales, emerging high growth markets, R&D and VMware. Our goal is to develop more innovative products and maintain strong growth and most importantly we established EMC and VMware as clear thought leaders with substantial amenum in private, public and hybrid cloud computing. We firmly believe cloud computing which enables IT as a service is the next big  wave that is shaping the information technology landscape. 
Our success in Q3 would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the 47,000 people of EMC and VMware around the world. I want to thank them for their leadership and congratulate them on their accomplishments. I would now like to make a few comments on a global economy and more importantly our view on IT spending trends. 
On the economic front, on a consolidated global basis we continue to see a slow recovery albeit with a few bumps in the road. Pretty much in line with what we've been saying all year and looking forward we expect this trend to continue. Closer to home in IT spending terms we are seeing really strong and rapid growing and emerging geographies. Moderate growth in the U.S. and Japan, most of Europe albeit with a bit of choppiness in a few countries and solid growth in countries such as Australia, Canada, Mexico and South Africa. Additionally across all markets the very good news is that the demand for virtualization, information storage, information protection and information security and governance are areas where EMC/VMware as the leader are growing considerably faster than the IT average. This is evidenced by the fact that in Q3 we grew on a year-on-year basis 21% in the U.S., 28% in APJ, 22% in constant currency, 14% in Europe, 19% in constant currency and approximately 30% in emerging markets. This bounced geographic growth demonstrates that we are focused on IT markets that are growing much faster than the IT market as a whole and more importantly we are clearly taking share. 
Additionally what drove this demand is the ever-continuing growth of information and the innovative uses of this information by our customers as they drive for higher and higher levels of productivity while meeting the mandate for risk mitigation and inherence to proper governance and compliance policies. What adds to our confidence in our future is the thought leaderhip, innovations and strong product roadmap we have in a new big wave of IT cloud computing. It is our firm believe that cloud computing will transform enterprised IT shops as the customers migrate their IT data centers into private clouds. This transformation will also happen in a surge provider community as they build out an expansive number of very large enterprise class public clouds. 
Additionally the actualization of private and public cloud computing will provide our customers a massive benefit namely the ability to run applications more flexibly with a lot more automation and a significantly lower cost while ensuring that the intended policies and service levels are adhered to. But even lower costs and more flexibility can be achieved as customers take advantage of both private and public cloud computing by federating or operating their various application loads between their own private clouds and the public clouds of their chosen service provider partners. We call this cloud implementation the hybrid cloud. I assure you the vast majority of our R&D budgets, our acquisitions, our go-to-market motions and the build out of our partner ecosystem is aimed at leading and winning in this game changing hybrid prod opportunity. The importance of having a world-class partner ecosystem cannot be overstated. I firmly believe no one IT company could possibly possess al the IT resources to go it alone and very importantly every single customer I speak with wants, in fact demands, best of breed and choice. 
To this end our partnership with Cisco is deepening and our VC coalition is gaining significant momentum in the market. As proof I am again pleased to report that our Vback sales are well ahead of plan. Our partnership with such integrators such as Incenter, CSC, Cap Gemini, WeePro, TCS, Deloit and others continues to grow strategically and tactically and last on the surge provider front we are building a number of very deep alliances with many of the leading Telco’s and service providers around the world. In Q3 we announced partnerships with the following companies: Branch Telecoms Orange Business Services, Cintels Alpha West, Swelty Telecom, Cable and Wireless and Terramark and you can expect many more announcements over the coming weeks and months.
In summary, EMC is executing well in today's IT market. We have a great product and technology portfolio and a go-to-market prowess to capture the opportunity that the private and public hybrid cloud-computing wave offers. Thus, I reaffirm our belief that we can achieve double-digit growth rates over the long term and to help you better understand why we are so confident in our future we will host an investor and analyst day in Q1. I'd now like to turn it back to Tony to moderate today's portion of the Q&A portion of today's call.

Now in the IIG business there’s a couple of things happening under the surface. That business is transitioning from a large enterprise, license type business to a smaller application dependent business so we’re moving from the traditional PLA to the kind of smaller XTP application rollout so underneath the surface you’re seeing that ? so that’s why you’re seeing the ? relatively flat but strategically it’s the great roll in the cloud strategy.

Relative to gross margins, yes we have seen nice expansion in the non VMware side business but as I mentioned during the quarter what we’ll be seeing is a mixed shift towards our higher gross margin products so we’re doing very well with things like our Nass Box, VMAX, like our DD Products and some of our storage software and the makeshift is helping the margins grow sequentially. I would point out to you that gross margins we equate that as an indicator of the value we’re providing to the customer and the more value we’re providing to the customer the better gross margins are  going to be with the business so that’s what’s happening beneath the surface there.

Faster than our major competitors so those would be the stars of the show obviously the information security is incredibly important and you can see the growth in our sales division business so those are going great and our new entry into Greenplum is showing a lot of progress and a good pipeline. That’s not going to be a major impact because of it’s size but still has great growth. We have several areas that I would hot and of course you mentioned that you wanted the II side but of course the VMware continues to raise their guidance also so pretty good strength for us, major project lines and of course we’ve got some, in Q1 we’re going to enter a new phase with our low end products so we’re in pretty good shape going forward, in very good shape going forward.

What we did do that customers are loving. As I said we’re, as we did with our VMAX platform and before, we have released a lot of the key software on the older platforms ahead of the new announcements so Unisphere, Fast Cash, Fast V2, new compression technology are being very well received by customers and that’s having an effect. Obviously, CLARiiON is obviously affected by Dell moving onto Equilogix so CLARiiON had a lot to overcome. Our new hope this year, strategy we think is back on track and we’re looking very forward to the future so I think it will continue to not be a star in Q4 but it’ll plod along and do okay.

I think it’s, the one metric that’s least helpful to look at on a quarter by quarter basis because of the timings and capital investments and CapEx buildup so I comment that free cash flow for the year so far is up 22% . Year-to-date it’s over $400 million higher than our non-GAAP net income. We’re looking forward to a Q4 in the year and looking forward to 2011 and we continue to strive to have our free cash flow be higher than our non-GAAP net income. 
So again, thank you for joining us. We very much appreciate it and in closing I want to reiterate that we are executing well. Our strategy for the private, public and hybrid cloud is solid and gaining traction. We have a product rollback that is well aimed and again very exciting and we have the go-to-market and the last part is necessary to bring these innovative products to market but most importantly we have 47,000 plus great people in EMC and VMware that believe in our vision and our future. So, once again thank you fro joining us and we look forward seeing to seeing you in the future, seeing you soon. Thank you very much. Bye, Bye.
