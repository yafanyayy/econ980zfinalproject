Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to report strong fourth quarter results this morning and I'm very happy that we're getting back to growing the business again.During Q4, sales trends were encouraging, particularly in North America, where our Retail business got back to positive comps. Staples Business Delivery grew sales for the first time in six quarters, and our Contract business showed nice signs of recovery.Both SBD and Contract improved their toplines by more than 10 percentage points compared to last quarter. We're gaining traction in our International business and saw strength in European Catalog and Contract as well as in South America.In terms of the Q4 headlines, total sales were up 4% versus last year to $6.4 billion. North American Retail comps were positive for the first time in 10 quarters. Adjusted earnings per share increased 6% to $0.38. And we ended the year with record free cash flow of $1.8 billion.By sticking to our recession plan of providing great service, managing expenses and investing in growth ideas, we had a lot done in 2009. Our team made great progress on the integration of Corporate Express in North America and Europe. We took big steps toward building one global Staples brand. We laid a solid foundation for growth in Tech Services and Copy & Print businesses, and we strengthened the leadership of our International business.As we look to the year ahead, we're pretty excited about our opportunities in 2010. While we're not planning for a big economic recovery this year, we do plan on getting back to growing both the top and bottom lines.One of the big biggest drivers of this growth where we'll be investing in growing adjacent categories like facilities and breakroom supplies, business technology and Copy & Print, all while continuing to grow sales in core office supplies.  We'll accomplish major milestones on the CE integration. We'll continue to open a new store every week, and we'll dramatically improve the profitability of our International business.All the work we've done to respond to our customers' needs positions us well to drive growth in our core offering while taking the business in new directions. I've never been more confident that we've got the right people and the right plan to take full advantage of the opportunities we have in front of us.Now turning to our business units, starting with North American Delivery. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2.4 billion, down about 1%. And while we're not quite back to growth in delivery, we were encouraged by the improving trends we saw throughout the quarter as the top line in each of our Delivery businesses improved sequentially.In Staples Business Delivery, we grew the top line in the mid-single digits. In Contract, sales declined in the low-single digits. And in Quill, the top line declined in the mid-single digits. NAD operating margin improved 24 basis points to 9.2% compared to the same period last year. Synergies from better buying, combining two sales forces, closing warehouses, and reducing marketing expense all helped operating margin. On the other hand, higher incentive compensation weighed on profitability. Contract customers also remained cautious with discretionary purchases, the mixed shift to On-Contract, lower margin products continued to moderate during the fourth quarter, and was only a modest drag of about 10 basis points on NAD product margin.During the fourth quarter, we signed several new government accounts, continuing the trend that we've seen throughout 2009. Our Government business grew by about 11% in Q4. We're right on track with the integration of Corporate Express in North America. During the fourth quarter, we integrated key finance systems and consolidated accounts payable activities to our shared services center in South Carolina. We completed the consolidation of our office products assortment, and we're currently rationalizing assortment in facility supplies, furniture and our other lines of business.We've wrapped up our brand transition in North America and we also made great progress with the integration of our distribution network. A few weeks ago, we went live with our first distribution center that will serve both Staples and legacy Corporate Express customers.Looking back at the past year, I'm extremely proud of how hard our team has worked and the progress we've made with the integration. During 2009, we hit our targets for direct and indirect buying synergies. We reduced small orders, increased average order size and the improved account profitability. We finalized our assortment and combined the Corporate Express and Staples brands, paving the way for our 2010 full-line catalog which featured one common product assortment. We combined our sales force and got all of our sales associates on the same compensation and benefits plans. We consolidated human resource and finance systems. We rationalized our transportation network and began using the rebranded Corporate Express fleet to deliver Staples products. And we leveraged our new lines of business to win more than $200 million of new business in adjacent categories like furniture, printing and technology solutions. At the same time, we managed working capital extremely well. Our shared services team dramatically improved DSO, and our supply chain team increased inventory turns resulting in strong free cash flow for NAD.Despite how far we've come in the 21 months since we acquired Corporate Express, we still have a lot of work to do. During 2010, we'll complete the majority of our supply chain network integration and consolidate a handful of fulfillment centers. We'll also be heavily focused on the design and testing of our single common e-commerce ordering platform, which will be a big improvement over our legacy ordering systems.During 2009, we made great progress developing our lines of business and in 2010, we're going to make an even bigger push into these adjacent categories, where our existing customers want us to provide them with solutions. We recently launched Staples Technology Solutions to provide business customers with a one-stop shop for data center and desktop technology products, as well as network services. We'll also invest in growing facilities and breakroom supplies, where our capabilities have improved with the acquisition of Corporate Express. We're confident that we can grow this category to become a much more meaningful piece of our business over the next coming years.Moving on to North American Retail. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2.6 billion. That was an increase of 8% or 4% in local currency versus Q4 of 2008. Fourth quarter same-store sales rose 3%. Customer count comps increased 4% compared to Q4 2008, and that's the strongest increase in traffic we've seen in more than three years.Average order size continues to improve sequentially, but remain negative compared to last year. Average order size was down about 1%. We saw double-digit top line growth in categories where we've made big investments like computers and ink. And we also relative strength in multifunction devices, tech peripherals and core office supplies. Our Services business also performed well during the fourth quarter. The Copy & Print Center achieved high-single digit top line growth while improving the bottom line. And our EasyTech business doubled versus the fourth quarter of 2008.We continue to improve our price impression with customers in the fourth quarter with strong performance during both the holiday and back-to-business seasons. Price and value remain top of mind and many of our traffic driving initiatives like great deals on laptops and other tech products, 50% back in rewards, double rewards on ink and strong paper offers really struck a chord with our customers. And while we're seeing increased traffic in our stores, we haven't taken our eye off the ball with customer service. And I'm happy to report that our customer satisfaction scores hit all-time highs during the fourth quarter.North American retail operating margin increased 21 basis points to 9.5% for the quarter. Gross profit continues to benefit from purchasing synergies, and we leveraged rent and distribution expenses during the quarter. These improvements were somewhat offset by an increased mix of lower margin technology products. We did a good job with the operating and selling expenses, particularly in marketing where we continue to reduce costs by moving more of our marketing online. These improvements were somewhat offset by increased incentive compensation, as the team drove better results in North American Retail.  We also worked hard managing working capital in North American Retail, reducing inventory per store by 5% and driving a 34 basis point improvement in inventory turns compared to last year's levels, all while improving customer service and in stock levels and driving the top line.During the fourth quarter, we opened four stores and we closed five. And for the full year, we opened 48 stores and closed 12 stores in North America. We ended the year with a total of 1,871 stores in North America, 1,555 in the United States and 316 in Canada. The commercial real estate market remains very attractive and in 2010, we'll continue to be very selective with the locations of our new store openings. We expect to open about 40 new stores in North America for the full year, around 35 in the United States and five in Canada.In addition to investing in new stores, we're also going to drive growth by making investments in attractive categories where we have very low market share like Business Technology and Copy & Print. We've made great strides in improving the quality of our offering and broadening our assortment. But to succeed in these categories, we're going to need to think differently about how we serve our customers. This year, we'll invest in people, training and store remodels to become a much more credible player here.And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike to talk about International."
34740,98200802,52120,"Staples, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Mar 02, 2010",2010-03-02,"Earnings Calls","Staples, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ron. Good morning, everybody.

Sales for the fourth quarter in International were $1.4 billion, an increase of about 7% in U.S. dollars and a decrease of about 6% local currency compared to the same period last year. Operating margin was 4.1% of sales, a decrease of 38 basis points from Q4 2008. Our Office Products business in Europe, which makes up a little more than 70% of our total International sales, showed relative strength. Profit improvement initiatives we've put in place are gaining traction, and the operating margin of that business improved by almost 100 basis points during the fourth quarter, with operating margin expansion across all channels: Retail, Catalog and Contract.However, the progress that we're making there was offset by losses in the Print Systems division in Europe and our business in China. Together, these two units lost $20 million in the fourth quarter compared to a small profit year ago.Print Systems division has done a good job, rightsizing for continued soft sales in 2010, reducing headcount by 11%. We expect PSD to post better results in the coming year.In China, although the top line trend showed some moderation during the fourth quarter, we continue to face double digit sales decline and steep losses. Jeff Jin, the former Chairman of Staples China, has left the business. And we have a strong team on the ground including a new CFO and Head of Human Resources working with our COO to get that business back on track.In Europe, Catalog sales grew in the low-single digits in local currency versus Q4 of last year, with particular strength in our French businesses. Catalog operating margin improved as a result of better product mix and purchasing synergy. Contract sales were flat in local currency versus last year, although the Nordics region had a very strong performance. Contract margins improved nicely due to the strength in our office supplies and cost saving measures. In-store sales in the European Retail declined 8% during the fourth quarter. The decline was driven entirely by durable, especially technology with positive comps for consumable based by double-digit growth rank [ph]. As a result, our gross margin comp was flat despite of the soft sales. Overall profitability for the Retail segment remains strong with operating margins increasing.Turning to the Corporate Express integration in Europe, we completed the majority of our direct and indirect vendor negotiations during the fourth quarter. We made progress with the rationalization of our warehouse network across Europe, completing the consolidation of Contract and Catalog warehouses in Spain, and transitioning our German Catalog operations from Brussels to Stuttgart.We're in the midst of the rebranding of all Contract facilities in Europe. And over the last month have re-signed our retail stores in Scandinavia from Corporate Express brands to Staples.Outside of Europe, Corporate Express Australia did a good job driving profit improvement despite soft sales during the fourth quarter. Our business in South America drove top line growth and significantly improved its profitability year-over-year. And our joint venture in India continues to grow quickly on pace with our expectations.Last quarter, I outlined three priorities for International: People, profitability and portfolio. On the people front, we recently named John Barton, Executive Vice President, International Development, with direct responsibility for our high-growth markets and an overall charter for implementing Staples' best practices around the world.John just celebrated his 20th anniversary at Staples, and has led our real estate function for the last six. That experience will be invaluable as we ramp up new store growth in Europe with 10 new stores in our 2010 plan. On profitability, the progress we're making with the integration of Corporate Express will be a key contributor to improving profitability. The integration in Europe got started about a year after North America, and a large portion of the buying, G&A and supply chain efficiencies that we focused on throughout 2009, will start to show up in our 2010 results.I mentioned the improved profitability of the Print Systems division, and we expect continued progress toward better profitability in our high-growth markets. I remain confident that we will take a significant step forward on International profitability in 2010.Our International portfolio strategy is all about focusing on a relatively small number of markets where we can build a strong profitable multichannel business, maximizing scale and minimizing G&A. We won't hesitate to pull back from unprofitable markets. During the fourth quarter, we closed our two Office Centre stores in Germany and exited our Catalog businesses in Hungary and the Czech Republic, bringing our total countries with operations outside of North America down to 23 to 25.At the same time, we're moving forward with investments in some of our priority markets. New store growth and investment in building a mid-market contract sales force. The more I learn about our International business, the more bullish I am about our opportunities.Now I'd like to turn it over to John to review our financials."

In the fourth quarter, total company sales were up 4% versus last year to $6.4 billion. The foreign exchange impact from the weaker U.S. dollar helped the top line by about 450 basis points during Q4, with about 40% of this benefit coming from Canada.For the full year, total company sales were up 5% to $24.3 billion. If you adjust our 2008 sales to include $3.4 billion of Corporate Express sales prior to the acquisition, our top line declined about 8% versus last year. Our fourth GAAP earnings per share on a fully-diluted basis decreased 20% to $0.32 a share versus the fourth quarter of 2008.A few weeks ago, we announced the settlement of several retail wage in hour class action lawsuits, for which we recorded a $42 million pretax expense. We also incurred $20 million of pretax integration and restructuring expenses in Q4. Excluding those two items, adjusted earnings per share increased to 6% to $0.38 per share versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Q4 2008 adjusted earnings per share excluded pretax integration and restructuring expense of $41 million and a $57 million tax gain.Favorable foreign currency exchange rates benefited EPS this quarter by about $0.02. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share declined 12% to $1.14 compared to last year's $1.29.Gross profit margin improved by 55 basis points to 27.4% during the fourth quarter. This reflects stronger product margins driven by purchasing synergies, efficiencies in delivery and distribution expense and leveraged rent expense, partially offset by a higher mix of lower margins in technology sales particularly in North American Retail.On an adjusted basis, SG&A delevered 38 basis points versus last year's fourth quarter to 19.5% of sales. This was driven by increased incentive compensation offset by leverage on the labor line, integration synergies and marketing efficiencies. And adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points during the fourth quarter to 7.6%. 2009 capital expenditures came in at $313 million, down from the $378 million we spent during 2008. With operating cash flow of about $2.1 billion, we generated a record $1.8 billion free cash flow for the year, versus $1.3 billion in 2008.In 2010, we're planning to increase our capital expenditures to $450 million as we invest in growth initiatives, new stores, remodels, systems and the integration of our distribution networks in North America and Europe. We expect that cash flow will remain strong during 2010. However, we don't have the same degree of integration-related working capital or tax opportunities that we had in 2009. We also may invest in inventory to support improving sales trends throughout the year. We plan to spend about $140 million more in capital this year, and are expecting to generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow in 2010.Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect total company sales to increase in the mid-single digits versus Q1 of 2009. We expect adjusted earnings per share, excluding integration and restructuring expense, in the range of $0.25 to $0.27 for the first quarter of 2010.We expect total company sales for the full year to increase in the low-single digits versus 2009. We expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share, excluding integration and restructuring expense, in the range of $1.23 to $1.33. This EPS guidance assumes a modest economic recovery throughout 2010 and increased investment in our growth ideas like Business Technology, Copy & Print, new stores, launching of mid-market Contract offering in Europe and adjacent categories such as facilities and breakroom supplies.Let me give you some more detail on our expectations for the P&L. We expect depreciation expense to be $115 million to $125 million in the first quarter, and $470 million to $490 million for the full year. We anticipate amortization expense to be $15 million to $20 million for the first quarter, and $65 million to $75 million for the full year. Integration and restructuring expense is expected to be front-end loaded during 2010, with $25 million to $30 million in the first quarter and $50 million to $60 million for the full year. And net interest expense is expected to be $55 million to $60 million in the first quarter, and $225 million to $235 million for the full year. In terms of share count, you should expect about 735 million to 740 million shares for the first quarter, and 740 million to 745 million for the full year.Thanks for your time this morning, and I will now turn the call back over to our conference moderator for Q&A."

The other is, obviously, as we think about investments in some of our growth categories, some of those are capital items, which will occur at the beginning of the year. Some of the store models, for example. We'll also invest in training associates to support that. And that'll put pressure on our profitability throughout the year, particularly as we -- so we'll try and scale that. So at the beginning of the year, our training will be smaller numbers of people. And to the extent that we see results from the training and staffing that we plan to invest in, we'll continue to invest in that throughout the year.

You look around, some of the -- it's both up in the Nordics, in Southern Europe, in our Catalog business, we've got some strong operations. We've also really improved our Retail business there over the years. I think three or four years ago, we were struggling to break even in Germany at Retail. That business is now approaching U.S. levels of profitability and on a nice trend. So I think there are some places in Europe where I think we're ready to invest today even though the overall operating profit level there is still below where we want it to be. With respect to mid-market, I think there's, particularly in Germany and the U.K., a nice opportunity for us to leverage the contract infrastructure that we've got in place there, and add the mid-market sales force model that has worked so well for Joe and the NAD team here in North America. You won't be surprised to learn that we're exporting people from Joe's team, who are experts on that model, to Europe to help lead that effort. And we've already got the first people on the ground, and are beginning to add sales people in that space as we speak. Obviously, it's something that needs to build over time, because you need to ramp the sales force to really drive the business. But we're optimistic that we can do the same thing over there that we have with SBA here in the U.S."

Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to report strong fourth quarter results this morning and I'm very happy that we're getting back to growing the business again.During Q4, sales trends were encouraging, particularly in North America, where our Retail business got back to positive comps. Staples Business Delivery grew sales for the first time in six quarters, and our Contract business showed nice signs of recovery.Both SBD and Contract improved their toplines by more than 10 percentage points compared to last quarter. We're gaining traction in our International business and saw strength in European Catalog and Contract as well as in South America.In terms of the Q4 headlines, total sales were up 4% versus last year to $6.4 billion. North American Retail comps were positive for the first time in 10 quarters. Adjusted earnings per share increased 6% to $0.38. And we ended the year with record free cash flow of $1.8 billion.By sticking to our recession plan of providing great service, managing expenses and investing in growth ideas, we had a lot done in 2009. Our team made great progress on the integration of Corporate Express in North America and Europe. We took big steps toward building one global Staples brand. We laid a solid foundation for growth in Tech Services and Copy & Print businesses, and we strengthened the leadership of our International business.As we look to the year ahead, we're pretty excited about our opportunities in 2010. While we're not planning for a big economic recovery this year, we do plan on getting back to growing both the top and bottom lines.One of the big biggest drivers of this growth where we'll be investing in growing adjacent categories like facilities and breakroom supplies, business technology and Copy & Print, all while continuing to grow sales in core office supplies.  We'll accomplish major milestones on the CE integration. We'll continue to open a new store every week, and we'll dramatically improve the profitability of our International business.All the work we've done to respond to our customers' needs positions us well to drive growth in our core offering while taking the business in new directions. I've never been more confident that we've got the right people and the right plan to take full advantage of the opportunities we have in front of us.Now turning to our business units, starting with North American Delivery. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2.4 billion, down about 1%. And while we're not quite back to growth in delivery, we were encouraged by the improving trends we saw throughout the quarter as the top line in each of our Delivery businesses improved sequentially.In Staples Business Delivery, we grew the top line in the mid-single digits. In Contract, sales declined in the low-single digits. And in Quill, the top line declined in the mid-single digits. NAD operating margin improved 24 basis points to 9.2% compared to the same period last year. Synergies from better buying, combining two sales forces, closing warehouses, and reducing marketing expense all helped operating margin. On the other hand, higher incentive compensation weighed on profitability. Contract customers also remained cautious with discretionary purchases, the mixed shift to On-Contract, lower margin products continued to moderate during the fourth quarter, and was only a modest drag of about 10 basis points on NAD product margin.During the fourth quarter, we signed several new government accounts, continuing the trend that we've seen throughout 2009. Our Government business grew by about 11% in Q4. We're right on track with the integration of Corporate Express in North America. During the fourth quarter, we integrated key finance systems and consolidated accounts payable activities to our shared services center in South Carolina. We completed the consolidation of our office products assortment, and we're currently rationalizing assortment in facility supplies, furniture and our other lines of business.We've wrapped up our brand transition in North America and we also made great progress with the integration of our distribution network. A few weeks ago, we went live with our first distribution center that will serve both Staples and legacy Corporate Express customers.Looking back at the past year, I'm extremely proud of how hard our team has worked and the progress we've made with the integration. During 2009, we hit our targets for direct and indirect buying synergies. We reduced small orders, increased average order size and the improved account profitability. We finalized our assortment and combined the Corporate Express and Staples brands, paving the way for our 2010 full-line catalog which featured one common product assortment. We combined our sales force and got all of our sales associates on the same compensation and benefits plans. We consolidated human resource and finance systems. We rationalized our transportation network and began using the rebranded Corporate Express fleet to deliver Staples products. And we leveraged our new lines of business to win more than $200 million of new business in adjacent categories like furniture, printing and technology solutions. At the same time, we managed working capital extremely well. Our shared services team dramatically improved DSO, and our supply chain team increased inventory turns resulting in strong free cash flow for NAD.Despite how far we've come in the 21 months since we acquired Corporate Express, we still have a lot of work to do. During 2010, we'll complete the majority of our supply chain network integration and consolidate a handful of fulfillment centers. We'll also be heavily focused on the design and testing of our single common e-commerce ordering platform, which will be a big improvement over our legacy ordering systems.During 2009, we made great progress developing our lines of business and in 2010, we're going to make an even bigger push into these adjacent categories, where our existing customers want us to provide them with solutions. We recently launched Staples Technology Solutions to provide business customers with a one-stop shop for data center and desktop technology products as well as network services. We'll also invest in growing facilities and breakroom supplies, where our capabilities have improved with the acquisition of Corporate Express. We're confident that we can grow this category to become a much more meaningful piece of our business over the next coming years.Moving on to North American Retail. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2.6 billion. That was an increase of 8% or 4% in local currency versus Q4 of 2008. Fourth quarter same-store sales rose 3%. Customer count comps increased 4% compared to Q4 2008, and that's the strongest increase in traffic we've seen in more than three years.Average order size continues to improve sequentially, but remain negative compared to last year. Average order size was down about 1%. We saw double-digit top line growth in categories where we've made big investments like computers and ink. And we also relative strength in multifunction devices, tech peripherals and core office supplies. Our Services business also performed well during the fourth quarter. The Copy & Print Center achieved high-single digit top line growth while improving the bottom line. And our EasyTech business doubled versus the fourth quarter of 2008.We continue to improve our price impression with customers in the fourth quarter with strong performance during both the holiday and back-to-business seasons. Price and value remain top of mind and many of our traffic driving initiatives like great deals on laptops and other tech products, 50% back in Rewards, double rewards on ink and strong paper offers really struck a chord with our customers. And while we're seeing increased traffic in our stores, we haven't taken our eye off the ball with customer service. And I'm happy to report that our customer satisfaction scores hit all-time highs during the fourth quarter.North American retail operating margin increased 21 basis points to 9.5% for the quarter. Gross profit continues to benefit from purchasing synergies, and we leveraged rent and distribution expenses during the quarter. These improvements were somewhat offset by an increased mix of lower margin technology products. We did a good job with the operating and selling expenses, particularly in marketing where we continue to reduce costs by moving more of our marketing online. These improvements were somewhat offset by increased incentive compensation, as the team drove better results in North American Retail.  We also worked hard managing working capital in North American Retail, reducing inventory per store by 5% and driving a 34 basis point improvement in inventory turns compared to last year's levels, all while improving customer service and in stock levels and driving the top line.During the fourth quarter, we opened four stores and we closed five. And for the full year, we opened 48 stores and closed 12 stores in North America. We ended the year with a total of 1,871 stores in North America, 1,555 in the United States and 316 in Canada. The commercial real estate market remains very attractive and in 2010, we'll continue to be very selective with the locations of our new store openings. We expect to open about 40 new stores in North America for the full year, around 35 in the United States and five in Canada.In addition to investing in new stores, we're also going to drive growth by making investments in attractive categories where we have very low market share like Business Technology and Copy & Print. We've made great strides in improving the quality of our offering and broadening our assortment. But to succeed in these categories, we're going to need to think differently about how we serve our customers. This year, we'll invest in people, training and store remodels to become a much more credible player here.And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike to talk about International."

Operating margin was 4.1% of sales, a decrease of 38 basis points from Q4 2008. Our Office Products business in Europe, which makes up a little more than 70% of our total International sales showed relative strength. Profit improvement initiatives we've put in place are gaining traction, and the operating margin of that business improved by almost 100 basis points during the fourth quarter, with operating margin expansion across all channels: Retail, Catalog and Contract.However, the progress that we're making there was offset by losses in the Print Systems division in Europe and our business in China. Together, these two units lost $20 million in the fourth quarter compared to a small profit a year ago.The Print Systems division has done a good job, rightsizing for continued soft sales in 2010, reducing headcount by 11%. We expect PSD to post better results in the coming year.In China, although the top line trend showed some moderation during the fourth quarter, we continue to face double digit sales declines and steep losses. Jeff Jin, the former Chairman of Staples China has left the business, and we have a strong team on the ground including a new CFO and Head of Human Resources working with our COO to get that business back on track.In Europe, Catalog sales grew in the low single digits in local currency versus Q4 of last year, with particular strength in our French businesses. Catalog operating margin improved as a result of better product mix and purchasing synergy. Contract sales were flat in local currency versus last year, although the Nordics region had a very strong performance. Contract margins improved nicely due to the strength in our office supplies and cost saving measures. In-store sales in the European Retail declined 8% during the fourth quarter. The decline was driven entirely by durable, especially technology with positive comps for consumables based by double-digit growth for ink. As a result, our gross margin comp was flat despite of the soft sales. Overall profitability for the Retail segment remains strong with operating margins increasing.Turning to the Corporate Express integration in Europe, we completed the majority of our direct and indirect vendor negotiations during the fourth quarter. We made progress with the rationalization of our warehouse network across Europe, completing the consolidation of Contract and Catalog warehouses in Spain, and transitioning our German Catalog operations from Brussels to Stuttgart.We're in the midst of the rebranding of all Contract facilities in Europe. And over the last month have re-signed our retail stores in Scandinavia from Corporate Express brands to Staples.Outside of Europe, Corporate Express Australia did a good job driving profit improvement despite soft sales during the fourth quarter. Our business in South America drove top line growth and significantly improved its profitability year-over-year. And our joint venture in India continues to grow quickly on pace with our expectations.Last quarter, I outlined three priorities for International: People, profitability and portfolio. On the people front, we recently named John Barton, Executive Vice President, International Development, with direct responsibility for our high-growth markets and an overall charter for implementing Staples' best practices around the world.John just celebrated his 20th anniversary at Staples, and has led our real estate function for the last six. That experience will be invaluable as we ramp up new store growth in Europe with 10 new stores in our 2010 plan. On profitability, the progress we're making with the integration of Corporate Express will be a key contributor to improving profitability. The integration in Europe got started about a year after North America, and a large portion of the buying, G&A and supply chain efficiencies that we focused on throughout 2009 will start to show up in our 2010 results.I mentioned the improved profitability of the Print Systems division, and we expect continued progress toward better profitability in our high-growth markets. I remain confident that we will take the significant step forward on International profitability in 2010.Our International portfolio strategy is all about focusing on a relatively small number of markets where we can build a strong profitable multichannel business, maximizing scale and minimizing G&A. We won't hesitate to pull back from unprofitable markets. During the fourth quarter, we closed our two Office Centre stores in Germany and exited our Catalog businesses in Hungary and the Czech Republic, bringing our total countries with operations outside of North America down to 23 from 25.At the same time, we're moving forward with investments in some of our priority markets. New store growth and investment in building a mid-market contract sales force. The more I learn about our International business, the more bullish I am about our opportunities.Now I'd like to turn it over to John to review our financials."

In the fourth quarter, total company sales were up 4% versus last year to $6.4 billion. The foreign exchange impact from the weaker U.S. dollar helped the top line by about 450 basis points during Q4, with about 40% of this benefit coming from Canada.For the full year, total company sales were up 5% to $24.3 billion. If you adjust our 2008 sales to include $3.4 billion of Corporate Express sales prior to the acquisition, our top line declined about 8% versus last year. Our fourth GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis decreased 20% to $0.32 a share versus the fourth quarter of 2008.A few weeks ago, we announced the settlement of several retail wage in hour class action lawsuits, for which we recorded a $42 million pretax expense. We also incurred $20 million of pretax integration and restructuring expenses in Q4. Excluding those two items, adjusted earnings per share increased to 6% to $0.38 per share versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Q4 2008 adjusted earnings per share excluded pretax integration and restructuring expense of $41 million and a $57 million tax gain.Favorable foreign currency exchange rates benefited EPS this quarter by about $0.02. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share declined 12% to $1.14 compared to last year's $1.29.Gross profit margin improved by 55 basis points to 27.4% during the fourth quarter. This reflects stronger product margins driven by purchasing synergies, efficiencies in delivery and distribution expense and leveraged rent expense, partially offset by a higher mix of lower margins in technology sales particularly in North American Retail.On an adjusted basis, SG&A delevered 38 basis points versus last year's fourth quarter to 19.5% of sales. This was driven by increased incentive compensation offset by leverage on the labor line, integration synergies and marketing efficiencies. And adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points during the fourth quarter to 7.6%. 2009 capital expenditures came in at $313 million, down from the $378 million we spent during 2008. With operating cash flow of about $2.1 billion, we generated a record $1.8 billion free cash flow for the year, versus $1.3 billion in 2008.In 2010, we're planning to increase our capital expenditures to $450 million as we invest in growth initiatives, new stores, remodels, systems and the integration of our distribution networks in North America and Europe. We expect that cash flow will remain strong during 2010. However, we don't have the same degree of integration-related working capital or tax opportunities that we had in 2009. We also may invest in inventory to support improving sales trends throughout the year. We plan to spend about $140 million more in capital this year, and are expecting to generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow in 2010.Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect total company sales to increase in the mid-single digits versus Q1 of 2009. We expect adjusted earnings per share, excluding integration and restructuring expense, in the range of $0.25 to $0.27 for the first quarter of 2010.We expect total company sales for the full year to increase in the low-single digits versus 2009. We expect to achieve adjusted earnings per share, excluding integration and restructuring expense, in the range of $1.23 to $1.33. This EPS guidance assumes a modest economic recovery throughout 2010 and increased investment in our growth ideas like Business Technology, Copy & Print, new stores, launching of mid-market Contract offering in Europe and adjacent categories such as facilities and breakroom supplies.Let me give you some more detail on our expectations for the P&L. We expect depreciation expense to be $115 million to $125 million in the first quarter, and $470 million to $490 million for the full year. We anticipate amortization expense to be $15 million to $20 million for the first quarter, and $65 million to $75 million for the full year. Integration and restructuring expense is expected to be front-end loaded during 2010, with $25 million to $30 million in the first quarter and $50 million to $60 million for the full year. And net interest expense is expected to be $55 million to $60 million in the first quarter, and $225 million to $235 million for the full year. In terms of share count, you should expect about 735 million to 740 million shares for the first quarter, and 740 million to 745 million for the full year.Thanks for your time this morning, and I will now turn the call back over to our conference moderator for Q&A."

The other is, obviously, as we think about investments in some of our growth categories, some of those are capital items, which will occur at the beginning of the year. Some of the store models, for example. We'll also invest in training associates to support that. And that'll put pressure on our profitability throughout the year, particularly as we -- so we'll try and scale that. So at the beginning of the year, our training will be smaller numbers of people. And to the extent that we see results from the training and staffing that we plan to invest in, we'll continue to invest in that throughout the year.

I think given a reasonable economic prospect and picture in 2010, we expect to get significant leverage from the better buying that we're doing. And as I said, those negotiations have all been completed. And so we really know what that's going to be. From the headcount reduction that we achieved through the works council negotiations in 2009 and again, although not all of that has been implemented, it's all been negotiated. And so we know what that's going to be. And through the supply chain consolidations that we are and still in the midst of, we're going from roughly 37 warehouses in Europe down to something like half that, but we're already halfway there.

Thanks for joining us today. I’m very pleased to report a strong start to 2010.

Thanks for joining us today. I’m very pleased to report a strong start to 2010. We’re seeing improvements in both the top and bottom lines in each of our three businesses and our team continues to execute extremely well. 
Compared to last year total sales were up 4% to $6.1 billion, and adjusted earnings per share increased 27% to $0.28. We generated $144 million of free cash flow during the first quarter. North American delivery got back to growing with a 2% increase on the top line, and North American retail comped 1%, a 300 basis point sequential improvement in the two-year comp trend. 
On the bottom line for the first time since the third quarter of 2007 we expanded operating margin in all three of our businesses. We saw particular strength in North American delivery, and international with both segments improving operating margin well over 100 basis points compared to last year. 
With solid progress on the Corporate Express integration, and positive early results from our key growth initiatives we’re seeing good momentum to start off the year. Turning  now to our business units, and I’m going to start with North American delivery, sales for the first quarter were $2.5 billion, an increase of 2% in US dollars. 
The top line in each of our delivery businesses improved sequentially. In Staples business delivery we grew the top line in the mid single-digits. In contract, sales grew in the low single-digits, and Quill’s top line declined in the low single-digits. 
In contract customer acquisition and retention remained strong. Sales from new customers drove top line improvement in the high single-digits. This was offset by lower spend from existing customers. The adjacent categories that we call our lines of business grew faster than the house during the first quarter with particular strength in promotional products, which had strong double-digit sales growth versus Q1 of last year. 
One of our key initiatives in North American delivery is to grow facilities and breakroom supplies, an area where we’ve greatly improved with the acquisition of Corporate Express. We’ve expanded our assortment, sharpened our pricing, and ramped up our marketing efforts to drive awareness resulting in top line growth above the house during the first quarter.
NAD operating margin improved 162 basis points to 8.3% compared to the same period last year. Improved product margins, sales force productivity, warehouse consolidation, reduced amortization, and customers buying a broader range of products, all helped operating margin. 
Throughout 2009 contract customers were cautious and shifted their mix to more on contract, lower margin products. During the first quarter of 2010, we saw an improvement in the mix as customers began to purchase more off contract items. This helped NAD gross margins by about 10 basis points during the quarter. 
Turning to some of the operating metrics we continued to increase our average order size. For Q1 average order in contract was about $200.00, an increase of $7.00 compared to Q1 of 2009. We also reduced the percentage of small orders under $50.00 by a few hundred basis points compared to last year. 
During 2010 our Corporate Express integration plans are going to be all about the supply chain. We continue making progress with our distribution and transportation network. After successful consolidations of facilities in Kansas City, and Orlando, we’re on track to consolidate another handful of fulfillment centers this year. 
In addition to supply chain integration we’re also in the early stages of developing our single ecommerce ordering platform for all of our contract customers. Moving on to North American retail, sales for the first quarter were $2.3 billion which was an increase of 6% or 2% in local currency compared to Q1 of 2009.
First quarter same store sales were up 1% with strength in computers, tech services, copy and print, and office supplies. Customer count comps increased 3% compared to Q1 of last year but average order size was down about 2%. 
Traffic trends in retail were stronger among consumers relative to small business customers, reflecting continued weakness in job creation. Our investments to grow business technology drove strong results across multiple categories. We have a very low share and relatively low customer awareness in categories like computing and tech services.
To take advantage of this huge market opportunity we’re investing in people, training, and store remodels this year. During the first quarter our top line growth was well above the house in computers, software, and peripherals. And our EasyTech business continued to grow very rapidly.
The average comp for these categories is up more than 10% for the quarter and margins were respectable as a result of good progress in attachment selling and inventory management. We’re also driving growth in our copy and print business by investing in training, technology, and store remodels, the sales force, as well as incremental marketing. 
During the first quarter our copy and print business in North American retail comped several hundred basis points better than the house. And while we’re very focused on these two big growth initiatives in retail we’re still growing our high margin core office supplies business. 
During Q1 office supplies performed better than the house with strength in writing instruments, business essentials, and dated goods. Cut sheet copy paper was also quite strong and ink comps were in line with the house. 
North American retail operating margin increased 30 basis points to 7.6% for the quarter. We leveraged marketing, distribution, and rent expense and also saw a benefit from reduced depreciation. We held gross margins flat despite an increased mix of technology products.
We achieved a modest reduction in inventory per store despite growing the top line and drove about a 50 basis point improvement in inventory turns compared to last year’s levels. We also achieved record high customer satisfaction scores. 
During the first quarter we opened 20 stores, we closed three stores ending Q1 with 1888 stores in North America. We’re on track to open about 40 new stores in North America for the full year. 
And with that I’ll turn it over to Mike, to talk about our international business.

Sales for the first quarter in international were $1.3 billion, an increase of about 6% in US dollars, a decrease of about 4% in local currency compared to the same period last year.
Operating margin for the international business was 2.9% of sales, an increase of 121 basis points from Q1 2009. Our European office products business achieved a 4.1% operating margin, a 300 basis point improvement as a result of our integration efforts and aggressive management of unprofitable businesses.
In Europe the delivery business had a solid quarter, with positive sales growth in local currency and strong profit growth. We’re realizing the profit improvements that we’ve talked about before generating better margins through [pan] European buying, reducing G&A with our new European organization, and integrating our supply chain.
In the first quarter we further reduced the number of delivery warehouses by four and have now closed a third of the facilities we had following the acquisition of Corporate Express. European retail has been more difficult, with a same store sales decline of 5%. 
We’ve reduced our emphasis on technology promotion and have refocused on building a retail business more based on office supplies. We were still able to hold our operating profit rate but we must develop new traffic drivers for this segment. 
The integration of Corporate Express in Europe remains solidly on track. During the quarter we implemented in catalogues and inventories the brand and product changes resulting from last year’s vendor negotiations. 
We completed the rebranding of our contract operations to Staples Advantage. The 2010 contract catalogues were launched in April, with Staples own brand products replacing all CE legacy brands. We also rebranded our retail stores in Norway to Staples. 
In addition to the warehouse consolidations I just mentioned we have started to leverage our contract warehouse in the Netherlands to replenish our Dutch stores replacing direct to store deliveries from vendors thus realizing cost savings and better in stock. 
The printing systems division produced a loss again in Q1 but sales have begun to stabilize and the cost reductions we’ve implemented there should make that division profit neutral for the balance of the year. 
Our high growth markets generally showed improved sales trends as the economies of Asia and South America rebound from 2009. In addition to sales growth we need to drive higher gross margin rates in these businesses and we made good progress on that in China and Brazil this quarter. 
As you might remember we have three priorities for driving our international business, people, profitability, and portfolio. We continue to add to our strong international leadership team. Yesterday we announced that [Pete Howard] who has been leading Staples Business Delivery has become the Senior Vice President for Southern Europe. 
That region includes two of our most profitable catalogue businesses and Pete will look to reignite sales growth there. We will also have the benefit of his direct marketing and ecommerce expertise across all of international.
As I just described we continue to make strides in our profitability with strong improvement in Europe during Q1. We expect to improve our overall profitability throughout the year as we lap last year’s losses in China and printing systems.
On the portfolio front I said last quarter that we wouldn’t hesitate to pull back from unprofitable markets and noted the closure of our operations in Hungary and in Czech Republic. Obviously we prefer turning a business around to exiting a market and in the first quarter we saw most of our European businesses which suffered losses a year ago turn a profit. 
Our portfolio strategy is equally focused on investing in priority markets and in Q1 we initiated a push into the mid market contract space in the UK. We also announced an offer to acquire the 41% of Corporate Express Australia that we don’t currently own. 
The offer period extends through June and we think that Staples multichannel approach will work well in the Australian market. Now I’d like to turn it over to John to review the financials.

The foreign exchange impact from the weaker US dollar helped the top line by about 400 basis points during Q1, with about half of this benefit coming from the strength in the Canadian dollar. 
Our first quarter GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis increased 30% to $0.26 versus the first quarter of 2009. Favorable foreign exchange rates benefited EPS by about $0.02 during the quarter. 
During the first quarter the company recorded pre-tax integration restructuring expense of $21 million or $0.02 per diluted share. Excluding these costs as well as the $19 million of pre-tax integration and restructuring expense that we incurred during the first quarter of 2009 adjusted earnings per share increased 27% to $0.28 versus $0.22 during Q1 of last year. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.5% compared to 34.5% last year. This change in the effective tax rate relates to the expiration of provisions in the IRS tax code regulating the way we report international income on our US tax return. 
As a result our tax expense for the first quarter of 2010 was $10 million higher than it would have been if Congress had extended these provisions. Assuming Congress extends these provisions our tax rate for the year would return to 34.5%, and we would have a catch up adjustment that would reduce income tax expense in the quarter that Congress passes the legislation. 
Gross profit margin improved by 50 basis points to 26.7% during the first quarter. This reflects stronger product margin driven by better buying and increased vendor support as well as efficiencies in delivery and distribution expense. 
SG&A leveraged 45 basis points versus last year’s first quarter to 20.1% of sales. This was driven by reduced marketing expense, G&A efficiencies, as well as a modest reduction in depreciation expense as a result of lower capital expenditures last year. 
Adjusted operating margin increased 107 basis points during the first quarter to 6.3% compared to Q1 2009. Q1 capital expenditures came in at $49 million with operating cash flow of $193 million, we generated $144 million in free cash flow for the first quarter. 
We remain on track to spend about $450 million on capital expenditures this year as we invest in growth initiatives, new stores, remodels, systems, and the integration of our distribution networks in North America and Europe. And we expect to generate more than a billion dollars of free cash flow this year. 
During the first quarter we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 9% to $0.09 per share. This equates to about $65 million of cash returned to shareholders through dividends during the quarter. Later this year we’ll also consider resuming our share repurchase program. 
As we look out to the rest of 2010 we’ll face tougher comparisons on the top line particularly in North American retail. For the current quarter and the full year we expect total company sales to increase in the low single-digits versus 2009.
Operating margin comparisons get tougher throughout 2010 especially in North American delivery as we anniversary about 200 basis points of sequential operating margin improvement from Q1 to Q2 of last year. 
We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding integration and restructuring expense to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.20 for Q2. This assumes Congress doesn’t pass legislation extending the provisions in the second quarter resulting in a 37.5% tax rate. 
Assuming we get back to the 34.5% tax rate for the full year, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range $1.25 to $1.33. We’re maintaining a wide range of earnings outcomes in light of the uncertainty of the sales trends in the back half of the year. 
As the employment picture and other macro factors remain uncertain, if the top line improves faster than we expect, we’ll be closer to the top end of the range. We expect depreciation expense to be $120 to $130 million in the second quarter and $470 to $490 million for the full year. 
Amortization expense to be about $15 to $20 million in the second quarter and $65 to $75 million for the full year. Integration and restructuring expense will be $15 to $20 million in the second quarter and $45 to $55 million for the year. And net interest expense to be about $50 to $55 million in the second quarter and $215 to $225 million for the full year. 
In terms of share count you should expect about 735 million shares for the second quarter and about 740 million for the full year. 
Thank you for your time this morning, and now I’ll turn it over for Q&A.

So though we’re getting the small business customer back we’re getting the consumer back faster.
I think a lot of our good promotions and incentives that we’ve put out there have really driven the traffic back to the store and I think a lot of the traditional non-office supply jobs related retailers have seen that increase over the past couple of months as they’ve reported in their numbers. 
So I think that’s probably helps us get at why the number is higher and the AOV number is slightly lower so we continue to see tech prices go through their normal cycle of more features slightly less retail and we’ll just keep working on driving the traffic and building the average order.
So, not exactly the perfect mix but good and improving.

One is kind of back to basics, getting out of the unprofitable businesses we’re in and anniversarying some of the one-time costs and that’s going to kick in in the second and third quarters of this year. And then building the business, improving the gross margins there through better merchandising and ultimately building scale there. But for us in China Q1 was about the same as Q1 was a year ago.

So although it deleverages our expenses it isn’t an unmanaged deleverage in our P&L. So the scope of that really depends on the success we’ve had and as Demos described it we’ve had decent success in growing our businesses that we’re investing in faster than the rest of the house and through a combination of better execution and an improving economy we hope that that will continue and that will allow us to keep making those investments that will benefit the longer-term but not in a way that’s going to dramatically adversely impact the current year P&L.

But we are able to see the productivity of each of those people grow in a way that although it requires some expense deleverage in the near-term we’re very confident that its going to result in driving that, the profitability of the store overall in the case of copy and print and the tech business and in some of the sales force changes we’ve made for the lines of business in NAD to improve and achieve some of our longer-term margin targets over time.

I don’t think we’re suffering anything for the transition of the brand from Corporate Express to Staples. In fact in Norway small geography limited number of stores, but we changed all the stores there from the banner [Endures] which was what they were called under Corporate Express to Staples in the first quarter and we had 3% comp sales growth there which was by far the best performance we had in our European retail.
We’re in most cases Corporate Express didn’t have a great strong brand in Europe so the change has been relatively a non-event from most customers. There are a few Staples legacy brands in Europe like JPG and [Mondoffice] in the catalogue space that do have very strong brand names and heritage and we’re going to be more gradual about our transition there.
So I think most of the issues that we’ve seen in Europe have been economic and hopefully as the economy recovers so will our sales.

In international for example we talked about the buying synergies coming in later then they had in the US and so that’s one of the big drivers in Europe. In NAD the improvements we’ve seen over the last 18 months in distribution and delivery has had a dramatic impact. We’ve seen some pressure more recently with some of the elements of transportation. 
But overall NAD through a combination of getting the average order size up in the contract business, driving the mix in SBG, and getting the order size up at Quill all have driven gross margin there and all of those things are sustainable. 
In North American retail, probably the biggest issue there is mix and Demos talked about driving improvements, faster growth in some of the high margin service businesses, improving attachment rate in the tech business all helped. So each of them has their own story but it isn’t one dimensional in any of the business units. 
Each of them have a number of initiatives they’re working on all of which should allow us to continue to see gross margin improvement.

Thanks for joining us today. And I'm very pleased to report a strong start to 2010. We're seeing improvements in both the top and bottom lines in each of our three businesses, and our team continues to execute extremely well. 
Compared to last year, total sales were up 4% to $6.1 billion, and adjusted earnings per share increased 27% to $0.28. We generated $144 million of free cash flow during the first quarter. North American Delivery got back to growing, with a 2% increase on the top line and North American Retail comped 1%, a 300 basis points sequential improvement in a two-year comp trend. 
On the bottom line for the first time since the third quarter of 2007, we expanded operating margin in all three of our businesses. We saw particular strength in North American Delivery and International, with both segments improving operating margin well over 100 basis points compared to last year. With solid progress on the Corporate Express integration and positive early results from our key growth initiatives, we're seeing good momentum to start off the year.
Turning now to our business units, and I'm going to start with North American Delivery. Sales for the first quarter were $2.5 billion, an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars. The top line in each of our Delivery businesses improved sequentially. In Staples Business Delivery, we grew the top line in the mid single digits. In Contract, sales grew on the low single digits, and Quill's top line declined in the low single digits. 
In Contract, customer acquisition and retention remained strong. Sales from new customers drove top line improvement in the high-single digits. This was offset by lower spend from existing customers. The adjacent categories, that we called our lines of business, grew faster than the house during the first quarter, with particular strength in promotional products, which had strong double-digit sales growth versus Q1 of last year. 
One of our key initiatives in North American Delivery is to grow facilities and break room supplies, an area where we've greatly improved with the acquisition of Corporate Express. We've expanded our assortment, sharpened our pricing and ramped up our marketing efforts to drive awareness, resulting in top line growth above the house during the first quarter.
NAD operating margin improved 162 basis points to a 8.3% compared to the same period last year. Improved product margins, sales force productivity, warehouse consolidation, reduced amortization and customers buying a broader range of products, all helped operating margin. 
Throughout 2009, Contract customers were cautious and shifted their mix to more on-contract lower-margin products. During the first quarter of 2010, we saw an improvement in the mix as customers began to purchase more off-contract items. This helped NAD gross margins by about 10 basis points during the quarter.
Turning to some of the operating metrics. We continue to increase our average order size. For Q1 average order in Contract was about $200, an increase of $7 compared to Q1 of 2009. We also reduced the percentage of small orders under $50 by a few hundred basis points compared to last year.
During 2010, our Corporate Express integration plans are going to be all about the supply chain. We continued making progress with our distribution and transportation network. After successful consolidations of facilities in Kansas City and Orlando, we're on track to consolidate another handful of fulfillment centers this year. In addition to supply chain integration, we're also in the early stages of developing our single e-commerce ordering platform for all of our Contract customers.
Moving on to North American Retail. Sales for the first quarter were $2.3 billion, which was an increase of 6%, or 2% in local currency, compared to Q1 of 2009. First quarter same-store sales were up 1% with strength in computers, tech services, copy & print and office supplies. Customer count comps increased 3% compared to Q1 of last year, but average order size was down about 2%. Traffic trends in Retail was stronger among consumers relative to small business customers, reflecting continued weakness in job creation.
Our investments to grow business technology drove strong results across multiple categories. We have a very low share and relatively low customer awareness in categories like computing and tech services. To take advantage of this huge market opportunity, we're investing in people, training and store remodels this year. 
During the first quarter, our top line growth was well above the house in computers, software and peripherals. And our EasyTech business continued to grow very rapidly. The average comp for these categories is up more than 10% for the quarter and margins were respectable as a result of good progress in attachment selling and inventory management.
We're also driving growth on our Copy & Print business by investing in training, technology and store remodels, the sales force as well as incremental marketing during the first quarter. Our Copy & Print business in North American Retail comped several hundred basis points better than the house. 
And while we're very focused on these two big growth initiatives in Retail,  we're still growing our high-margin core Office Supplies business. During Q1, Office Supplies performed better than the house with strength in writing instruments, business essentials and dated goods. Cut sheet copy paper is also quite strong, and ink comps were in line with the house.
North America Retail operating margin increased 30 basis points to 7.6% for the quarter. We leveraged marketing, distribution and rent expense and also saw a benefit from reduced depreciation. We held gross margin flat despite an increased mix of technology products. We achieved a modest reduction in inventory per store despite growing the top line and drove about a 50 basis point improvement in inventory turns compared to last year's levels. We also achieved record-high customer satisfaction scores.
During the first quarter, we opened 20 stores, and we closed three stores, ending Q1 with 1,888 stores in North America. We're on track to open about 40 new stores in North America for the full year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike to talk about our International business."

Sales for the first quarter in International were $1.3 billion, an increase of about 6% in U.S. dollars, a decrease of about 4% in local currency, compared to the same period last year. Operating margin for the International business was 2.9% of sales, an increase of 121 basis points from Q1 2009. 
Our European Office Products business achieved a 4.1% operating margin, a 300 basis point improvement, as a result of our integration efforts and aggressive management of unprofitable businesses. 
In Europe, the Delivery business had solid quarter with positive sales growth in local currency and strong profit growth. We're realizing the profit improvements that we've talked about before, generating better margins through pan-European buying, reducing G&A with our new European organization and integrating our supply chain. In the first quarter, we further reduced the number of Delivery warehouses by four and have now closed a third of the facilities we had following the acquisition of Corporate Express.
European Retail has been more difficult with the same-store sales decline of 5%. We reduced our emphasis on technology promotion and have refocused on building a Retail business more based on office supply. We were still able to hold our operating profit rate, but we must develop new traffic drivers for this segment.
Integration of Corporate Express in Europe remains solidly on track. During the quarter, we implemented, in catalogs and inventories, the brand and product changes resulting from last year's vendor negotiations. We completed the rebranding of our Contract operations to Staples Advantage. The 2010 Contract catalogs were launched in April with Staples own-brand products replacing all CE legacy brands. We also rebranded our retail stores in Norway to Staples. 
In addition to the warehouse consolidations I just mentioned, we have started to leverage our Contract warehouse in the Netherlands to replenish our Dutch stores, replacing direct-to-store deliveries from vendors, thus, realizing cost savings and better in-stock.
The Printing Systems division produced a loss again in Q1, but sales have begun to stabilized, and the cost reductions we've implemented there should make that division profit neutral for the balance of the year.
Our high-growth markets generally showed improved sales trends as the economies of Asia and South America rebound from 2009. In addition to sales growth, we need to drive higher gross margin rates in these businesses, and we made good progress on that in China and Brazil this quarter.
As you might remember, we have three priorities for driving our International business: people, profitability and portfolio. We continue to add to our strong International leadership team. Yesterday, we announced that Pete Howard, who has been leading Staples Business Delivery, has become the Senior Vice President for Southern Europe. That region includes two of our most profitable Catalog businesses, and Pete will look to reignite sales growth there. We also have the benefit of his direct marketing and e-commerce expertise across all of International. 
As I just described, we continue to make strides in our profitability with strong improvement in Europe during Q1. We expect to improve our overall profitability throughout the year as we lap last year's losses in China and Printing Systems. 
On the portfolio front, I said last quarter that we wouldn't hesitate to pull back from unprofitable markets and noted the closure of our operations in Hungary and the Czech Republic. Obviously, we prefer turning a business around to exiting a market. And in the first quarter, we saw most of our European businesses, which suffered losses a year ago, turn a profit. 
Our portfolio strategy is equally focused on investing in priority markets. And in Q1, we initiated a push into the mid-market contracts space in the U.K. 
We also announced an offer to acquire the 41% of Corporate Express Australia that we don't currently own. The offer period extends through June, and we think that Staples multichannel approach will work well in the Australian market.
Now I'd like to turn it over to John to review the financials."

Our first quarter GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis increased 30% to $0.26 versus the first quarter of 2009. Favorable foreign exchange rates benefited EPS by about $0.02 during the quarter. 
During the first quarter, the company recorded pretax integration and restructuring expense of $21 million or $0.02 per diluted share. Excluding these costs, as well as the $19 million of pretax integration and restructuring expense that we incurred during the first quarter of 2009, adjusted earnings per share increased 27% to $0.28 versus $0.22 during Q1 of last year.
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.5% compared to 34.5% last year. This change in the effective tax rate relates to the expiration of provisions in the IRS tax code, regulating the way we report International income on our U.S. tax return. As a result, our tax expense for the first quarter of 2010 was $10 million higher than it would've been if Congress had extended these provisions. Assuming Congress extends these provisions, our tax rate for the year would return to 34.5%, and we would have a catch-up adjustment that would reduce income tax expense in the quarter that Congress passes the legislation.
Gross profit margin improved by 50 basis points to 26.7% during the first quarter. This reflects stronger product margin, driven by better buying and increased vendor support as well as efficiencies in delivery and distribution expense. 
SG&A leveraged 45 basis points versus last year's first quarter to 20.1% of sales. This was driven by reduced marketing expense, G&A efficiencies as well as a modest reduction in depreciation expense as a result of lower capital expenditures last year.  Adjusted operating margin increased 107 basis points during the first quarter to 6.3% compared to Q1 2009. 
Q1 capital expenditures came in at $49 million. With operating cash flow of $193 million, we generated $144 million in free cash flow for the first quarter. We remain on track to spend about $450 million on capital expenditures this year as we invest in growth initiatives, new stores, remodel, systems and the integration of our distribution networks in North America and Europe, but we expect to generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow this year.
During the first quarter, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 9% to $0.09 per share. This equates to about $65 million of cash return to shareholders through dividends during the quarter. Later this year, we'll also consider resuming our share repurchase program. 
As we look out to the rest of 2010, we'll face tougher comparisons on the top line, particularly in North American Retail. For the current quarter and the full year, we expect total company sales to increase in the low single digits versus 2009. Operating margin comparisons get tougher throughout 2010, especially in North American Delivery, as we anniversary about 200 basis points of sequential operating margin improvement from Q1 to Q2 of last year. 
We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding integration and restructuring expense, to be in a range of $0.18 to $0.20 for Q2. This assumes Congress doesn't pass legislation extending the provisions in the second quarter resulting in a 37.5% tax rate. Assuming we get back to the 34.5% tax rate for the full year, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in a range of $1.25 to $1.33. We're maintaining a wide range of earnings outcomes in light of the uncertainty of sales trends in the back half of the year as the employment picture and other macro factors remain uncertain. If the top line improves faster than we expect, we'll be closer to the top end of the range. 
We expect depreciation expense to be $120 million to $130 million in the second quarter and $470 million to $490 million for the full year. Amortization expense to be about $15 million to $20 million in the second quarter and $65 million to $75 million for the full year. Integration and restructuring expense will be $15 million to $20 million in the second quarter and $45 million to $55 million for the year, and net interest expense to be about $50 million to $55 million in the second quarter and $215 million to $225 million for the full year. In terms of share count, you should expect about 735 million shares for the second quarter and about 740 million for the full year.

Let me just ask the second question, get it out of the way. Mike, you gave us some interesting break-outs of the composition of the International P&L, speaking specifically about the delta in Europe, which exceeded the delta or the improvement that you saw overall in International.

So it's a little bit more upfront work in each and every one of them. So that's what we've learned. But as far as the benefits that we're achieving both in terms of costs and inventory, et cetera, is just meeting the levels that we anticipated. So we continue to have a year of heavy lifting, not only in terms of the integration of the quad channel buildings, but also of the many delivery hubs that we are in the process of integrating as well throughout the network, to get a single delivery in a geography, consolidated between a Corporate Express suite and the Staples suite.

As you know, we lost about $50 million in Asia in 2009. We're kind of in the three-step process of improving that. One is kind of back to basics, getting out of the unprofitable businesses we're in and anniversary-ing some of the onetime costs, and that's going to kick in, in the second and third quarters of this year. And then building the business, improving the gross margins there to a better merchandising and, ultimately, building scale there. But for us in China, Q1 was about the same as Q1 was a year ago.

Ron mentioned that we had a relatively easy compare in NAD with last year's first quarter in terms of the operating margin rate. But I think we're looking for over the long-term, steady improvement in the operating margin of NAD towards our long-term targets. And we're not going to see that in a linear fashion exactly the same way in every quarter."

Thanks for joining us today. And I'm very pleased to report a strong start to 2010. We're seeing improvements in both the top and bottom lines in each of our three businesses, and our team continues to ex",1025,"Well, thanks, Laurel, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. And I'm very pleased to report a strong start to 2010. We're seeing improvements in both the top and bottom lines in each of our three businesses, and our team continues to execute extremely well. 
Compared to last year, total sales were up 4% to $6.1 billion, and adjusted earnings per share increased 27% to $0.28. We generated $144 million of free cash flow during the first quarter. North American Delivery got back to growing, with a 2% increase on the top line and North American Retail comped 1%, a 300 basis points sequential improvement in a two-year comp trend. 
On the bottom line for the first time since the third quarter of 2007, we expanded operating margin in all three of our businesses. We saw particular strength in North American Delivery and International, with both segments improving operating margin well over 100 basis points compared to last year. With solid progress on the Corporate Express integration and positive early results from our key growth initiatives, we're seeing good momentum to start off the year.
Turning now to our business units, and I'm going to start with North American Delivery. Sales for the first quarter were $2.5 billion, an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars. The top line in each of our Delivery businesses improved sequentially. In Staples Business Delivery, we grew the top line in the mid single digits. In Contract, sales grew on the low single digits, and Quill's top line declined in the low single digits. 
In Contract, customer acquisition and retention remained strong. Sales from new customers drove top line improvement in the high-single digits. This was offset by lower spend from existing customers. The adjacent categories, that we called our lines of business, grew faster than the house during the first quarter, with particular strength in promotional products, which had strong double-digit sales growth versus Q1 of last year. 
One of our key initiatives in North American Delivery is to grow facilities and break room supplies, an area where we've greatly improved with the acquisition of Corporate Express. We've expanded our assortment, sharpened our pricing and ramped up our marketing efforts to drive awareness, resulting in top line growth above the house during the first quarter.
NAD operating margin improved 162 basis points to a 8.3% compared to the same period last year. Improved product margins, sales force productivity, warehouse consolidation, reduced amortization and customers buying a broader range of products, all helped operating margin. 
Throughout 2009, Contract customers were cautious and shifted their mix to more on-contract lower-margin products. During the first quarter of 2010, we saw an improvement in the mix as customers began to purchase more off-contract items. This helped NAD gross margins by about 10 basis points during the quarter.
Turning to some of the operating metrics. We continue to increase our average order size. For Q1 average order in Contract was about $200, an increase of $7 compared to Q1 of 2009. We also reduced the percentage of small orders under $50 by a few hundred basis points compared to last year.
During 2010, our Corporate Express integration plans are going to be all about the supply chain. We continued making progress with our distribution and transportation network. After successful consolidations of facilities in Kansas City and Orlando, we're on track to consolidate another handful of fulfillment centers this year. In addition to supply chain integration, we're also in the early stages of developing our single e-commerce ordering platform for all of our Contract customers.
Moving on to North American Retail. Sales for the first quarter were $2.3 billion, which was an increase of 6%, or 2% in local currency, compared to Q1 of 2009. First quarter same-store sales were up 1% with strength in computers, tech services, copy & print and office supplies. Customer count comps increased 3% compared to Q1 of last year, but average order size was down about 2%. Traffic trends in Retail was stronger among consumers relative to small business customers, reflecting continued weakness in job creation.
Our investments to grow business technology drove strong results across multiple categories. We have a very low share and relatively low customer awareness in categories like computing and tech services. To take advantage of this huge market opportunity, we're investing in people, training and store remodels this year. 
During the first quarter, our top line growth was well above the house in computers, software and peripherals. And our EasyTech business continued to grow very rapidly. The average comp for these categories is up more than 10% for the quarter and margins were respectable as a result of good progress in attachment selling and inventory management.
We're also driving growth on our Copy & Print business by investing in training, technology and store remodels, the sales force as well as incremental marketing during the first quarter. Our Copy & Print business in North American Retail comped several hundred basis points better than the house. 
And while we're very focused on these two big growth initiatives in Retail,  we're still growing our high-margin core Office Supplies business. During Q1, Office Supplies performed better than the house with strength in writing instruments, business essentials and dated goods. Cut sheet copy paper is also quite strong, and ink comps were in line with the house.
North America Retail operating margin increased 30 basis points to 7.6% for the quarter. We leveraged marketing, distribution and rent expense and also saw a benefit from reduced depreciation. We held gross margin flat despite an increased mix of technology products. We achieved a modest reduction in inventory per store despite growing the top line and drove about a 50 basis point improvement in inventory turns compared to last year's levels. We also achieved record-high customer satisfaction scores.
During the first quarter, we opened 20 stores, and we closed three stores, ending Q1 with 1,888 stores in North America. We're on track to open about 40 new stores in North America for the full year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike to talk about our International business."

Sales for the first quarter in International were $1.3 billion, an increase of about 6% in U.S. dollars, a decrease of about 4% in local currency, compared to the same period last year. Operating margin for the International business was 2.9% of sales, an increase of 121 basis points from Q1 2009. 
Our European Office Products business achieved a 4.1% operating margin, a 300 basis point improvement, as a result of our integration efforts and aggressive management of unprofitable businesses. 
In Europe, the Delivery business had solid quarter with positive sales growth in local currency and strong profit growth. We're realizing the profit improvements that we've talked about before, generating better margins through pan-European buying, reducing G&A with our new European organization and integrating our supply chain. In the first quarter, we further reduced the number of Delivery warehouses by four and have now closed a third of the facilities we had following the acquisition of Corporate Express.
European Retail has been more difficult with the same-store sales decline of 5%. We reduced our emphasis on technology promotion and have refocused on building a Retail business more based on office supply. We were still able to hold our operating profit rate, but we must develop new traffic drivers for this segment.
Integration of Corporate Express in Europe remains solidly on track. During the quarter, we implemented, in catalogs and inventories, the brand and product changes resulting from last year's vendor negotiations. We completed the rebranding of our Contract operations to Staples Advantage. The 2010 Contract catalogs were launched in April with Staples own-brand products replacing all CE legacy brands. We also rebranded our retail stores in Norway to Staples. 
In addition to the warehouse consolidations I just mentioned, we have started to leverage our Contract warehouse in the Netherlands to replenish our Dutch stores, replacing direct-to-store deliveries from vendors, thus, realizing cost savings and better in-stock.
The Printing Systems division produced a loss again in Q1, but sales have begun to stabilized, and the cost reductions we've implemented there should make that division profit neutral for the balance of the year.
Our high-growth markets generally showed improved sales trends as the economies of Asia and South America rebound from 2009. In addition to sales growth, we need to drive higher gross margin rates in these businesses, and we made good progress on that in China and Brazil this quarter.
As you might remember, we have three priorities for driving our International business: people, profitability and portfolio. We continue to add to our strong International leadership team. Yesterday, we announced that Pete Howard, who has been leading Staples Business Delivery, has become the Senior Vice President for Southern Europe. That region includes two of our most profitable Catalog businesses, and Pete will look to reignite sales growth there. We also have the benefit of his direct marketing and e-commerce expertise across all of International. 
As I just described, we continue to make strides in our profitability with strong improvement in Europe during Q1. We expect to improve our overall profitability throughout the year as we lap last year's losses in China and Printing Systems. 
On the portfolio front, I said last quarter that we wouldn't hesitate to pull back from unprofitable markets and noted the closure of our operations in Hungary and the Czech Republic. Obviously, we prefer turning a business around to exiting a market. And in the first quarter, we saw most of our European businesses, which suffered losses a year ago, turn a profit. 
Our portfolio strategy is equally focused on investing in priority markets. And in Q1, we initiated a push into the mid-market contracts space in the U.K. 
We also announced an offer to acquire the 41% of Corporate Express Australia that we don't currently own. The offer period extends through June, and we think that Staples multichannel approach will work well in the Australian market.
Now I'd like to turn it over to John to review the financials."

For the first quarter, total company sales were up 4% versus last year to $6.1 billion. The foreign exchange impact from the weaker U.S. dollar helped the top line by about 400 basis points during Q1, with about half of this benefit coming from the strength of the Canadian dollar.
Our first quarter GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis increased 30% to $0.26 versus the first quarter of 2009. Favorable foreign exchange rates benefited EPS by about $0.02 during the quarter. 
During the first quarter, the company recorded pretax integration and restructuring expense of $21 million or $0.02 per diluted share. Excluding these costs, as well as the $19 million of pretax integration and restructuring expense that we incurred during the first quarter of 2009, adjusted earnings per share increased 27% to $0.28 versus $0.22 during Q1 of last year.
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.5% compared to 34.5% last year. This change in the effective tax rate relates to the expiration of provisions in the IRS tax code, regulating the way we report International income on our U.S. tax return. As a result, our tax expense for the first quarter of 2010 was $10 million higher than it would've been if Congress had extended these provisions. Assuming Congress extends these provisions, our tax rate for the year would return to 34.5%, and we would have a catch-up adjustment that would reduce income tax expense in the quarter that Congress passes the legislation.
Gross profit margin improved by 50 basis points to 26.7% during the first quarter. This reflects stronger product margin, driven by better buying and increased vendor support as well as efficiencies in delivery and distribution expense. 
SG&A leveraged 45 basis points versus last year's first quarter to 20.1% of sales. This was driven by reduced marketing expense, G&A efficiencies as well as a modest reduction in depreciation expense as a result of lower capital expenditures last year.  Adjusted operating margin increased 107 basis points during the first quarter to 6.3% compared to Q1 2009. 
Q1 capital expenditures came in at $49 million. With operating cash flow of $193 million, we generated $144 million in free cash flow for the first quarter. We remain on track to spend about $450 million on capital expenditures this year as we invest in growth initiatives, new stores, remodel, systems and the integration of our distribution networks in North America and Europe, but we expect to generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow this year.
During the first quarter, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 9% to $0.09 per share. This equates to about $65 million of cash return to shareholders through dividends during the quarter. Later this year, we'll also consider resuming our share repurchase program. 
As we look out to the rest of 2010, we'll face tougher comparisons on the top line, particularly in North American Retail. For the current quarter and the full year, we expect total company sales to increase in the low single digits versus 2009. Operating margin comparisons get tougher throughout 2010, especially in North American Delivery, as we anniversary about 200 basis points of sequential operating margin improvement from Q1 to Q2 of last year. 
We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding integration and restructuring expense, to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.20 for Q2. This assumes Congress doesn't pass legislation extending the provisions in the second quarter, resulting in a 37.5% tax rate. Assuming we get back to the 34.5% tax rate for the full year, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.25 to $1.33. We're maintaining a wide range of earnings outcomes in light of the uncertainty of sales trends in the back half of the year as the employment picture and other macro factors remain uncertain. If the top line improves faster than we expect, we'll be closer to the top end of the range. 
We expect depreciation expense to be $120 million to $130 million in the second quarter and $470 million to $490 million for the full year. Amortization expense to be about $15 million to $20 million in the second quarter and $65 million to $75 million for the full year. Integration and restructuring expense will be $15 million to $20 million in the second quarter and $45 million to $55 million for the year, and net interest expense to be about $50 million to $55 million in the second quarter and $215 million to $225 million for the full year. In terms of share count, you should expect about 735 million shares for the second quarter and about 740 million for the full year.

Our business is coming back just like it did in the last recession, and I think that bodes very well for the company in 2010, 2011, 2012. Obviously, the economic indicators are really mixed, and we're seeing, in the first quarter, some choppy sales, kind of up and down. But from my perspective, the key is job creation. And our job is take care of customers, invest appropriately, run a tight ship, but there's some real positive signs we're seeing, I mean, the mix of off-contract to on-contract in our Contract business. Our Contract business is starting to see some momentum, and we're seeing that not only in the medium business side but the large business side. Customer counts are strong in our Retail business. Our SBD business continued to show some improvement during the quarter. So I'm not sure it's going to be a big-time recovery, but I think it's going to be a slow, steady recovery. Obviously, there's going to be some chops in the middle, but I'm a little more optimistic than I've been, maybe, the last few quarters."

We had a several hundred basis points improvement and reduction of our small orders.

In most cases, Corporate Express didn't have a great strong brand in Europe. So the change has been relatively a non-event for most customers. There are a few Staples legacy brands in Europe like JPG and MondOffice in the catalog space that do have very strong brand names and heritage.

In North American Retail, part of the biggest issue there is mix.

I'm pleased to report strong earnings growth for the second quarter. Our operations are solid. Our growth initiatives are gaining traction, and we are delivering good earnings performance despite soft topline trends. Compared to last year, total company sales were flat at $5.5 billion, and adjusted earnings per share increased 25% to $0.20.
North American Delivery grew topline by 2%. North American Retail also grew sales by 2% and had flat same-store sales, which was a 200 basis point improvement in our three-year comp trend. And our international business declined 6% in U.S. dollars, but only 2% in local currency. On the bottomline, we expanded operating margin in all three of our businesses for the second consecutive quarter.
Our view of the business for the back-half of 2010 remains unchanged. We expect to see a modest recovery in the economy and unemployment to remain high. We'll continue to drive the topline by investing in key growth initiatives, areas like facilities and breakroom supplies, business technology and copy and print where we're already seeing positive signs. And we'll accomplish important milestones on the Corporate Express integration, particularly in the areas of supply chain and systems.
Turning to our business units, starting with North American Delivery, sales for the second quarter were $2.4 billion and increased up 2% in U.S. dollars or 1% in local currency compared to Q2 of 2009. In Staples Business Delivery, we grew the topline in the mid-single digits. In Contract, sales grew in the low-single digits. And Quill's topline improved versus last quarter, with declines in the low-single digits.
Core office supplies and business technology were stronger in the second quarter, while durables like business machines and furniture remained weaker than the house.
The pricing environment contract remains rational. And during the second quarter, customer acquisition and retention in our contract business was strong. Sales from new customers drove topline improvement in the high-single digits. This was offset by lower spend from existing customers.
We're seeing good trends in the facilities and breakroom category. A growing percentage of customers have started to think of Staples for more than just office supply, particularly in contract where we've had some recent wins with larger customers who previously came to us for only their core supplies.
Our expanded assortment, better training for our sales associates, sharper pricing and increased marketing efforts drove topline growth in this category during the second quarter despite difficult comparisons from sales of H1N1 related products last year.
NAD operating margin increased 79 basis points to 8.7% compared to the same period last year. Our better buying and more favorable mix of discretionary products and lower amortization expense, all contributed to this improvement.
We continue to increase our average order size. For Q2, average order in contract was just under $206, which was an increase of almost $8 compared to Q2 of 2009. We also reduced the percentage of small orders, under $50, by a couple of hundred basis points compared to last year.
The integration of our supply chain is a multi-year project and includes development of common back-end systems as well as physical integration of our networks. Systems work is complete, and we're now making great progress with integrating the physical network.
During the second quarter, we closed two fulfillment centers. We upgraded 10 facilities with the capability to serve both Staples and legacy Corporate Express customers. The scope of our integration also includes our last-mile delivery homes, and we consolidated over 30 of these locations during the first half of 2010 and approximately 35 more are in the works.
This year, we've taken on more infrastructure projects than in any other time in Staples' history. Despite the additional complexity and resources required, the team has done an excellent job executing these projects while maintaining great customer service.
Moving on to North American Retail, sales for the second quarter were $2.0 billion, an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars or flat in local currency compared to Q2 of 2009. Second quarter same-store sales were flat with strengthened software, copy and print, tech services, offset by weakness in big ticket items like business machines and furniture. Consumable categories like ink and paper comped in line with the house during the second quarter. And our efforts to drive core office supplies were successful with positive comps in the low-single digits.
Traffic in the North American stores was positive for the fourth straight quarter, up about 1% versus Q2 of last year. Average order size remained negative, and that was down about 1%.
North American Retail operating margin increased 5 basis points to 5.3% for the quarter. We improved product margins and saw a benefit from reduced depreciation, distribution and marketing expense. These improvements were offset somewhat by investments we're making in our growth initiatives.
On the technology side, we continue to see strong double-digit growth in our EasyTech and good progress with attachment selling. Computers comped in line with the house during the second quarter as we carefully managed the profitability of this category, while lapping mid single-digit comps for computers during Q2 of last year.
Our copy and print initiative was growing nicely as well. We've increased associate training, expanded our offering, improved our quality and put a sales force in place to drive copy and print business to our stores. All of these efforts helped to driving high single-digit copy and print comps during the second quarter.
We kicked our back-to-school in early July and we expect this year to be promotional just like every other year. To drive strong store traffic, we're offering our weekly circular coupons, more promotional deals as well as laptop and software bundles that help customers save on technology. We're working to increase awareness of technology products and services by offering $50 in rewards for trading an old computer for a new one, as well as free PC tune-ups. While several big back-to-school weeks are still ahead of us, we're pleased with our results and our in-store execution so far.
Customer service scores remain at all-time highs, as we benefit from our quality programs and copy and print and EasyTech, as well as the positive impact from our associate training programs.
During the second quarter, we opened two stores and closed two stores, ending Q2 with 1,888 stores in North America. We remain on track to open about 40 new stores in North America for the full year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike to talk about our international business.

Sales for the second quarter in international were $1.2 billion, a decrease of about 6% in U.S. dollars and a decrease of about 2% in local currency compared to the same period last year. Operating margin for the international business was 1.2%, an increase of 86 basis points from the same period in 2009. Supply chain improvements, lower amortization expense, better results in China, and lower marketing expense all helped the bottomline.
Our delivery business in Europe continues to rebound from the depths of the recession. We have positive year-over-year sales in local currency during the second quarter, despite a very soft May, when the European sovereign debt concerns were most pronounced. We saw growth in both June and July and look forward to a better second half. And operating margins improved by over 300 basis points, driven by improvements in logistics as well as reduced amortization and G&A expense.
We continue to make good progress on integrating our systems and back office functions. During the second quarter, SAP went live in our Irish business. And we're rolling out common applications for warehouse management and replenishment. We're achieving the synergies we expected in supply chain and indirect purchasing. We're also leveraging our global e-commerce and marketing expertise with a consistent staples.com look and feel across all of our major websites in Europe.
Our European delivery businesses are on a good trend, European retail has been a different story; with same store sales down 9% and weakness across all countries. This performance represents a 700 basis point improvement over Q1 in the two year trend, but we clearly need to make some changes in our marketing and merchandising tactics. To that end, we've initiated a complete review of our plans for the second half with the goal of getting comps turned around.
We have some excellent long term growth opportunities in European retail, copy center, text services, our customer loyalty program, and new store growth to name a few. But we're refocused on 2010 and putting new store openings until we see some improvement in our topline.
The Australian business had a flattish quarter, with growth in office products undercut by softness in promotional products and technology services. Operating income de-leveraged slightly on expenses associated with the SAP roll-out in New Zealand and other initiatives. We picked up several big contract wins in the quarter, including government business with New Zealand and the state of South Australia.
In China, our back-to-basics approach is beginning to bear fruit. We saw topline sales growth in seven quarter, this growth was powered by the Chinese economy and achieved in spite of our exit from unprofitable business. We're also making progress in improving our gross margins with the consolidation of our Chinese buy-in from four regions to one central function that our pricing discipline and eliminations of unprofitable SKUs.
South America continues to post strong growth and improved operating margins. The printing systems division achieved flattish sales growth with strong sequential improvement in topline. The market remains tough for new printing, but our order intake continues to improve. Operating margins were better by about 100 basis points. And we remain confident and we'll breakeven during the back half of the year, providing a decent upside as we (flap) our restructuring efforts from 2009.
Also during the second quarter, we made further progress on our overall priorities for Staples International; people, portfolio and profitability. We recently added two strong players to our China team, Anders Kristiansen an industry veteran who most recently ran Lyreco's Asia-Pacific business will join us as president of Staples China next month. We also hired Noah Herschman who brings 20 years of merchandising experience, including time with Amazon in the U.S. and China as our chief merchant in Shanghai.
During Q2, we made two key acquisitions that build on our portfolio. We acquired Corporate Express, the deal included a 59% stake in Corporate Express Australia. During the second quarter, we increased our interest in the business to more that 98% and we expect to acquire the remaining shares that we don't currently own over the coming weeks. Having a 100% ownership of this business will allow us to address the Australian market more effectively especially with respect to the Staples brand.
We're also building scale in our profitable Nordics region. A few weeks ago we announced the acquisition of Lindell the leading Finnish office supply company. Prior to the acquisition, we had an alliance with them to serve our global contract customer in Finland. With this acquisition, we're not only expanding in an important market in our European portfolio, we're also adding a strong leader in Bo Nyman, CEO of Lindell and we look forward to accelerating the growth of this business.
Now I'd like to turn it over to John to review our financials.

34740,111665068,75480,"Staples, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 19, 2010",2010-08-19,"Earnings Calls","Staples, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike, good morning, everybody. The second quarter total sales were flat versus last year at $5.5 billion.

The second quarter total sales were flat versus last year at $5.5 billion. The foreign exchange impact was neutral during the quarter as weakness in the euro and pound were offset by strength in the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar. Our second quarter GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis increased 38% to $0.18 versus the second quarter of 2009.
During Q2, the company recorded pretax integration and restructuring expense of $22 million or $0.02 per diluted share, excluding these costs as well as the $30 million of pretax integration and restructuring expense that we incurred in the second quarter of 2009, adjusted earnings per share increased 25% to $0.20 versus $0.16 during Q2 of last year.
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 37.5% compared to 34.5% last year. This change relates to the expiration in this year of provisions in the IRS tax code, regulating the way we report international income on our U.S. tax returns, which we discussed during our Q1 earnings call. As a result of our tax expense for the second quarter, it was about $6 million higher than it would have been for the 34.5% tax rate.
Gross profit margin improved by 69 basis points to 26.4% during Q2. This reflects stronger product margins driven by increased vendor support as well as efficiencies in delivery and distribution expense. SG&A leveraged 7 basis points versus last year's second quarter to 20.9% of sales. This was driven by a reduction in depreciation expense as a result of lower capital expenditures last year.
Earlier this year, we made changes to our equity compensation plan and removed and accelerated adjusting benefit for associates under the age of 65. This change is one of the benefits from the previously announced $5 billion stock option derivative litigation settlement throughout the majority of the $19 million year-over-year improvement in equity compensation expense. We expect equity compensation expense for the back half of 2010 to be in line with the back half of 2009.
Adjusted operating margin, excluding integration and restructuring expense, increased 97 basis points during the second quarter to 5.2% compared with Q2 2009. Year-to-date capital expenditures came in at $151 million compared to $130 million that we spent on capital during the same period last year. With year-to-date operating cash flow of $245 million, we've generated $95 million in free cash flow during the first half of the year.
We remain on track to spend about $450 million on capital expenditures this year, as we invest in growth initiatives, new stores, remodeled systems and the integration of our distribution networks in North America and Europe. And we'll generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow for the full year.
During the second quarter, we spent about $400 million on the purchase of additional shares of Corporate Express Australia, as well as our acquisition of Lindell in Finland. We also ramped up our inventory for back-to-school and resumed our share repurchase program under which we bought back 5.1 million shares for $102 million.
With $872 million of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet and available lines of credit of more than $1.3 billion, our liquidity position remains very strong. At the end of Q2, we had 731 million shares outstanding. This reflects about 1 million share increase compared to the 730 million shares outstanding at the end of Q1, as our repurchase activity somewhat offset our annual restricted stock grant to associates which took place in early July.
Turning to guidance for the current quarter and the full year, we expect total company sales to increase in the low-single digits versus 2009, as year-over-year comparisons get tougher throughout the back half of 2010. During the third quarter, we'll anniversary a 500 basis point improvement in the sequential comp trend from Q2 to Q3 of last year in North American Retail and a 200 basis point improvement in the sequential topline trend of the North American Delivery.
During last quarter's call, we provided full year earnings guidance based on the expectation that Congress would extend certain expired provisions in the IRS tax code and that our full year tax rate would return to 34.5%. However, the extenders still haven't passed. And while there's still a chance that they may pass during the back half of the year, we're now planning for our tax rate to be 37.5% for 2010.
Without trying to explain all the complexities of our international tax structure, I thought it'd be helpful to give a little more detail on our tax planning. For the purchase of Corporate Express in 2008, we added a substantial number of foreign entities to our structure. Both companies rely on the so called check-the-box provision for the law to allow cash to flow freely among all wholly-owned entities.
We were not able to rely on this rule without impacting our efforts to buy the remaining shares of Corporate Express, governed by the Dutch legal system. We relied instead on a temporary provision of tax law that was expected to be extended by Congress, but to date has not been. As a result, we've now adopted a structure that we expect to allow us to return to a 34.5% tax rate in 2011, assuming no other changes in the tax laws.
The increase in the tax rate equates to about $0.06 earnings per diluted share for the full year. We also anticipate a combined benefit of about $0.02 of earnings per diluted share from our increased ownership in Corporate Express Australia and our share repurchase program. As a result, we now expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding integration and restructuring expense, to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.29 for the full year and in the range of $0.39 to $0.41 for the third quarter.
We expect depreciation expense to be $120 million to $130 million in the third quarter and $480 million to $490 million for the full year, amortization expense to be about $15 million to $20 million in the third quarter and $65 million to $70 million for the full year, integration and restructuring expense to be approximately $10 million in the third quarter and $55 million to $60 million for the full year, and net interest expense to be $50 million to $55 million in the third quarter and $215 million to $220 million for the full year.
Thanks for your time this morning. And now, I'll turn it back over to Josh for Q&A…

So I think it's one that we manage very, very carefully going forward, and have been over the past year or so. It's a little hard, Chris for us to kind of investing in the technology category, so we're growing it as we're expanding it.

And I think that suggests at least to me that it's as much related to what we're doing or not doing as it is to the European economy. Frankly, our trends in the stronger markets in Europe, like Germany, are not any better than our trends in the most challenged markets like Portugal.
So again, suggests that we can look to ourselves for improvement. The weakest part of our business is in the technology space there. So of that is the result of our conscious decision to deemphasize price item technology offers that were driving a little bit of sales, but not much profitability.
We're trying to refocus our traffic driving efforts in the supplies area. In the U.S. we've used case paper very successfully to drive a business customer into our stores. And we think we've got the same opportunity in Europe.
In general, what we're doing in the second half of the year is looking to change our tactics around promotion and pricing, probably invest a little bit more in some of tried and true tactics from the past. And then in the long term, I think our expectation is that we'll be able to drive some of the same businesses that have helped make the North American business so successful, namely the copy center business, tech Services business, use of loyalty program more effectively than we have there so far.
And ultimately, get after new store growth there. We've had good improvement over the last several years in our operating margins in Europe. So that the stores there with decent sales are profitable, but obviously with a negative 9% comp, that goes right up the window.
So our focus is on getting that business back to positive comps from the second half of the year.

As you know, we have debt repayments over the next several years, $500 million next year, and then $325 million in 2012 plus the $1.5 billion that's due in '14.
So I think we have to be aware of meeting those capital needs as we think about things like share buybacks, although, we felt very comfortable making the acquisitions of the remaining interest in Australia, and making the deal in Finland. So our priorities remain intact.
Our first priority is to invest in the business. We want to make sure that we maintain great flexibility to be able to do the kinds of things that we've been able to do. We also want to make sure that any excess cash that we have we are able to return both in the form of dividends and in share buybacks.
You heard that we bought about five million shares back this quarter. I think that reflects that the process that we have which is to buyback regularly in the market. By a little bit more when the stock is lower. Unfortunately, that's been the case recently. So I would expect to see similar trends as we move through the rest of the year.

So it strikes me that most of the issue is the result of either our programs or what we were doing a year ago.
As I said, we're 700 basis points better in the second quarter on a two year basis than we were in Q1, but with a negative nine top, you're certainly not going to get very excited about that. So I think we're very focused on addressing the issues. They are a little different country by country. But particularly in the U.K. and Germany, which are two biggest retail markets over there, in terms of the number of stores, we've got businesses that seem to respond in much the same way that our U.S. and Canadian businesses respond. That gives me some confidence that the tactics that have worked to help us gain share here, we'll be successful over there and as you can imagine we're moving with as much speed as possible to get those implemented in the second half.

We continue to get hurt with sales from existing accounts, but that negative has been improved slightly sequentially here in this quarter. So it's getting better.
As far as opportunities, we continue to drive for market share growth. We clearly believe we have a great lowest-cost delivery model in place that continues to drive market share gains, both in the mid-market as well as in the large account sector.
And as far as U.S. community is concerned, we're going to go aggressively after that business. As you probably know, we felt that the U.S. community agreement was in direct conflict with some existing agreements that we have that are out there today, generating close to $200 million of business for us in that space.

I think you said low-single digit sales growth for the year, but you're flat this quarter. So seems like that things have to get a little bit better in the back half from where they were in the second quarter, but you don't expect that recovery. So if you can help us flush out what's contemplated in that, particularly as comparisons get harder.
And then just numerically, on the full year guidance, I think if you adjusted the tax rate, you raised your guidance by $0.04. You said $0.02 from lower share count and Corporate Express Australia. So where is the other $0.02 coming from? Is that from better margins?

What we're saying is that we're not seeing any huge change in the tone of the business, but the steady improvements we're seeing, that is something we expect for the rest of the year.
With respect of the earnings per share, the tax hit is worth about $0.06. We had about $0.02 of benefit from the combination of the share buyback program and the additional earnings that we get from acquiring the remaining piece of Australia. So that's the reason that the range that we had before comes down by $0.04.

And so the biggest component affecting our share count is the restricted stock that gets issued that goes into the account. And that we believe will be offset the share buybacks that we've done. The remaining part, as you know, is the impact of using the treasury stocks on option price. And obviously, we can sense somewhat on what the share price does, but making reasonable assumptions about the share price, we will be about neutral.
As far as gross margin is concerned, it gets harder these days to talk about gross margin with all the moving parts because you have everything that's going on internationally combined with the integration impact of Corporate Express and NAD along with changes in mix that are coming in our U.S retail business. So without going on and on forever, we look really hard at each one of those businesses for ways to improve it.
We see improvements in supply chain across the board that have helped improve gross margins, that we've seen continued improvement in buying, somewhat as a result of Corporate Express, but also as a result of the investments the vendors have made in driving sales through Staples where they've had better success than maybe some other places.
And then in the internationally business, you got the combined effect of some of the buying benefits; they're kicking in more in Europe this year, as with farther down the road in integration. As well as some good disciplines that are taking place in the contract business in Europe that'll allow us to improve margins. So for us, we believe that our internal operations and focus on execution is really what's driving our gross margin improvement, and I think I can speak for the rest of the industry.
Dan, on U.S. communities; first, we've got two relationships out there today. One that JPA, which is a Staples relationships and wanted IPA which is former CE relationship and those two generate for us, I'd say close to $200 million business. The U.S. community's agreement, as one of our competitors I think said onerous, would've required us to be exclusive with them for one to participate in that. We decided not to do that. However, those customers that are out there today under U.S. communities contract are we feel fair game to after their business. And we are going to aggressively go after their business utilizing our other agreements.
So, that's what I meant by still going after of the U.S. communities business, it's their customers that we're going after.

Whether it's people, whether it's margin improvement, whether it's scale, whether it's the ability to run our distribution network better, whether it's customer service capabilities, I mean it's really been a great acquisition that has been integrated very smoothly.
I think it's safe to say that in North America, we're probably 80% of the way there in terms of synergy captures. But for the next several years we've got some work to do in terms of integrating and rationalizing the backend distribution and the supply chain. And that's going to provide more upside.
I don't want to be too specific, as we are not even tracking synergies that way anymore. But I would say, we are far along in North America. And then in Europe, I think we are probably maybe a third of the way there in terms of where we are ultimately going to be. And I think you will see European profitability improve throughout the year and throughout next year.
So obviously the big one was in North America; that's where the most of the synergies were, because that's where we had the overlap in the contract business. In Europe we've got a contract business on top of a retail and a catalogue business; so probably not nearly as much synergy there. But in general, we'll capture every bit of those synergies that we talked about during the acquisition and more.

So I was wondering maybe if Demos could speak to how the new store, the productivity is with new openings, and kind of how you feel about that. And how we should kind of think about the new store growth for the year of 40, how that should lay out for the second half?

Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to report strong earnings growth for the second quarter.

I'm pleased to report strong earnings growth for the second quarter. Our operations are solid, our growth initiatives are gaining traction and we're delivering good earnings performance despite soft top line trends. Compared to last year, total company sales were flat at $5.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share increased 25% to $0.20. 
Our North American Delivery grew the top line by 2%. North American Retail also grew sales by 2% and had flat same-store sales, which was a 200 basis point improvement in our two-year comp trend. And our International business declined 6% in U.S. dollars but only 2% in local currency. On the bottom line, we expanded operating margin in all three of our businesses for the second consecutive quarter.
Our view of the business for the back half of 2010 remains unchanged. We expect to see a modest recovery in the economy and unemployment to remain high. We'll continue to drive the top line by investing in key growth initiatives, areas like facilities and breakroom supplies, business technology and Copy & Print, where we're already seeing positive signs. And we'll accomplish important milestones on the Corporate Express integration, particularly in the areas of supply chain systems.
Turning to our business units, starting with North American Delivery. Sales for the second quarter were $2.4 billion, an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars or 1% in local currency compared to Q2 of 2009. In Staples Business Delivery, we grew the top line in the mid-single digits, in Contract sales grew in the low-single digits and Quill's top line improved versus last quarter, with declines in the low-single digits.
Core Office Supplies and business technology were strong during the second quarter, while Durables like business machines and furniture remained weaker than the House. The pricing environment contract remains rational, and during the second quarter customer acquisition and retention in our Contract business was strong. Sales from new customers drove top line improvement in the high-single digits. This was offset by lower spend from existing customers.
We're seeing good trends in the Facilities and Breakroom category, a growing percentage of customers have started to think of Staples for more than just office supply, particularly in Contract, where we've had some recent wins with large customers, who previously came to us for only their core supplies. 
Our expanded assortment, better training for our sales associates, sharper pricing and increased marketing efforts drove top line growth in this category during the second quarter despite difficult comparisons from sales of H1N1-related products last year.
NAD operating margin increased 79 basis points to 8.7% compared to the same period last year. Better buying, a more favorable mix of discretionary products and lower amortization expense, all contributed to this improvement. 
We continue to increase our average order size. For Q2 average order in Contract was just under $206, which was an increase of almost $8 compared to Q2 of 2009. We also reduced the percentage of small orders $150 by a couple of hundred basis points compared to last year.
The integration of our supply chain is a multi-year project and includes development of common back-end systems as well as physical integration of our networks. Systems work is complete, and we're now making great progress with integrating the physical network. 
During the second quarter, we closed two fulfillment centers. We upgraded 10 facilities with the capability to serve both Staples and legacy Corporate Express customers. The scope of our integration also includes our last-mile delivery hubs, and we consolidated over 30 of these locations during the first half of 2010 and approximately 35 more are in the works. 
This year we've taken out more infrastructure projects than in any other time in Staples history. Despite the additional complexity and resources required, the team has done an excellent job executing these projects, while maintaining great customer service.
Moving on to North American Retail. Sales for the second quarter were $2.0 billion, an increase of 2% in U.S. dollar or flat in local currency compared to Q2 of 2009. Second quarter same-store sales were flat with strength in software, Copy & Print, Tech Services offset by weakness in big-ticket items like business machines and furniture. Consumable categories like Ink and Paper comp in line with The House during the second quarter. And our efforts to drive core Office Supplies were successful with positive comps in the low-single digits.
Traffic in our North American stores was positive for the fourth straight quarter, up about 1% versus Q2 of last year. Average order size remain negative, and that was down about 1%. North American Retail operating margin increased five basis points to 5.3% for the quarter. We improved product margins and saw a benefit from reduced depreciation, distribution and marketing expense. These improvements were offset somewhat by investments we're making in our growth initiatives. On the technology side, we continue to see strong double-digit growth in our EasyTech and good progress with attachment selling.
Computers comped in line with the House during the second quarter as we carefully managed the profitability of these category, while lapping mid single-digit comps for Computers during Q2 of last year. Our Copy & Print initiative is growing nicely as well. We've increased social training, expanded our offering, improved our quality and put a sales force in place to drive Copy & Print business to our stores. All of these efforts helped to drive high single-digit Copy & Print comps during the second quarter. 
We kicked off back-to-school in early July, and we expect this year to be promotional, just like every other year. To drive strong store traffic, we're operating more, weekly, circular coupons, more promotional deals as well as laptop and software bundles to help customers save on technology. We're working to increase awareness of technology products and services by offering $50 in rewards for trading an old computer for a new one, as well as free PC tune-ups.
While several big back-to-school weeks are still ahead of us, we're pleased with our results and our in-store execution so far. Customer service scores  remain at all-time high as we benefit from our quality programs in Copy & Print and EasyTech as well as the positive impact from our social training programs. 
During the second quarter, we opened two stores and closed two stores, ending Q2 with 1,888 stores in North America. We remain on track to open about 40 new stores in North America for the full year.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike to talk about our International business."

Sales for the second quarter in International were $1.2 billion, a decrease of about 6% in U.S. dollars and a decrease of about 2% in local currency compared to the same period last year. Operating margin for the International business was 1.2%, an increase of 86 basis points from the same period in 2009. Supply chain improvements, lower amortization expense, better results in China and lower marketing expense all helped the bottom line.
Our Delivery business in Europe continues to rebound from the depths of the recession. We have positive year-over-year sales in local currency during the second quarter despite a very soft May, when the European sovereign debt concerns were most pronounced. We saw growth in both June and July and look forward to a better second half. And operating margins improved by over 300 basis points driven by improvements in logistics as well as reduced amortization and G&A expense. 
We continue to make good progress on integrating our systems in back-office functions. During the second quarter, SAP went live on our Irish business and were rolling out common applications for warehouse management and replenishment. We're achieving the synergies we expected in supply chain and indirect purchasing. We're also leveraging our global e-commerce and marketing expertise, with a consistent staples.com look and feel across all of our major websites in Europe.
While the European Delivery businesses are in a good trend, European Retail has been a different story, with same-store sales down 9% and weakness across all countries. This performance represents a 700 basis point improvement over Q1 in the two-year trend, but we clearly need to make some changes in our marketing and merchandising tactics. To that end we've initiated a complete review of our plans for the second half with the goal of getting comps turned around. We have some excellent long-term growth opportunities in European Retail: copy center, tech services, our customer loyalty program and new store growth to name a few. But we're refocused on 2010 and putting new store openings on hold until we see some improvement in our top line.
The Australian business had a flattish quarter with growth in office products undercut by softness in promotional products and technology services. Operating income deleveraged slightly on expenses associated with the SAP rollout in New Zealand and other initiatives. We picked up several big contract wins in the quarter, including government business with New Zealand and the state of South Australia. 
In China, our back-to-basics approach is beginning to bear fruit. We saw top line sales growth for the first time in seven quarters. This growth was powered by the Chinese economy and achieved in spite of our exit from one profitable business. We're also making progress in improving our gross margins with the consolidation of our Chinese buying from four regions to one central function,  better pricing discipline and elimination of unprofitable SKUs.
South America continues to post strong growth and improved operating margins. The Printing Systems division achieved flattish sales growth, with strong sequential improvement in top line. The market remains tough for new printing presses, but our order intake continues to improve. Operating margins were better by about 100 basis points, and we remain confident that we'll break even during the back half of the year, providing a decent  upside as we lap our restructuring efforts from 2009.
Also during the second quarter we made further progress on our overall priorities for Staples International: people, portfolio and profitability. We recently added two strong players to our China team, Anders Kristiansen, an industry veteran who most recently ran Lyreco's Asia-Pacific business, will join us as President of Staples China next month. We also hired Noah Herschman who brings 20 years of merchandising experience, including time with Amazon in the U.S. and China as our Chief Merchant in Shanghai. 
During Q2, we made two key acquisitions that build on our portfolio. When we acquired Corporate Express back in 2008, the deal included a 59% stake in Corporate Express Australia. During the second quarter, we increased our interest in the business to more than 98%, and we expect to acquire the remaining shares that we don't currently own over the coming weeks. Having 100% ownership of this business, will allow us to address the Australian market more effectively, especially with respect to the Staples brand. 
We're also building scale in our profitable Nordics region. A few weeks ago we announced the acquisition of Lindell the leading Finnish office-supply company. Prior to the acquisition, we had an alliance with them to serve our global Contract customers in Finland. With this acquisition, we're not only expanding in an important market in our European portfolio, we're also adding a strong leader in Bo Nyman, the CEO of Lindell. And we look forward to accelerating the growth of this business.  Now I'd like to turn it over to John to review our financials."
34740,111665068,75617,"Staples, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 19, 2010",2010-08-19,"Earnings Calls","Staples, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everybody. The second quarter total sales were flat versus last year at $5.5 billion.

The second quarter total sales were flat versus last year at $5.5 billion. The foreign exchange impact was neutral during the quarter, as weakness in the euro and pound were offset by strength in the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar. 
Our second quarter GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis increased 38% to $0.18 versus the second quarter of 2009. During Q2, the company recorded pretax integration restructuring expense of $22 million or $0.02 per diluted share. Excluding these costs, as well as the $30 million of pretax integration restructuring expense that we incurred during the second quarter of 2009, adjusted earnings per share increased 25% to $0.20 versus $0.16 during the Q2 of last year. 
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 37.5% compared to 34.5% last year. This change relates for the expiration this year of provisions in the IRS tax code, regulating the way we report international income on our U.S. tax return, which we discussed during our Q1 earnings call.  As a result of -- our tax expense for the second quarter was about $6 million higher than it would have been in the 34.5% tax rate. 
Gross profit margin improved by 69 basis points to 26.4% during Q2. This reflects the stronger product margins driven by increased vendor support as well as efficiencies in delivery and distribution expense. 
SG&A leveraged seven basis points versus last year's second quarter to 20.9% of sales. This was driven by a reduction and depreciation expense, as a result of lower capital expenditures last year. 
Earlier this year, we made changes to our equity compensation plan and removed and accelerated the vesting benefit for associates under the age of 65. This change, as well as the benefit from the previously announced $5 billion stock option derivative litigation settlement, drove the majority of the $19 million year-over-year improvement in equity compensation expense. We expect equity compensation expense for the back half of 2010 to be in line with the back half of 2009. 
Adjusted operating margin, excluding integration and restructuring expense, increased 97 basis points during the second quarter to 5.2% compared with Q2 2009. Year-to-date capital expenditures came in at $151 million compared to $130 million that we spent on capital during the same period last year. 
With year-to-date operating cash flow of $245 million, we've generated $95 million in free cash flow during the first half of the year. We remain on track to spend about $450 million on capital expenditures this year, as we invest in growth initiatives, new stores, remodel, systems and the integration of our distribution networks in North America and Europe. And we'll generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow for the full year.
During the second quarter, we spent about $400 million on the purchase of additional shares of Corporate Express Australia as well as our acquisition of Lindell in Finland. We also ramped up our inventory for back-to-school and resumed our share repurchase program, under which we bought back 5.1 million shares for $102 million. 
With $872 million of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet and available lines of credit of more than $1.3 billion, our liquidity position remains very strong. At the end of Q2, we had 731 million shares outstanding. This reflects about 1 million share increase compared to the 730 million shares outstanding at the end of Q1 as our repurchase activity somewhat offset our annual restricted stock grant to associates, which took place in early July.
Turning to guidance for the current quarter and the full year. We expect total company sales to increase in the low-single digits versus 2009, as year-over-year comparisons get tougher throughout the back half of 2010. During the third quarter, we'll anniversary a 500 basis point improvement in the sequential comp trend from Q2 to Q3 of last year in North American Retail and a 200 basis point improvement in the sequential top line trend to North American Delivery.
During last quarter's call, we provided full-year earnings guidance based on the expectation that Congress would extend certain expired provisions in the IRS tax code, and that our full year tax rate would return to 34.5%. However, the extenders still haven't passed, and while there's still a chance that they may pass during the back half of the year, we're now planning for our tax rate to be 37.5% for 2010. 
Without trying to explain all the complexities of our International tax structure, I thought it'd be helpful to give a little more detail on our tax planning. With the purchase of Corporate Express in 2008, we added a substantial number of foreign entities our structure. Most companies rely on the so called check-the-box provisions of the law to allow cash to flow freely among all wholly owned entities. We were not able to rely on this rule without impacting our efforts to buy the remaining shares of Corporate Express governed by the Dutch legal system. We relied instead on a temporary provision of tax law that was expected to be extended by Congress but to date has not been. As a result we have now adopted the structure that we expect will allow us to return to a 34.5% tax rate in 2011, assuming no other changes in the tax laws. 
The increase in the tax rate equates to about $0.06 per earnings per diluted share for the full year. We also anticipated combined benefit of about $0.02 of earnings per diluted share from our increased ownership with Corporate Express Australia and our share repurchase program. As a result, we now expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding integration and restructuring expense to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.29 to the full year and in the range of $0.39 to $0.41 for the third quarter.
We expect depreciation expense to be $120 million to $130 million on the third quarter and $480 million to $490 million for the full year, amortization expense to be about $15 million to $20 million in the third quarter and $65 million to $70 million for the full year, integration and restructuring expense to be approximately $10 million in the third quarter and $55 million to $60 million for the full year and net interest expense to be $50 million to $55 million in the third quarter and $215 million  to $220 million for the full year.

In terms of supply, we are in good shape. We're pleased with where we stand today, so I don't know about the next few months as far as that is concerned. So I think it's one that we manage very, very carefully going forward and have been over the past year or so."

Gary, to your point, the European Retail business is really on a different trend from the rest of our business in Europe. And, I think that suggests, at least to me, that it's as much related to what we're doing or not doing as it is to the European economy. Frankly, our trends in the stronger markets in Europe like Germany are not any better than our trends in the most challenged markets like Portugal, so again suggests that we can look to our ourselves for improvement. The weakest part of our business is in technology space there. Some of that is the result of our conscious decision to de-emphasize price item technology offers that we're driving a little bit of sales but not much profitability. We're trying to refocus our traffic-driving efforts in the supplies area. In the U.S. we've used case paper very successfully to drive a business customer into our stores. And we think we've got the same opportunity in Europe. In general, what we're doing in the second half of the year is looking to change our tactics around promotion and pricing, probably invest a little bit more in some of our tried and true tactics from the past. And then in the long term, I think our expectation is that we'll be able to drive some of the same businesses that have helped make the North American business so successful, namely the Copy Center business, Tech Services business. Use a loyalty program more effectively than we have there so far, and ultimately, get after new store growth there. We've had good improvement over the last several years in our operating margins in Europe so that the stores there with decent sales are profitable, but obviously, with the negative 9% comp that goes right out the window. So our focus is on getting that business back to positive comps in the second half of the year."

So our priorities remain intact. Our first priority is to invest in the business. We want to make sure that we maintain great flexibility to be able to do the kinds of things that we've been able to do. We also want to make sure that any excess cash that we have, we are able to return both in the form of dividends and share buybacks. You heard that we bought about 5 million shares back this quarter.

So I think we're very focused on addressing the issues. They are a little different country by country, but particularly, in the U.K. and Germany, which are our two biggest retail markets over there, in terms of the number of stores, we've got businesses that seem to respond in much the same way that our U.S. and Canadian businesses respond, and that gives me some confidence that the tactics that have worked to help us gain share here will be successful over there.

We do issue our equity in July. And so the biggest component affecting our share count is the restricted stock that gets issued that goes into the account, and that, we believe, will be offset by the share buybacks that we've done. The remaining part as you know is the impact of using the treasury stock on option pricing, and obviously depends somewhat on what the share price does. But making reasonable assumptions about the share price, we assume that will be about neutral. I guess as far as gross margin is concerned, it gets harder these days to talk about the gross margin with all the moving parts because you have everything that's going on internationally combined with the integration impact of Corporate Express in NAD along with changes in mix that are coming in our U.S. Retail business. So without going on and on forever, we look really hard at each one of those businesses for ways to improve it. We see improvements in supply chain across the board that have helped improve gross margins. So we'll be seeing continued improvement in buying somewhat as a result of Corporate Express, but also as a result of some of the investments that vendors have made in driving sales through Staples where they have better success and maybe some other places. And then in the International business, you've got the combined effect of some of the buying benefits. They're kicking in more in Europe this year as we've gotten farther down the road in integration. As well as some good disciplines that are taking place in the Contract business in Europe that allow us to improve margin. So for us, we believe that our internal operations and focus on execution is really what's driving our gross margin improvement. And I guess, I can't speak for the industry."

The headline is the Corporate Express acquisition has been a home run for the company. Whether its people, whether its margin improvement, whether its scale, whether its ability to run our distribution network better, whether its customer service capabilities, I mean it's really been a great acquisition that has been integrated very smoothly. I think it's safe to say that in North America, we're probably 80% of the way there in terms of synergy captures. But for the next several years, I mean we've got some work to do in terms of integrating and rationalizing the back end distribution and supply chain. And that's going to provide more upside. I don't want to be too specific because we're not even tracking synergies that way anymore. But I'd say we're pretty far along in North America. And then in Europe, I think we're probably maybe a third of the way there in terms of where we're ultimately going to be. And I think you'll see European profitability improve throughout the year and throughout next year. So obviously the big win was in North America that's where most of the synergies were because that's where we had the overlap in the Contract business. In Europe we've got a Contract business on top of our Retail and the Catalog business. So probably not nearly as much synergy there. But in general, we'll capture every bit of those synergies that we talked about during the acquisition and more."

That said, I think we're very excited about China and Brazil. Australia, in many ways, benefits from the growth in Asia, and so that's been the rationale behind our foreign investment down there. And ultimately, I think India could be a good market for us as well. We don't talk about it much but we've had good growth in both the Delivery and Retail businesses in India this year, and they're progressing nicely on their profit plan to a point that we'll be very happy with that business as well. We've not got a significant presence in Russia at this stage. There's a lot on our plates right now but it's obviously a market that we're keeping an eye on.

Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to report strong earnings growth for the second quarter. Our operations are solid, our growth initiatives are gaining traction and we're delivering good earnings performa",1101,"Thanks Laurel, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to report strong earnings growth for the second quarter. Our operations are solid, our growth initiatives are gaining traction and we're delivering good earnings performance despite soft top line trends. Compared to last year, total company sales were flat at $5.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share increased 25% to $0.20. 
Our North American Delivery grew the top line by 2%. North American Retail also grew sales by 2% and had flat same-store sales, which was a 200 basis point improvement in our two-year comp trend. And our International business declined 6% in U.S. dollars but only 2% in local currency. On the bottom line, we expanded operating margin in all three of our businesses for the second consecutive quarter.
Our view of the business for the back half of 2010 remains unchanged. We expect to see a modest recovery in the economy and unemployment to remain high. We'll continue to drive the top line by investing in key growth initiatives, areas like facilities and breakroom supplies, business technology and Copy & Print, where we're already seeing positive signs. And we'll accomplish important milestones on the Corporate Express integration, particularly in the areas of supply chain systems.
Turning to our business units, starting with North American Delivery. Sales for the second quarter were $2.4 billion, an increase of 2% in U.S. dollars or 1% in local currency compared to Q2 of 2009. In Staples Business Delivery, we grew the top line in the mid-single digits, in Contract sales grew in the low-single digits and Quill's top line improved versus last quarter, with declines in the low-single digits.
Core Office Supplies and business technology were strong during the second quarter, while Durables like business machines and furniture remained weaker than the House. The pricing environment contract remains rational, and during the second quarter customer acquisition and retention in our Contract business was strong. Sales from new customers drove top line improvement in the high-single digits. This was offset by lower spend from existing customers.
We're seeing good trends in the Facilities and Breakroom category, a growing percentage of customers have started to think of Staples for more than just office supply, particularly in Contract, where we've had some recent wins with large customers, who previously came to us for only their core supplies. 
Our expanded assortment, better training for our sales associates, sharper pricing and increased marketing efforts drove top line growth in this category during the second quarter despite difficult comparisons from sales of H1N1-related products last year.
NAD operating margin increased 79 basis points to 8.7% compared to the same period last year. Better buying, a more favorable mix of discretionary products and lower amortization expense, all contributed to this improvement. 
We continue to increase our average order size. For Q2 average order in Contract was just under $206, which was an increase of almost $8 compared to Q2 of 2009. We also reduced the percentage of small orders $150 by a couple of hundred basis points compared to last year.
The integration of our supply chain is a multi-year project and includes development of common back-end systems as well as physical integration of our networks. Systems work is complete, and we're now making great progress with integrating the physical network. 
During the second quarter, we closed two fulfillment centers. We upgraded 10 facilities with the capability to serve both Staples and legacy Corporate Express customers. The scope of our integration also includes our last-mile delivery hubs, and we consolidated over 30 of these locations during the first half of 2010 and approximately 35 more are in the works. 
This year we've taken out more infrastructure projects than in any other time in Staples history. Despite the additional complexity and resources required, the team has done an excellent job executing these projects, while maintaining great customer service.
Moving on to North American Retail. Sales for the second quarter were $2.0 billion, an increase of 2% in U.S. dollar or flat in local currency compared to Q2 of 2009. Second quarter same-store sales were flat with strength in software, Copy & Print, Tech Services offset by weakness in big-ticket items like business machines and furniture. Consumable categories like Ink and Paper comp in line with The House during the second quarter. And our efforts to drive core Office Supplies were successful with positive comps in the low-single digits.
Traffic in our North American stores was positive for the fourth straight quarter, up about 1% versus Q2 of last year. Average order size remain negative, and that was down about 1%. North American Retail operating margin increased five basis points to 5.3% for the quarter. We improved product margins and saw a benefit from reduced depreciation, distribution and marketing expense. These improvements were offset somewhat by investments we're making in our growth initiatives. On the technology side, we continue to see strong double-digit growth in our EasyTech and good progress with attachment selling.
Computers comped in line with the House during the second quarter as we carefully managed the profitability of these category, while lapping mid single-digit comps for Computers during Q2 of last year. Our Copy & Print initiative is growing nicely as well. We've increased social training, expanded our offering, improved our quality and put a sales force in place to drive Copy & Print business to our stores. All of these efforts helped to drive high single-digit Copy & Print comps during the second quarter. 
We kicked off back-to-school in early July, and we expect this year to be promotional, just like every other year. To drive strong store traffic, we're operating more, weekly, circular coupons, more promotional deals as well as laptop and software bundles to help customers save on technology. We're working to increase awareness of technology products and services by offering $50 in rewards for trading an old computer for a new one, as well as free PC tune-ups.
While several big back-to-school weeks are still ahead of us, we're pleased with our results and our in-store execution so far. Customer service scores  remain at all-time high as we benefit from our quality programs in Copy & Print and EasyTech as well as the positive impact from our social training programs. 
During the second quarter, we opened two stores and closed two stores, ending Q2 with 1,888 stores in North America. We remain on track to open about 40 new stores in North America for the full year.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike to talk about our International business."

Sales for the second quarter in International were $1.2 billion, a decrease of about 6% in U.S. dollars and a decrease of about 2% in local currency compared to the same period last year. Operating margin for the International business was 1.2%, an increase of 86 basis points from the same period in 2009. Supply chain improvements, lower amortization expense, better results in China and lower marketing expense all helped the bottom line.
Our Delivery business in Europe continues to rebound from the depths of the recession. We have positive year-over-year sales in local currency during the second quarter despite a very soft May, when the European sovereign debt concerns were most pronounced. We saw a growth in both June and July and look forward to a better second half. And operating margins improved by over 300 basis points driven by improvements in logistics as well as reduced amortization and G&A expense. 
We continue to make good progress on integrating our systems in back-office functions. During the second quarter, SAP went live on our Irish business and we're rolling out common applications for warehouse management and replenishment. We're achieving the synergies we expected in supply chain and indirect purchasing. We're also leveraging our global e-commerce and marketing expertise, with a consistent staples.com look and feel across all of our major websites in Europe.
While our European Delivery businesses are in a good trend, European Retail has been a different story, with same-store sales down 9% and weakness across all countries. This performance represents a 700 basis point improvement over Q1 in the two-year trend, but we clearly need to make some changes in our marketing and merchandising tactics. To that end we've initiated a complete review of our plans for the second half with the goal of getting comps turned around. We have some excellent long-term growth opportunities in European Retail: copy center, tech services, our customer loyalty program and new store growth to name a few. But we're refocused on 2010 and putting new store openings on hold until we see some improvement in our top line.
The Australian business had a flattish quarter with growth in office products undercut by softness in promotional products and technology services. Operating income deleveraged slightly on expenses associated with the SAP rollout in New Zealand and other initiatives. We picked up several big contract wins in the quarter, including government business with New Zealand and the state of South Australia. 
In China, our back-to-basics approach is beginning to bear a fruit. We saw a top line sales growth for the first time in seven quarters. This growth was powered by the Chinese economy and achieved in spite of our exit from one profitable business. We're also making progress in improving our gross margins with the consolidation of our Chinese buying from four regions to one central function, better pricing discipline and elimination of unprofitable SKUs.
South America continues to post strong growth and improved operating margins. The Printing Systems division achieved flattish sales growth, with strong sequential improvement in top line. The market remains tough for new printing presses, but our order intake continues to improve. Operating margins were better by about 100 basis points, and we remain confident that we'll break even during the back half of the year, providing a decent upside as we lap our restructuring efforts from 2009.
Also during the second quarter we made further progress on our overall priorities for Staples International: people, portfolio and profitability. We recently added two strong players to our China team, Anders Kristiansen, an industry veteran who most recently ran Lyreco's Asia-Pacific business, will join us as President of Staples China next month. We also hired Noah Herschman who brings 20 years of merchandising experience, including time with Amazon in the U.S. and China as our Chief Merchant in Shanghai. 
During Q2, we made two key acquisitions that build on our portfolio. When we acquired Corporate Express back in 2008, the deal included a 59% stake in Corporate Express Australia. During the second quarter, we increased our interest in the business to more than 98%, and we expect to acquire the remaining shares that we don't currently own over the coming weeks. Having 100% ownership of this business, will allow us to address the Australian market more effectively, especially with respect to the Staples brand. 
We're also building scale in our profitable Nordics region. A few weeks ago we announced the acquisition of Lindell the leading Finnish office-supply company. Prior to the acquisition, we had an alliance with them to serve our global Contract customers in Finland. With this acquisition, we're not only expanding in an important market in our European portfolio, we're also adding a strong leader in Bo Nyman, the CEO of Lindell. And we look forward to accelerating the growth of this business.  Now I'd like to turn it over to John to review our financials."
34740,111665068,75742,"Staples, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 19, 2010",2010-08-19,"Earnings Calls","Staples, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everybody. The second quarter total sales were flat versus last year at $5.5 billion.

The second quarter total sales were flat versus last year at $5.5 billion. The foreign exchange impact was neutral during the quarter, as weakness in the euro and pound were offset by strength in the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar. 
Our second quarter GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis increased 38% to $0.18 versus the second quarter of 2009. During Q2, the company recorded pretax integration restructuring expense of $22 million or $0.02 per diluted share. Excluding these costs, as well as the $30 million of pretax integration and restructuring expense that we incurred during the second quarter of 2009, adjusted earnings per share increased 25% to $0.20 versus $0.16 during the Q2 of last year. 
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 37.5% compared to 34.5% last year. This change relates for the expiration this year of provisions in the IRS tax code, regulating the way we report international income on our U.S. tax return, which we discussed during our Q1 earnings call.  As a result of -- our tax expense for the second quarter was about $6 million higher than it would have been in the 34.5% tax rate. 
Gross profit margin improved by 69 basis points to 26.4% during Q2. This reflects the stronger product margins driven by increased vendor support as well as efficiencies in delivery and distribution expense. 
SG&A leveraged seven basis points versus last year's second quarter to 20.9% of sales. This was driven by a reduction and depreciation expense, as a result of lower capital expenditures last year. 
Earlier this year, we made changes to our equity compensation plan and removed and accelerated the vesting benefit for associates under the age of 65. This change, as well as the benefit from the previously announced $5 billion stock option derivative litigation settlement, drove the majority of the $19 million year-over-year improvement in equity compensation expense. We expect equity compensation expense for the back half of 2010 to be in line with the back half of 2009. 
Adjusted operating margin, excluding integration and restructuring expense, increased 97 basis points during the second quarter to 5.2% compared with Q2 2009. Year-to-date capital expenditures came in at $151 million compared to $130 million that we spent on capital during the same period last year. 
With year-to-date operating cash flow of $245 million, we've generated $95 million in free cash flow during the first half of the year. We remain on track to spend about $450 million on capital expenditures this year, as we invest in growth initiatives, new stores, remodels, systems and the integration of our distribution networks in North America and Europe. And we'll generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow for the full year.
During the second quarter, we spent about $400 million on the purchase of additional shares of Corporate Express Australia as well as our acquisition of Lindell in Finland. We also ramped up our inventory for back-to-school and resumed our share repurchase program, under which we bought back 5.1 million shares for $102 million. 
With $872 million of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet and available lines of credit of more than $1.3 billion, our liquidity position remains very strong. At the end of Q2, we had 731 million shares outstanding. This reflects about 1 million share increase compared to the 730 million shares outstanding at the end of Q1 as our repurchase activity somewhat offset our annual restricted stock grant to associates, which took place in early July.
Turning to guidance for the current quarter and the full year. We expect total company sales to increase in the low-single digits versus 2009, as year-over-year comparisons get tougher throughout the back half of 2010. During the third quarter, we'll anniversary a 500 basis point improvement in the sequential comp trend from Q2 to Q3 of last year in North American Retail and a 200 basis point improvement in the sequential top line trend to North American Delivery.
During last quarter's call, we provided full-year earnings guidance based on the expectation that Congress would extend certain expired provisions in the IRS tax code, and that our full year tax rate would return to 34.5%. However, the extenders still haven't passed, and while there's still a chance that they may pass during the back half of the year, we're now planning for our tax rate to be 37.5% for 2010. 
Without trying to explain all the complexities of our International tax structure, I thought it'd be helpful to give a little more detail on our tax planning. With the purchase of Corporate Express in 2008, we added a substantial number of foreign entities to our structure. Most companies rely on the so called check-the-box provisions of the law to allow cash to flow freely among all wholly-owned entities. We were not able to rely on this rule without impacting our efforts to buy the remaining shares of Corporate Express governed by the Dutch legal system. We relied instead on a temporary provision of tax law that was expected to be extended by Congress but to date has not been. As a result we have now adopted the structure that we expect will allow us to return to a 34.5% tax rate in 2011, assuming no other changes in the tax laws. 
The increase in the tax rate equates to about $0.06 per earnings per diluted share for the full year. We also anticipated combined benefit of about $0.02 of earnings per diluted share from our increased ownership with Corporate Express Australia and our share repurchase program. As a result, we now expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding integration and restructuring expense to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.29 to the full year and in the range of $0.39 to $0.41 for the third quarter.
We expect depreciation expense to be $120 million to $130 million on the third quarter and $480 million to $490 million for the full year, amortization expense to be about $15 million to $20 million in the third quarter and $65 million to $70 million for the full year, integration and restructuring expense to be approximately $10 million in the third quarter and $55 million to $60 million for the full year and net interest expense to be $50 million to $55 million in the third quarter and $215 million  to $220 million for the full year.

And, I think that suggests, at least to me, that it's as much related to what we're doing or not doing as it is to the European economy. Frankly, our trends in the stronger markets in Europe like Germany are not any better than our trends in the most challenged markets like Portugal, so again suggests that we can look to our ourselves for improvement. The weakest part of our business is in technology space there. Some of that is the result of our conscious decision to de-emphasize price item technology offers that we're driving a little bit of sales but not much profitability. We're trying to refocus our traffic-driving efforts in the supplies area. In the U.S. we've used case paper very successfully to drive a business customer into our stores. And we think we've got the same opportunity in Europe. In general, what we're doing in the second half of the year is looking to change our tactics around promotion and pricing, probably invest a little bit more in some of our tried and true tactics from the past. And then in the long term, I think our expectation is that we'll be able to drive some of the same businesses that have helped make the North American business so successful, namely the Copy Center business, Tech Services business. Use a loyalty program more effectively than we have there so far, and ultimately, get after new store growth there. We've had good improvement over the last several years in our operating margins in Europe so that the stores there with decent sales are profitable, but obviously, with the negative 9% comp that goes right out the window.

So I think we have to be aware of meeting those capital needs as we think about things like share buybacks, although we felt very comfortable making the acquisition, the remaining interest in Australia and making the deal in Finland. So our priorities remain intact. Our first priority is to invest in the business. We want to make sure that we maintain great flexibility to be able to do the kinds of things that we've been able to do. We also want to make sure that any excess cash that we have, we are able to return both in the form of dividends and share buybacks. You heard that we bought about 5 million shares back this quarter. I think that, that reflects that the process that we have, which is to buyback regularly in the market and buy a little bit more when the stock is lower, and unfortunately that's been the case recently. So I'd expect to see similar trends as we move through the rest of the year."

As I said, we're 700 basis points better in the second quarter on a two-year basis than we were in Q1, but with a negative 9%, we're certainly not going to get very excited about that. So I think we're very focused on addressing the issues. They are a little different country by country, but particularly, in the U.K. and Germany, which are our two biggest retail markets over there, in terms of the number of stores, we've got businesses that seem to respond in much the same way that our U.S. and Canadian businesses respond, and that gives me some confidence that the tactics that have worked to help us gain share here will be successful over there.

We do issue our equity in July. And so the biggest component affecting our share count is the restricted stock that gets issued that goes into the account, and that, we believe, will be offset by the share buybacks that we've done. The remaining part as you know is the impact of using the treasury stock on option pricing, and obviously depends somewhat on what the share price does. But making reasonable assumptions about the share price, we assume that will be about neutral. I guess as far as gross margin is concerned, it gets harder these days to talk about the gross margin with all the moving parts because you have everything that's going on internationally combined with the integration impact of Corporate Express in NAD along with changes in mix that are coming in our U.S. Retail business. So without going on and on forever, we look really hard at each one of those businesses for ways to improve it. We see improvements in supply chain across the board that have helped improve gross margins. So we'll be seeing continued improvement in buying somewhat as a result of Corporate Express, but also as a result of some of the investments that vendors have made in driving sales through Staples where they have better success and maybe some other places. And then in the International business, you've got the combined effect of some of the buying benefits. They're kicking in more in Europe this year as we've gotten farther down the road in integration. As well as some good disciplines that are taking place in the Contract business in Europe that allow us to improve margin. So for us, we believe that our internal operations and focus on execution is really what's driving our gross margin improvement. And I guess, I can't speak for the industry."

The headline is the Corporate Express acquisition has been a home run for the company. Whether its people, whether its margin improvement, whether its scale, whether its ability to run our distribution network better, whether its customer service capabilities, I mean it's really been a great acquisition that has been integrated very smoothly. I think it's safe to say that in North America, we're probably 80% of the way there in terms of synergy captures. But for the next several years, I mean we've got some work to do in terms of integrating and rationalizing the back end distribution and supply chain. And that's going to provide more upside. I don't want to be too specific because we're not even tracking synergies that way anymore. But I'd say we're pretty far along in North America. And then in Europe, I think we're probably maybe a third of the way there in terms of where we're ultimately going to be. And I think you'll see European profitability improve throughout the year and throughout next year. So obviously the big win was in North America that's where most of the synergies were because that's where we had the overlap in the Contract business.

I mean we just got so much scale there and so much opportunity there that it would be, I think, a mistake in my mind to rely too much on some of those BRICs economies. That said, I think we're very excited about China and Brazil. Australia, in many ways, benefits from the growth in Asia, and so that's been the rationale behind our foreign investment down there. And ultimately, I think India could be a good market for us as well. We don't talk about it much but we've had good growth in both the Delivery and Retail businesses in India this year, and they're progressing nicely on their profit plan to a point that we'll be very happy with that business as well. We've not got a significant presence in Russia at this stage. There's a lot on our plates right now but it's obviously a market that we're keeping an eye on. In general, I think those economies will be obviously the highest percentage growth parts of our portfolio, and then probably in the second half of this decade will be providing meaningful dollar growth on the bottom line for Staples."

This morning, I'm pleased to announce Staples' third quarter results, and I'll start with the headlines. 
Total company sales were $6.5 billion for the quarter, up slightly compared to Q3 of last year. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.41 at the high end of our guidance, and cash flows were very strong. 
Last month, at our investor conference, we outlined our strategies to drive growth in North America and also our plans to profitably grow our International business. And during the third quarter, we made good progress against those plans, gaining traction in our growth initiatives, growing core office supplies and significantly improving our international profitability.  In North American retail, we achieved strong comps in copy and print and double-digit growth in our EasyTech business. In North American Delivery, we continued to see momentum on the top line, with 3% growth. And in our International segment, we grew a solid profit growth, with operating margins up 150 basis points compared to last year's third quarter.
With all the work that we've done in 2009 and 2010, we're poised for better top line trends going forward. For 2011, we're planning for sales growth in the low to mid-single digits and strong double-digit earnings growth. And while we're not expecting a rapid improvement of the economic environment, we do assume a slow steady recovery throughout the year.
We'll hit our sales targets by focusing on the four parts of our profitable growth strategy that we discussed at our Investor Day. We'll continue to grow our share of core office supplies, including growth and Staples' brand products. We'll take a big step forward in categories beyond office supply like facilities and breakroom products. We'll increase our mix of services, like copy and print and EasyTech. And we'll continue to make progress toward our goal of 7.5% operating margin in International. Doing all this, we'll generate a lot of cash that we will use to invest in our business and return to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.
Turning to our business units, and I'll start with the North American delivery. Sales for the third quarter were $2.5 billion, an increase of 3% in U.S. dollars or 2% in local currency compared to Q3 of 2009. We grew the top line in the low-single digits in both contracts in Staples Business Delivery, and the gross top line trend continued to improve as we got back to flat sales after nine quarters of declines. 
Core office supplies and computers and accessories were strong during the third quarter. Office paper grew faster than the house, while ink was about flat for the quarter. Our Facilities and Breakroom initiative gained traction as we won several new multimillion dollar contracts during the third quarter. This year, we put a lot of effort into building a foundation to accelerate growth in facilities supplies. We've expanded our assortment, offering sharper prices and improved our systems to handle the unique requirements of this business. We have high expectations for growth in this category going forward.
NAD operating margin was flat compared to Q3 of 2009 at 8.9%, with nice leverage in contract. Our Contract business continues to benefit from Corporate Express synergies, will also investing in our growth initiatives. Strong margins in contract were offset by lower margins in Staples Business Delivery and Quill, as we invested in marketing and pricing to drive traffic in key categories like paper and facility supplies. 
During the third quarter, we also made strong progress with the physical integration of our supply chain. We upgraded 12 warehouses with the capability to serve both Staples and legacy Corporate Express customers, and service levels at these facilities are at all-time highs. The scope of our integration also includes our last mile delivery hubs. And so far this year, we've integrated over 45 locations, with about 15 more in process. And while we still have a lot of work to do in terms of integrating the supply chain network, launching a common front end and moving all our customers to the new system, we expect to get significant savings from this consolidation over the next several years. 
Moving on to North American Retail, sales for the third quarter were $2.6 billion, an increase of 1% in U.S. dollars compared to Q3 of 2009. Third quarter same-store sales declined 1%, with the strength in core office supplies, EasyTech and copy and print, offset by softness in business machines and computers. Computers were slightly negative, as we cycled last year's launch of Windows 7 late in the quarter. This added about a point to our Q3 comp last year. Consumables like ink and paper were in line with the house.
We are pleased with our back-to-school season, which was highlighted by strong customer demand for core supplies. This year, customers were required to hit a $5 minimum purchase threshold to be able to take advantage of our best offers, which drove up average order size and improved our margins.  North American Retail operating margin increased 47 basis points to 10.6% for the third quarter, as we improved product margins and recorded lower depreciation expense. We also saw strong growth in our high-margin services businesses like Copy and Print and EasyTech.
During the third quarter, Copy and Print achieved mid single-digit comps. We're seeing a great response for mid-market customers who were serving at retail through our outside sales force. And we continue to invest in copies and our remodels, as well as marketing to drive awareness.  Our EasyTech business is also gaining momentum with strong double-digit growth during the third quarter. We remain on track to exceed $100 million in EasyTech sales for the year in North America. We've seen a great response to our traffic driving deals like our free PC tuneup and 50% off tech service offers. 
We've also seen good results from our remodeling activities. We've now remodeled more than 550 stores with new EasyTech counters, and we'll complete another 200 in Q4.
With Black Friday about a week away, we've got big plans to drive traffic this holiday season. For most of the year, we have a strong focus on the needs of our small-business customers. But during the holidays, we also work on driving consumer traffic. This year, we're offering the latest tech products like the Kindle web printers and flip video cameras. 
During the third quarter, we opened 10 stores. We closed one store, ending Q3 with 1,897 stores in North America. We remain on track to open about 40 new stores in North America for the full year. And looking out to next year, we are planning to open about the same number of stores as this year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike Miles to talk about international."

Sales for the third quarter in International were $1.4 billion, a decrease of about 4% in U.S. dollars or a decrease of about 1% in local currency compared to the same period last year. We're seeing steady quarter-by-quarter improvement in local currency sales trend with 300 basis points of sequential improvement on a two-year basis during Q3. Operating margin for the International business was 4.3%, an increase of 150 basis points from the same period in 2009, almost a 50% increase in profit dollars versus last year. This was driven by strong margin improvement in both our European delivery and Australian businesses, reduced losses in the Printing Systems division, as well as lower amortization. It was somewhat offset by deleverage of fixed expenses on lower sales in European retail. We had flat year-over-year sales performance in local currency in our European Delivery business, and the team did an outstanding job managing expenses, driving almost 200 basis points of operating margin improvement.
As we discussed on last quarter's call, we weren't satisfied with the minus nine comp and European retail during Q2. While we didn't quite get back to positive comps for Europe as a whole during the third quarter, the minus two comp was a nice sequential improvement on both a one-year and two-year basis. Improving trend at retail was led by Germany and Portugal, which both had positive comps during the third quarter. A highlight is our German Retail business. We've taken a much more disciplined approach to our marketing programs. We've pulled back on using low-margin tech to drive traffic and instead have focused on driving sales of core office supply. I feel confident that the German Retail business is on the right track, were profitable in every single store in Germany, and are making plans to ramp up new store growth there in 2011.
During the third quarter, we completed our acquisition of the remaining shares of Corporate Express Australia. Despite a slight decline on the top line in local currency, operating income increased 90 basis points. A few weeks ago, we launched staples.com.au, serving small business customers in both New South Wales and the Australian Capitol territory. The Staples name is new to the Australian market, and our global experience will help us deliver a differentiated offer to small businesses there. We're using the European web platform for Australia and for China as we leverage our global strength to give customers an easy e-commerce experience.
In the Printing Systems Division, we achieved top line growth and low single digits in local currency. Over the last two years, PSD has reduced its cost structure by 25%. It will breakeven during the second half of 2010, providing a nice upside as we lap the operating losses and restructuring charges of 2009.
At our investor conference in October, I walked you through our plans to improve international operating margins from 2.3% last year to 7.5% over the coming years. We have a big opportunity to get our cost structure more in line with our North American businesses and we put the right team in place to take us there. 
During the first three quarters of this year, we've taken a big step forward, with year-to-date operating margin up more than 120 basis points. I'm confident that we'll end 2010 with international operating margins above 3.5%.  And over the next few years, we expect to bridge the gap between where we stand at year end and our 7.5% goal by focusing on a few key areas. First, we plan to achieve about 150 basis points of improvement through G&A savings. Second, we will get 100 basis points from merchandising initiatives,  like better buying and increased penetration of staples brand products. Finally, I expect about 50 basis points each from supply chain, turning around or exiting unprofitable business units and improving business mix like mid-market contract and retail services. Sales growth would provide additional leverage and accelerate our achievement, but the 7.5% margin target is based on the size of the business we have today. 
And I'd like to turn it over to John to review our financials."
34740,115655173,88655,"Staples, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2010",2010-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Staples, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everybody. For the third quarter, total company sales were up slightly versus last year at $6.5 billion. The foreign exchange impact from the stronger U.S. dollar had a modest negative impact on the top line, with sales grow",549,"Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everybody. For the third quarter, total company sales were up slightly versus last year at $6.5 billion. The foreign exchange impact from the stronger U.S. dollar had a modest negative impact on the top line, with sales growth rounding up to 1% in local currency for the quarter. 
Our third quarter GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis increased 8% to $0.40 versus the third quarter of 2009. During Q3, the company recorded pretax integration and restructuring expense of $9 million or $0.01 cent per diluted share. Excluding these costs as well as the $16 million of pretax integration restructuring expense that we incurred during the third quarter of 2009, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 5% to $0.41 versus $0.39 during Q3 of last year.  Gross profit margin improved by 49 basis points to 27.6% during Q3. This reflects improved product margins, as well as increased supply chain efficiencies. 
SG&A deleveraged seven basis points versus last year's third quarter to 19.3% of sales. This was driven by lower depreciation expense and expense management, offset by our investments in training, labor and marketing to support the growth initiatives.  Adjusted operating margin, excluding integration and restructuring expense, increased 60 basis points during the third quarter to 8.0% compared to Q3 of 2009.  As we've discussed on previous calls, our effective tax rate this year is 37.5% compared to 34.5% last year. In the third quarter, this drove approximately $14 million of additional tax expense. We expect our tax rate to return to above 34.5% in 2011, assuming no other changes to the tax laws.
Year-to-date capital expenditures came in at $246 million compared to $191 million that we spent on capital during the same period last year. With year-to-date operating cash flow of more than $1 billion, we've generated $750 million in free cash flow. We expect our capital expenditures for the year to be closer to $400 million versus our previous guidance of $450 million. And we're on track to generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow for the full year. During the third quarter, we repurchased 8 million shares for $156 million. With a $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet and available lines of credit of more than $1.2 billion, our balance sheet remains strong.
Turning to guidance for the fourth quarter, we expect total company sales to increase in the low single-digits versus 2009. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.39 to $0.41 for the fourth quarter and $1.27 to $1.29 for the full year. This excludes integration and restructuring expense of approximately $8 million in the fourth quarter and about $60 million for the full year. 
Looking out to 2011, we expect top line growth in the low to mid-single digits as our growth initiatives continue to gain traction and earnings per share in the range of $1.50 to $1.60. And we expect to generate more than $1 billion in free cash next year after spending about $500 million in capital expenditures as we invest in supply chains, systems, new stores, as well as our growth initiatives.

So it does have an effect. And as I think you've heard, all of the growth initiatives, particularly in the Retail business with the services have been growing substantially faster than the rest of the business. And so as Demos said, that helps gross margin, but it also helps covers the G&A that we're adding in order to support those initiatives. So as you expect, as we track these initiatives, we're try to balance maintaining good operating income margin and pushing the capabilities we need to be able to accelerate the growth in all of those. It's a delicate balance but obviously, in retail, in the quarter, the team did a great job."

The economy there is probably the strongest in Europe right now. We've done a fair amount of market research that suggests that customers who are aware of the Staples experience and particularly those who have been in our stores accept the concept and really like what we offer in Retail there. We've got 50-something stores, all of which are profitable, which is a pretty good sign that our concept works. And there's not really a pure-play competitor in the market. So given that there are only 57 stores there and we've got 81 million people in Germany, you do that math versus any of our North American markets, and you can see that there's a lot of upside to add stores. So we're excited about the prospect, and are looking to start opening stores again there over the next couple of years. I'm sure as we do that, there will be some things that we can learn for the other European markets. But it is true that the European markets are pretty different one from the other. And the challenges that our business in the U.K. is facing, for instance, are quite different than what we see in Germany. But from a new store standpoint, if we can be successful in Germany anywhere near to the extent that we can, that could be several years worth of new store growth just in that market, without us even having to look to other countries in Europe."

I was just wondering if you can give us any color even just directionally, in terms of the sales lift that you're getting in those stores for either just the EasyTech business and/or total technology product sales in those stores?"

This morning I'm pleased to announce Staples third quarter results and I'll start with the headlines. Total company sales were $6.5 billion for the quarter, up slightly compared to Q3 of last year. And we adjusted earnings per share of $0.41 at the high-end of our guidance, and cash flows were very strong.
Last month at our investor conference we outlined our strategies to drive grown in North America and also our plans to profitably grow our international business. And during the third quarter, we made good progress against those plans. Gaining traction in our growth initiatives, growing core office supplies and significantly improving our international profitability.
In North American Retail we achieved strong comps in copy and print and double-digit growth in our EasyTech business. In North American delivery, we continue to see momentum on the top-line with 3% growth. And in our international segment, we drove solid profit growth with operating margins up 150 basis points, compared to last year's third quarter.
With all the work that we've done in 2009 and 2010, we're poised for better top-line trends going forward. For 2011, we're planning for sales growth in the low-to-mid-single digits and strong double-digit earnings growth. Although, we're not expecting a rapid improvement in the economic environment, we do assume a slow steady recovery throughout the year. We'll hit our sales targets by focusing on the four parts of our profitable growth strategy that we discussed at our Investor Day.
We'll continue to grow our share of core office supplies, including growth in Staples brand products. We'll take a big step forward in categories beyond office supplies like facilities and breakroom products. We'll increase our mix in services like copy and print and EasyTech. And we'll continue to make progress to a certain goal of 7.5% operating margin in international. Doing all this, we'll generate a lot of cash that we will use to invest in our business and return to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.
Turning to our business units, and I'll start with the North American Delivery. Sales for the third quarter were $2.5 billion an increase of 3% in U.S. dollars or 2% in local currency compared to Q3 of 2009. We grew the top-line in the low-single digits in both Contract and Staples with Business Delivery. And Quill's top-line trend continued to improve as we got back to flat sales after nine quarters of declines.
Core office supplies and computers and accessories were strong during the third quarter. Office Paper grew faster than the House, while Ink was about flat for the quarter. Our facilities in breakroom initiative gained traction as we won several new multi-million dollar contracts during the third quarter. This year we put a lot of effort into building a foundation to accelerate growth and facility supplies.
We've expanded our assortment; we're offering sharper prices and improved our systems to handle the unique requirements of this business. We have high expectations for growth in this category going forward.
NAD operating margin was flat, compared to Q3 of 2009 at 8.9% with nice leverage in Contract. Our contract business continues to benefit from Property Express synergies, while also investing in our growth initiatives. Strong margins in Contract were offset by lower margins in Staples Business Delivery and Quill, as we invested in marketing and pricing to drive traffic and key categories like paper and facility supplies.
During the third quarter, we also made strong progress with the physical integration of our supply chain. And we upgraded 12 warehouses with the capability to serve both Staples and Legacy Corporate Express customers. And service levels of these facilities are at all time highs. The scope of our integration also includes our last mile delivery hubs. And so far this year, we've integrated over 45 locations with about 15 more in process.
And while we still have a lot of work to do in terms of integrating the supply chain network, launching a common front-end and moving all our customers to the new system we expect to get significant savings from this consolidation over the next several years.
Moving on to North-American retail, sales for the third quarter were $2.6 billion and increase of 1% in U.S. dollars compared to Q3 of 2009. Third quarter same store sales declined 1% with strength in core office supplies, EasyTech and copy and print offset by softness in business machines and computers. Computers were slightly negative as we cycled last year's launch of Windows 7 late in the quarter. This added a lot of point to our Q3 comp last year, consumables like ink and paper were in-line with the house.
We are pleased with our back to school season, which was highlighted by strong customer demand for core supplies. This year customers were required to hit a $5 minimum purchase threshold to be able to take advantage of our best offers, which drove up average order size and improved our margins.
North-American retail operating margin increased 47 basis points to 10.6% for the third quarter as we improved product margins and recorded lower depreciation expense, we also saw strong growth in our high margin services businesses like copy and print and EasyTech.
During the third quarter copy and print achieved mid single-digit comps and we're seeing a great response from mid-market customers who were serving in retail through our outside sales force and we continue to invest in copy center remodels as well as marketing to drive awareness.
Our EasyTech business is also gaining momentum with the strong double-digit growth during the third quarter we remain on track to exceed $100 million in EasyTech sales for the year in North-America. We've seen a great response to our traffic driving deals like our free PC tune-up and 50% off of tech service offers.
We've also seen good results from our remodeling activities we've now remodeled more than 550 stores with new EasyTech counters and we'll complete another 200 in Q4.
With Black Friday about a week away we've got big plans to drive traffic this holiday season for most of the year we have a strong focus on the needs of our small business customers but during the holidays we also work on driving consumer traffic. This year we're offering the latest tech products like the Kindle, web printers and Flip video cameras.
During the third quarter we opened 10 stores, we closed 1 store ending Q3 with 1897 stores in North-America. We remain on track to open about 40 new stores in North-America for the full year. And looking out to next year, we are planning to open about the same number of stores as this year.
And with that I'll turn it over to Mike Miles to talk about international.

Sales for the third quarter in international were $1.4 billion, a decrease of about 4% in U.S. dollars or a decrease of about 1% in local currency, compared to the same period last year. We're seeing steady quarter-by-quarter improvement in local currency sales trend with 300 basis points of sequential improvement on a two-year basis during Q3.
Operating margin for the international business was 4.3%, an increase of 150 basis points from the same period in 2009. Almost a 50% increase in profit dollars versus last year. This was driven by strong margin improvement in both our European Delivery and Australian businesses, reduced losses in the printing systems division as well as lower amortization. It was somewhat offset by a de-leverage of fixed expense on lower sales in European Retail.
We had flat year-over-year sales performance in local currency in our European Delivery business and the team did an outstanding job managing expenses, driving almost 200 basis points of operating margin improvement. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we weren't satisfied with the minus 9 comp and European retail during Q2. And we didn't quite get back to positive comps for Europe as a whole during the third quarter. The minus 2 comp was a nice sequential improvement on both the one year and two-year basis.
Improving trend of retail was led by Germany and Portugal, which both had positive comps during the third quarter. A highlight is our German Retail business. We've taken a much more disciplined approach to our marketing programs. We've pulled back on using low margin tech to drive traffic and instead have focused on driving sales of core office supply. I feel confident that the German Retail business in on the right track. We're profitable in every single store in Germany and are making plans to ramp up new store growth there in 2011.
During the third quarter we completed our acquisition of the remaining shares of Corporate Express Australia. Despite a slight decline on the top-line in local currency, operating income increased 90 basis points. A few weeks ago, we launched staples.com.au, serving small business customers in both New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.
Staples name is new to the Australian market and our global experience will help us deliver a differentiated offer to small businesses there. We're using the European web platform for Australia and for China, as we leverage our global strength to give customers an easy e-commerce experience.
In the printing systems division, we achieved top-line growth in low-single digits in local currency. Over the last two years, PSD has reduced its cost structure by 25%. It will breakeven during the second half of 2010, providing a nice upside as we wrap the operating losses and restructuring charges of 2009.
At our Investor Conference in October, I'll walk you through our plans to improve international operating margins from 2.3% last year to 7.5% over the coming years. We have a big opportunity to get our cost structure more in line with our North American businesses and we put the right team in place to take us there.
During the first three quarters of this year, we've taken a big step forward. With year-to-date operating margin of more than 120 basis points, I'm confident that we'll end 2010 with international operating margins above 3.5%. And over the next few years, we expect to bridge the gap between, where we stand at year-end and our 7.5% goal by focusing on a few key areas.
First, we plan to achieve about 150 basis points of improvement through G&A savings. Second, we will get 100 basis points from merchandising initiatives like better buying and increased penetration of Staples brand products. Finally, I expect about 50 basis points each from supply chain turning around or exiting unprofitable business units, and improving business mix, like mid-market contract and retail services. Sales growth would provide additional leverage and accelerate our achievement, that the 7.5% margin target is based on the size of the business we have today.
Now I'd like to turn it over to John to review our financials.

The third quarter total company sales were up slightly versus last year at $6.5 billion. The foreign exchange impact from the stronger U.S. dollar had a modest negative impact on the top-line, with sales growth rounding up to 1% in local currency for the quarter. Our third quarter GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis increased 8% to $0.40 versus the third quarter of 2009.
During Q3, the company recorded pretax integration and restructuring expense of $9 million or $0.01 per diluted share, excluding these costs as well as the $16 million of pretax integration and restructuring expense that we incurred during the third quarter of 2009, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 5% to $0.41 versus $0.39 during Q3 of last year.
Gross profit margin improved by 49 basis points to 27.6% during Q3. This reflects improved product margins as well as increased supply chain efficiencies. SG&A deleveraged 7 basis points versus last year's third quarter to 19.3% of sales. This is driven by lower depreciation expense and expense management, offset by our investments in training, labor and marketing to support the growth initiatives.
Adjusted operating margins, excluding integration and restructuring expense increased 60 basis points during the third quarter to 8.0% compared to Q3 of 2009.
As we've discussed on previous calls, our effective tax rate this year is 37.5% compared to 34.5% last year. In the third quarter, this drove approximately $14 million of additional tax expense. We expect our tax rate to return to about 34.5% in 2011, assuming no other changes in the tax laws.
Year-to-date capital expenditures came in at $246 million compared to $191 million that we spent on capital during the same period last year.
With year-to-date operating cash flow of more than $1 billion, we generated $750 million in free cash flow. We expect our capital expenditures for the year to be closer to $400 million versus our previous guidance of $450 million, and we are on track to generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow for the full year.
During the third quarter, we repurchased 8 million shares for $156 million. With $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet and available lines of credit of more than $1.2 billion, our balance sheet remains strong.
Turning to guidance for the fourth quarter, we expect total company sales to increase in the low single-digits versus 2009. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.39 to $0.41 for the fourth quarter and $1.27 to $1.29 for the full year. This excludes integration and restructuring expense of approximately 8 million in the fourth quarter and about $60 million for the full year.
Looking out to 2011, we expect top-line growth in the low to mid single-digits, as our growth initiatives continue to gain traction, and earnings per share in the range of $1.50 to $1.60. And we expect to generate more than $1 billion in free cash flow next year after spending about $500 million in capital expenditures as we invest in the supply teams, systems, new stores, as well as our growth initiatives.

On the first one, if you could talk about your ability to generate operating leverage in retail, particularly as it relates to gross margin, given the mix shift towards technology. I understand that you cycled Windows 7; so maybe the tech mix shift was most pronounced as it has been. And this is the biggest retail leverage that I think you've shown in something like four years. So any insights there about drivers and sustainability would be great.

And then finally, the work that we have done with our copy and print business, both in-store, the remodels, and the counter out on the street, are beginning take hold as well. So actually, those are the main drivers.

The big combination of capital is, you heard about the number of projects we have done in remodeling stores. And so you can imagine that we have got a substantial investment in G&A, both in terms of the people managing those activities as well as the people developing the marketing and training capabilities that we have. So it does have an effect.
And I think you've heard, all of the growth initiatives, particularly in the retail business with the services have been growing substantially faster than the rest of the businesses. So as Demos says, that helps gross margin but it also helps cover the G&A that we are adding in order to support those initiatives.
So as you'd expect, as we track these initiatives, we are trying to balance, maintaining good operating income margin and pushing the capabilities we need to be able to accelerate the growth in all of those. It's a delicate balance, but obviously in retail in the quarter, Pete did a great job.

And we clearly made investments in both marketing and pricing, focused on customer acquisition, building in an awareness campaign in Quill as well as facilities in breakroom. So those are the key areas that we've really focused on. We realized that in the short term that most of these investments did not have a positive impact on margin, but they are really the right things for the long term growth of the business.
We did see some upside to our trend line on sales. We feel real good about our customer base and the development of the customer base with our customer acquisition activity. And we're committed to continuing to see to meet our long term margin goal. Within the short term I wouldn't expected that our short term trends for sales and margin growth will differ dramatically at least in Q4 from Q3.

This would be the first dotcom business that we've gotten into, where we really led with the dotcom as opposed to having a catalog business where dotcom kind of follows in behind it. We are going to see how far we can push this by using e-commerce and e-marketing techniques largely. All others, certainly a direct mail plan that goes with it, it's probably not as catalog-intense as the SBD business is here, and certainly not as catalog-intense as our direct businesses in Europe are.
We are on a soft launch at the moment; we are going to go much heavier in the first quarter of 2011 and then through a combination of the direct marketing that you described and also expanding the geographic spread. Today as I said, we are just in the Sydney/Canberra areas. We will expand across the country in 2012.

The economy there is probably the strongest in Europe right now. We've done a fair amount of market research that suggests that customers who are aware of the Staples experience and particularly those who have been in our stores accept the concept and really like what we offer in retail there. We've got 50 odd stores there, all of which are profitable, which is a pretty good sign that our concept works. And there is not really a pure play competitor in the market.
So given that there are only 57 stores there and we've got 81 million people in Germany, you do that math versus any of our North American markets and you can see that there is lot of upside to add stores.
So we're excited about the prospect and are looking to start opening stores again there over the next couple of years. I am sure as we do that there will be some things that we can learn for the other European markets. But it is true that the European markets are pretty different, one from the other. And the challenges that our business in the U.K. is facing for instance are quite different than what we see in Germany. But from a new store standpoint, if we can be successful in Germany anywhere near to the extent that we can, that could be several years worth of new store growth just in that market without us even having to look to other companies in Europe.

This morning, I'm pleased to announce Staples' third quarter results, and I'll start with the headlines. 
Total company sales were $6.5 billion for the quarter, up slightly compared to Q3 of last year. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $0.41 at the high end of our guidance, and cash flows were very strong. 
Last month, at our investor conference, we outlined our strategies to drive growth in North America and also our plans to profitably grow our International business. And during the third quarter, we made good progress against those plans, gaining traction in our growth initiatives, growing core office supplies and significantly improving our international profitability.  In North American retail, we achieved strong comps in copy and print and double-digit growth in our EasyTech business. In North American Delivery, we continued to see momentum on the top line, with 3% growth. And in our International segment, we grew a solid profit growth, with operating margins up 150 basis points compared to last year's third quarter.
With all the work that we've done in 2009 and 2010, we're poised for better top line trends going forward. For 2011, we're planning for sales growth in the low to mid-single digits and strong double-digit earnings growth. And while we're not expecting a rapid improvement of the economic environment, we do assume a slow steady recovery throughout the year.
We'll hit our sales targets by focusing on the four parts of our profitable growth strategy that we discussed at our Investor Day. We'll continue to grow our share of core office supplies, including growth and Staples' brand products. We'll take a big step forward in categories beyond office supply like facilities and breakroom products. We'll increase our mix of services, like copy and print and EasyTech. And we'll continue to make progress toward our goal of 7.5% operating margin in International. Doing all this, we'll generate a lot of cash that we will use to invest in our business and return to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.
Turning to our business units, and I'll start with the North American delivery. Sales for the third quarter were $2.5 billion, an increase of 3% in U.S. dollars or 2% in local currency compared to Q3 of 2009. We grew the top line in the low-single digits in both contracts in Staples Business Delivery, and the gross top line trend continued to improve as we got back to flat sales after nine quarters of declines. 
Core office supplies and computers and accessories were strong during the third quarter. Office paper grew faster than the house, while ink was about flat for the quarter. Our Facilities and Breakroom initiative gained traction as we won several new multimillion dollar contracts during the third quarter. This year, we put a lot of effort into building a foundation to accelerate growth in facilities supplies. We've expanded our assortment, offering sharper prices and improved our systems to handle the unique requirements of this business. We have high expectations for growth in this category going forward.
NAD operating margin was flat compared to Q3 of 2009 at 8.9%, with nice leverage in contract. Our Contract business continues to benefit from Corporate Express synergies, will also investing in our growth initiatives. Strong margins in contract were offset by lower margins in Staples Business Delivery and Quill, as we invested in marketing and pricing to drive traffic in key categories like paper and facility supplies. 
During the third quarter, we also made strong progress with the physical integration of our supply chain. We upgraded 12 warehouses with the capability to serve both Staples and legacy Corporate Express customers, and service levels at these facilities are at all-time highs. The scope of our integration also includes our last mile delivery hubs. And so far this year, we've integrated over 45 locations, with about 15 more in process. And while we still have a lot of work to do in terms of integrating the supply chain network, launching a common front end and moving all our customers to the new system, we expect to get significant savings from this consolidation over the next several years. 
Moving on to North American Retail, sales for the third quarter were $2.6 billion, an increase of 1% in U.S. dollars compared to Q3 of 2009. Third quarter same-store sales declined 1%, with the strength in core office supplies, EasyTech and copy and print, offset by softness in business machines and computers. Computers were slightly negative, as we cycled last year's launch of Windows 7 late in the quarter. This added about a point to our Q3 comp last year. Consumables like ink and paper were in line with the house.
We are pleased with our back-to-school season, which was highlighted by strong customer demand for core supplies. This year, customers were required to hit a $5 minimum purchase threshold to be able to take advantage of our best offers, which drove up average order size and improved our margins.  North American Retail operating margin increased 47 basis points to 10.6% for the third quarter, as we improved product margins and recorded lower depreciation expense. We also saw strong growth in our high-margin services businesses like Copy and Print and EasyTech.
During the third quarter, Copy and Print achieved mid single-digit comps. We're seeing a great response for mid-market customers who were serving at retail through our outside sales force. And we continue to invest in copies and our remodels, as well as marketing to drive awareness.  Our EasyTech business is also gaining momentum with strong double-digit growth during the third quarter. We remain on track to exceed $100 million in EasyTech sales for the year in North America. We've seen a great response to our traffic driving deals like our free PC tune-up and 50% off tech service offers. 
We've also seen good results from our remodeling activities. We've now remodeled more than 550 stores with new EasyTech counters, and we'll complete another 200 in Q4.
With Black Friday about a week away, we've got big plans to drive traffic this holiday season. For most of the year, we have a strong focus on the needs of our small-business customers. But during the holidays, we also work on driving consumer traffic. This year, we're offering the latest tech products like the Kindle, web printers and flip video cameras. 
During the third quarter, we opened 10 stores. We closed one store, ending Q3 with 1,897 stores in North America. We remain on track to open about 40 new stores in North America for the full year. And looking out to next year, we are planning to open about the same number of stores as this year. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike Miles to talk about international."

Sales for the third quarter in International were $1.4 billion, a decrease of about 4% in U.S. dollars or a decrease of about 1% in local currency compared to the same period last year. We're seeing steady quarter-by-quarter improvement in local currency sales trend with 300 basis points of sequential improvement on a two-year basis during Q3. Operating margin for the International business was 4.3%, an increase of 150 basis points from the same period in 2009, almost a 50% increase in profit dollars versus last year. This was driven by strong margin improvement in both our European delivery and Australian businesses, reduced losses in the Printing Systems division, as well as lower amortization. It was somewhat offset by deleverage of fixed expenses on lower sales in European retail. We had flat year-over-year sales performance in local currency in our European Delivery business, and the team did an outstanding job managing expenses, driving almost 200 basis points of operating margin improvement.
As we discussed on last quarter's call, we weren't satisfied with the minus nine comp and European retail during Q2. While we didn't quite get back to positive comps for Europe as a whole during the third quarter, the minus two comp was a nice sequential improvement on both a one-year and two-year basis. Improving trend at retail was led by Germany and Portugal, which both had positive comps during the third quarter. A highlight is our German Retail business. We've taken a much more disciplined approach to our marketing programs. We've pulled back on using low-margin tech to drive traffic and instead have focused on driving sales of core office supply. I feel confident that the German Retail business is on the right track. We’re profitable in every single store in Germany, and are making plans to ramp up new store growth there in 2011.
During the third quarter, we completed our acquisition of the remaining shares of Corporate Express Australia. Despite a slight decline on the top line in local currency, operating income increased 90 basis points. A few weeks ago, we launched staples.com.au, serving small business customers in both New South Wales and the Australian Capital territory. The Staples name is new to the Australian market, and our global experience will help us deliver a differentiated offer to small businesses there. We're using the European web platform for Australia and for China as we leverage our global strength to give customers an easy e-commerce experience.
In the Printing Systems Division, we achieved top line growth and low single digits in local currency. Over the last two years, PSD has reduced its cost structure by 25%. It will breakeven during the second half of 2010, providing a nice upside as we lap the operating losses and restructuring charges of 2009.
At our investor conference in October, I walked you through our plans to improve international operating margins from 2.3% last year to 7.5% over the coming years. We have a big opportunity to get our cost structure more in line with our North American businesses and we put the right team in place to take us there. 
During the first three quarters of this year, we've taken a big step forward, with year-to-date operating margin up more than 120 basis points. I'm confident that we'll end 2010 with international operating margins above 3.5%.  And over the next few years, we expect to bridge the gap between where we stand at year end and our 7.5% goal by focusing on a few key areas. First, we plan to achieve about 150 basis points of improvement through G&A savings. Second, we will get 100 basis points from merchandising initiatives, like better buying and increased penetration of staples brand products. Finally, I expect about 50 basis points each from supply chain, turning around or exiting unprofitable business units and improving business mix like mid-market contract and retail services. Sales growth would provide additional leverage and accelerate our achievement, but the 7.5% margin target is based on the size of the business we have today. 
And I'd like to turn it over to John to review our financials."

For the third quarter, total company sales were up slightly versus last year at $6.5 billion. The foreign exchange impact from the stronger U.S. dollar had a modest negative impact on the top line, with sales grow",549,"Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everybody. For the third quarter, total company sales were up slightly versus last year at $6.5 billion. The foreign exchange impact from the stronger U.S. dollar had a modest negative impact on the top line, with sales growth rounding up to 1% in local currency for the quarter. 
Our third quarter GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis increased 8% to $0.40 versus the third quarter of 2009. During Q3, the company recorded pretax integration and restructuring expense of $9 million or $0.01 cent per diluted share. Excluding these costs as well as the $16 million of pretax integration restructuring expense that we incurred during the third quarter of 2009, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 5% to $0.41 versus $0.39 during Q3 of last year.  Gross profit margin improved by 49 basis points to 27.6% during Q3. This reflects improved product margins, as well as increased supply chain efficiencies. 
SG&A deleveraged seven basis points versus last year's third quarter to 19.3% of sales. This was driven by lower depreciation expense and expense management, offset by our investments in training, labor and marketing to support the growth initiatives.  Adjusted operating margin, excluding integration and restructuring expense, increased 60 basis points during the third quarter to 8.0% compared to Q3 of 2009.  As we've discussed on previous calls, our effective tax rate this year is 37.5% compared to 34.5% last year. In the third quarter, this drove approximately $14 million of additional tax expense. We expect our tax rate to return to above 34.5% in 2011, assuming no other changes to the tax laws.
Year-to-date capital expenditures came in at $246 million compared to $191 million that we spent on capital during the same period last year. With year-to-date operating cash flow of more than $1 billion, we've generated $750 million in free cash flow. We expect our capital expenditures for the year to be closer to $400 million versus our previous guidance of $450 million. And we're on track to generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow for the full year. During the third quarter, we repurchased 8 million shares for $156 million. With a $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet and available lines of credit of more than $1.2 billion, our balance sheet remains strong.
Turning to guidance for the fourth quarter, we expect total company sales to increase in the low single-digits versus 2009. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.39 to $0.41 for the fourth quarter and $1.27 to $1.29 for the full year. This excludes integration and restructuring expense of approximately $8 million in the fourth quarter and about $60 million for the full year. 
Looking out to 2011, we expect top line growth in the low to mid-single digits as our growth initiatives continue to gain traction and earnings per share in the range of $1.50 to $1.60. And we expect to generate more than $1 billion in free cash next year after spending about $500 million in capital expenditures as we invest in supply chains, systems, new stores, as well as our growth initiatives.

I understand that you cycled Windows 7, so maybe the tech mix shift was mispronounced as it had been, but this is the biggest retail leverage that I think you've shown in something like four years. So, any insights there about drivers and sustainability would be great."

So it does have an effect. And as I think you've heard, all of the growth initiatives, particularly in the Retail business with the services have been growing substantially faster than the rest of the business. And so as Demos said, that helps gross margin, but it also helps cover the G&A that we're adding in order to support those initiatives.

The economy there is probably the strongest in Europe right now. We've done a fair amount of market research that suggests that customers who are aware of the Staples experience and particularly those who have been in our stores accept the concept and really like what we offer in Retail there. We've got 50-some stores there, all of which are profitable, which is a pretty good sign that our concept works. And there's not really a pure-play competitor in the market. So given that there are only 57 stores there and we've got 81 million people in Germany, you do that math versus any of our North American markets, and you can see that there's a lot of upside to add stores. So we're excited about the prospect, and are looking to start opening stores again there over the next couple of years. I'm sure as we do that, there will be some things that we can learn for the other European markets. But it is true that the European markets are pretty different one from the other. And the challenges that our business in the U.K. is facing, for instance, are quite different than what we see in Germany. But from a new store standpoint, if we can be successful in Germany anywhere near to the extent that we can, that could be several years worth of new store growth just in that market, without us even having to look to other countries in Europe."
