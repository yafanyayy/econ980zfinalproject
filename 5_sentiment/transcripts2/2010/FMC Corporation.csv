We realized strong performance in our businesses that serve end markets less sensitive to the broader economy, like agricultural products and biopolymers.
In our businesses serving end markets more sensitive to the economies, though volumes were lower than a year ago, demand continued to improve on a sequential basis relative to the third quarter with further improvement expected in 2010.  Let me first summarize our fourth quarter results.  
Sales of $722 million were 2% lower than last year's fourth quarter, while earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $0.94 per diluted share were 8% lower than the year-ago quarter.  In agricultural products, sales of $269 million increased 12% and segment earnings of $46.8 million increased 39% versus the year-ago quarter, driven mainly by sales gain in Latin America.
In specialty chemicals, sales of $194 million were up 2% while earnings of $40.1 million increased 14% versus the year-ago quarter, as strong commercial performance in biopolymer, especially in food ingredient market was partially offset by lower lithium performance.  
In industrial chemicals sales of $260 million declined 16%, and earnings of $32.7 million were 39% lower than the year-ago quarter, impacted by lower phosphate selling prices and soda ash volumes partially offset by lower raw material and energy costs.  

On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $62.1 million or $0.85 per diluted share.  GAAP earnings in the current quarter included a net charge of $6.8 million after tax or $0.09 per diluted share versus a net charge of $29.1 million after tax or $0.39 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.  Our non-GAAP earnings were $0.94 per diluted share in the current quarter, a decrease of 8%, versus $1.02 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Let me now take a more detailed look at the performance of each of our operating segments in the quarter.  First agricultural, fourth quarter sales of $269 million increased 12% compared with the prior year quarter.  In Latin America, for this business, sales increased significantly reflecting slowly improving market conditions and growth from new products.  Market conditions improved compared with the first half of 2009 driven by growth in planted acres for a number of key crops and a positive start to the 2009-2010 crop season.
Crop production businesses in Asia and Europe also realized sales gain reflecting favorable currency impact and increased contribution from growth initiatives.  In our North American crop business, sales were lower than a year ago as unfavorable weather conditions resulted in fewer late season treatments.
Segment earnings of $46.8 million increased 39% versus the year ago quarter as a result of the sales growth, lower manufacturing cost, the recovery of certain indirect taxes in 
Brazil, and favorable currency impact.
Now moving on to specialty chemicals — revenues of $194 million were 2% higher than the prior year quarter.  The results of strong commercial performance in biopolymer partially offset by lower volumes in lithium primaries.
 
Segment earnings of $40.1 million increased 14% versus the prior year, driven by sales gain and favorable mix in biopolymer, partially mitigated by lower lithium performance.  In biopolymer, volume and selling prices increased revenues in both pharmaceutical and food ingredients market.  Gains in food ingredients were especially strong, led by growth in the new beverage application and growth in emerging markets.  Biopolymer earnings improved significantly over prior year driven by strong commercial performance and added by lower operating cost.
In our lithium business, volumes and revenues were lower than the prior quarter, mainly due to reduced demand in lithium primaries.  However, volumes continued to improve sequentially which we expect will continue in 2010.  Lithium earnings were modestly lower than a year ago due the revenue decline, partially offset by the favorable manufacturing and supply chain performance.
Moving now to corporate items — corporate expense was $12.2 million as compared to $12.3 million a year ago.  Interest expense, net was $7.3 million versus $7.4 million in the prior year quarter.  On December 31, 2009, gross consolidated debt was $643.9 million, and debt net of cash was $567.3 million.  For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $33.7 million, and capital expenditures were $54.4 million.
I would now like to turn the call over to Michael Wilson for a review of the performance and prospects of our specialty chemicals segment.

Three businesses comprise our industrial chemicals segment—our alkali chemical division or soda ash business, North American Peroxygens which is comprised predominantly of hydrogen peroxide but also includes several specialty Peroxygens and Feret, our wholly owned Spanish subsidiary which manufactures Peroxygens and phosphates as well as lesser quantities of other inorganic ingredients for powder detergents.
As most of you are already family with our business, I’m going to forgo a detailed overview of each of them and move straight to the results of our fourth quarter 2009 performance.  I will then discuss our 2010 outlook for this segment touching on the key earnings drivers for each of the three businesses.
For the fourth quarter of 2009, sales of $260 million declined 16% from the year ago quarter, reflecting reduced phosphate selling prices, lower soda ash volumes, and lower electricity sales due to the divesture of the Spanish cogeneration facility earlier in the year.
Segment earnings of $32.7 million declined 39% as the result of the lower selling prices and the impact of lower volumes, partially offset by favorable raw material costs, particularly phosphate rock and energy costs.  While segment earnings compared unfavorably to the year ago period, earnings improved sequentially for the second consecutive quarter, up 58% from third quarter on the strength of improving volumes and lower raw material costs.
With that summary of the fourth quarter 2009 results, I’ll now shift to our 2010 outlook for industrial chemicals.  On a full year basis, we expect earnings to improve by 5-15% over 2009 as improved volumes and lower raw material energy prices more than offset lower selling prices.
Before commenting specifically on the businesses that comprise industrial chemicals, allow me to first summarize at the segment level the impacts of the three major drivers of profitability for this segment—volumes, selling prices, and input costs.
We have experienced increased demand across our businesses, particularly in soda ash export markets.  We also anticipate volume growth in our North American Peroxygens business in both hydrogen peroxide as well as in specialty Peroxygens serving environmental, food, and aseptic packaging applications.  Overall, across the segment, we expect aggregate net volume impacts to earnings of approximately $35 million in 2010.
As a result of the significant decline in demand in the first half of last year, utilization rates across the industries in which we participate generally reached low points during the middle of the year.  Consequently, market pricing in some of our markets declined with demand, notably soda ash exports and phosphates.
To some extent, annual pricing contracts insulated us from the full impact of market price declines in 2009.  Sequential demand recovery that we experienced in the second half raised utilization rates across our businesses.  Though utilization rates rose, the key determinate for 2010 pricing was whether utilization rose to a sufficient level to return pricing leverage to producers by the time of annual negotiations.
In phosphates, soda ash exports, and hydrogen peroxide market pricing levels have begun the year essentially at the level they ended 2009.  As a result, when compared to higher pricing in the first half of last year, pricing will be a headwind to the segment in 2010.
As many of you know, historically the vast majority of our businesses tend to be on an annual contract rather than on a spot basis.  While this will remain true for domestic soda ash and hydrogen peroxide in 2010, export soda ash and phosphates will have a higher component of quarterly price contracts this year.  Given current market direction, we view this as advantageous.
Overall, we expect aggregate net price headwinds of approximately $65 million for this segment from 2010.  Conversely, raw material, energy, and other input costs will be tailwinds for industrial chemicals.  Feret will be the biggest beneficiary, particularly in phosphate rock as well as for caustic soda and energy.  Our soda ash business will also benefit from lower energy costs.  In total, across the segment, raw material, energy, and other input costs are expected to provide a tailwind of approximately $40 million in 2010.
With that as background, let me review each business in more detail, starting with soda ash.  As we begin 2010, global soda ash demand recovery is underway.  Though challenging global economic conditions persist, we expect global demand for soda ash to grow by approximately 4% in 2010 following a decline of 3% in 2009.  This outlook returns global demand to its 2008 level of approximately 48 million metric tons.
For both 2009 and 2010, flat glass demand is the primary driver of the demand change due to the impacts of the recession and the forecasted recovery on automobile production, housing, and commercial construction.  Recall that globally glass in all forms—flat, container, and fiber—accounts for approximately 50% of soda ash demand.  Demand growth, however, is not expected to be uniform across the globe.  We expect domestic demand defined as the US and Canada to grow approximately 3% in 2010 following a decline of 13% in 2009.
The recovery in domestic demand will also be driven by increased flat glass demand as US housing starts and auto sales are forecasted to rebound off of very low bases recorded in 2009.  Overall, we expect flat glass demand domestically to improve by approximately 10% while year over year demand in container glass, which was less affected by the recession, was forecasted to be flat.  We’re also projecting a 5% improvement in non-glass applications, chemical and detergent uses for example, which will grow with improving industrial production and detergent mix changes favoring powder respectively.
In China, the world’s largest soda ash market, demand is expected to grow 5% and accordingly China will account for almost 50% of global volume growth.  After dramatically declining in 2008, Chinese domestic pricing has recently turned upward pressured by rising input costs and the strengthening of demand within China.
Chinese synthetic cost producers will face further cost challenges as global economies recover and their input cost for energy, coke, ammonia, and salt increase.  They also face increasing environmental pressures, tightening lending and credit practices, and the continued reevaluation of the Yuan.  We further expect rising ocean freight rates will make some export markets less accessible.  As a result, we forecast Chinese exports to be flat year over year at approximately 2.3 million metric tons.
Among our key export markets, we perceive market growth of 3% in Latin America and in Asia ex-China, while the Western European market is expected to be flat.  Rest of the world demand is projected to grow at a healthier 5%.
Given the low cost position of US producers, ANSAC will be able to profitably sell the available capacity of US producers.  Consequently, we see the US industry remaining at or near 100% utilization in 2010.  This will not be the case for synthetic producers around the globe.
With this as a backdrop to the global environment, let me comment on pricing for 2010.  In North America, soda ash price increases varied by customer, depending upon contract provisions, timing, and competitive dynamics.  Overall, we realized a small net price increase.  As mentioned earlier, the vast majority of our domestic business remains on an annual contract basis.  Therefore, I see little risk or opportunity for pricing changes as the year progresses.
ANSAC’s contracting for 2010 has been more challenging given export pricing levels in 2009.  As we reported in our third quarter call, ANSAC successfully regained market share last year, albeit at lower prices.  Consequently, we’ll begin 2010 with lower export prices than in 2009.  With that said, ANSAC’s 2010 contracts contain a higher proportion of quarterly price commitments relative to prior years.  While not imbedded in our outlook, we believe ANSAC could achieve some price improvement as we progress throughout the year.
Nevertheless, the earnings impact of the forecasted export price decline is expected to be more than offset by higher volumes and lower raw material, energy, and other costs such that our soda ash business will once again deliver earnings growth in 2010.  Let me note as I do each year that I own 87.5% of the earnings stream of our soda ash business.  The balance is owned by our two Japanese partners.
Finally, a comment on our capacity plans.  As you know, we mothballed our Granger production facility during the second quarter of 2009.  It is our intent to leave this capacity idled until export market conditions warrant its restart.  When that time comes, Granger clearly represents a volume upside for the business.
Moving now to North American Peroxygens — The largest component of this business is hydrogen peroxide.  While hydrogen peroxide is consumed in a wide variety of applications, the single largest use is as a bleaching agent for pulp and paper which accounts for about two-thirds of North Amercan demand.  In 2009, hydrogen peroxide demand for pulp and paper applications fell 18% versus 2008.  The demand decline was particularly acute in the first half of 2009 due to de-stocking associated with the high level of global market pulp inventories at the end of 2008.  The pulp and paper segment decline drove an overall North American hydrogen peroxide demand reduction of 15%.
Peroxide demand in the pulp and paper market is expected to increase approximately 4% in 2010 driven primarily by recovery in market pulp and bleached paperboard, while non-pulp markets are expected to grow 3%.  Market pulp demand improved significantly in the second half of 2009 driven by increased demand from China.  Global pulp inventories are currently low, and demand is expected to benefit from a stronger economy in 2010.  
North American market pulp mills are forecasted to operated\ at approximately 95% capacity utilization in 2010 with total pulp reduction approximately 10% below the 2006 to 2008 levels due to capacity closures.
Paper grade mix and brightness are forecasted to be favorable to peroxide demand in 2010.  Commodity pulp market hydrogen peroxide demand will be augmented by continued growth in specialty applications.  Non-pulp hydrogen peroxide markets in total are expected to gain at a 3% rate in 2010 driven by growth in environmental, electronics, and water treatment applications.
Semiconductor production in US is expected to continue the recovery started in the second half of 2009 with year to year demand up 10%.  North American hydrogen peroxide industry capacity utilization, though improving, is forecasted to remain significantly underutilized at approximately 80% of name plate in 2010.  As a result, average hydrogen peroxide prices are forecasted to decline modestly in 2010 from 2009 contract levels.
The division continues to invest in promising growth initiatives in specialty peroxygens and expects further success in 2010.  Our sulfate growth initiatives are focused on the continued globalization of branded closure for sulfate for environmental soil remediation and oil field product portfolio expansions.  Closure and oil field sales volumes are budgeted to increase 16% and 35% respectively over 2009.  
Peracetic acid sales to the food safety industry are budgeted to grow 42% in 2010 as FMC’s Spectrum program captures an additional 5% of the US poultry market.  Other developing adjacent growth initiatives for peracetic acid in packaging and waste water markets are expected to deliver significant growth as well.
Our efforts to diversify our market exposure in peroxygens to lessen our dependence on commodity hydrogen peroxide remain on track.  Overall, since inception of the strategy in 2007, specialties have grown to account for more than 40% of divisional revenue.  Despite the progress in product line and market mix diversification, North American peroxygens earnings remain dependent for now on the performance of the commodity hydrogen peroxide segment.  Division earnings will be level to slightly down in 2010 as the price declines in commodity hydrogen peroxide are offset by volume in specialty mix benefit.
Turning to our European hydrogen peroxide business, in Western Europe, hydrogen peroxide demand experienced a decline of 15% in 2009 also due to weakness in the pulp and paper segment.  For 2010, we expect a similar demand pattern to emerge in Europe as in North America, but demand will be somewhat weaker due to the strength of the Euro which limits European pulp producers’ participation in the global market pulp segment.
Overall, we’re forecasting demand to be flat to down 2% versus 2009.  Also similar to North America, we expect weakness in Western European hydrogen peroxide pricing given an expected 86% capacity utilization rate.  Feret’s phosphorus chemicals products, its other major business, are used in a range of applications including detergent, feed, and industrial uses.  Demand growth for phosphorous chemicals in these applications tends to mirror GDP.
The major product in phosphorous chemicals line is sodium tripolyphosphate or STPP, a key builder for powder detergents.  Throughout most of 2009 STPP and other phosphate selling prices sell faster than raw material costs, significantly reducing phosphate’s margins.
As we move into 2010, on a comparative basis, the year over year price erosion threat we will experience in phosphates will be more than offset by lower raw material and energy pricing.  Phosphate raw material prices has now fallen 80% from their 2008 peak.  With volume impacts forecasted to be relatively flat, phosphates will contribute to Feret’s overall improved profitability in 2010.
In light of that detailed outlook for the businesses that comprise industrial chemicals, let me summarize our aggregate view for the segment for the year ahead.  We expect full year 2010 revenue to be level to prior year as stronger volumes across the group are offset by reduced selling prices.  We expect full year 2010 earnings to be up 5-15% the prior year as volume growth and favorable raw material and energy costs are partially offset by lower selling prices.  For the first quarter, we expect to have earnings to be level to up 10% as higher volumes and low raw material and energy cost are partially offset by reduced selling prices.  
With that, I look forward to taking your questions during the Q&A period.  I would now like to turn the call over to Kim Foster.

Our earlier guidance for the quarter and the full year assumed a tax rate of 32%; however, our full year tax rate came in at 30.8% instead.  The full catch-up adjustment was taken in the fourth quarter.  This change in tax rate favorably impacted earnings per share by $0.07 in the quarter.  
Moving to our financial position, I’m pleased to report that we ended the year with a very strong balance sheet.  Net debt of $567 million was in the middle of our $500-600 million target range.  We maintained our net debt target while investing approximately $35 million on two acquisitions in the agricultural products group and returning approximately $71 million to shareholders, comprised of approximately $35 million in share repurchases and $36 million in cash dividends.
Free cash flow for 2009 was approximately $100 million.  As a remainder, free cash flow is after acquisitions but before cash return to shareholders.  For 2010, free cash flow is projected to be approximately $200 million.  The free cash flow is higher than 2009 primarily due to higher earnings, lower capital spending, better working capital performance, and the absence of acquisition spending.
While our projections do not include funds for acquisitions, we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities in 2010.  Our current stock repurchase program has a remaining authorization of $190 million, and as I do each quarter, I’ll remind you that our repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price target and may be suspended at any time, and our guidance for 2010 assumes that we do not repurchase any shares.
The fourth quarter brought several improvements to our capital structure and liquidity profile.  After being upgraded to BBB+/Baa1 by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, we completed a $300 million 10-year senior notes offering and a coupon of 5.2%.  We believe that our bond pricing had one of the tightest spreads of any BBB chemical issuer for any maturity during the year.
Proceeds from our offering paid down outstanding borrowings on our domestic credit facility and also the European credit facility that comes due at the end of this year.  At year end, we had available funds under our committed credit facilities of $762 million, cash on hand of $77 million.  Debt maturing in the next 5 years is less than $200 million.
Although we are not required to make a contribution to our US defined benefit plan during 2020, to reduce future volatility, we anticipate voluntarily contributing approximately $80 million this year which is included in our free cash flow estimate.
Each quarter prior to the conference call, we post the FMC outlook statement on our website.  The bottom portion of the statement addresses corporate and other financial items.  Let me make a few explanatory comments to address a few of these disclosures.  Interest expense is expected to increase to $42 million due to the recently completed bond offering.  Capital spending of $125 million is projected to be below depreciation and amortization of $135 million.  We expect this relationship to continue for the next several years.
Other income and expenses expected to be down year over year to $18 million of expense as I foreshadowed in the third quarter conference call.  The primary reason for the lower expense is that higher pension expense is more than offset by favorable LIFO charges.
To summarize, despite the challenging market conditions we all experienced in 2009 and the uncertainties still ahead of us, we exited 2009 with a stronger balance sheet and liquidity profile than we entered the year.  Consequently, we will continue to look for opportunities to grow the company through a combination of internal and external investments.  However, we will retain a strong balance sheet and maintain a solid liquidity position.  We will continue to error on the side of financial prudence.
With that, I’ll now turn the call back to you, Pierre.

At this point, we are not expecting further deterioration.  The big question for us is with all of the things which are involved in defining the pricing for exports, what will be the cost for the Chinese producers, how much product will they be pushing into the non-domestic market.  We know at some point that price is going to turn around for exports.  What we are not capable of saying today, and that’s why I say that our forecasting remains conservative.

What I would like to say in closing is that our 2010 outlook presumes a continued global recovery, both tempered and uneven as it may be.  As a result, the impact on our business is hard to predict.  Nonetheless, we expect strong performance from agriculture products and specialty chemicals based on demand recovery and the benefits of our growth initiatives.  The more uncertain area of our outlook is in soda ash export pricing.  We have prudently chosen to be conservative regarding the potential for higher selling prices in the export market as the year develops.  Though we do think there is some upside in this regard, we do not control the timing of when increased demand tightens the supply-demand balance to enable higher pricing in the export market for soda ash.  As I told you and you know I have joined FMC recently, and I would like to share my views on our business and our capacity to grow.
FMC’s financial position and the attractiveness of our business portfolio are two distinct strengths for the company.  We have a well-defined strategy for profitable growth.  My message is one of continuity.  I strongly believe in the growth platform we have, especially agricultural products, biopolymer, and lithium.  We will drive growth in these businesses following the technology roadmap we have in place.  We will combine that with a focus on taking full advantage of the premium growth opportunities in the world’s rapidly developing economies and continue with very selective M&A as it was done in the past.

As you saw in our earnings release, we did strong second quarter performance, better than our expectations. We realized strong sales growth in agricultural products and specialty chemicals and demand recover",1115,"Thank you, Brennen, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings release, we did strong second quarter performance, better than our expectations. We realized strong sales growth in agricultural products and specialty chemicals and demand recovery in additional chemicals. Our second quarter earnings increased 16% to $1.28 per diluted share before structuring and other income and charges on revenue of $770 million, which increased 11%.
In Agricultural Products, sales of $294 million increased 60% while segment earnings of $18 million were down 12%, slightly better than expected. In Specialty Chemical, sales of $215 million increased 11% and earnings of $51 million increased 26%. Industrial chemical, sales of $269 million, increased 5% and earnings of $30 million, more than double up 121%, which was above our expectations. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $66 million or $0.90 per diluted share. GAAP earnings in the current quarter included a net charge of $28 million after tax of $0.38 per diluted share versus a net charge of $11 million after tax or $0.16 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.
With that reconciliation our non-GAAP earnings were $1.28 per diluted share in the current quarter, an increase of 16% versus $1.10 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2009.  Going forward, our outlook is for the strong performance to continue in the third quarter and for the full year. In the third quarter, we expect earnings of $1 to $1.60 per diluted share before restructuring and other income and charges, 21% increase at midpoint of this range. For the full year, we have raised our outlook to $4.65 to $4.80 per diluted share before restructuring and other income and charges. The 13% increase at midpoint of this range. 
Let's now take a more detailed look at the second quarter performance in each of the operating segments. First, in Specialty Chemicals, revenue of $215 million was 11% higher than the prior year quarter, driven by a robust demand recovery in Lithium Primaries and higher volumes in selling prices in Biopolymer.
Segment earnings of $51 million, increased 26% above the prior year as a result of the strong commercial performance in Biopolymer and higher volume in lithium primaries, partially offset by higher raw material cost. In Lithium, our upstream primaries business continues to experience a V shaped demand recovery, driven largely by growth in battery and metals markets in Asia.
Second quarter Lithium Primaries volume increased substantially versus prior year, while selling prices have stabilized in recent months at a level lower than last year. A downstream lithium business contributes to top line growth through higher selling prices. Lithium earnings in the quarter increased substantially versus last year as a result of the sales gain in the margin leverage on this top line growth. 
In Biopolymer, second quarter revenues also increased driven by broad based sales gain across food, pharmaceutical and healthcare businesses and higher prices for food ingredients. Biopolymer earnings were essentially level to a year ago as the strong commercial performance was offset by higher costs inventory related to a year ago and higher raw material costs.
Moving now on to industrial chemicals, sales of $269 million increased 5% from the prior year quarter. Gains in soda ash especially in export markets the preoxygens and phosphates were partially offset by reduced selling prices in many businesses and lower electricity sales due as a divesture of a Spanish cogeneration pathology in the third quarter of 2009. Segment earnings of $30 million more than doubled versus last year, up 121% as the result of the broad based demand recovery and lower raw material and energy costs. In soda ash volumes continued to rebound significantly above last year. In the domestic markets are mid single-digit volume growth year to date is in line with the demand recovery being experienced in flat glass detergents and chemicals.
In the export markets of Asia and Latin America, demand growth is even more robust, up approximately 50% versus last year resulting from both higher market demand and the success of Anzac share recapture strategy. Anzac’s primary competitor in the export market chain these potash exporters reduced have reduced export volume in the first half by approximately 40% versus last year. Our view, however, is that uncertainty remains in regard to the soda ash export volumes which could increase in the second half. Presently in China and in our parts of Asia has increased generally consistent with input costs increases in the Chinese soda ash products.
This strong rebound in domestic and export markets has moved US producer to near full utilization. We expect tight conditions to continue across the balance of the year. In reflection, this industry conditions FMC announced a $10 per ton price increase in May for the domestic market effective July 1. However, given the full nature of our domestic contract pricing, no marginal increase was achieved prior to January 1 next year.
Late in the second quarter, we exchanged an operational issue at one of the coal-fired boiler at our Greenriver facility. The boiler has been repaired and is now back on stream. Though we did experience unplanned down time early in the third quarter. During the down time we supplemented products by bringing on incinerator gas fired boiler capacity. The financial impact of these occurrences will be reflected in our single half performance. We project an earnings impact in the range of $4 million to $7 million with the majority of that occurring in the third quarter. This impact is already included in our fully revised guidance for the year.
Our peroxygens business performed well in the quarter, delivering a significant earnings increase driven by higher volumes in all product lines and improved mix due to growth in our specialties business. In specialties our environmental soil remediation, food safety and all sealed businesses all contributed strongly to the earning increase. In Europe, a Forest subsidiary benefited from energy and lower raw materials cost, particularly phosphate rocks. Volumes in phosphate and hydrogen peroxide improved both versus a year ago and compared to the first quarter. Lower prices in phosphates and hydrogen peroxide partially offset the performance improvement.
Now moving to corporate items. Corporate expense was $15 million as compared to $10 million a year ago. Interest expense net was $9 million versus $7 million in the prior quarter. On June 30, 2010 gross consolidated debt was $638 million and debt net of cash was $476 million. For the quarter depreciation and amortization was $33 million and capital expenditures were $28 million.
Now I'll turn the call over to Milton Steele for a review of the performance and strategy of our agricultural product segment. Milton?

28606,108800114,70529,"FMC Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","FMC Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Pierre, and greetings to everyone. Global agriculture in the midst of a long-term growth cycle as the agricultural outlook stated last month, international commodity prices are anticipated to average higher in the next decade compared to the decad",2463,"Thanks, Pierre, and greetings to everyone. Global agriculture in the midst of a long-term growth cycle as the agricultural outlook stated last month, international commodity prices are anticipated to average higher in the next decade compared to the decade before the price spike of 2007 and 2008.
So while there maybe seasonal challenges of pricing and weather, which have affected several key markets this year. The fundamental trends for global agriculture remain positive driven by factors such as diminishing arable land and water supply, growing populations increasing demand for more protein, feed, fiber and fuel and relatively limited increases in farmers yield.
Over the long term, these trends will drive continued growth for agricultural inputs including crop protection chemical. In this growth environment, FMC remains committed to providing unique solutions to our customers and continuing to maneuver sales growth and profit margins ahead of industry averages.
We will do this by maintaining our crop focus strategy, finding ways to extend the life cycle of products, accessing new products and lowering the cost of producing them all while sustaining highly focused relationships with our customers. As a result of our strategy, we're expecting another strong year of AG products but with a different quarterly pattern, that is, lower earnings in the second quarter followed by stronger third and fourth quarters.
So what was our financial performance in the second quarter? Second quarter revenues increased 16% to $294 million driven by higher sales in Latin America, North America and Asia. In Latin America which is dominated by Brazil sales increased reflecting improved marketing conditions and growth in new and recently introduced products. Sales also improved in Argentina and Colombia.
Sales in North America increased due to strong demand for our proprietary herbicides, growth from new and recently introduced products, particularly our newly acquired herbicide and NATO improving market conditions in some non-crop segments. Asia sales were up with gains in most key countries reflecting better market conditions and the introduction of new products including (inaudible) China, another new herbicide for which we acquired exclusive access.
As expected, sales in Europe declined driven mostly by the shift and by pension sales from the second quarter to the first quarter which we reviewed with you in last quarter's call. Segment earnings of $80 million were 12% lower in the quarter. This is better than we projected in our last outlook statement. As we explained in the first quarter call, there were a number of reasons for our earnings to be down versus the prior year even with the higher sales.
Please consider, similar to the first quarter as we have stated in our last earnings call we had higher cost inventory compared with the prior year quarter. This higher cost inventory is now fully liquidated and will not impact our third and fourth quarters.
We have paid import duties in the United States as duty suspension legislation had not yet been renewed this year. We are less favorable geographic mix and finally we increased our spending on growth initiatives. Tackling these challenges head on we have laid the foundation for strong second half relative to last year and it is all based on our strategy of how are we going to continue growing FMC's AG business profitably.
For many years there's been a strategic paradigm in the global chemical crop protection industry which is generally followed by most, if not all, of our competitors. Simply stated this paradigm is one can either be a new active ingredient discover and market or one can be a genetic competitor.
In other words, one can compete in technology investing in R&D with expectations of earning higher margins or one can compete in price and through lower costs also earn acceptable margin. Indeed this paradigm is mostly played out along these two paths but with two exceptions. The first exception is that consistently attractive margins have not resulted for many competitors who pursue either path and the second exception is FMC's agricultural products group.
We broke this paradigm and proceeded in a uniquely different strategic direction. Several years ago we concluded that a company does not have to be either discovered new chemistries or a generic competitor to flourish in this industry. Instead we remain committed to innovation, though not new active ingredient discovery and have carved out a unique market position that consistently produces high margins. We call our strategy growing innovation where FMC this entails acquiring and developing technologies and making selective investments in innovation to extend product life cycle.
Driving for global cost competitiveness by our virtual manufacturing operation and creating sustainable relationships with customers based on mutuality. The key enabler of our strategy has been and will continue to be our investments in people development, and our ability to create and develop an agile and empowered organization. As a result of our strategic paradigm shift and these key tactics, we have delivered six consecutive years of record EBIT performance with EBIT margins consistently among the best in the industry. Furthermore, we remain on track to deliver another record EBIT performance in 2010.
Let me now share with you the strategy, by which we have consistently delivered industry leading margins and superior returns in net assets and more importantly, how we will continue to deliver profitable top line growth while sustaining current EBIT margins. FMC has a proven ability to consistently deliver strong returns. We have done this by carving out unique spaces in the market, investing in new formulations and mixes and sustaining value in a way that generic competitors do not yet appear to have mastered.
How does FMC does this, and how will we continue to do this? The first element of our strategy we call aggregating technology. FMC has developed a sophisticated scouting operation that seeks technologies that have the potential to improve the performance of existing active ingredients whether these are FMC's molecules or competitor's molecules. In other words, we gain access to technologies that someone else has invented, and we use our innovation and ingenuity to apply these technologies to make our products perform better and, thereby, provide more value to our customers.
As an example, we currently are developing several novel technology platforms that have the potential to expand the length of control of various pesticides. In this way we create opportunities to renew and/or extend the life cycles of all our chemistries by our infantries technologies that are patent protected and, which invariably exclusively able to FMC.
We also have extensive programs focused on extending the life cycle of our key proprietary chemistry. These include accessing new products in premix partner, to extend our product offering always with the goal of ensuring better returns for FMC and our customers.
Recently we announce the acquisition of Herbicide from Kumiai, which we market in North America as cadet. In addition, we very recently obtained the rights to contest and development Kumiai’s unique new herbicide is in premixes. These new herbicides premixes will provide Canadian and Latin American farmers with highly efficacious herbicide solutions in several key crops such as soybean, corn and wheat.
Importantly these premixes will provide outstanding control on most of the weeds that are showing significant resistant to herbicides like. We estimate that this family of premixes has the potential to generate patent protected trials for FMC in excess of $150 million at maturity with attractive margin.
Furthermore, we expect that our annual investment of $75 million in innovation will result in a stream of differentiated products that increase the attractiveness of our product offering, strengthen our relevance in key focus markets and complement our current product portfolio.
We believe that products currently in development and newly commercialized have the potential to generate $300 million to $400 million in new sales within the next five years. 
Approximately 25% of FMC's gross profit will be earned on products that were introduced over the past five years. By 2015 we expect 30% to 40% of our gross profit to come from products introduced in the preceding five years. In other words, we do not discover new active ingredients, but we invest in innovation to make active ingredients, whether ours or others, into new and unique solutions to meet customers' needs.
The next element of our strategy is competitive sourcing. FMC's low-cost virtual manufacturing operation enables us to be highly cost competitive and relatively immune to volume swings. FMC's manufacturing cost structure is approximately 95% variable and most critical products and raw materials are sourced from multiple suppliers. Global cost competitiveness has been a cornerstone of FMC's profitability for the past decade. 
Our accumulated expertise in running this global, virtual manufacturing operation has enabled us to continually reduce manufacturing costs, improve efficiency, as well as to reliably and competitively source materials and products from multiple suppliers.
Another benefit of our manufacturing strategy is the low levels of capital expenditures required to sustain our operation. Even though our virtual manufacturing operation is the envy of many in the industry, we are willing to rely solely on our past successes. We are in the process of reinventing our supply chain by investing in state-of-the-art systems and more skilled people. 
These investments will ensure that we meet our customers' needs by industry leading performance on right first-time order fulfillment. In addition, we expect that these investments will lead to further improvement in inventory turns and working capital efficiency, thereby freeing up cash for other profit generating investment.
These supply chain investments will also allow to us grow more effectively and sustainable over the long-term. Finally, we are in the process of looking for and developing the next generation of low-cost manufacturing opportunities that could manifest in the future. The third element of our strategy is customer intimacy, which for FMC means focusing on key customers, markets, crops and products, and delivering on our customers' needs better than our competitors. For FMC, delighting our customers is not only a passion, but it is a mission critical for ensuring long-term sustainability and profitability.
Over the past several years, FMC has developed strong and in some cases leading positions in he various crops, for example, sugarcane in Brazil. We have also established sustainable positions in other important agricultural crops, such as corn, soybeans and sunflowers in North America, and several crops in Europe and Asia. 
So whether it is in the Australian structural pest control market, Brazil's rapidly growing sugarcane market, or North American corn and soybean weed control, FMC works closely with customers to build leading market positions and to leverage market access.
And we work relentlessly to ensure that our relationships with our customers are based on mutuality. That means they win and we win. We're always looking for ways to create value to our customers, knowing full well that this year's unique FMC customer program could be imitated by competitors tomorrow. Today, we have an extensive idea of pipelines and concepts, all aimed at created sustaining, superior customer intimacy in our key markets for many years to come.
So now let me talk about future growth. As I've just explained FMC has carved out its own distinctive place in the market transforming its AG business into a globally cost competitive segment focused unique solutions provider. 
While aggregating technologies, competitive sourcing and developing superior customer intimacy have been keys to our past successes and will we believe continue to remain essential elements of our strategy, we will not rely on these exclusively to continue to drive profitable future growth.
Importantly, we are actively pursuing three strategic growth initiatives which we expect to help us drive future profit growth. The first initiative is developing and expanding vital alliances. We already have a proven track record of increasing values through alliances and have identified a number of alliances aimed at expanding our profit line or at enhancing market access in focus markets. Our alliances also include the areas of manufacturing and technology access and development.
The second initiative is expanding into adjacent spaces with crop protection market. This entails identifying, developing and potentially acquiring physicians and technologies that are adjacent to traditional chemical crop protection products and that would allow us to leverage our skills, innovation, market access and consummate images. An example would be development of a line of biological products which we could enhance with our novel technology platform. We currently have more than 20 different biological products in various test programs across the world.
However, biologicals are example of an adjacent phase. We are exploring our neighboring opportunities with future EBIT growth potential. Our third initiative is size transformation. This entails acquiring products, technologies and/or businesses. 
While this is not necessarily a new initiative, it is a key element of our ongoing strategy to strengthen market position and to drive sales and profit growth. In particular, we are currently considering several bolt-on acquisitions that are complementary to our crop protection business. We believe that there will be more opportunities to consider than have been available over the past several years and we also believe that FMC is well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities as we arise.
So in summary, FMC has spent years developing a culture focused on bottom line profitability and return. The interrelationships between our strategy of aggregating technologies, our sourcing model and our agile marketing approach to develop customer intimacy create a sustainable long term competitive advantage for FMC.
Unquestionably our competitive edge relies on our resourceful team of people, their commitment to productivity and our empowering organization structure. While we will aggressively pursue alliances, expand into adjacent spaces where feasible and make size transforming acquisitions in order to complement our paradigm breaking strategy of growing innovation, these strategies and initiatives are all geared towards continued profitable growth for the foreseeable future.
Finally, let me reaffirm our outlook for the remainder of 2010. Third quarter earnings are expected to be up approximately 25% compared with the prior year driven by growth in Brazil and Asia. Based on current commodity prices and planting intention, the outlook for the 2010, 2011 the whole market season is quite positive and we expect this to benefit our second half performance.
For the full year 2010, we project revenue to be up approximately 10% reflecting increased volumes in most regions, particularly Brazil. Due to the projected improving market condition in growth and new and recently introduced products. And finally, I wish to reaffirm full year earnings growth in the mid single-digits reflecting higher sales in most regions partially offset by the higher first half inventory costs, less favorable product and geographic mix and increased spending on growth initiatives.
Thanks for your time. I look forward to taking your questions during the Q&A session. And I’d now like to turn the call over to Kim Foster.

As a reminder, free cash flow is defined as after acquisitions but before cash returned to shareholders. Our year-to-date free cash flow is in line with our expectations and we are maintaining our free cash flow projection for 2010 at approximately $200 million.
I'd now like to make a comment curtaining FMC's consolidated SG&A or selling, general and administrative spending for the quarter. For the second quarter, our SG&A spending was $96 million, up $21 million or 28% from the second quarter of 2009. The increase was driven by six factors. First and by far the largest is an increase in pension expense which stems from the dramatic market declines in 2008.
Second, changes in exchange rate have resulted in spending in our foreign businesses being translated into higher US dollar amounts. This impact is most pronounced in EBGs, operations in Brazil where the Brazilian real has strengthened 20% versus the US dollar in the period to being compared.
Third, performance-based incentives are higher than a year ago. In the second quarter of last year, we revised our full year guidance downward and consequently reduced our projected incentive-based compensation for that period.
Fourth is disclosed many times in the past six months we will have higher consulting expenses associated with several of our vision 2015 initiatives. The initial focus for spending will be on our global procurement initiative, which we now expect to deliver $50 million in annual savings from the procurement initiative should begin in 2011 and reach maturity in two to three years.
Fifth, as we've discussed for the past year, we have increased spending on growth initiatives and agricultural products. And finally, we’re experiencing higher costs during the transition of Chief Executive Officers. These costs have been fully disclosed.
In summary, our spending on recurring SG&A remains tightly under control and we are selectively investing in several focused initiatives that will deliver improved profitability in the near future. Regarding share repurchase, during the quarter we repurchased 410,000 shares for a total value of $25 million.
The share repurchase has essentially offset the year-to-date dilution from the issuance of restricted stock and stock option exercises. Our stock repurchase program will continue with the goal of offsetting future dilution. The existing board authorization has $165 million remaining.
With that, I'll now turn the call back to you, Pierre.

We expect biopolymer to achieve its sixth year for recall earnings and lithium to realize significant earnings improvement through a robust demand recovery in lithium primary.
In industrial chemicals we project earnings to be up 25% to 30% on the strength of a significant volume rebound and favorable raw materials costs partially offset by reduced selling prices and higher plant outage costs. Moving now to our outlook for the third quarter, we expect earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $1.00 to $1.15 per diluted share. A 21% increase above last year at the midpoint of this range. 
Double-digit earning increases are expected in all three business segments. In agricultural products we look for third quarter earnings to be up approximately 25% driven by growth in Brazil and Asia.
In specialty chemicals earnings are expected to be up approximately 15% driven by continued strong commercial performance in biopolymer and higher volume in lithium primaries. In industrial chemicals we expect earnings to be up in the low teens as higher volumes and lower raw material costs are partially offset by reduced selling prices and higher plant outage costs which we previously mentioned.
With that I thank you for your time and attention. I'll be happy to take your questions. Operator, please.

It was particularly true in soda ash as it related to export demand and share within Ansac. So if you look, for example at the demand for soda ash and year-to-date, total sales were probably around 8%, but Ansac, for example, demand is up some 52%. So that sort of gives you an idea where the split. Similarly in peroxygens and phosphates we've seen a big rebound in demand just based on year-over-year recovery.

The question in this space where we are looking for acquisition is always the one of multiples, because when you look for properties in AG or pharma or food, you tend to have pretty healthy multiple, and I would say today the kind of multiples, which are at the beginning of negotiation would be somewhere around between nine times and 12 times EBITDA. Certainly at 12 times EBITDA it becomes a diligent acquisition for us, so not the kind of premium we are willing to pay, but in the lower range we are talking to quite a few firms today.

This is when we will make decision. Most likely it will lead to a partial reopening of Granger sometime next year. Now as I'm sure you understand we do have the flexibility with the type of facility we have in Granger solution mining to have partial opening. We don't need to have a full opening of the entire facility bringing very large volumes. So we will most likely go through a partial reopening if demand keeps on justifying that sometime next year with addition to second quarter.

First we'll maintain our financial strength and strategy flexibility. We have a solid balance sheet and investment grade rating.
We have the capacity to take on more debt, but will only do that for the right opportunities, highly strategic accretive acquisitions. High liquidity profile is conservative with debt maturing in the next five years less than $200 million and our cash flow is strong, $200 million pre-cash flow is projected this year and is likely to increase next year.
Next we are working to lower our cost by leveraging our company size such as procurement, logistic and supply chain. Though we are early in this process we have identified annual procurement savings of up to $50 million at maturity. Saving in procurement could he should begin in 2011 and reach maturity in the next two to three years.
Third, we are focusing on growth in agricultural products and biopolymers. By increasing our emphasis on internal technology development, complementing this already growth by financially attractive bolt-on acquisitions and technology end licensing and balancing our growth toward capturing share in a rapidly evolving economy.
For example, we have announced the consolidation of the five offices and labs in and around Shanghai in one innovation center that we will house our R&D commercial tech service and administrative team. The cost of consolidation into one site from multiple sites is low.
Fourth with, we intend to enhance our additional chemicals portfolio by leveraging our strength in sodaash and peroxygen, while reducing the earnings volatility as was associated with the first stated business. We continue to reevaluate and remain optimistic about the potential to develop a new environmental solution platform. We are pursuing a number of promising opportunities spanning air, soil and water treatment which liberates existing property and green chemistry.
And finally our fifth strategy first is to position our lithium business for the middle of this decade as the next growth platform. The capacity increase of 30% we recently announced is progressing well with a scheduled on-stream in the fourth quarter 2011. In addition, we have begun to look for our next source of lithium in order to be ready by mid decade for the next leg of the lithium growth curve.
Our companywide strategy with you is progressing well. This will enable us to refine a business to develop a roadmap for greater top line growth without compromising our commitment to shareholders to deliver sustained earnings growth. The outcome of this effort will be in a development of a five-year vision, Vision 2015 that we will present to our board in October. In December we plan to hold an Investor Day to share our strategic direction and introduce our Vision 2015 for FMC.
Thank you very much. This concludes our call.

As you saw in our earnings release, with very strong third quarter performance, at the high-end of our expected range. We realized strong double-digit earnings growth and significant margin expansion across all three segments. Third quarter earnings increased 28% to $1.14 per diluted share before restructuring and other income and charges, on revenue of $772 million which increased 8%.
In Agricultural Products, sales increased 15% to $309 million, while earnings increased to 27% to $75 million consistent with their expectation. In Specialty Chemicals, sales increased 5% to $202 million with earnings up 15% to $47 million again in line with our expectation. And in Industrial Chemical, sales increased 3% to $262 million and earnings were up 45% to $30 million which was better than we expected. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $83 million or $1.13 per diluted share. GAAP earnings in the current quarter included a net charge of $0.6 million after tax or $1 per diluted share versus a net charge of $37 million after tax or $0.51 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.
With that reconciliation our non-GAAP earnings were $1.14 per diluted share in the current quarter, an increase of 28% versus $0.89 per diluted share in the quarter of 2009. Going forward, our outlook is for the strong performance to continue for the balance of the year. In the fourth quarter, we expect earnings of $0.95 to $1.05 per diluted share before restructuring and other income and charges and for the full year 2010, we have raised the midpoints of our guidance with our expectation for earnings before restructuring and other income and charges to $4.70 to $4.80 per diluted share a 14% increase above last year at the midpoint of this range.
Let me now take a more detailed look at the third quarter performance in each of our operating segments. First, in Agricultural products. As I noted a moment ago, revenue increased 15% versus the prior year quarter. This was driven by higher sales in all regions. In Latin America, the sales increase reflected improved market conditions and growth in planted acres for key crops. In Asia, sales were up in most key countries reflecting improved market conditions, the introductions of new product and favorable currency impacts. Sales in North America improved due to a strong demand in the current market partially offset by lower pressure in the residue market.
Sales in Europe increased as a result of higher herbicide sales and a sequent sale from the second quarter due to the delayed growing season. Agricultural segments earnings increased 27% to $75 million driven by the sales gain and favorable product and geographic mix partially offset by increased spending on new product introductions and growth initiatives.
Moving now to Specialty Chemicals. Revenue in this segment of $202 million was 5% higher than the prior year quarter driven by the continued demand recovery in lithium primaries, higher volumes in selling prices in lithium specialties and volume growth in Biopolymer. Segment earnings of $47 million increased 15% above prior year driven by the sales gain favorable mix in Biopolymers food ingredients business and continuous productivity improvement partially offset by higher raw material costs.
In lithium, upstream primaries volumes increased substantially versus prior year driven by strong battery in Asian demand. In downstream specialties, growth was driven by higher volumes in selling price in Butyllithium. Lithium earnings increased significantly versus last year as a result of the sales gain and continuous productivity improvements.
In Biopolymer, third quarter revenues increased as a result of volume growth in food and pharmaceutical businesses. Biopolymer earnings increased significantly versus a year ago driven by volumes gains, favorable product mix in food ingredients in reused operating cost partially offset by higher raw material costs.
Moving to Industrial Chemicals, sales of $262 million increased 3% from the prior year quarter. Volume gains in soda ash especially in export markets and in North America and European Peroxygen markets were partially offset by lower selling prices. Segment earnings of $30 million increased 45% versus last year as a result of the volume gains lower raw material and energy cost and lower plant outage cost.
This year-over-year performance exceeded our earlier guidance for the quarter in part because we chose to shift to the fourth quarter some outages we usually planned for the third quarter for commercial and operational reasons. In soda ash volumes continued to rebound significantly above last year.
In the domestic market, mid-single-digit volume growth year-to-date is in line with the demand recovery in the flat glass, detergents and chemicals markets. And in the export markets of Asia and Latin America, demand growth is more robust, up approximately 50% year-to-date versus last year resulting from higher market demand and the success of Anzac share recapture strategy. Anzac’s primary competitor in the export market Chinese soda ash exporters have reduced export volume in the by approximately 35% versus last year. Continued constrain from Chinese exports is expected due to input cost pressure and government imposed energy restrictions.
This strong rebound has moved US producers to near full utilization. We expect tight conditions to continue across the balance of this year and into next year. In reflection of this industry conditions, FMC announced a $10 per ton price increase in May for the domestic market and last month we announced another $10 per ton price increase. However, given the full year nature of our domestic contract pricing, no marginal increase will be achieved prior to January 1 next year.
Our Peroxygen business performed well in the quarter, delivering a significant earnings increase driven by volume growth and improved mix due to growth in our specialties business. In specialties, our environmental soil remediation, food safety and oil field businesses all contributed strongly to the earnings increase.
I will now turn the call over to Kim Foster for a review of corporate financial items and to provide our outlook for the balance of the year. Kim?

Continuing on third quarter items, corporate expense was $16 million as compared to $10 million a year ago. Interest expense net was $10 million versus $6 million in the prior year quarter.
On September 30, 2010 gross consolidated debt was $668 million and debt net of cash was $400 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $33 million and capital expenditures were $36 million. Moving to free cash flow, we are maintaining our cash flow projection for the full year 2010 at approximately $200 million. As a reminder, free cash flow is defined as after acquisitions but before cash returned to shareholders.
Regarding share repurchases, during the quarter we repurchased 156,000 shares for a total value of $10 million. The share repurchases we have made year-to-date have essentially offset dilution from the issuance of restricted stock and stock option exercises. The existing Board authorization has $155 million remaining.
Let me now provide you more detail regarding the outlook for the balance of the year that Pierre summarized earlier. For the full year 2010, we raised the midpoint of our guidance with our expectation of earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $4.70 to $4.80 per diluted share, a 14% increase above last year at the midpoint of this range.
We expect Agricultural Products to deliver its seventh straight year of record earnings, with segment earnings up in the mid-single-digits while increasing investment in innovation and continuing to deliver high profit margins. In Specialty Chemicals, earnings are projected to increase by approximately 20%. We expect Biopolymer to achieve its sixth straight year of record earnings and lithium to realize significant earnings improvement through the robust demand recovery in lithium primaries. In Industrial Chemicals, we project earnings to increase by approximately 35% driven by a significant volume rebound and favorable raw material costs only partially offset by reduced selling prices.
Moving to our outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $0.95 to $1.05 per diluted share. In Agricultural Products, we look for fourth quarter earnings to be up approximately 20%, driven by continued growth in Brazil. In Specialty Chemicals, earnings are expected to be up approximately 30%, driven by volume growth across the segment and favorable mix in food ingredients, partially offset by higher raw material costs.
In Industrial Chemicals, we expect earnings to decline approximately 20%, primarily due to the move from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of planned maintenance outages, including the successful completion of the boiler repair at our Wyoming soda ash facility early in the fourth quarter. Commercial performance in the segment will continue to benefit from higher volumes and lower raw material and energy costs, only partially offset by reduced selling prices relative to a year ago.
With that I’ll turn the call back to you Pierre.

I would like to share with you the longer term perspective for FMC in the context of the Vision 2015 initiative we launched in July. As you know, we will provide you with a more in-depth review of Vision 2015 at our Investor Conference in D",1725,"Thank you Kim. I would like to share with you the longer term perspective for FMC in the context of the Vision 2015 initiative we launched in July. As you know, we will provide you with a more in-depth review of Vision 2015 at our Investor Conference in December 7 in New York, but I want to take this opportunity to preview its key elements.
In short, Vision 2015 is about driving strong shareholder value creation by aligning our organization around clear and ambitious financial goals. By 2015 we envision in FMC that generates $5 billion of annual revenue, delivers improved sustained EBIT margin greater than 20%, demonstrate significantly less earnings volatility, sustained high returns on invested capital and provide strong free cash flow.
We have a well-defined executable plan to grow our current businesses above $4 billion in revenue through organic initiatives. The result that by itself would significant enhance shareholder returns. On top of that, we expect external growth initiatives including acquisition to increase its total revenue to $5 billion by 2015.
We have developed a focused disciplined plan that reduces the risk normally inherence in external growth and we believe this target is achievable. Importantly, we believe that our external growth targets will not require all of our expected free cash flow and debt capacity. As a result, we fully intend to return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders. Starting in the fourth quarter, we intent to repurchased $100 million in stock in open market transactions under our existing Board authorization.
We are launching Vision 2015 from a position of strength. FMC’s recent past has been a pure year of a strong financial performance. Most of our businesses now enjoy margins and return on net assets well above peer levels. FMC is also strongly positioned financially with a liquid balance sheet of high operating ROI and substantial free cash flow. Our performance created attractive shareholder value over the period of 2002 to 2009.
FMC delivered 17% compound annual total shareholder return putting us in the top quartile of our industry. Our goal is to sustain these high level of performance and to drive even greater value creation by growing our leadership position, increasing our reach, leveraging the size and scale of the operations and reducing costs, more actively managing our portfolio of businesses and maintaining a highly disciplined focus on our use of cash.
Let me briefly touch on each of these strategic elements. First growing our leadership position. We will strengthen and build FMC’s leadership positions in a current core businesses and markets. We will not seek to add new business leg to our portfolio. We strongly believe our portfolio of businesses and the markets they serve are attractive and provide ample opportunity for profitable growth over the planned horizon.
Second, increasing FMC’s reach. We intend to accelerate the global growth of many of our businesses with a particular focus on rapidly developing economies or RDEs. Our goal is for RDEs to contribute roughly half of FMC sales by 2015.
Third, we seek to capture the value of common ownership by shifting from a globally decentralized model to one that better leverages the size and scale of our company in a few key areas to realize greater savings and operational efficiencies while maintaining autonomy and accountability in the business unit. (inaudible) include optimizing procurements in our supply chain and as I produce these stages building the essential infrastructure in RDEs.
Fourth, we will move actively. We will more actively manage our portfolio, while nearly all of our current businesses and divisions are well positioned for sustained growth, we are continued to assess their performance and address any issues hindering profitably of growth.
And finally, we will maintain a highly discipline and focused approach to cash deployments. During the 2010 to 2015 period, we expect to generate cumulative excess cash of approximately $2 billion. After taxes, capital spending and regular dividends. Our balance sheet strength also gives us the opportunity to increase debt while maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating.
Overall we expect to have approximately $3 billion in variable excess cash to redeploy. As I’ve noted, we intent to return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders over these period as our external growth strategy will not consume all the available cash. Those of you who have followed FMC in the past will recognize the Vision 2015 both the elements of continuity and important elements of change.
Let me begin with what will be different. There are four key change elements that we expect will contribute significantly to the success of vision 2015.
First, external growth in our AG business will be driven by smaller transaction including proto-plan acquisition, licensing, development investments and alliances, and gaining access through third-party active ingredients. We will not pursue transformational or bolt-on acquisitions.
Second, biopolymers food ingredients business is a top priority for M&A. We will proactively seek bolt-on acquisition target to extend into other texturant products, build on our position in developing economies, and evaluate entering into additional specialty ingredients.
Third, soda ash and preoxygens are a highly valued contributor to and clear long-term components of the FMC portfolio. We will retain these businesses as core parts of our portfolio.
Fourth, as previously mentioned, given our expected free cash flow, debt capacity, and expected cash needs, we plan to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders.
While these four elements each represent a degree of change in new direction, the sole focus of our business units provides continuity. When we provide more detail at our December investor conference, I want to mention some initiatives here.
AG products will focus on maintaining premium margin through the continued successful execution of its current business model. Specifically it’s focused on these crops, selective penetration of larger crops, and it’s variable manufacturing paradigm.
Market innovation, improving the productivity of product division export, and reinforcing a different share position through selective external growth are also critical elements to achieve its margin objectives. In addition, we will actively explore opportunity in adjacent spaces in order to expand our technology platform.
Within specialty chemicals, as I mentioned earlier, biopolymers food ingredient business is a priority area for bolt-on M&A. While it continues to pursue attractive opportunities for organic growth and close to customer [ph] and technology development with an increased focus on RDEs [ph] especially China, India and other parts of Asia. Our intent is to maintain and strengthen its industry leading margins while pursuing external growth.
In biopolymers pharmaceutical business, our strategic priorities are to maintain a leading position, increase our presence in RDEs [ph] and very selectively explore adjacent products and markets including positioning ourselves differently in the value chain.
Lithium is also positioned to become a major growth platform and we’ll focus on continuing organic growth in its attractive end markets, enhancing margins and preparing its business for significant growth by mid-decade.
Our refocus industrial chemicals business will produce higher margin, stronger cash generation, and less earnings volatility.
Our soda ash business is a highly valued component of our portfolio with no volatility, strong profitability, and high returns on capital employed. Soda ash will focus on maintaining leadership in the rebounding market and continuing to work to improve our cash position through operational excellence initiatives and advancements in process technology. We consider a grandeur facility, a strategic asset and we’ll deploy its capacity as needed to meet growing demands.
In preoxygens, we will significantly shift our product mix to specialty products and market including environmental and antimicrobial applications. We will consolidate a North American and European businesses into a single global business to leverage scale and accelerate the penetration of specialty initiatives across geographies.
By 2015, we expect the majority of our sales to be generated in specialty applications. Across the businesses of industrial chemicals, we have some promising early stage environmental solutions offering. We currently have two potentially significant applications nearing commercialization. Hydrogen peroxide for NOx control and peracetic acid biocides for shale gas consumers
Though each it depends on successful field testing and regulatory outcomes, this plus a few other potential products across the portfolio could provide the foundation for a significant environmental solutions growth that form longer term.
As we have discussed in recent quarters, we are in the process of restructuring Foray down to its profitable core through the exit of the phosphate business and the consolidation of its preoxygens business into FMC preoxygens.
The restructuring of phosphate is critical to achieving a vision for industrial chemical segment that achieves and sustains the higher operating margin and significantly reduced earnings volatility.
We are currently pursuing two parallel paths with respect to phosphate and are working hard to achieve resolution in the coming weeks. Therefore, we are not in a position to provide any more detail today.
To sum up, I hope this review has provided a good roadmap for you to begin thinking about FMC’s future. Through vision 2015, we have identified a clear strategic priorities and associated financial goals. To reiterate again, a few key points, in agricultural products, we will not pursue transformational or bolt-on transaction, but will pursue growth opportunities through smaller transactions and by building on the innovation under our innovation strategy.
Biopolymers food ingredient business is the number one priority for bolt-on M&A and product line expansion is mission critical. Soda ash and preoxygens are attractive businesses and we believe there are substantial opportunities to drive earnings in both businesses.
Finally, given FMC’s expected future cash generation and investment needs, we will be focused on disciplined cash deployment including returning cash to shareholders. This will start in the fourth quarter. As I said, when we intend to repurchase $100 million in stock in open-market transactions under our existing Board authorization.
This is truly an exciting time for FMC. We look forward to sharing our vision 2015 with you at our investor conference on December 7th in New York.
With that in mind, in today’s Q&A session, we would ask that you focus your questions on our third quarter results, fourth quarter outlook, and only general question regarding our strategic directions. We will be happy to address more specific vision 2015 questions on December 7th in New York.
With that, I thank you for your time and attention. I’ll be happy to take your questions. Operator, please.

There is two major reasons for which we do have such a situation. First of all, remember that business from a learning standpoint was penalized in the first half of the year on inventory cost and there was about a $20 million over two quarters of penalty at the gross margin level. It’s purely accounting, there is nothing to do with the quality or the performance or the sale or the operations of the business.
Second of all, we have made a very conscious decision to increase our spending in market innovation and technology innovation for growth. So we knew getting into the year that those two reasons would create lower earnings growth than sales growth. We do believe it’s going to be a situation where it’s going to change where we will be starting next year able to leverage top-end growth into earning growth.

Year-on-year the lithium business was at 14%, so well within expectations. The pharma business was at 9%, well within expectation. The food business was only up 4%, which is below what we would be expecting, and there is one main reason for that.
As you know, we had an acquisition we made of ISP, and this year we completed the integration process of that acquisition, creating some lower capacity, because we faced some problem in transferring the process and moving that to our North American plant. So what happened is, in this quarter, we were limited in our growth not by customer demand, we actually were operating through the quarter with a significant backlog. But we were limited in our ability to supply products to customers, because of those integration issues. We do have worked those issues very hard and we do believe that they are very close to being behind us and we can resume normal growth very quickly.

And as we said, we had to increase for a total of $20 per ton. And ANSAC announced that grew at $30 per ton increase for export markets.
Now for the domestic market as we said before, we are operating very near to full capacity, so we are just getting right now into contract negotiation. It’s always hard before you negotiate your contract to know where you will end up and how much of this price increase we’ll seek. Nevertheless, looking at the near full capacity utilization in North America, we are getting into those negotiation quite confidence.
Regarding the export market, we do have many reasons to believe that ANSAC will be successful. I think we’re seeing more and more limitation on Chinese export capacity because of their pricing and cost situation. So we do believe that the price increase ANSAC is pushing will result in some success. Once again, this price increase for us applies to Latin America where most of the contracts are, and we also have to know until we get closer to January.
We might actually in Asia outside of China see some impact of this price increase, because we’re operating on shorter term contract in Asia, and we might be able to see some improvement on the pricing situation for export in Asia outside of China. But really the full impact, John, we will know that when we get closer to the month of December-January.

I don’t have an exact number for you in terms of the amount of capacity that’s been taken off line. Sometimes it’s hard to track. We do know that at least two significant plants have been taken down we believe permanently, and others have been curtailed, and a lot of this has to do with China and its targets for energy usage as a percentage of GDP, so there were a lot of restrictions in the third quarter.
I think overall, China is operating at about 80% capacity utilization. But if you go into some of these provinces where they’re really up against their targets capacity and some plants have been ratcheted back to 30%, 60%, so it’s really hard to judge overall. What we do know is that exports from China year-on-year are down some 35%. So between the energy restrictions and between their inability to compete on price with ANSAC, there’s been a significant impact in terms of our influence in the export market.

What we would like to expect from a multiple stand point is to make acquisition where past synergies multiple do not create dilution. And of course we like acquisition to be accretive very quickly first year and if not first year, year or two at the latest.
From a strategy standpoint, we are looking at acquisition. If you look we have product line in the texturant business where we do have high market share in niche area, where we are very strong, but pretty much limiting growth to whatever market growth we have.
So our intent - and we believe we could gain share at critical customers if we would increase our position in the texturant market with other technologies than the one we do have today.
So that’s going to be a priority. But once again we thought through that carefully, it’s going to be small companies feeding our strategy, we are not going for by any mean for large transformational deal.

So I’ll certainly be talking at December the 2nd in New York, and hopefully you’ll hear a lot more details around procurement and rapidly developing economies then, but rest assured the work is going forward.

Couple of questions as most of them have been answered. Number one, I know you guys are hedging your natural gas exposure about 80% and by this time of the year you should be mostly hedged for 2011. So my question is what should be our expectations be for natural gas costs on 2011 versus 2010? And then secondly more of a strategic question along the same lines, several companies in our states were half hedged natural gas in the past and proceeding as operating in environment of inflationary natural gas pricing, have backed away from hedging given that the price of gas has declined and projections at least for the near to mid-term are for continuing benign kind of $4 maybe to sub $4 natural gas. So have you considered going away from your hedges or hedging less of your upcoming needs?

First",349,"Yes, first of all let me make sure I’m very clear on these business. It is a critical business from a growth and earnings standpoint. So external growth of this business is absolutely critical. Now here is what is the thinking behind the decision. First of all we do have a very high quality franchise. Our earnings and repeated performance demonstrate that we do have a unique business model which is very sustainable. When we look at other companies which could be potentially at some points variable for acquisition. It is very hard to find any company which is close to the performance for witness model, we do have in our Ag business and we are concerned - I am concerned about potentially having a negative impact if we do acquisitions on the quality and the performance of these franchise.
These specially coming with the type of multiple which are seen to the in the Ag world which are very high and I’m just afraid we would not get the right type of returns taking into account the performance of our business. It also comes from the fact that the agricultural team has encountered maybe stronger way to grow. And I’m talking about smaller transaction. Smaller transaction just stands that they might involve less over cost because they will not be straight acquisition of company but more acquisition of product line. So its licensing each one of it, joint technology development is one of it but think about companies which might have product line which would have a lot of synergy with a product and might not be as critical for them. We would be willing to make significant investments to bring these in our portfolio and we believe it’s a safer way to protect the quality of our franchise.
Now we will uncover more about the size but the actual growth in Ag through these process could be significant by no means. We are reducing that to no growth, it’s still pretty ambitious but a very different approach and a cheaper approach with higher return to do it.

As you saw in our earnings release, we delivered strong third quarter performance at the high-end of our expected range. We realized strong double-digit earnings growth and significant margin expansion across all 3 segments. Third quarter earnings increased 28% to $1.14 per diluted share before restructuring and other income and charges on revenue of $772 million, which increased 8%. 
In Agricultural Products, sales increased 15% to $309 million, while earnings increased 27% to $75 million, consistent with our expectation. In Specialty Chemicals, sales increased 5% to $202 million with earnings of 15% to $47 million, again in line with our expectation. And in Industrial Chemicals, sales increased 3% to $262 million and earnings were up 45% to $30 million, which was better than we expected.
On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $83 million or $1.13 per diluted share, GAAP earnings in the current quarter included the net charge of $0.6 million after-tax or $0.01 per diluted share versus a net charge of $37 million after tax of $0.51 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. With that reconciliation, our non-GAAP earnings were $1.14 reduced share in the current quarter, an increase of 28% versus $0.89 per diluted share in the quarter of 2009.
Going forward, our outlook is for the strong performance to continue for the balance of the year. In the fourth quarter, we expect earnings of $0.95 to $1.05 per diluted share before restructuring and other income and charges. And for the full year 2010, we have raised the midpoint of our guidance with our expectation for earnings before restructuring and other income and charges to $4.07 to $4.08 earnings per diluted share, a 14% increase above last year at the midpoint of this range.
Let me now take a more detailed look at the third quarter performance in each of our operating segments. First, in Agricultural Products. As I noted a moment ago, revenue increased 15% versus the prior year quarter. This was driven by higher sales in all regions. In Latin America, the sales increase reflected improved market conditions and growth in plant acres for key crops. In Asia, sales were up in most key countries, reflecting improved market conditions, the introductions of new product and favorable currency impact. Sales in North America improved due to a strong demand in the current market, partially offset by lower price pressure in the market. Europe increased as a result of higher herbicide sales and a shift in sale from the second quarter due to the delayed growing season.
Agricultural segment earnings increased 27% to $75 million, driven by the sales gain and favorable product and geographic mix, partially offset by increased spending on new product introductions and growth initiatives.
Moving now to Specialty Chemicals. Revenue in this segment of $202 million was 5% higher than the prior year quarter, driven by the continued demand recovery in lithium primaries, higher volumes and selling prices in lithium specialty and volume growth in BioPolymer. Segment earnings of $47 million increased 15% above prior year, driven by the sales gain, favorable mix in BioPolymers food ingredients business and continued productivity improvement, partially offset by higher raw material cost. In lithium, upstream primaries volumes increased substantially versus prior year driven by strong in Asian demand. In downstream specialties, growth was driven by higher volumes in selling price in butyllithium. Lithium earnings increased significantly versus last year as a result of the sales gain and continuous productivity improvements.
In BioPolymer, third quarter revenue increased as a result of volume growth in food and pharmaceutical's business. BioPolymer earnings increased significantly versus a year ago, driven by volume gains, favorable product mix in food ingredients and reduced operating cost, partially offset by higher raw material costs.
Moving to Industrial Chemicals. Sales of $262 million increased 3% from the prior year quarter. Volume gains in soda ash particularly in export market and in North America and European markets were partially offset by lower selling price. Segment earnings of $30 million increased 45% versus last year as a result of the volume gains, lower raw material and energy cost and lower plant outage cost. This year-on-year performance exceeded our earlier guidance for the quarter in part because we chose to shift to the fourth quarter some outages we usually plan for the third quarter of commercial and operational.
In soda ash, volumes continued to rebound significantly above last year. In developing markets, our mid-single-digit volume growth year-to-date is in line with the demand recovery in detergents and chemicals market. And in the export markets of Asia and Latin America, our demand growth is more robust at approximately 50% year-to-date versus last year resulting from higher market demand and the success of share recapture strategy.
Primary competitors in this export market, Chinese soda ash exporters have reduced export volume by approximately 35% versus last year. Continued constraint on Chinese export is expected due to input cost pressure and government-imposed energy restrictions. These strong results have moved U.S. producers to near full utilization. We expect tight conditions to continue across the balance of this year and into next year. 
In reflection of these industry conditions, FMC announced a $10 per ton price increase in rate for the domestic market. And last month, we announced another $10 per ton price increase. However, given the full year nature of our domestic contract pricing, raw material increase will be achieved prior to January 1 next year. Our business performed well in the quarter, delivering a significant earnings increase driven by volume growth and improved mix due to growth in our specialties business.
In specialties, our environmental slow remediation, food safety and oil field businesses all contributed strongly to the earnings increase.
I will now turn the call over to Kim Foster for a review of corporate financial items and to provide our outlook for the balance of the year. Kim?"

On September 30, 2010",483,"Thanks, Pierre, and good morning, everyone. Continuing on third quarter items, corporate expense was $16 million as compared to $10 million a year ago. Interest expense net was $10 million versus $6 million in the prior year quarter. On September 30, 2010, gross consolidated debt was $668 million and debt net of cash was $400 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $33 million and capital expenditures were $36 million.
Moving to free cash flow, we are maintaining our cash flow projection for the full year 2010 at approximately $200 million. As a reminder, free cash flow is defined as after acquisitions but before cash return to shareholders. Regarding share repurchases during the quarter, we repurchased 156,000 shares for a total value of $10 million. The share repurchases we have made year-to-date have essentially offset dilution from the issuance of restricted stock and stock option exercises. The existing board authorization has $155 million remaining. 
Let me now provide more detail regarding the outlook for the balance of the year that Pierre summarized earlier. For the full year 2010, we've raised the midpoint of our guidance with our expectation of earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $4.70 to $4.80 per diluted share, a 14% increase above last year at the midpoint of this range. We expect the Agricultural Products to deliver it's seventh straight year of record earnings with segment earnings up in the mid-single digits while increasing investment in innovation and continuing to deliver high profit margins.
In Specialty Chemicals, earnings are projected to increase by approximately 20%. We expect BioPolymer to achieve its sixth straight year of record earnings and lithium to realize significant earnings improvement through the robust demand recovery in the lithium primaries. In Industrial Chemicals we project earnings to increase by approximately 35% driven by significant volume rebound and favorable raw material costs, only partially offset by reduced selling prices.
Moving to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $0.95 to $1.05 per diluted share. In Agricultural Products, we look for fourth quarter earnings to be up approximately 20%, driven by continued growth in Brazil. In Specialty Chemicals, earnings are expected to be up approximately 30%, driven by volume growth across the segment and favorable mix in food ingredients, partially offset by higher raw material costs. In Industrial Chemicals, we expect earnings to decline approximately 20% primarily due to the move from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of the plant maintenance outages, including the successful completion of the boiler repair at our Wyoming soda ash facility early in the fourth quarter. Commercial performance in the segment will continue to benefit from higher volumes and lower raw material and energy costs, only partially offset by reduced selling prices relative to a year ago.
With that, I'll now turn the call back to you, Pierre."

As you know, we will provide you with a more in-depth review of Vision 2015 at our investor conference in",1689,"Thank you, Kim. I would like to share with you the longer-term perspective for FMC in the context of the Vision 2015 initiative we launched in July. As you know, we will provide you with a more in-depth review of Vision 2015 at our investor conference in December 2 in New York, but I want to take this opportunity to preview its key elements. 
In short, Vision 2015 is about driving strong shareholder value creation by aligning our organization around clear and ambitious financial growth. By 2015, we envision in FMC that generate $5 billion of annual revenue, delivers improved sustained EBIT margin greater than 20%, demonstrate significantly less earnings volatility, sustain high returns for incentive capital and provide strong free cash flow. We have a well-defined executable plan to grew our current businesses above $4 billion in revenue through organic initiatives, the reason that by itself would significantly enhance shareholder return.
On top of that, we expect external growth initiatives, including acquisition to increase the total revenue to $5 billion by 2015. We have developed a focused disciplined plan that reduces the risk normally inherent in external growth and believe this target is achievable. Importantly, we believe that our external growth target will not require all of our expected free cash flow and debt capacity. As a result, we fully intend to return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders. 
Starting in the fourth quarter, we intend to repurchase $100 million in stock in open market transactions under our existing board authorization. We are launching Vision 2015 from a position of strength. FMC's recent task is in a period of strong financial performance. Most of our businesses now enjoy margins and return on net assets well above peer levels. FMC is also strongly positioned financially with our liquid balance sheet, the high operating ROI and substantial free cash flow. Our performance created attractive shareholder value over the period of 2002 to 2009. FMC delivered 17% compounded total annual shareholder putting is in the top quartile of our industry. Our goal is to sustain this highly volatile performance and to drive even greater value creation by growing our leadership position, increasing our reach, leveraging the size and scale of our operations and reducing cost, more actively managing our portfolio of businesses and maintaining a highly disciplined focus on our use of cash. 
Let me briefly touch on each of these strategic elements. First, growing our leadership position. We will strengthen and view FMC's leadership position in the current core businesses and market. We will not to add the new business leg to our portfolio. We strongly believe our portfolio of businesses and the markets they serve are attractive and provide ample opportunity for profitable growth over the plan.
Second, increasing FMC's reach. We intend to accelerate the global growth of many of our businesses. We are particularly focused on rapidly developing economies or RDEs. Our goal is for RDEs to contribute roughly half of FMC sales by 2015. 
Third, we seek to capture the value of common ownership by shifting from a decentralized model to one that better leverages the size and scale of our company in a few key areas to realize greater savings and operational efficiencies while maintaining autonomy and accountability in the business units. Prior -- include optimizing procurement and our supply chain, and as I previously stated, building the essential infrastructure in RDEs.
We will move actively -- we will more actively manage our portfolio, while nearly all of our current businesses and divisions are well positioned for sustained growth, we will continue to assess their performance and address any issues and profitability for growth. And finally, we will maintain the highly disciplined and focused approach to cash deployment.
During the 2010 to 2015 period, we expect to generate cumulative excess cash of approximately $2 billion after taxes, capital spending and regular dividends. Our balance sheet's strength also gives us the opportunity to increase that while maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating. Overall, we expect to have approximately $3 billion in available excess cash to be deployed. As I've noted, we intend to return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders over this period as our external growth strategy will not consume all the available cash.
Those of you who have followed up FMC the past will recognize the Vision 2015 both the element of continuity and important element of change. Let me begin with what will be different. There are four key chain elements that we expect will contribute significantly to the success of Vision 2015. First, external growth in our Ag business will be driven by smaller transaction, including product line acquisition, licensing, development investments and alliances and gaining access to third-party activities. We will not pursue transformational or bolt-on acquisitions.
Second, BioPolymer's food ingredients business is a top priority for M&A. We will proactively seek bolt-on acquisition target to extend into other excellent product, built on their position economies and evaluate entry into additional specialty ingredients. 
Third, soda ash and peroxygens are highly valued contributor and key long-term components of the FMC portfolio. We will retain these businesses as core parts of our portfolio.
Fourth, as previously mentioned, given our expected free cash flow, debt capacity and expected cash needs, we plan to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders. While these 4 elements each represent a degree of changing the direction, the forward focus of our business unit provides continuity. 
While we provide more detail at our December investor conference, I want to mention some initiatives here. Our product will focus on maintaining premium margin through the continued successful execution of its current business model. Specifically, it's focused on niche crops, penetration of larger crops and its variable manufacturing product. Market innovation, improving the productivity of product division and reinforcing our differentiated position to selective external growth are also critical element to achieve its margin objectives. In addition, we will actively explore opportunity in adjacent spaces in order to expand our technology vessel. 
Within Specialty Chemicals, as I mentioned earlier, BioPolymer's food ingredients business is a priority area for bolt-on M&A. While it continues to pursue attractive opportunities for organic growth and across the customer technology development with an increased focus on RDEs, especially China, India and other parts of Asia. Our intent is to maintain and strengthen its industry-leading margin while pursuing external growth.
In BioPolymer's pharmaceutical business, our strategy priority is out to maintain a leading position, increase our presence in RDEs and very selectively explore adjacent products and markets including positioning ourselves differently in the value chain. 
Lithium is also positioned to become a major growth platform and with a focus on continuing organic growth in this attractive end market, enhancing margin and preparing its business for significant growth. 
Our refocused Industrial Chemicals business will produce higher margin, stronger cash generation and less earnings volatility. Our soda ash business is a highly valued component of our portfolio with low volatility, strong profitability and high returns on capital employed. Soda ash will focus on maintaining leadership in the rebounding market and continuing to work to improve our cost position through operational excellence initiatives and advancements in process technology. We consider our Granger facility a strategic asset and will deploy capacity as needed to meet growing demand. 
In peroxygen, we will significantly shift our product mix specialty product and market, including environmental and anti-microbial applications. We will consolidate North American and European businesses into a single global business to leverage scale and accelerate the penetration of specialty initiatives across geographies. By 2015, we expect the majority of our sales to be generated in specialty applications.
Across the businesses of Industrial Chemicals, we have some promising early-stage environmental solutions offering. We currently have 2 potentially significant application nearing commercialization. Hydrogen peroxide for cultural and acid herbicide for shale gas, though each would depend on successful field testing and regulatory outcomes. This plus a few other potential products across the portfolio would provide the foundation for significant environmental solutions growth platform longer term. 
As we have discussed in recent quarters, we are in the process of restructuring Foret down through its profitable core through exit of the phosphate business and the consolidation of its peroxygen business into FMC peroxygen. The restructuring of phosphate is critical to achieving our vision for Industrial Chemicals segment that achieve and sustain the higher operating margin and significantly reduced earnings volatility.
We are currently pursuing 2 power with respect to phosphate and are working hard to achieve resolution in the coming weeks. Therefore, we are not in a position to provide any more detail today.
To sum up, I hope this review has provided a good roadmap for you to be thinking about FMC's future. Through Vision 2015, we have identified clear strategic priorities and associated financial goals. To reiterate again, a few key points, in Agricultural Products, we will not pursue transformational or bolt-on transaction, but we'll pursue growth opportunities through small transaction and by building on our innovation strategy. BioPolymer's food ingredients business is number 1 priority for bolt-on M&A and product line extension is mission-critical. Soda ash and peroxygen are attractive businesses, and we believe they are substantial opportunities to drive earnings in both businesses.
Finally, given FMC's expected future cash generation and investment needs, we will be focused on disciplined cash deployment including returning cash to shareholders. This will start in the fourth quarter as I said when we intend to repurchase $100 million in stock in open market transaction under our existing board authorization. 
This is truly an exciting time for FMC. We look forward to sharing our Vision 2015 with you at our investor conference on December 2 in New York.
With that in mind, in today's Q&A session, we would ask that you focus your questions on our third quarter results, fourth quarter outlook and only general question regarding our strategic direction. We will be happy to address more specific Vision 2015 question on December 2 in New York. 
With that, I thank you for your time and attention, I'd be happy to take your questions. Operator please?"

The food business was only up 4%, which is below what we would be expecting, and there is one main reason for that. As you know, we have an acquisition we made of ISC [ph] and this year, we completed the integration process of that acquisition, creating some lower capacity because we faced some problem in transferring the process and moving that to our North American plant. So what happened in this quarter, we will operate in growth not by customer demand. We actually were operating through the quarter with a significant backlog that we were limited in our ability to supply product to customers because of those integration issues. We do have worked those issues very hard, and we do believe that they are very close to being and we can resume normal growth very quickly."

It's always hard before you negotiate your contract to know where you will end up and how much of the price increase we'll see. Nevertheless, looking at the near full capacity utilization in North America, we are getting into those negotiations quite confident. Regarding the export market, we do have many reasons to believe that will be successful. I think we're seeing more and more limitation on Chinese export capacity because of their pricing and cost situation. So we do believe that the price increase in will result in some success. Once again, this price increase for us applied to Latin America where most of the contracts are annual so hard to know when we get closer to January. We might actually in Asia, actually in China, see some impact of price increase because we're operating on shorter-term contract in Asia and we might be able to see some improvement on the pricing situation for export in Asia outside of China.

We do know that at least 2 significant plants have been taken down we believe permanently and others have been curtailed, and a lot of this has to do with China and its targets for energy usage as a percentage of GDP. So there are a lot of restrictions in the third quarter. I think overall, China's operating at about 80% capacity utilization. But if you go into some of these provinces where they're really up against their targets, capacity and some plants is going to ratcheted back to 30%, 60%. So it's really hard to judge overall.

First o",398,"Yes, first of all, let me make sure I'm very clear on this business. It is a critical business from a growth and earnings standpoint. So external growth of this business is absolutely critical. Now here is what is the thinking behind the decision. First of all, we do have a very high quality franchise. Our earnings and repeated performance demonstrate that we do have a unique business model, which is very sustainable. When we look at other companies, which could be potentially at some point variable for acquisition, it is very hard to find any company which is close to the performance of business model we do have in our Ag business, and we are concerned, I am concerned about potentially having a negative impact if we do acquisition on the quality and the performance of this franchise. These especially coming with the type of multiple which we're seeing today in the [Audio Gap] world, which are very high and I'm just afraid we would not get the right type of returns, taking into account the performance of our business. It also comes from the fact that the agricultural team has uncovered maybe stronger way to grow and I'm talking about smaller transaction. Smaller transaction is they might involve less of occurrence because it will not be straight acquisition of company but more acquisition of product line. So it's licensing and it's one of it. Joined technology provides one of it. But think about companies which might have product line, which would have a lot of synergies of our product and might not be as critical for them. We would be willing to make significant investments to bring these in our portfolio, and we believe it's a safer way to protect the quality to our franchise. Now we will uncover more about the size, but the actual growth in Ag through this process could be significant by no mean we are reducing that through growth. It's a pretty ambitious but very different approach in a cheaper approach with higher return to do it.

As you saw in our earnings release, we delivered strong third quarter performance at the high-end of our expected range. We realized strong double-digit earnings growth and significant margin expansion across all 3 segments. Third quarter earnings increased 28% to $1.14 per diluted share before restructuring and other income and charges on revenue of $772 million, which increased 8%. 
In Agricultural Products, sales increased 15% to $309 million, while earnings increased 27% to $75 million, consistent with our expectation. In Specialty Chemicals, sales increased 5% to $202 million with earnings up 15% to $47 million, again in line with our expectations. And Industrial Chemicals, sales increased 3% to $262 million and earnings were up 45% to $30 million, which was better than we expected.
On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $83 million or $1.13 per diluted share. GAAP earnings in the current quarter included the net charge of $0.6 million after tax or $0.01 per diluted share versus the net charge of $37 million after tax of $0.51 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. With that reconciliation, our non-GAAP earnings were $1.14 per diluted share in the current quarter, an increase of 28% versus $0.89 per diluted share in the quarter of 2009.
Going forward, our outlook is for the strong performance to continue for the balance of the year. In the fourth quarter, we expect earnings of $0.95 to $1.05 per diluted share before restructuring and other income and charges. And for the full year 2010, we have raised the midpoint of our guidance with our expectation for earnings before restructuring and other income and charges to $4.07 to $4.08 earnings per diluted share, a 14% increase above last year at the midpoint of this range.
Let me now take a more detailed look at third quarter performance in each of our operating segments. First, in Agricultural Products. As I noted a moment ago, revenue increased 15% versus the prior year quarter. This was driven by higher sales in all regions. In Latin America, the sales increase reflected improved market conditions and growth in planted acres for key crops. In Asia, sales were up in most key countries, reflecting improved market conditions, the introductions of new product and favorable currency impact. Sales in North America improved due to a strong demand in the cotton market, partially offset by lower price pressure in the residue market. Sales in Europe increased as a result of higher herbicide sales and a sheep wool sales from the second quarter due to the delayed growing seasons. Agricultural segment earnings increased 27% to $75 million, driven by the sales gain and favorable product and geographic mix, partially offset by increased spending on new product introductions and growth initiatives.
Moving now to Specialty Chemicals. Revenue in this segment of $202 million was 5% higher than the prior year quarter, driven by the continued demand recovery in lithium primaries, higher volumes and selling prices in lithium specialty and volume growth in BioPolymer. Segment earnings of $47 million increased 15% above prior year, driven by the sales gain, favorable mix in BioPolymer's food ingredient business and continuous productivity improvement, partially offset by higher raw material cost. In lithium, upstream primaries volumes increased substantially versus prior year driven by strong battery in Asian demand. In downstream specialties, growth was driven by higher volumes in selling price in butyllithium. Lithium earnings increased significantly versus last year as a result of the sales gain and continuous productivity improvements. In BioPolymer, third quarter revenue increased as a result of volume growth in food and pharmaceutical businesses. BioPolymer earnings increased significantly versus a year ago, driven by volume gains, favorable product mix in food ingredients and reduced operating costs, partially offset by higher raw material costs.
Moving to Industrial Chemicals. Sales of $262 million increased 3% from the prior year quarter. Volume gains in soda ash, especially in export market and in North America and European peroxygen markets were partially offset by lower selling price. Segment earnings of $30 million increased 45% versus last year as a result of the volume gains, lower raw material and energy cost and lower plant outage costs. This year-on-year performance exceeded our earlier guidance for the quarter in part because we chose to shift to the fourth quarter some outages we've usually planned for the third quarter for commercial and operational reasons.
In soda ash, volumes continued to rebound significantly above last year. In the domestic markets, our mid-single digit volume growth year-to-date is in line with the demand recovery in flat glass, detergents and chemicals market. And in the export markets of Asia and Latin America, our demand growth is more robust, up approximately 50% year-to-date versus last year resulting from higher market demand and the success of ANSAC share recapture strategy. ANSAC primary competitors in this export market, Chinese soda ash exporters, have reduced export volume by approximately 35% versus last year. Continued constraint on Chinese export is expected due to input cost pressure and government-imposed energy restrictions. This strong rebound have moved U.S. producers to near full utilization. We expect tight conditions to continue across the balance of this year and into next year. 
In reflection of these industry conditions, FMC announced a $10 per ton price increase in May for the domestic market. And last month, we announced another $10 per ton price increase. However, given the full year nature of our domestic contract pricing, no material increase will be achieved prior to January 1 next year. Our peroxygens business performed well in the quarter, delivering a significant earnings increase driven by volume growth and improved mix due to growth in our specialties business. In specialties, our environmental solar mediation, food safety and oil field businesses all contributed strongly to the earnings increase.
I will now turn the call over to Kim Foster for a review of corporate financial items and to provide our outlook for the balance of the year. Kim?"

Continuing on third quarter items, corporate expense was $16 million as compared to $10 million a year ago. Interest expense net was $10 million versus $6 million in the prior year quarter. On September 30, 2010",483,"Thanks, Pierre, and good morning, everyone. Continuing on third quarter items, corporate expense was $16 million as compared to $10 million a year ago. Interest expense net was $10 million versus $6 million in the prior year quarter. On September 30, 2010, gross consolidated debt was $668 million and debt net of cash was $400 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $33 million and capital expenditures were $36 million.
Moving to free cash flow, we are maintaining our cash flow projection for the full year 2010 at approximately $200 million. As a reminder, free cash flow is defined as after acquisitions but before cash returned to shareholders. Regarding share repurchases during the quarter, we repurchased 156,000 shares for a total value of $10 million. The share repurchases we have made year-to-date have essentially offset dilution from the issuance of restricted stock and stock option exercises. The existing board authorization has $155 million remaining. 
Let me now provide more detail regarding the outlook for the balance of the year that Pierre summarized earlier. For the full year 2010, we've raised the midpoint of our guidance with our expectation of earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $4.70 to $4.80 per diluted share, a 14% increase above last year at the midpoint of this range. We expect the Agricultural Products to deliver its seventh straight year of record earnings, with segment earnings up in the mid-single digits while increasing investment in innovation and continuing to deliver high profit margins.
In Specialty Chemicals, earnings are projected to increase by approximately 20%. We expect BioPolymer to achieve its sixth straight year of record earnings and lithium to realize significant earnings improvement through the robust demand recovery in lithium primaries. In Industrial Chemicals, we project earnings to increase by approximately 35% driven by a significant volume rebound and favorable raw material costs, only partially offset by reduced selling prices.
Moving to our outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $0.95 to $1.05 per diluted share. In Agricultural Products, we look for fourth quarter earnings to be up approximately 20%, driven by continued growth in Brazil. In Specialty Chemicals, earnings are expected to be up approximately 30%, driven by volume growth across the segment and favorable mix in food ingredients, partially offset by higher raw material costs. In Industrial Chemicals, we expect earnings to decline approximately 20% primarily due to the move from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of the planned maintenance outages including the successful completion of the boiler repair at our Wyoming soda ash facility early in the fourth quarter. Commercial performance in the segment will continue to benefit from higher volumes and lower raw material and energy costs, only partially offset by reduced selling prices relative to a year ago.
With that, I'll now turn the call back to you, Pierre."

I would like to share with you the longer-term perspective for FMC in the context of the Vision 2015 initiative we launched in July. As you know, we will provide you with a more in-depth review of Vision 2015 at our investor conference on",1716,"Thank you, Kim. I would like to share with you the longer-term perspective for FMC in the context of the Vision 2015 initiative we launched in July. As you know, we will provide you with a more in-depth review of Vision 2015 at our investor conference on December 2 in New York, but I want to take this opportunity to preview its key elements. 
In short, Vision 2015 is about driving strong shareholder value creation by aligning our organization around clear and ambitious financial growth. By 2015, we envision an FMC that generate $5 billion of annual revenue, delivers improved sustained EBIT margin greater than 20%, demonstrate significantly less earnings volatility, sustain high returns on investment capital and provide strong free cash flow. We have a well-defined executable plan to grew our current businesses above $4 billion in revenue through organic initiatives. The result that, by itself, would significantly enhance shareholder return.
On top of that, we expect external growth initiatives, including acquisition, to increase our total revenue to $5 billion by 2015. We have developed a focused disciplined plan that reduces the risk normally inherent in external growth and believe this target is achievable. Importantly, we believe that our external growth target will not require all of our expected free cash flow and debt capacity. As a result, we fully intend to return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders. 
Starting in the fourth quarter, we intend to repurchase $100 million in stock in open market transactions under our existing board authorization. We are launching Vision 2015 from a position of strength. FMC's recent past has been a period of strong financial performance. Most of our businesses now enjoy margins and return on net assets well above peer levels. FMC is also strongly positioned financially with a liquid balance sheet, with high operating ROI and substantial free cash flow. Our performance created attractive shareholder value over the period of 2002 to 2009. FMC delivered 17% compound total annual total shareholder return, putting us in the top quartile of our industry. Our goal is to sustain this high level of performance and to drive even greater value creation by growing our leadership position, increasing our reach, leveraging the size and scale of our operations and reducing cost, more actively managing our portfolio of businesses and maintaining a highly disciplined focus on our use of cash. 
Let me briefly touch on each of these strategic elements. First, growing our leadership position. We will strengthen and build FMC's leadership positions in our current core businesses and market. We will not seek to add the new business leg to our portfolio. We strongly believe our portfolio of businesses and the markets they serve are attractive and provide ample opportunity for profitable growth over the planned horizon.
Second, increasing FMC's reach. We intend to accelerate the global growth of many of our businesses with a particular focus on rapidly developing economies or RDEs. Our goal is for RDEs to contribute roughly half of FMC sales by 2015. 
Third, we seek to capture the value of common ownership by shifting from a novelly decentralized model to one that better leverages the size and scale of our company in a few key areas to realize greater savings and operational efficiencies while maintaining autonomy and accountability in the business units. Prior area include optimizing procurement and our supply chain. And as I previously stated, building the essential infrastructure in RDEs.
Fourth,  we will move actively -- we will more actively manage our portfolio, while nearly all of our current businesses and divisions are well positioned for sustained growth, we will continue to assess their performance and address any issues hindering profitability for growth. And finally, we will maintain a highly disciplined and focused approach to cash deployment.
During the 2010 to 2015 period, we expect to generate cumulative excess cash of approximately $2 billion after taxes, capital spending and regular dividends. Our balance sheet strength also gives us the opportunity to increase debt while maintaining the strong investment grade credit rating. Overall, we expect to have approximately $3 billion in available excess cash to be deployed. As I've noted, we intend to return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders over this period as our external growth strategy will not consume all the available cash.
Those of you who have followed up FMC the past will recognize the Vision 2015 both the elements of continuity and important element of change. Let me begin with what will be different. There are 4 key change element that we expect will contribute significantly to the success of Vision 2015. First, external growth in our Ag business will be driven by smaller transaction, including product line acquisition, licensing, development investments and alliances and gaining access to third-party active ingredients. We will not pursue transformational or bolt-on acquisitions.
Second, BioPolymer's food ingredients business is a top priority for M&A. We will proactively seek bolt-on acquisition targets to extend into other texturant product, build on our position revenue in developing economies and evaluate entry into additional specialty ingredients. Third, soda ash and peroxygens are highly valued contributor and key long-term components of the FMC portfolio. We will retain these businesses as core parts of our portfolio.
Fourth, as previously mentioned, given our expected free cash flow, debt capacity and expected cash needs, we plan to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders. While these 4 elements each represent a degree of change in our direction, the forward focus of our business unit provides continuity. While we provide more detail at our December 2 investor conference, I want to mention some initiatives here. 
Our products will focus on maintaining premium margin through the continued successful execution of its current business model. Specifically, its focus on niche crops, selective penetration of larger crops and its variable manufacturing paradigm. Market innovation, improving the productivity of product division export and reinforcing a differentiated position to selective external growth are also critical element to achieve its margin objectives. In addition, we will actively explore opportunity in adjacent spaces in order to expand our technology platform. 
Within Specialty Chemicals, as I mentioned earlier, BioPolymer's food ingredients business is a priority area for bolt-on M&A. While it continues to pursue attractive opportunities for organic growth and across the customer and technology development with an increased focus on RDEs, especially China, India and other parts of Asia. Our intent is to maintain and strengthen its industry-leading margin while pursuing external growth.
In BioPolymer's pharmaceutical business, our strategy priorities are to maintain our leading positions, increase our presence in RDEs and very selectively explore adjacent products and markets including positioning ourselves differently in the value chain. Lithium is also positioned to become a major growth platform and we will focus on continuing organic growth in this attractive end market, enhancing margins and preparing its business for significant growth by mid-decade.
Our refocused Industrial Chemicals business will produce higher margin, stronger cash generation and less earnings volatility. Our soda ash business is a highly valued component of our portfolio with low volatility, strong profitability and high returns on capital employed. Soda ash will focus on maintaining leadership in a rebounding market and continuing to work to improve our cost position through operational excellence initiative and advancement in process technology. We consider our Granger facility a strategic asset and will deploy its capacity as needed to meet growing demand. 
In peroxygen, we will significantly shift our product mix to specialty products and markets, including environmental and anti-microbial applications. We will consolidate our North American and European businesses into a single global business to leverage scale and accelerate the penetration of specialty initiative across geographies. By 2015, we expect the majority of our sales to be generated in specialty applications.
Across the businesses of Industrial Chemicals, we have some promising early-stage environmental solutions offering. We currently have 2 potentially significant applications nearing commercialization. Hydrogen peroxide for NOx control peracetic acid biocide for shale gas consumers. Though each -- it depends on successful field testing and regulatory outcomes. This, plus a few other potential products across the portfolio, could provide the foundation for a significant environmental solutions growth platform longer term. 
As we have discussed in recent quarters, we are in the process of restructuring Foret down to its profitable core through the exit of the phosphate business and the consolidation of its peroxygen business into FMC peroxygens. The restructuring of phosphate is critical to achieving our vision for Industrial Chemicals segment that achieve and sustain the higher operating margin and significantly reduced earnings volatility. We are currently pursuing 2 parallel paths with respect to phosphate and are working hard to achieve resolution in the coming weeks. Therefore, we are not in a position to provide any more detail today.
To sum up, I hope this review has provided a good roadmap for you to begin thinking about FMC's future. Through Vision 2015, we have identified clear strategic priorities in the associated financial goals. To reiterate again, a few key points, in Agricultural Products, we will not pursue transformational or bolt-on transaction, but we'll pursue growth opportunities through small transaction and by building on our innovation strategy. BioPolymer's food ingredient business is our #1 priority for bolt-on M&A and product line extension is mission-critical. Soda ash and peroxygen are attractive businesses, and we believe there are substantial opportunities to drive earnings in both businesses.
Finally, given FMC's expected future cash generation and investment needs, we will be focused on disciplined cash deployment including returning cash to shareholders. This will start in the fourth quarter, as I said, when we intend to repurchase $100 million in stock in open market transaction under our existing board authorization. 
This is truly an exciting time for FMC. We look forward to sharing our Vision 2015 with you at our investor conference on December 2 in New York.
With that in mind, in today's Q&A session, we would ask that you focus your questions on our third quarter results, fourth quarter outlook and only general question regarding our strategic direction. We will be happy to address more specific Vision 2015 questions on December 2 in New York. 
With that, I thank you for your time and attention, I'll be happy to take your questions. Operator please?"

Year-on-year, the lithium business was up 14%, well within expectations. The pharma business was up 9%, well within expectations. The food business was only up 4%, which is below what we would be expecting. And there is one main reason for that. As you know, we had an acquisition we made of ISP and this year, we completed the integration process of that acquisition, creating some lower capacity because we faced some problem in transferring the process and moving that to our North American plant. So what happened is in this quarter, we were limited in our growth, not by customer demand. We actually were operating through the quarter with a significant backlog that we were limited in our ability to supply product to customers because of those integration issues. We do have worked those issues very hard, and we do believe that they are very close to being behind us, and we can resume normal growth very quickly."

Now for the domestic market, as we said before, we are operating very near to full capacity, so we are just getting right now into contract negotiations. It's always hard before you negotiate your contract to know where you will end up and how much of this price increase we'll see. Nevertheless, looking at the near full capacity utilization in North America, we are getting into those negotiation quite confident. Regarding the export market, we do have many reasons to believe that ANSAC will be successful. I think we are seeing more and more limitation on Chinese export capacity because of their pricing and cost situation. So we do believe that the price increase ANSAC is pushing will result in some success. Once again, this price increase for us applied to Latin America, where most of the contracts are annual, so hard to know until we get closer to January. We might actually, in Asia, actually in China, see some impact of this price increase because we are operating on shorter-term contract in Asia, and we might be able to see some improvement on the pricing situation for export in Asia outside of China.

Sometimes, it's hard to track. We do know that at least 2 significant plants have been taken down, we believe, permanently and others have been curtailed, And a lot of this has to do with China and its targets for energy usage as a percentage of GDP. So there were a lot of restrictions in the third quarter. I think, overall, China is operating at about 80% capacity utilization. But if you go into some of these provinces where they're really up against their targets, capacity in some plants has been ratcheted back to 30%, 60%. So it's really hard to judge overall. What we do know is that exports from China year-on-year are down some 35%.

If you look, we have product line in the texturant business where we do have high market share in niche area where we are very strong but pretty much limiting our growth to whatever market growth we have. So our intent -- and we believe we could gain share at critical customers if we wouldn't increase our position in the texturant market with other technologies than the one we do have today.

It is a critical business from a growth and earnings standpoint. So external growth of this business is absolutely critical. Now here is what is the thinking behind the decision. First of all, we do have a very high quality franchise. Our earnings and repeated performance demonstrate that we do have a unique business model which is very sustainable. When we look at other companies, which could be potentially, at some point, variable for acquisition, it is very hard to find any company which is close to the performance or business model we do have in our Ag business, and we are concerned -- I am concerned about potentially having a negative impact if we do acquisition on the quality and the performance of this franchise. These especially come in with the type of multiple which are seen today in the Ag world, which are very high. And I'm just afraid we would not get the right type of returns, taking into account the performance of our business. It also comes from the fact that the agricultural team has uncovered maybe stronger way to grow. And I'm talking about smaller transaction. Smaller transaction in the sense that they might involve less of a cost because it will not be straight acquisition of company but more acquisition of product line. So it's licensing in is one of it. Joint technology development is one of it, but think about companies which might have product line, which would have a lot of synergies with our product and might not be as critical for them. We would be willing to make significant investments to bring these in our portfolio. And we believe it's a safer way to protect the quality to our franchise. Now we will uncover more about the size, but the actual growth in Ag through this process could be significant by no mean we are reducing that through no growth. It's still pretty ambitious, but a very different approach and a cheaper approach with higher return to do it. 
All right, I think I'm going to go now in my very quick closing remarks. First of all, I would like to thank everyone for your time and attention. We look forward to seeing you at our investor conference on December 2 in New York. And on these words, it concludes our call. Thank you very much."

As you saw in our earnings release, we delivered strong third quarter performance at the high-end of our expected range. We realized strong double-digit earnings growth and significant margin expansion acros",1001,"Thank you, Brennen, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings release, we delivered strong third quarter performance at the high-end of our expected range. We realized strong double-digit earnings growth and significant margin expansion across all 3 segments. Third quarter earnings increased 28% to $1.14 per diluted share before restructuring and other income and charges on revenue of $772 million, which increased 8%. 
In Agricultural Products, sales increased 15% to $309 million, while earnings increased 27% to $75 million, consistent with our expectation. In Specialty Chemicals, sales increased 5% to $202 million with earnings up 15% to $47 million, again in line with our expectations. And Industrial Chemicals, sales increased 3% to $262 million and earnings were up 45% to $30 million, which was better than we expected.
On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $83 million or $1.13 per diluted share. GAAP earnings in the current quarter included the net charge of $0.6 million after tax or $0.01 per diluted share versus the net charge of $37 million after tax of $0.51 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. With that reconciliation, our non-GAAP earnings were $1.14 per diluted share in the current quarter, an increase of 28% versus $0.89 per diluted share in the quarter of 2009.
Going forward, our outlook is for the strong performance to continue for the balance of the year. In the fourth quarter, we expect earnings of $0.95 to $1.05 per diluted share before restructuring and other income and charges. And for the full year 2010, we have raised the midpoint of our guidance with our expectation for earnings before restructuring and other income and charges to $4.07 to $4.08 earnings per diluted share, a 14% increase above last year at the midpoint of this range.
Let me now take a more detailed look at third quarter performance in each of our operating segments. First, in Agricultural Products. As I noted a moment ago, revenue increased 15% versus the prior year quarter. This was driven by higher sales in all regions. In Latin America, the sales increase reflected improved market conditions and growth in planted acres for key crops. In Asia, sales were up in most key countries, reflecting improved market conditions, the introductions of new product and favorable currency impact. Sales in North America improved due to a strong demand in the cotton market, partially offset by lower price pressure in the residue market. Sales in Europe increased as a result of higher herbicide sales and a sheep wool sales from the second quarter due to the delayed growing seasons. Agricultural segment earnings increased 27% to $75 million, driven by the sales gain and favorable product and geographic mix, partially offset by increased spending on new product introductions and growth initiatives.
Moving now to Specialty Chemicals. Revenue in this segment of $202 million was 5% higher than the prior year quarter, driven by the continued demand recovery in lithium primaries, higher volumes and selling prices in lithium specialty and volume growth in BioPolymer. Segment earnings of $47 million increased 15% above prior year, driven by the sales gain, favorable mix in BioPolymer's food ingredient business and continuous productivity improvement, partially offset by higher raw material cost. In lithium, upstream primaries volumes increased substantially versus prior year driven by strong battery in Asian demand. In downstream specialties, growth was driven by higher volumes in selling price in butyllithium. Lithium earnings increased significantly versus last year as a result of the sales gain and continuous productivity improvements. In BioPolymer, third quarter revenue increased as a result of volume growth in food and pharmaceutical businesses. BioPolymer earnings increased significantly versus a year ago, driven by volume gains, favorable product mix in food ingredients and reduced operating costs, partially offset by higher raw material costs.
Moving to Industrial Chemicals. Sales of $262 million increased 3% from the prior year quarter. Volume gains in soda ash, especially in export market and in North America and European peroxygen markets were partially offset by lower selling price. Segment earnings of $30 million increased 45% versus last year as a result of the volume gains, lower raw material and energy cost and lower plant outage costs. This year-on-year performance exceeded our earlier guidance for the quarter in part because we chose to shift to the fourth quarter some outages we've usually planned for the third quarter for commercial and operational reasons.
In soda ash, volumes continued to rebound significantly above last year. In the domestic markets, our mid-single digit volume growth year-to-date is in line with the demand recovery in flat glass, detergents and chemicals market. And in the export markets of Asia and Latin America, our demand growth is more robust, up approximately 50% year-to-date versus last year resulting from higher market demand and the success of ANSAC share recapture strategy. ANSAC primary competitors in this export market, Chinese soda ash exporters, have reduced export volume by approximately 35% versus last year. Continued constraint on Chinese export is expected due to input cost pressure and government-imposed energy restrictions. This strong rebound have moved U.S. producers to near full utilization. We expect tight conditions to continue across the balance of this year and into next year. 
In reflection of these industry conditions, FMC announced a $10 per ton price increase in May for the domestic market. And last month, we announced another $10 per ton price increase. However, given the full year nature of our domestic contract pricing, no material increase will be achieved prior to January 1 next year. Our peroxygens business performed well in the quarter, delivering a significant earnings increase driven by volume growth and improved mix due to growth in our specialties business. In specialties, our environmental solar mediation, food safety and oil field businesses all contributed strongly to the earnings increase.
I will now turn the call over to Kim Foster for a review of corporate financial items and to provide our outlook for the balance of the year. Kim?"

Continuing on third quarter items, corporate expense was $16 million as compared to $10 million a year ago. Interest expense net was $10 million versus $6 million in the prior year quarter. On September 30, 2010",483,"Thanks, Pierre, and good morning, everyone. Continuing on third quarter items, corporate expense was $16 million as compared to $10 million a year ago. Interest expense net was $10 million versus $6 million in the prior year quarter. On September 30, 2010, gross consolidated debt was $668 million and debt net of cash was $400 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $33 million and capital expenditures were $36 million.
Moving to free cash flow, we are maintaining our cash flow projection for the full year 2010 at approximately $200 million. As a reminder, free cash flow is defined as after acquisitions but before cash returned to shareholders. Regarding share repurchases during the quarter, we repurchased 156,000 shares for a total value of $10 million. The share repurchases we have made year-to-date have essentially offset dilution from the issuance of restricted stock and stock option exercises. The existing board authorization has $155 million remaining. 
Let me now provide more detail regarding the outlook for the balance of the year that Pierre summarized earlier. For the full year 2010, we've raised the midpoint of our guidance with our expectation of earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $4.70 to $4.80 per diluted share, a 14% increase above last year at the midpoint of this range. We expect the Agricultural Products to deliver its seventh straight year of record earnings, with segment earnings up in the mid-single digits while increasing investment in innovation and continuing to deliver high profit margins.
In Specialty Chemicals, earnings are projected to increase by approximately 20%. We expect BioPolymer to achieve its sixth straight year of record earnings and lithium to realize significant earnings improvement through the robust demand recovery in lithium primaries. In Industrial Chemicals, we project earnings to increase by approximately 35% driven by a significant volume rebound and favorable raw material costs, only partially offset by reduced selling prices.
Moving to our outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $0.95 to $1.05 per diluted share. In Agricultural Products, we look for fourth quarter earnings to be up approximately 20%, driven by continued growth in Brazil. In Specialty Chemicals, earnings are expected to be up approximately 30%, driven by volume growth across the segment and favorable mix in food ingredients, partially offset by higher raw material costs. In Industrial Chemicals, we expect earnings to decline approximately 20% primarily due to the move from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of the planned maintenance outages including the successful completion of the boiler repair at our Wyoming soda ash facility early in the fourth quarter. Commercial performance in the segment will continue to benefit from higher volumes and lower raw material and energy costs, only partially offset by reduced selling prices relative to a year ago.
With that, I'll now turn the call back to you, Pierre."
28606,113942482,163469,"FMC Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","FMC Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kim. I would like to share with you the longer-term perspective for FMC in the context of the Vision 2015 initiative we launched in July. As you know, we will provide you with a more in-depth review of Vision 2015 at our investor conference on",1716,"Thank you, Kim. I would like to share with you the longer-term perspective for FMC in the context of the Vision 2015 initiative we launched in July. As you know, we will provide you with a more in-depth review of Vision 2015 at our investor conference on December 2 in New York, but I want to take this opportunity to preview its key elements. 
In short, Vision 2015 is about driving strong shareholder value creation by aligning our organization around clear and ambitious financial growth. By 2015, we envision an FMC that generate $5 billion of annual revenue, delivers improved sustained EBIT margin greater than 20%, demonstrate significantly less earnings volatility, sustain high returns on investment capital and provide strong free cash flow. We have a well-defined executable plan to grew our current businesses above $4 billion in revenue through organic initiatives. The result that, by itself, would significantly enhance shareholder return.
On top of that, we expect external growth initiatives, including acquisition, to increase our total revenue to $5 billion by 2015. We have developed a focused disciplined plan that reduces the risk normally inherent in external growth and believe this target is achievable. Importantly, we believe that our external growth target will not require all of our expected free cash flow and debt capacity. As a result, we fully intend to return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders. 
Starting in the fourth quarter, we intend to repurchase $100 million in stock in open market transactions under our existing board authorization. We are launching Vision 2015 from a position of strength. FMC's recent past has been a period of strong financial performance. Most of our businesses now enjoy margins and return on net assets well above peer levels. FMC is also strongly positioned financially with a liquid balance sheet, with high operating ROI and substantial free cash flow. Our performance created attractive shareholder value over the period of 2002 to 2009. FMC delivered 17% compound annual total shareholder return, putting us in the top quartile of our industry. Our goal is to sustain this high level of performance and to drive even greater value creation by growing our leadership position, increasing our reach, leveraging the size and scale of our operations and reducing cost, more actively managing our portfolio of businesses and maintaining a highly disciplined focus on our use of cash. 
Let me briefly touch on each of these strategic elements. First, growing our leadership position. We will strengthen and build FMC's leadership positions in our current core businesses and market. We will not seek to add the new business leg to our portfolio. We strongly believe our portfolio of businesses and the markets they serve are attractive and provide ample opportunity for profitable growth over the planned horizon.
Second, increasing FMC's reach. We intend to accelerate the global growth of many of our businesses with a particular focus on rapidly developing economies or RDEs. Our goal is for RDEs to contribute roughly half of FMC sales by 2015. 
Third, we seek to capture the value of common ownership by shifting from a novelly decentralized model to one that better leverages the size and scale of our company in a few key areas to realize greater savings and operational efficiencies while maintaining autonomy and accountability in the business units. Prior area include optimizing procurement and our supply chain. And as I previously stated, building the essential infrastructure in RDEs.
Fourth,  we will move actively -- we will more actively manage our portfolio.  While nearly all of our current businesses and divisions are well positioned for sustained growth, we will continue to assess their performance and address any issues hindering profitability for growth. And finally, we will maintain a highly disciplined and focused approach to cash deployment.
During the 2010 to 2015 period, we expect to generate cumulative excess cash of approximately $2 billion after taxes, capital spending and regular dividends. Our balance sheet strength also gives us the opportunity to increase debt while maintaining the strong investment grade credit rating. Overall, we expect to have approximately $3 billion in available excess cash to be deployed. As I've noted, we intend to return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders over this period as our external growth strategy will not consume all the available cash.
Those of you who have followed up FMC the past will recognize the Vision 2015 both the elements of continuity and important element of change. Let me begin with what will be different. There are 4 key change element that we expect will contribute significantly to the success of Vision 2015. First, external growth in our Ag business will be driven by smaller transaction, including product line acquisition, licensing, development investments and alliances and gaining access to third-party active ingredients. We will not pursue transformational or bolt-on acquisitions.
Second, BioPolymer's food ingredients business is a top priority for M&A. We will proactively seek bolt-on acquisition targets to extend into other texturant product, build on our position revenue in developing economies and evaluate entry into additional specialty ingredients. Third, soda ash and peroxygens are highly valued contributor to and key long-term components of the FMC portfolio. We will retain these businesses as core parts of our portfolio.
Fourth, as previously mentioned, given our expected free cash flow, debt capacity and expected cash needs, we plan to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders. While these 4 elements each represent a degree of change in our direction, the forward focus of our business unit provides continuity. While we provide more detail at our December 2 investor conference, I want to mention some initiatives here. 
Our products will focus on maintaining premium margin through the continued successful execution of its current business model. Specifically, its focus on niche crops, selective penetration of larger crops and its variable manufacturing paradigm. Market innovation, improving the productivity of product division export and reinforcing a differentiated position to selective external growth are also critical element to achieve its margin objectives. In addition, we will actively explore opportunity in adjacent spaces in order to expand our technology platform. 
Within Specialty Chemicals, as I mentioned earlier, BioPolymer's food ingredients business is a priority area for bolt-on M&A. While it continues to pursue attractive opportunities for organic growth and across the customer and technology development with an increased focus on RDEs, especially China, India and other parts of Asia. Our intent is to maintain and strengthen its industry-leading margin while pursuing external growth.
In BioPolymer's pharmaceutical business, our strategy priorities are to maintain our leading positions, increase our presence in RDEs and very selectively explore adjacent products and markets including positioning ourselves differently in the value chain. Lithium is also positioned to become a major growth platform and we will focus on continuing organic growth in this attractive end market, enhancing margins and preparing its business for significant growth by mid-decade.
Our refocused Industrial Chemicals business will produce higher margin, stronger cash generation and less earnings volatility. Our soda ash business is a highly valued component of our portfolio with low volatility, strong profitability and high returns on capital employed. Soda ash will focus on maintaining leadership in a rebounding market and continuing to work to improve our cost position through operational excellence initiative and advancement in process technology. We consider our Granger facility a strategic asset and will deploy its capacity as needed to meet growing demand. 
In peroxygen, we will significantly shift our product mix to specialty products and markets, including environmental and anti-microbial applications. We will consolidate our North American and European businesses into a single global business to leverage scale and accelerate the penetration of specialty initiative across geographies. By 2015, we expect the majority of our sales to be generated in specialty applications.
Across the businesses of Industrial Chemicals, we have some promising early-stage environmental solutions offering. We currently have 2 potentially significant applications nearing commercialization. Hydrogen peroxide for NOx control peracetic acid biocide for shale gas consumers. Though each -- it depends on successful field testing and regulatory outcomes. This, plus a few other potential products across the portfolio, could provide the foundation for a significant environmental solutions growth platform longer term. 
As we have discussed in recent quarters, we are in the process of restructuring Foret down to its profitable core through the exit of the phosphate business and the consolidation of its peroxygen business into FMC peroxygens. The restructuring of phosphate is critical to achieving our vision for Industrial Chemicals segment that achieve and sustain the higher operating margin and significantly reduced earnings volatility. We are currently pursuing 2 parallel paths with respect to phosphate and are working hard to achieve resolution in the coming weeks. Therefore, we are not in a position to provide any more detail today.
To sum up, I hope this review has provided a good roadmap for you to begin thinking about FMC's future. Through Vision 2015, we have identified clear strategic priorities in the associated financial goals. To reiterate again, a few key points, in Agricultural Products, we will not pursue transformational or bolt-on transaction, but we'll pursue growth opportunities through small transaction and by building on our innovation strategy. BioPolymer's food ingredient business is our #1 priority for bolt-on M&A and product line extension is mission-critical. Soda ash and peroxygen are attractive businesses, and we believe there are substantial opportunities to drive earnings in both businesses.
Finally, given FMC's expected future cash generation and investment needs, we will be focused on disciplined cash deployment including returning cash to shareholders. This will start in the fourth quarter, as I said, when we intend to repurchase $100 million in stock in open market transaction under our existing board authorization. 
This is truly an exciting time for FMC. We look forward to sharing our Vision 2015 with you at our investor conference on December 2 in New York.
With that in mind, in today's Q&A session, we would ask that you focus your questions on our third quarter results, fourth quarter outlook and only general question regarding our strategic direction. We will be happy to address more specific Vision 2015 questions on December 2 in New York. 
With that, I thank you for your time and attention, I'll be happy to take your questions. Operator please?"

The food business was only up 4%, which is below what we would be expecting. And there is one main reason for that. As you know, we had an acquisition we made of ISP and this year, we completed the integration process of that acquisition, creating some lower capacity because we faced some problem in transferring the process and moving that to our North American plant. So what happened is in this quarter, we were limited in our growth, not by customer demand. We actually were operating through the quarter with a significant backlog that we were limited in our ability to supply product to customers because of those integration issues. We do have -- work those issues very hard, and we do believe that they are very close to being behind us, and we can resume normal growth very quickly."

Now for the domestic market, as we said before, we are operating very near to full capacity, so we are just getting right now into contract negotiations. It's always hard before you negotiate your contract to know where you will end up and how much of this price increase we'll see. Nevertheless, looking at the near full capacity utilization in North America, we are getting into those negotiation quite confident. Regarding the export market, we do have many reasons to believe that ANSAC will be successful. I think we are seeing more and more limitation on Chinese export capacity because of their pricing and cost situation. So we do believe that the price increase ANSAC is pushing will result in some success. Once again, this price increase for us applied to Latin America, where most of the contracts are annual, so hard to know until we get closer to January. We might actually, in Asia, outside of China, see some impact of this price increase because we are operating on shorter-term contract in Asia, and we might be able to see some improvement on the pricing situation for export in Asia outside of China.

So there were a lot of restrictions in the third quarter. I think, overall, China is operating at about 80% capacity utilization. But if you go into some of these provinces where they're really up against their targets, capacity in some plants has been ratcheted back to 30%, 60%. So it's really hard to judge overall.

So our intent -- and we believe we could gain share at critical customers if we wouldn't increase our position in the texturant market with other technologies than the one we do have today. So that's going to be our priority. But once again, we've thought through that very carefully. It's going to be small companies feeding our strategy. We are not going for, any mean, for last transformational deal. We do not believe it would fit our strategy and it could dilute our successful business model."

It is a critical business from a growth and earnings standpoint. So external growth of this business is absolutely critical. Now here is what is the thinking behind the decision. First of all, we do have a very high quality franchise. Our earnings and repeated performance demonstrate that we do have a unique business model which is very sustainable. When we look at other companies, which could be potentially, at some point, variable for acquisition, it is very hard to find any company which is close to the performance or business model we do have in our Ag business, and we are concerned -- I am concerned about potentially having a negative impact if we do acquisition on the quality and the performance of this franchise. These especially come in with the type of multiple which are seen today in the Ag world, which are very high. And I'm just afraid we would not get the right type of returns, taking into account the performance of our business. It also comes from the fact that the agricultural team has uncovered maybe stronger way to grow. And I'm talking about smaller transaction. Smaller transaction in the sense that they might involve less of a cost because it will not be straight acquisition of company but more acquisition of product line. So it's licensing in is one of it. Joint technology development is one of it, but think about companies which might have product line, which would have a lot of synergies with our product and might not be as critical for them. We would be willing to make significant investments to bring these in our portfolio. And we believe it's a safer way to protect the quality to our franchise. Now we will uncover more about the size, but the actual growth in Ag through this process could be significant by no means we are reducing that through no growth. It's still pretty ambitious, but a very different approach and a cheaper approach with higher return to do it. 
All right, I think I'm going to go now in my very quick closing remarks. First of all, I would like to thank everyone for your time and attention. We look forward to seeing you at our investor conference on December 2 in New York. And on these words, it concludes our call. Thank you very much."

As you saw in our earnings release, we delivered strong third quarter performance at the high end of our expected range. We realized strong double-digit earnings growth and significant margin expansion acros",1003,"Thank you, Brennen, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings release, we delivered strong third quarter performance at the high end of our expected range. We realized strong double-digit earnings growth and significant margin expansion across all 3 segments. Third quarter earnings increased 28% to $1.14 per diluted share before restructuring and other income and charges on revenue of $772 million, which increased 8%. 
In Agricultural Products, sales increased 15% to $309 million, while earnings increased 27% to $75 million, consistent with our expectation. In Specialty Chemicals, sales increased 5% to $202 million with earnings up 15% to $47 million, again in line with our expectation. And in Industrial Chemicals, sales increased 3% to $262 million and earnings were up 45% to $30 million, which was better than we expected.
On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $83 million or $1.13 per diluted share. GAAP earnings in the current quarter included a net charge of $0.6 million after tax or $0.01 per diluted share versus a net charge of $37 million after tax of $0.51 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. With that reconciliation, our non-GAAP earnings were $1.14 per diluted share in the current quarter, an increase of 28% versus $0.89 per diluted share in the quarter of 2009.
Going forward, our outlook is for the strong performance to continue for the balance of the year. In the fourth quarter, we expect earnings of $0.95 to $1.05 per diluted share before restructuring and other income and charges. And for the full year 2010, we have raised the midpoint of our guidance with our expectation for earnings before restructuring and other income and charges to $4.07 to $4.08 earnings per diluted share, a 14% increase above last year at the midpoint of this range.
Let me now take a more detailed look at third quarter performance in each of our operating segments. First, in Agricultural Products. As I noted a moment ago, revenue increased 15% versus the prior year quarter. This was driven by higher sales in all regions. In Latin America, the sales increase reflected improved market conditions and growth in planted acres for key crops. In Asia, sales were up in most key countries, reflecting improved market conditions, the introductions of new product and favorable currency impact. Sales in North America improved due to a strong demand in the cotton market, partially offset by lower price pressure in the residue market. Sales in Europe increased as a result of higher herbicide sales and the shift in sales from the second quarter due to the delayed growing seasons. Agricultural segment earnings increased 27% to $75 million, driven by the sales gain and favorable product and geographic mix, partially offset by increased spending on new product introductions and growth initiatives.
Moving now to Specialty Chemicals. Revenue in this segment of $202 million was 5% higher than the prior year quarter, driven by the continued demand recovery in lithium primaries, higher volumes and selling prices in lithium specialty and volume growth in BioPolymer. Segment earnings of $47 million increased 15% above prior year, driven by the sales gain, favorable mix in BioPolymer's food ingredient business and continuous productivity improvement, partially offset by higher raw material cost. In lithium, upstream primaries volumes increased substantially versus prior year driven by strong battery and Asian demand. In downstream specialties, growth was driven by higher volumes and selling price in butyllithium. Lithium earnings increased significantly versus last year as a result of the sales gain and continuous productivity improvements. In BioPolymer, third quarter revenue increased as a result of volume growth in food and pharmaceutical businesses. BioPolymer earnings increased significantly versus a year ago, driven by volume gains, favorable product mix in food ingredients and reduced operating costs, partially offset by higher raw material costs.
Moving to Industrial Chemicals. Sales of $262 million increased 3% from the prior year quarter. Volume gains in soda ash, especially in export market and in North America and European peroxygen markets were partially offset by lower selling price. Segment earnings of $30 million increased 45% versus last year as a result of the volume gains, lower raw material and energy cost and lower plant outage costs. This year-on-year performance exceeded our earlier guidance for the quarter in part because we chose to shift to the fourth quarter some outages we've usually planned for the third quarter for commercial and operational reasons.
In soda ash, volumes continued to rebound significantly above last year. In the domestic market, our mid-single digit volume growth year-to-date is in line with the demand recovery in flat glass, detergents and chemicals markets. And in the export markets of Asia and Latin America, our demand growth is more robust, up approximately 50% year-to-date versus last year resulting from higher market demand and the success of ANSAC share recapture strategy. ANSAC's primary competitors in this export market, Chinese soda ash exporters, have reduced export volume by approximately 35% versus last year. Continued constraint on Chinese exports is expected due to input cost pressure and government-imposed energy restrictions. These strong rebounds have moved U.S. producers to near full utilization. We expect tight conditions to continue across the balance of this year and into next year. 
In reflection of these industry conditions, FMC announced a $10 per ton price increase in May for the domestic market. And last month, we announced another $10 per ton price increase. However, given the full year nature of our domestic contract pricing, no material increase will be achieved prior to January 1 next year. Our peroxygens business performed well in the quarter, delivering a significant earnings increase driven by volume growth and improved mix due to growth in our specialties business. In specialties, our environmental soil remediation, food safety and oil field businesses all contributed strongly to the earnings increase.
I will now turn the call over to Kim Foster for a review of corporate financial items and to provide our outlook for the balance of the year. Kim?"

Continuing on third quarter items, corporate expense was $16 million as compared to $10 million a year ago. Interest expense net was $10 million versus $6 million in the prior year quarter. On September 30, 2010",482,"Thanks, Pierre, and good morning, everyone. Continuing on third quarter items, corporate expense was $16 million as compared to $10 million a year ago. Interest expense net was $10 million versus $6 million in the prior year quarter. On September 30, 2010, gross consolidated debt was $668 million and debt net of cash was $400 million. For the quarter, depreciation and amortization was $33 million and capital expenditures were $36 million.
Moving to free cash flow, we are maintaining our cash flow projection for the full year 2010 at approximately $200 million. As a reminder, free cash flow is defined as after acquisitions but before cash returned to shareholders. Regarding share repurchases, during the quarter, we repurchased 156,000 shares for a total value of $10 million. The share repurchases we have made year-to-date have essentially offset dilution from the issuance of restricted stock and stock option exercises. The existing board authorization has $155 million remaining. 
Let me now provide more detail regarding the outlook for the balance of the year that Pierre summarized earlier. For the full year 2010, we've raised the midpoint of our guidance with our expectation of earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $4.70 to $4.80 per diluted share, a 14% increase above last year at the midpoint of this range. We expect Agricultural Products to deliver its seventh straight year of record earnings, with segment earnings up in the mid-single digits while increasing investment in innovation and continuing to deliver high profit margins.
In Specialty Chemicals, earnings are projected to increase by approximately 20%. We expect BioPolymer to achieve its sixth straight year of record earnings and lithium to realize significant earnings improvement through the robust demand recovery in lithium primaries. In Industrial Chemicals, we project earnings to increase by approximately 35%, driven by a significant volume rebound and favorable raw material costs, only partially offset by reduced selling prices.
Moving to our outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect earnings before restructuring and other income and charges of $0.95 to $1.05 per diluted share. In Agricultural Products, we look for fourth quarter earnings to be up approximately 20%, driven by continued growth in Brazil. In Specialty Chemicals, earnings are expected to be up approximately 30%, driven by volume growth across the segment and favorable mix in food ingredients, partially offset by higher raw material costs. In Industrial Chemicals, we expect earnings to decline approximately 20% primarily due to the move from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of the planned maintenance outages including the successful completion of the boiler repair at our Wyoming soda ash facility early in the fourth quarter. Commercial performance in the segment will continue to benefit from higher volumes and lower raw material and energy costs, only partially offset by reduced selling prices relative to a year ago.
With that, I'll now turn the call back to you, Pierre."
28606,113942482,165497,"FMC Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","FMC Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Kim. I would like to share with you the longer-term perspective for FMC in the context of the Vision 2015 initiative we launched in July. As you know, we will provide you with a more in-depth review of Vision 2015 at our investor conference on",1713,"Thank you, Kim. I would like to share with you the longer-term perspective for FMC in the context of the Vision 2015 initiative we launched in July. As you know, we will provide you with a more in-depth review of Vision 2015 at our investor conference on December 2 in New York, but I want to take this opportunity to preview its key elements. 
In short, Vision 2015 is about driving strong shareholder value creation by aligning our organization around clear and ambitious financial goals. By 2015, we envision an FMC that generate $5 billion of annual revenue, delivers improved sustained EBIT margin greater than 20%, demonstrate significantly less earnings volatility, sustains high returns on invested capital and provide strong free cash flow. We have a well-defined executable plan to grow our current businesses above $4 billion in revenue through organic initiatives; the result that, by itself, would significantly enhance shareholder return.
On top of that, we expect external growth initiatives, including acquisition, to increase our total revenue to $5 billion by 2015. We have developed a focused, disciplined plan that reduces the risk normally inherent in external growth and believe this target is achievable. Importantly, we believe that our external growth target will not require all of our expected free cash flow and debt capacity. As a result, we fully intend to return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders. 
Starting in the fourth quarter, we intend to repurchase $100 million in stock in open market transactions under our existing board authorization. We are launching Vision 2015 from a position of strength. FMC's recent past has been a period of strong financial performance. Most of our businesses now enjoy margins and return on net assets well above peer levels. FMC is also strongly positioned financially with a liquid balance sheet, with high operating ROI and substantial free cash flow. Our performance created attractive shareholder value over the period of 2002 to 2009. FMC delivered 17% compound annual total shareholder return, putting us in the top quartile of our industry. Our goal is to sustain this high level of performance and to drive even greater value creation by growing our leadership position, increasing our reach, leveraging the size and scale of our operations and reducing cost, more actively managing our portfolio of businesses and maintaining a highly disciplined focus on our use of cash. 
Let me briefly touch on each of these strategic elements. First, growing our leadership position. We will strengthen and build FMC's leadership positions in our current core businesses and market. We will not seek to add the new business leg to our portfolio. We strongly believe our portfolio of businesses and the markets they serve are attractive and provide ample opportunity for profitable growth over the planned horizon.
Second, increasing FMC's reach. We intend to accelerate the global growth of many of our businesses with a particular focus on rapidly developing economies or RDEs. Our goal is for RDEs to contribute roughly half of FMC sales by 2015. 
Third, we seek to capture the value of common ownership by shifting from a novelly decentralized model to one that better leverages the size and scale of our company in a few key areas to realize greater savings and operational efficiencies while maintaining autonomy and accountability in the business units. Prior area include optimizing procurement and our supply chain, and as I previously stated, building the essential infrastructure in RDEs.
Fourth, we will move actively -- we will more actively manage our portfolio.  While nearly all of our current businesses and divisions are well positioned for sustained growth, we will continue to assess their performance and address any issues hindering profitability or growth. And finally, we will maintain a highly disciplined and focused approach to cash deployment.
During the 2010 to 2015 period, we expect to generate cumulative excess cash of approximately $2 billion after taxes, capital spending and regular dividends. Our balance sheet strength also gives us the opportunity to increase debt while maintaining the strong investment-grade credit rating. Overall, we expect to have approximately $3 billion in available excess cash to be deployed. As I've noted, we intend to return a meaningful amount of cash to shareholders over this period as our external growth strategy will not consume all the available cash.
Those of you who have followed FMC in the past will recognize in Vision 2015 both elements of continuity and important elements of change. Let me begin with what will be different. There are 4 key change element that we expect will contribute significantly to the success of Vision 2015. First, external growth in our Ag business will be driven by smaller transaction, including product line acquisition, licensing, development investments and alliances and gaining access to third-party active ingredients. We will not pursue transformational or bolt-on acquisitions.
Second, BioPolymer's food ingredients business is a top priority for M&A. We will proactively seek bolt-on acquisition targets to extend into other texturant product, build on our position in rapidly developing economies and evaluate entry into additional specialty ingredients. Third, soda ash and peroxygens are a highly valued contributor to and key long-term components of the FMC portfolio. We will retain these businesses as core parts of our portfolio.
Fourth, as previously mentioned, given our expected free cash flow, debt capacity and expected cash needs, we plan to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders. While these 4 elements each represent a degree of change in our direction, the forward focus of our business unit provides continuity. While we provide more detail at our December 2 investor conference, I want to mention some initiatives here. 
Our products will focus on maintaining premium margin through the continued successful execution of its current business model. Specifically, its focus on niche crops, selective penetration of larger crops and its variable manufacturing paradigm. Market innovation, improving the productivity of product division export and reinforcing a differentiated position through selective external growth are also critical elements to achieve its margin objectives. In addition, we will actively explore opportunity in adjacent spaces in order to expand our technology platform. 
Within Specialty Chemicals, as I mentioned earlier, BioPolymer's food ingredients business is a priority area for bolt-on M&A. While it continues to pursue attractive opportunities for organic growth and close-to-customer technology development with an increased focus on RDEs, especially China, India and other parts of Asia. Our intent is to maintain and strengthen its industry-leading margins while pursuing external growth.
In BioPolymer's pharmaceutical business, our strategy priorities are to maintain our leading positions, increase our presence in RDEs and very selectively explore adjacent products and markets including positioning ourselves differently in the value chain. Lithium is also positioned to become a major growth platform and we will focus on continuing organic growth in its attractive end markets, enhancing margins and preparing its business for significant growth by mid-decade.
Our refocused Industrial Chemicals business will produce higher margin, stronger cash generation and less earnings volatility. Our soda ash business is a highly valued component of our portfolio with low volatility, strong profitability and high returns on capital employed. Soda ash will focus on maintaining leadership in a rebounding market and continuing to work to improve our cost position through operational excellence initiatives and advancements in process technology. We consider our Granger facility a strategic asset and will deploy its capacity as needed to meet growing demand. 
In peroxygen, we will significantly shift our product mix to specialty products and markets, including environmental and anti-microbial applications. We will consolidate our North American and European businesses into a single global business to leverage scale and accelerate the penetration of specialty initiatives across geographies. By 2015, we expect the majority of our sales to be generated in specialty applications.
Across the businesses of Industrial Chemicals, we have some promising early-stage environmental solutions offering. We currently have 2 potentially significant applications nearing commercialization: hydrogen peroxide for NOx control and peracetic acid biocide for shale gas consumers, though each, it depends on successful field testing and regulatory outcomes. This, plus a few other potential products across the portfolio, could provide the foundation for a significant environmental solutions growth platform longer term. 
As we have discussed in recent quarters, we are in the process of restructuring Foret down to its profitable core through the exit of the phosphate business and the consolidation of its peroxygen business into FMC peroxygens. The restructuring of phosphate is critical to achieving our vision for an Industrial Chemicals segment that achieves and sustain the higher operating margin and significantly reduced earnings volatility. We are currently pursuing 2 parallel paths with respect to phosphate and are working hard to achieve resolution in the coming weeks. Therefore, we are not in a position to provide any more detail today.
To sum up, I hope this review has provided a good roadmap for you to begin thinking about FMC's future. Through Vision 2015, we have identified clear strategic priorities and the associated financial goals. To reiterate again, a few key points, in Agricultural Products, we will not pursue transformational or bolt-on transaction, but will pursue growth opportunities through small transaction and by building on our innovation strategy. BioPolymer's food ingredient business is our #1 priority for bolt-on M&A and product line extension is mission-critical. Soda ash and peroxygen are attractive businesses, and we believe there are substantial opportunities to drive earnings in both businesses.
Finally, given FMC's expected future cash generation and investment needs, we will be focused on disciplined cash deployment including returning cash to shareholders. This will start in the fourth quarter, as I said, when we intend to repurchase $100 million in stock in open market transaction under our existing board authorization. 
This is truly an exciting time for FMC. We look forward to sharing our Vision 2015 with you at our investor conference on December 2 in New York.
With that in mind, in today's Q&A session, we would ask that you focus your questions on our third quarter results, fourth quarter outlook and only general question regarding other strategic direction. We will be happy to address more specific Vision 2015 questions on December 2 in New York. 
With that, I thank you for your time and attention, I'll be happy to take your questions. Operator please?"

There is nothing to do with the quality of the performance or the sales or the operations of the business.

Year-on-year, the lithium business was up 14%, so well within expectations. The pharma business was up 9%, well within expectation. The food business was only up 4%, which is below what we would be expecting. And there is one main reason for that. As you know, we had an acquisition we made of ISP and this year, we completed the integration process of that acquisition, creating some lower capacity because we faced some problem in transferring the process and moving that to our North American plant. So what happened is in this quarter, we were limited in our growth, not by customer demand. We actually were operating through the quarter with a significant backlog. But we were limited in our ability to supply product to customers because of those integration issues. We do have -- work those issues very hard, and we do believe that they are very close to being behind us, and we can resume normal growth very quickly."

Now for the domestic market, as we said before, we are operating very near to full capacity, so we are just getting right now into contract negotiation. It's always hard before you negotiate your contract to know where you will end up and how much of this price increase we'll see. Nevertheless, looking at the near full capacity utilization in North America, we are getting into those negotiation quite confident. Regarding the export market, we do have many reasons to believe that ANSAC will be successful. I think we are seeing more and more limitation on Chinese export capability because of their pricing and cost situation. So we do believe that the price increase ANSAC is pushing will result in some success. Once again, this price increase for us applied to Latin America, where most of the contract are annual, so hard to know until we get closer to January. We might actually, in Asia, outside of China, see some impact of this price increase because we are operating on shorter-term contract in Asia, and we might be able to see some improvement on the pricing situation for export in Asia outside of China.

And a lot of this has to do with China and its targets for energy usage as a percentage of GDP. So there were a lot of restrictions in the third quarter. I think, overall, China is operating at about 80% capacity utilization. But if you go into some of these provinces where they're really up against their targets, capacity in some plants has been ratcheted back to 30%, 60%. So it's really hard to judge overall.

What we would like to expect from a multiple standpoint is to make acquisition where past synergies multiple do not create dilution. And of course, we like acquisition to be accretive very quickly first year, and if not first year, year 2 at the latest. From a strategy standpoint, we are looking at acquisition. If you look, we have product line in the texturant business where we do have high market share in niche area where we are very strong but pretty much limiting our growth to whatever market growth we have. So our intent -- and we believe we could gain share at critical customers if we would increase our position in the texturant market with other technologies than the one we do have today. So that's going to be our priority. But once again, we've thought through that very carefully. It's going to be small companies feeding our strategy. We are not going for, by any mean, for a large transformational deal. We do not believe it would fit our strategy and it could dilute our successful business model."

It is a critical business from a growth and earnings standpoint. So external growth of this business is absolutely critical. Now here is what is the thinking behind the decision. First of all, we do have a very high quality franchise. Our earnings and repeated performance demonstrate that we do have a unique business model which is very sustainable. When we look at other companies, which could be potentially, at some point, available for acquisition, it is very hard to find any company which is close to the performance or business model we do have in our Ag business, and we are concerned -- I am concerned about potentially having a negative impact if we do acquisition on the quality and the performance of this franchise. These especially come in with the type of multiple which are seen today in the Ag world, which are very high. And I'm just afraid we would not get the right type of return, taking into account the performance of our business. It also comes from the fact that the agricultural team has uncovered maybe stronger way to grow. And I'm talking about smaller transaction. Smaller transaction in the sense that they might involve less of a cost because it will not be straight acquisition of company but more acquisition of product line. So it's licensing in is one of it. Joint technology development is one of it, but think about companies which might have product line, which would have a lot of synergies with our product and might not be as critical for them. We would be willing to make significant investments to bring these in our portfolio. And we believe it's a safer way to protect the quality of our franchise. Now we will uncover more about the size, but the actual growth in Ag through this process could be significant; by no means we are reducing that to no growth. It's still pretty ambitious, but a very different approach and a cheaper approach with higher return to do it. 
All right, I think I'm going to go now in my very quick closing remarks. First of all, I would like to thank everyone for your time and attention. We look forward to seeing you at our investor conference on December 2 in New York. And on these words, it concludes our call. Thank you very much."
