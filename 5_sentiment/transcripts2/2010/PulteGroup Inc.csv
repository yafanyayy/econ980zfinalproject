I want to welcome everyone on the call and listening via the Internet to this morning’s call to discuss Pulte Homes’ results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009.
On the call with me to discuss our results are Richard Dugas, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Petruska, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Roger Cregg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Mike Schweninger, Vice President and Controller.
For those of you who have access to the Internet, a slide presentation available at www.pulteinc.com will accompany this discussion. Given our merger with Centex and the resulting impact on our reported quarterly results, we have expanded the slide content. We believe these slides will greatly assist the understanding and analysis of our quarterly performance and we strongly encourage everyone to review this material. 
As a reminder, on August 18th, 2009, Pulte Homes completed its merger with Centex Corporation. Unless otherwise identified, results reported in the release and on this call reflect the inclusion of Centex’s operations for the entire fourth quarter although prior period results have not been adjusted for this merger.
Finally, I want to alert everyone listening on the call must be considered forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Pulte Homes believes such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but there are no assurances that actual outcomes will not be materially different from those discussed today. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to the company on the date of this call and the company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information in the future.
Participants in today's call should refer to Pulte's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and this morning’s press release for a detailed list of the risks and uncertainties associated with the business. Certain statements made during this call also contain references to non-GAAP financial measures. See this morning’s press release which is available on our corporate website Pulte.com for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP numbers. As always, at the end of our prepared comments, we will have time for Q&A. We will wait until then to open the queue for questions.
I will now turn the call over to Richard Dugas for opening comments. Richard?

From sign up pace and margins to cost controls and cash accumulation, Pulte Homes’ fourth quarter results demonstrate another quarter of improvement in key business and financial metric",1225,"Thanks, Jim and thank you to everyone joining us on the call today. From sign up pace and margins to cost controls and cash accumulation, Pulte Homes’ fourth quarter results demonstrate another quarter of improvement in key business and financial metrics. 
Our operations are clearly making important strides as we continue to advance on our primary financial priority which remains consistent profitability. Pulte Homes’ fourth quarter results reveal a number of very positive data points. That said, accounting charges related to goodwill, land and merger costs make this quarter more challenging to interpret. As we did in the third quarter we will do our best to isolate the significant charges taken in the quarter in order to provide better insight into the performance of our ongoing operations. Roger will provide more details on the quarterly financial results and at a high level there are several key metrics I would like to highlight. 
First, order rates for the quarter were up 113% on a reported basis. The 100+% increase obviously reflects the merger with Centex. If you look at the results on more of a pro forma basis our Q4 signups were also very strong showing an increase of 32% over combined Pulte and Centex numbers for the same period last year. 
Along with strong orders, we realized continued expansion in gross margin which was 14.2% for the quarter before impairments and merger related costs. Margins expanded every quarter in 2009 as we worked hard to lower our construction costs while improving our selling position by moving towards a build to order model. There is still much work for us to do but we made steady progress over the course of 2009 and expect further margin improvement in 2010. 
Along with reducing our cost of goods, we are realizing similar success in lowering and leveraging our SG&A. Fourth quarter SG&A for the combined businesses was $188 million which is down more than $17 million from Pulte stand-alone last year. SG&A costs as a percentage of homebuilding revenue dropped 170 basis points as we realized meaningful overhead leverage on the volume delivered in the quarter. When you stop to consider we are now running two businesses versus just one last year this absolute reduction in overhead clearly demonstrates how aggressively we are attacking these costs. 
Adjusting for the charges taken in the quarter we have significantly moved the needle in profitability through the gains we have delivered in both margin and overhead leverage. We fully appreciate you still have to count all of the other costs but driving the business to and ultimately beyond break-even are critical next steps to consistent profitability. 
That brings us to the question that seems to be on everyone’s mind. Can Pulte be profitable in 2010? We stopped providing guidance two years ago but I think it is important we help to set expectations. As demonstrated in the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis we are much closer to being profitable than many expected. Organizationally we have positioned the business to be profitable in 2010 but success ultimately requires ongoing stability in market demand and associated pricing.  
Internally we will do our part in that we fully expect to realize targeted synergies and overhead leverage and to capture the benefits associated with the adoption of our build to order model which includes better margins and more consistent closings. Externally while we are cautiously optimistic about housing demand in the year ahead we can’t control macro conditions but can only be prepared to respond as the year plays out. Again in making these comments it is not our intent to open up a financial modeling discussion. Rather, we just want to highlight the fact that our operations have worked very hard to reduce costs and improve their operating position heading into a year in which the macro environment has yet to be defined. 
After three plus years of depressed industry sales and recent signs the economy is beginning to gear up there are reasons to be hopeful about U.S. housing demand in 2010. We continue to believe that job growth and improved consumer confidence are needed to drive a meaningful rebound in new home sales. That being said, we appreciate as the economy gets better the government will look to remove industry supports. The tax credit likely won’t be extended, mortgage rates will likely move higher and the FHA has already outlined plans that will result in some limited tightening of lending standards. Over time we believe that all of the government supports for housing will, and need, to go away. Ideally it happens as soon as consumer confidence and job growth return. 
Regardless of demand conditions in the immediate future, having the opportunity to be profitable in 2010 was clearly enhanced by the strategic decision to merge with Centex. By running the two businesses with essentially one management team we have the opportunity to save over $310 million in corporate and field costs plus $130 million in interest savings we are realizing from paying down the $1.9 billion in debt. We have already implemented needed actions to generate these savings and remain on track towards our stated goal of capturing the first $350 million in annualized savings by the end of the first quarter this year. We also remain confident in achieving the targeted $440 million in annual savings by the end of 2010. 
Beyond these cost savings as a result of the merger Pulte now controls approximately 155,000 lots which means we have a land pipeline that can help drive future sales and cash flow generation. More importantly, the simple fact we control lots and are not under any pressure to acquire additional land positions is certainly an advantage. One of the strategic pillars to the deal was acquiring Centex’s 56,000 lots while retaining our cash position. I think everyone is getting a better appreciation for the current land environment and the limited availability of well positioned, finished lots. 
The long anticipated and feared flood of bank owned lots has not and in our view will not materialize. Replacing this fear more recently has been a growing concern that ""A"" location lots will remain scarce and that lot pricing has already started to rise. We are seeing new land transactions being offered and completed at values that are meaningfully higher than those of just 6-12 months ago. 
2009 was tough but clearly a different trajectory than the prior couple of years. We will have to see how 2010 develops but the company’s ample cash position puts Pulte Homes in a very strong position to manage whatever the market has to offer. If conditions become more challenging we can further liquidate our inventory and increase our cash position. If positions get better we have a supported land pipeline to meet customer demand and the liquidity to fund working capital needs associated with any increase in home construction. 
In conclusion let me thank our employees and business partners for their efforts and commitments throughout 2009. They have helped to dramatically improve Pulte Homes’ results and its near-term prospects. We are in a much improved position heading into the New Year and as we say internally it is time to get back to winning. 
Now let me turn the call over to Roger Cregg for additional details on Pulte’s fourth quarter financial results. Roger?

294550,84988516,49140,"Pulte Homes Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-09-2010",2010-02-09,"Earnings Calls","PulteGroup, Inc.","Executives","Thank you Richard. Good morning. Revenues from home settlements from the homebuilding operations increased approximately 5% from the prior year quarter to approximately $1.6 billion. Increased revenues reflect the increase in unit closings that were above",1785,"Thank you Richard. Good morning. Revenues from home settlements from the homebuilding operations increased approximately 5% from the prior year quarter to approximately $1.6 billion. Increased revenues reflect the increase in unit closings that were above prior year by approximately 13%. 
The average sales price decreased approximately 7% versus the prior-year quarter to an average of $258,000. In the fourth quarter land sales generated approximately $90 million in total revenues which is a decrease of approximately $2 million versus the prior year quarter. The sales in the quarter resulted from the rationalization of our land portfolio and giving consideration to the land acquired during the merger. Specifically, these were assets deemed to be nonstrategic in their respective markets given the positioning and concentration of their portfolios as we look to rebalance the optimized profitability and returns. We sold approximately 40 land parcels of which approximately ¾ were Pulte positions and the remainder was former Centex positions. 
Additionally, we eliminated approximately $4 million in annual carrying costs. Homebuilding gross profits from home settlements for the quarter including home building interest expense was approximately $26 million versus a loss of $84 million in the prior year quarter. For those with access to the webcast slides I refer you to slide number seven which outlines our gross margins and the following details: Homebuilding gross margins for home settlements as a percentage of revenues was 1.6% compared with a negative 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Adjusting the current quarter’s gross margin for land and community valuation charges, interest expense and the acquisition accounting write up for the Centex work in process resulting in a 14.2% conversion compared to 13.1% for the third quarter of 2009 or an improvement of 110 basis points. 
As I have mentioned on our prior conference calls we expect a sequential quarterly improvement in gross margin as we work our way through the backlog of higher incentives from earlier in the year and house cost reduction initiatives we executed during the first quarter of 2009 now benefiting margins on home closings in later quarters. Homebuilding interest expense decreased during the quarter to approximately $41 million versus approximately $61 million in the prior year. Included in the interest expense of $41 million is an additional $11 million of expense related to land and community valuation adjustments taken in the current quarter. 
Also included in the gross margin for the quarter was a charge related to land and community valuation adjustments in the amount of approximately $140 million. For the fourth quarter we tested approximately 53 communities for potential impairment and valuation adjustments. We recorded valuation adjustments on approximately 40 communities for the quarter of which approximately 34 communities or 85% had been previously impaired. Additionally, we impaired three large projects which represented approximately $99 million or 71% of the total $140 million of impairments. 
Of the $140 million of land and community valuation adjustments approximately 49% or $69 million were related to Del Webb communities reflecting adjustments due to current absorption rates and pricing. The total net loss from land sales posted for the quarter was approximately $97 million. The loss is mainly attributed to the fair market value adjustment in the current quarter for land sold and land being held for disposition in the amount of approximately $98 million which is included in the land cost of sales. 
Homebuilding SG&A expenses as a percent of home sales for the quarter was approximately 11.8% or $188 million, a decrease of approximately $17 million or approximately 8% versus the prior year quarter. The current quarter reflects the inclusion of the Centex operations after the merger. In addition the fourth quarter includes approximately $7 million for employee severance costs and merger and integration expenses. If we look at SG&A on a pro forma basis our expenses reflect the reduction of approximately $168 million or 45% from the combined Pulte and Centex SG&A expenses from the previous year’s quarter. 
In the homebuilding other income and expense category for the quarter the expense of approximately $608 million include the goodwill impairment of approximately $563 million, the write off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs resulting from a decision not to pursue certain land acquisitions in the amount of $36 million and valuation adjustments and unconsolidated joint venture investments with a liability reversal of approximately $5 million. Included in the category for the quarter is approximately $10 million associated with restructuring charges related to overhead expense reductions associated with the lease exit costs and fixed asset impairments related to the merger with Centex. 
To further expand on the goodwill impairment, during the fourth quarter and specifically as of October 31 of each year, we perform our annual goodwill impairment test in accordance with ASC 350 where we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by comparing the carrying value of the company’s reported units to their fair value. Fair value is determined using accepted valuation methods including discounted cash flows supplemented by market based assessments of fair value. Impairment is measured as a difference between the resulting implied fair value of goodwill and the reported carrying value of goodwill. 
We had recorded in the third quarter approximately $1.4 billion in goodwill all attributable to the Centex merger. As a result of the test we determined that approximately $563 million of goodwill was impaired. This impairment resulted from a number of factors including the significant decline in the overall market capitalization of the company between the Centex merger date and the goodwill valuation test date, the relationship between market capitalization and shareholder equity and the requirement under ASC 350 to allocate all goodwill to the reporting units even though a significant portion of the goodwill is attributable to the economic value of deferred tax assets and corporate and financing synergies that do not get directly reflected in the fair values of the individual reporting units. 
The homebuilding pre-tax loss for the fourth quarter of approximately $867 million resulted in a pre-tax margin of approximately negative 51% on total home building revenues. Adjusting for the impact of the charges related to the goodwill adjustment, the valuation adjustments and land inventory investments, land held for sale, severance and related charges, merger and integration expenses and the Centex work in process adjustment of approximately $884 million homebuilding pre-tax margins converted at a break-even level for the quarter. 
The pre-tax loss from Pulte’s financial services operations for the fourth quarter was approximately $36 million or an increased loss compared to the previous year’s quarter of approximately $28 million. The loss in the quarter is mainly attributed to an increase in loan repurchase loss reserves by approximately $37 million during the quarter and integration and severance costs related to the Centex merger of approximately $4 million, partially offset by an increase in loan origination principle volume from an increase in settlements. 
Total mortgage principle origination dollars were $906 million, an increase of 7% compared to the same period last year. The increase is related to the volume increase in the home building closing activity in the quarter. Total agency originations were $823 million. Non-agency originations were approximately $6 million and brokered or non-funded loans were approximately $77 million. Additionally within the funded agency originations FHA loans were approximately 45% for the loans funded from the financing line in the fourth quarter compared to approximately 43% in the third quarter of 2009. 
Pulte Mortgage’s capture rate for the current quarter was approximately 81% and the average FICO score for the quarter was 735. 
In the other non-operating category, pre-tax loss for the fourth quarter of approximately $14 million includes corporate expenses of approximately $11 million and the write off of approximately $3 million associated with capitalized bank fees as a result of our completed amendment to the revolver agreement during the quarter. 
For the fourth quarter the company’s pre-tax loss was approximately $917 million. Pre-tax loss includes $928 million for the charges related to the goodwill impairment, valuation adjustments in land inventory and investments, land held for sale, severance and related charges, merger and integration related expenses, loan repurchase loss reserves and the write off of the capitalized bank fees. 
The net loss for the fourth quarter was approximately $117 million or a loss of $0.31 per share as compared to a net loss of $338 million or a loss of $1.33 per share for the same period last year. The quarter reflects a tax benefit of approximately $800 million primarily due to an adjustment in the deferred income tax assets related to the enacted Worker, Home Ownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009 legislation which allows for the carry back of federal tax losses. The new legislation extended the net operating loss carry back period from 2 years to 5 years. 
The number of shares used in the EPS calculation was approximately 376.9 million shares for the fourth quarter. Total shares outstanding at December 31st were approximately 380.7 million shares. 
Now to review the balance sheet for the quarter. We ended with a cash balance of approximately $1.9 billion increasing approximately $340 million from the third quarter of 2009. House and land inventory ended the quarter at approximately $4.9 billion. The total reduction in house and land inventory and land held for sale generated approximately $356 million in cash from the third quarter of 2009. 
During the fourth quarter our new investments in land or in rolling lot option take downs and purchases were approximately $90 million and land development spending of approximately $170 million. With the passing of the new legislation extending the carry back period on the NOL we increased our income tax receivable by approximately $917 million to $955 million associated with the expected federal tax refund and the difference of $38 million is associated with state tax refund receivables. 
In accordance with ASC 740 or FAS 109, accounting for income tax, at December 31st we had net deferred tax assets of approximately $2.3 billion which were offset equally by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of realized deferred taxes. Approximately $1.9 billion in cash at the end of the fourth quarter we had no outstanding balance drawn on the revolving credit facility at the end of the quarter. The company’s gross debt to total capitalization ratio was approximately 57.3% and on a net basis 42.8%. Interest incurred amounted to approximately $69 million in the fourth quarter compared to $54 million for the same period last year. 
Pulte’s shareholder equity for the fourth quarter was approximately $3.2 billion. We repurchased no shares during the quarter and the company has approximately $102 million remaining on our current authorization. 
I will now turn the call over to Steve for additional comments on the fourth quarter. Steve?

Again good morning to everyone. Externally the fourth quarter saw a continuation of market conditions experienced through much of the year while internally we successfully advanced key operating initiatives of continuing the integration with Centex. 
To that last point we grew increasingly confident in our ability to capture the critical benefits associated with this transaction related to cost savings, brand development and land access having effectively absorbed Centex communities into our tracking and reporting systems. We have already started the process of rationalizing some of the combined land divisions along with redesigning and/or rebranding select communities to better match the targeted consumer profile. At year-end the combined operations of just under 155,000 lots of which 89% were owned and the remaining 11% under option. 
Within our land pipeline about 1/3 of the lots are developed which means we are in a great position heading into the selling season and for meeting demand in general. There has been a lot of discussion about the increasing demand for land and it is certainly the case that finished lots in decent locations could have multiple bidders. The obvious result is that land prices are starting to creep up in a number of markets or more specifically sub-markets across the country. 
Our existing land pipeline means we aren’t under any undue pressure to complete deals and we can me more selective in acquiring positions that offer the best possible returns. Further, because we still have land development capabilities in-house we can look at alternative transactions where the land is entitled but we may have to rework those entitlements. Builders that have dismantled their land operations no longer have the expertise to change entitlements meaning they are effectively restricted to bidding on projects in the most competitive segment of the land market. 
Consistent with the comments above, in the fourth quarter we acquired approximately 2,600 new lots while rationalizing some of the combined Pulte/Centex inventory by selling approximately 12,000 lots. Beyond land our purchasing operations are through the first phase of integration which involves among other things a line by line comparison of the material and labor costs for Pulte and Centex. With the best prices identified we then set about assuring that both organizations were at a minimum paying this lowest price. The purchasing group has now moved onto the next phase which is to capture opportunities to take supply costs down even further. 
Given our adoption of key elements of Centex’s build to order model, part of this work involves a detailed analysis of total vendor costs including those specific to how they deliver materials or services to our operations. Home building has historically not been the most efficient business so there are numerous activities to develop over time to increase the time, complexity and/or costs associated with building a home. By partnering with suppliers we can identify these loan value added activities and related products and find ways to eliminate them. 
As part of our Q3 results we talked about targeting purchasing synergies in a range of $150-200 million. I am pleased with the progress we have made to date and the opportunities we are seeing to realize ongoing benefits in the future. Cost savings along with reduced spec sales continue to help our margins which increased 110 basis points sequentially to 14.2% before interest, merger costs, impairments and the work in process write up. Further, given the near-term visibility associated with our current backlog, our expectations are that we can realize additional margin expansion in 2010. 
Moving onto other data points for the quarter, on a reported basis signups for the quarter totaled 3,748 homes which is an increase of 113% over the same period last year. As Richard mentioned just as a point of reference, Q4 signups increased 32% compared to the combined numbers for Pulte and Centex last year. Our Q4 signups were generated from a community count of 882 which is down approximately 8% from the third quarter 2009. Cancellation rates for the quarter ticked up to 25.9% from just under 23% in Q3 although significantly better than last year’s cancellation rate of almost 50%. The cancelation rates bounced around throughout the quarter with no specific period or region driving the changes. 
The higher cancelation rates did roll back our unsold inventory position which at just under 2,800 homes was up 11% from the prior quarter. While up slightly from Q3, this represents a 20% decrease from Pulte stand-along at the end of 2008. Pulte’s reported backlog at quarter end totaled approximately 6,000 homes with a value of $1.6 billion. As with prior conference calls let me provide some comments about how our areas performed during the quarter. The merger makes direct comparisons of sign ups less meaningful so I will try and provide commentary as of the underlying business conditions. 
Reported signups for our Northeast area which is essentially Northern Virginia and Washington D.C. up to Massachusetts totaled about 448 homes. The markets have held up relatively well although we did feel the impact of community closings and uncertainty around the tax credit. In our Southeast area signups for the quarter were 649 homes. We have experienced good demand in our South Carolina coastal operations although this was offset by seasonal slowdowns and some pullback in demand out of our Georgia operations. Given the land positions we acquired via Centex, we expect this area to be a solid performer in 2010 and beyond. 
Signups in our mid-west area totaled 434 homes and look to be consistent with the typical seasonal slowdown combined with a 6% decline in community count. General economic conditions for the Midwest remain very challenging although it would appear they did not get materially weaker as we ended 2009. Our Gulf Coast operations continued to show very strong performance with signups of 1,337 homes in the quarter. Gains were particularly strong in both South Florida and Dallas. In general, demand in Texas has been fairly consistent across the markets while Florida remains difficult with some glimmers of demand in the single family, detached product. 
Market conditions in the Southwest continue to be among the most difficult in the country as both Phoenix and Las Vegas continue to struggle with too much inventory on the ground. Even within this environment we are finding pockets of improvement in markets closer in towards Phoenix. Q4 signups in the area were 429 homes with demand growth in New Mexico being among the bright spots albeit at small volumes. 
Finally, signups of 409 homes in our west area reflected relatively stable market conditions. We are excited about the operations we acquired in Seattle and Portland although they may be among the most challenging land markets we face in the country. Moving south into California we experienced a little weakness in the Bay area but it is likely more seasonal than any real change in demand. In general, closer in positions in both Northern and Southern California are holding up well. It is the further out markets in which building expanded during the run up that are still really struggling. 
In terms of sales, I will tell you our markets are still working through the integration process as they sort through the existing land positions and community offerings which make the demand picture a little cloudier. That said I feel Q4 was a continuation of the relatively stable environment we saw earlier in the year offset by some seasonal weakness and slowing associated with the off again, on again tax credits. 
As I have told our operators I am excited about Pulte’s opportunities heading into 2010. In the month of January we experienced good traffic and conversion rates and we have experienced improvement as each week has progressed which is what you want to see heading into the selling season. With the primary selling season in front of us and the opportunity to create a greater sense of urgency for buyers, we think this bodes well for continuation of these trends. 
Our operators have done a great job managing through a challenging year while at the same time successfully integrating another organization. I know I speak for the entire team when I say thank you to our employers, our employees and our business partners who have been instrumental to the gains we realized last year and we will realize in the year ahead.

In terms of Centex inventory and how that affects margins I think you ought to think about it as more of a gradual improvement than a step up at any one point in time. I think we mentioned on our third quarter call the assets are coming online and the way the purchase accounting works it is going to take some time to realize the full benefit of that. I think reasonably we won’t get to our full run rate of any benefit for some time yet so rather than expect a step up in any one quarter as a result specifically of that. It is going to be more gradual. Having said that, to Roger’s point, we do expect margins better in 2010 than what we delivered in 2009.

We saw some fall off in the Centex traffic levels as you would expect after the tax rebate expired at the end of 11/30 and then was put back in. That was probably temporary. We think those folks will be back out in force. 
Centex is making up roughly 1/3 or maybe 40% of our signups in the quarter. Then the Pulte overall demand remained relatively strong although that is where we have seen predominately more community run off over the last two years and so it is tough to get comparisons unless you dig into an adjusted comparison by community count. Relatively stable traffic counts. Relatively stable demand.

I could give you examples at the foundation level in California we are seeing anywhere from $800 to $1,000 per house savings just in the way we have synergized our operations and combined our trade basis throughout California.

The way we do our pricing with our vendors is on a real-time basis so we are not buying forwards and fixing and pricing like that. Obviously in this demand environment that is very risky. What we have focused on is where we are getting some of these price increases. We continue to focus on the inefficient side of framing for instance. There is a lot more to be gained from picking up framing efficiencies either through panelization, obviously a lot more trussing and certainly on the labor side in general and certainly in maintaining the proper cadence so you can adjust your framing contractors’ overhead appropriately to the size of the business we have. 
Where we have seen some of these cost increases we can isolate it to the cost of the dimensional lumber that is actually going up in price. We have very detailed take offs on every home that we build and the labor market is still pretty soft out there for framers. Net/net I would expect our ability to manage this and keep the framing costs low in spite of some rising lumber prices on an overall basis it isn’t going to be so bad as we continue to manage more through the labor side of things.

It was nothing fundamentally different with the overall business. The business was the same business we had in the third quarter but the difference was the stock price at the closing of the transaction was basically $12.33 and then you have to do the impairment test and basically the date we had because we had chosen it awhile back it was October 31, and the stock price on that date was $9.01. That was basically a drop of about $1.3 billion in our market cap. So there is sensitivity here when you do the analysis on the goodwill impairment to look at what the market cap is and again, now we are basically at a floor of about $9.01 from where we were at $12.33. So really that is the change and that gave rise to the significant part of the write off of the $563 million in the quarter.

A couple of things, I think a 32% order growth over prior year pro forma numbers compared to a couple of other builders who might have been in that range or the 40% range shows that we didn’t give up a whole hell of a lot in volume to drive the business we have. The second thing is we have worked very hard internally to adopt a model that gets us to a more planned production view that ultimately should benefit us in terms of much more level closing volume and much more predictable earnings. We think it is a little irresponsible to chase a tax credit in the short-term for that long-term benefit. 
Unless we saw our business going to nothing, which is not the case…I think Steve indicated that January has started out pretty nicely for us, that we think it is the right approach overall. The government is clearly going to lift support for housing at some point in time whether it is as scheduled here in the spring or some time later. It is going to eventually happen. We would rather have a model internally that allows us to operate in a way we are comfortable for the long-run. I would also just tell you one other thing, with 880 communities out there the chances of us losing a lot of market share is not real great. 
I have said repeatedly on these calls the first place we are going to see an improvement in business is in same store sales growth and the fact we have 880 communities operational and 2,800 specs out there I hardly think we are in a weak spot to not enjoy whatever business rebound there may be.

On a per community basis if we have to go head to head with a very fierce competitor that has a lot of inventory our operators do that and they do it very well. We are not of the mindset if a community operates very well at five or six a month we need to lower the price to try and tweak that demand to 10 a month. We just think that the land control on the ground is a good thing to have and there are margin opportunities by keeping to a proper cadence and we will continue to pursue business that way.

For those of you who have access to the Internet, a slide presentation, available at pultegroupinc.com will accompany this discussion. The slides will be archived on the site for the next 30 days for those who want to review it later. As a reminder, on August 18, 2009, PulteGroup completed its merger with Centex Corporation. Unless otherwise identified, results reported and released and on the call reflect the inclusion of Centex's operations for the first quarter of 2010, although results for the comparable prior year period have not been adjusted for this merger. Finally, I want to alert everyone that certain statements and comments made during the course of this call must be considered forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. PulteGroup believes that such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but there are no assurances that actual outcomes will not be materially different from those discussed today. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to the company on the date of this call, and the company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information in the future.
Participants in today's call should refer to PulteGroup's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and this morning's press release for a detailed list of risks and uncertainties associated with the business. Certain statements during this call also contain references to non-GAAP financial measures. See this morning's press release, which is available on our corporate website, pultegroupinc.com, for reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP numbers. As always, at the end of our prepared comments, we will have time for Q&A. We wait until then to open the queue for questions.

Our first call is the newly named PulteGroup. I'm very pleased to discuss PulteGroup's first quarter results as they demonstrate the significant gains we continue to realize in the critical areas of margin expansion and overhead leverage. The expected benefits from last year's merger with Centex are clearly evident in the numbers and in accelerating PulteGroup's progress toward profitability. In planning for 2010 during last year's budgeting process, we worked under the assumption that demand for new homes in 2010 would be comparable to what we experienced in 2009. We were looking for volume and pricing to remain relatively stable, similar to what we saw in the back half of 2009, with the potential for volatility from month-to-month. At the time, this view was less optimistic than many economists held, but with one quarter down, it looks like 2010 is unfolding more in line with our expectations. Given the planning assumption of relatively stable industry demand, we organized our operations to be successful within this environment while being positioned to respond to more robust demand if it materialized. 
We continue to advance initiatives focused on expanding margins, gaining overhead leverage and protecting our balance sheet. We also continue to shift away from a sales model that emphasizes the production of spec inventory to one that focuses more on leveling production and building to an existing order. By properly organizing and sizing our operations in alignment with anticipated market conditions, we generated significantly better financial results. On what we would call relatively modest revenue and closing volumes for the first quarter, PulteGroup reported a net loss for the period of approximately $12 million or $0.03 per share. In contrast to the roughly $2.00 per share loss in Q1 of last year, we made tremendous gains by emphasizing profitability over volume and by dramatically improving overhead leverage. 
Improved earnings for the quarter reflect a combination of factors: first, better gross margins, which continue to expand in the quarter. Since bottoming out in late 2008 and early 2009, we have realized steadily improving margins within our homebuilding operations. We still have a lot of work to do on improving margins over the long term, but we have made solid progress during the past year. Second, we captured critical overhead leverage on the combined Pulte-Centex volumes and delivered on the underlying merger strategy of running two businesses essentially on one overhead structure. And third, the absence of significant impairment charges. Given more stable demand and pricing conditions in the market and improving margins, we believe that the worst of the impairment process should be behind us. 
Of course, a key component to the year-over-year gains PulteGroup realized in the quarter was last year's merger with Centex and the aggressive actions taken to capture the targeted $440 million in savings and synergies. When we announced the merger, we talked about the critical underlying strategic benefits supporting this transaction, including significant cost savings and operating efficiencies, overhead leverage, acquisition of critical land assets and some unique branding opportunities. At that time, we also talked about how the merger with Centex could help accelerate PulteGroup's progress in these key areas and, in particular, advance our return to profitability. Given PulteGroup's strong start in 2010, our Q1 results demonstrate clearly that we are realizing the significant operating and financial benefits associated with the Centex merger. With the opportunity to realize ongoing margin expansion, additional SG&A leverage and improved closing volumes, assuming market conditions for the housing industry remain stable, we expect PulteGroup to be profitable for 2010. 
With regard to the merger integration work, I will tell you that we are  effectively done and operating as one company. There are still projects to complete in important areas as we transition information systems and complete the integration work supporting our operations and financial processes, but I feel comfortable in saying that the bigger merger risks are behind us. Now it's a matter of completing select tasks and capturing any additional synergy opportunities, particularly in the areas of construction efficiencies and purchasing. As I said at the outset of this call, I think we've gotten off to a solid start in a year that may not be as robust as some had expected. I think the U.S. Housing Industry is finding and may have already found the bottom, but that's different from saying that a recovery is at hand. 
We believe that any meaningful sustained improvement will require employment gains and in turn, better consumer confidence. To the latter point, while unemployment is high at roughly 10%, that still means that 90% of people are working but not many of them are buying homes right now. Even a modest uptick in employment could have a significant impact on demand, assuming it drives greater confidence among this larger group. PulteGroup is in an excellent position to meet current and optimistically increasing demand given our strong land pipeline and robust cash position, which benefited from the tax refunds associated with last year's NOL legislation. The 20-plus land transactions primarily involved finished lots, so we can move quickly to selling and constructing new homes, which can provide new jobs and help the economic recovery at both a local and national level. As always, I want to thank our associates for the great work they continue to do in delivering superior product quality and an unmatched home buying experience to our customers. Now let me turn the call over to Roger Cregg for additional details on PulteGroup's first quarter financial results. Roger?"

Revenues from home settlements for the homebuilding operations increased approximately 73% from the prior year quarter to approximately $1 billion. The increased revenues reflect the increase in unit closings that were a",1394,"Thanks, Richard, and good morning. Revenues from home settlements for the homebuilding operations increased approximately 73% from the prior year quarter to approximately $1 billion. The increased revenues reflect the increase in unit closings that were above prior year by approximately 77%. The average sales price decreased approximately 2% versus the prior-year quarter to an average of $257,000. This decrease is attributed to the mix of greater first time home buyer volume due to the Centex merger, in addition to the geographical and product mix of homes closed during the quarter.
In the first quarter, land sales generated approximately $13 million in total revenues, which is an increase of approximately $12 million versus the prior year's quarter. The sales in the quarter mainly reflect lot sales to other builders and several land parcel sales negotiated before the merger. Homebuilding gross profits from home settlements for the quarter, including homebuilding interest expense, was approximately $127 million versus the loss of $333 million in the prior year quarter. For those with access to the webcast slides, I refer you to Slide 6, the adjusted margin analysis, which outlines our gross margins in the following detail: Homebuilding gross margins from home settlements as a percentage of revenues was 13%, compared to a negative 59% in the first quarter of 2009. Adjusting the current quarter's gross margins for land and community valuation charges, interest expense and the acquisition accounting write-up for the Centex work in process, resulted in a conversion of 16.3% compared to 14.2% for the fourth quarter of 2009 or an improvement of 210 basis points. On a comparative basis versus the previous year's first quarter, conversion of 8.6%, the adjusted increase of 770 basis points. We expect that sequential quarterly improvements in gross margins as we worked our way through the backlog of higher incentives in early 2009, along with the house cost reductions initiatives we executed during last year plus the added benefits of the merger. 
Homebuilding interest expense decreased during the quarter to approximately $27 million versus approximately $55 million in the prior year. Included in the interest expense of the $27 million is an additional $1 million of expense relating to land and community valuation adjustments taken in the current quarter. Also included in the gross margin for the quarter was a charge related to land and community valuation adjustment in the amount of approximately $4 million. For the first quarter, we tested approximately 18 communities for potential impairment and valuation adjustments. The recorded valuation adjustments on approximately 10 communities for the quarter, of which approximately 9 communities have been previously impaired.
The total net gain from land sales posted for the quarter was approximately $4 million. The gain is mainly attributed to the sale of lots and several parcels of land in the quarter, offset by the fair value adjustment in land sold and land being held for disposition in the amount of approximately $600,000, which is included in the land cost of sales. Homebuilding SG&A expenses as a percentage of home sales for the quarter was approximately 15.4% or $151 million, an increase of approximately $31 million or approximately 26% versus the prior year quarter. This increase reflects the additional overhead as a result of the merger with the Centex operations. In addition, the first quarter includes approximately $3 million for employee severance and related costs. 
If we look at the SG&A line on a pro forma basis, our expenses reflect a reduction of approximately $88 million or 37% from the combined Pulte and Centex SG&A expenses from the previous year's quarter. In addition, relative to our SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009, we reduced the expense sequentially by $37 million or approximately 20%. In the homebuilding, other income and expense category for the quarter, the income of approximately $8 million includes a write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs resulting from the decision not to pursue certain land acquisitions in the amount of $500,000 and valuation adjustments and unconsolidated joint ventures of approximately $2 million. 
Also included in the category for the quarter is an expense of approximately $1.4 million associated with overhead expense reductions for lease exit and related costs. The homebuilding pretax loss for the quarter of approximately $11.8 million resulted in a pretax margin of approximately a negative 1% on total homebuilding revenues. The pretax loss is inclusive of the charges related to the valuation adjustments and land inventory and investments, land held for sale, severance and lease-exit-related charges and the acquisition accounting write-up for the Centex work in process. The pretax income from Pulte's financial service operations for the first quarter was approximately $5 million or an increase compared with the previous year's quarter of approximately $6 million. The pretax income increase is primarily the result of the increased home settlements reflecting the Centex merger volume. Total mortgage principal origination dollars were $498 million, an increase of 45% when compared to the same period last year. The increases related to greater home settlements from the homebuilding closing activity for the quarter. Total agency originations were $469 million, non-agency originations were approximately $6 million and broker or non-funded loans were approximately $23 million. Additionally, within the funded agency originations, FHA loans were approximately 40% of the loans funded from the financing line in the quarter compared to approximately 45% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Pulte Mortgage's capture rate for the current quarter was approximately 75% and the average FICO score for the quarter was 748. 
In the other non-operating category, pretax loss from the first quarter of approximately $8 million includes corporate expenses of approximately $10 million, partially offset by net interest income of $2 million resulting from our invested cash balances. If we look at the corporate expense line on a pro forma basis, our expenses reflect a reduction of approximately $25 million or 70% from the combined Pulte and Centex corporate expenses from the previous year's quarter.
For the first quarter, the company's pretax loss was approximately $14.5 million. This pretax loss for the quarter is inclusive of the charges related to the valuation adjustments in land inventory and investments, land held for sale, severance and lease-exit and related costs and the acquisition accounting for the Centex work-in-process write-off. The net loss for the first quarter was approximately $12.5 million or a loss of $0.03 per share as compared to a net loss of approximately $515 million or a loss of $2.02 per share for the same period last year. 
The quarter reflects a tax benefit of approximately $2 million, primarily due to the Accounting Standard Codification 740 or formerly FIN 48 accounting for uncertainty for income taxes. The number of shares used in the EPS calculation was approximately 377.7 million shares for the first quarter of 2010. The total shares outstanding in March 31, 2010, were approximately 382.5 million shares. 
Reviewing the balance sheet for the quarter, we ended with a cash balance of approximately $2.6 billion, increasing approximately $722 million from the fourth quarter of 2009. We received approximately $778 million in cash refunds during the first quarter related to our NOL carrybacks. Subsequently, in April, we received an additional $103 million in refunds for a total of approximately $880 million related to the NOL carrybacks. 
House and land inventory ended the quarter at approximately $5 billion. The increase in house and land inventory and land held for sale consumed approximately $30 million in cash from the fourth quarter of 2009. During the first quarter, our new investments in land were enrolling lot option takedowns and purchases of approximately $164 million and land development spending of approximately $108 million, offset by a modest reduction in house inventory by approximately $14 million. With approximately $2.6 billion in cash to end the quarter, we had no outstanding balance drawn on the revolving credit facility at the end of the quarter. The company's gross debt-to-total capitalization ratio was approximately 57.3% and on the net basis, 34.7%. Interest incurred amounted to approximately $69 million in the quarter, compared to $54 million for the same period last year. PulteGroup shareholder equity for the first quarter was approximately $3.2 billion. We repurchased no shares during the quarter, and the company has approximately $102 million remaining on our current authorization. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for some additional comments on the quarter. Steve?"

As Richard touched on, actual housing demand for the first quarter of 2010 was likely below many estimates. As we've talked about before, our expectations for market demand heading into the year were",1437,"Thanks, Roger, and once again, good morning, everyone. As Richard touched on, actual housing demand for the first quarter of 2010 was likely below many estimates. As we've talked about before, our expectations for market demand heading into the year were pretty modest, and Q1 demand was about what we expected, so we were properly positioned to realize significant overhead leverage. Our operations did a great job staying focused on the critical business drivers, closings, margins and overhead leverage and on capturing the opportunities related to our merger with Centex. 
In the markets, our process change work was ongoing in the quarter, as we continued to shift our operating model to focus more on building to order and away from our historical emphasis on carrying a higher level of spec inventory. We likely gave up some sales in the quarter, but we also realized a 4% decrease in our unsold inventory position from the fourth quarter of 2009. We ended Q1 with fewer than 2,700 unsold inventory homes. More importantly, the majority of the decrease was in spec finals, which fell by 15% to about 1,100 homes. Along with helping to control our unsold inventory positions, our process change work continues to benefit construction efficiency and purchasing activities, which over time, can translate into further margin expansion. The enhanced Pulte operating system has been rolled out to all markets. When we started rolling out the system, our operating divisions were at different stages of development, but all are quickly moving up the learning curve and adopting the critical processes and related information systems. 
We are tracking a number of performance metrics and critical operating categories, including material cost, cycle times and delivered quality. Once our Pulte operating system is fully implemented, we will be in a much better position to consistently track and measure critical sales and construction metrics across all communities in a market and across all of our markets around the country. Layering on top of this work, our Purchasing group has gotten through much of the data collection, analysis and initial vendor discussions associated with efforts to capture the target of the $150 million to $200 million in purchasing synergies. The group is now transitioning to the bidding and contracting stage. A number of important categories, including flooring, appliances and cabinets, will be entering the RFP process in the second and third quarters of 2010. These are important next steps as we work to capture the targeted merger synergies. 
Moving on to other data points for the quarter. On a reported basis, net sign-ups for the quarter totaled 4,320 homes, which is an increase of 43% over the same period last year and in line with our expectations. Maybe more relevant, given the timing of the merger close, orders were up 15% from the fourth quarter 2009 as absorptions per community improved. While direct comparisons are difficult, assuming PulteGroup and Centex were combined in 2009, reported Q1 orders were down roughly 26% compared to last year. The year-over-year change reflects a combination of a 19% decrease in community count and a change in our sign-up process implemented at the start of the year. Consistent with our build-to-order strategy, we are now taking buyers deeper into the mortgage approval process before counting them as a sign-up. As a result of this process change, which is designed to help lower our cancellation rate and ensure that buyers ultimately close on the home, there were approximately 450 pending sales that would have previously been counted as sign-ups. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter sign-ups, which were consistent with our plans heading into the year. 
PulteGroup's reported backlog at quarter end totaled approximately 6,500 homes, more than double last year's number with a value of approximately $1.7 billion. 
Moving past the data analysis, I'll provide some high-level comments about how our geographic areas performed during the first quarter. As I discussed on the last call, the merger makes direct comparisons of sign-ups less meaningful, so I'll try to provide commentary as to the underlying business conditions. Reported sign-ups for the Northeast, which covers an area from Southern Virginia through Washington, D.C. and into Massachusetts, totaled 461 homes. As you've probably heard many times, the D.C. market has been one of the better performing areas of the country, even with the difficult weather conditions to start this year. Offsetting this somewhat was weakness in our Delaware value markets. 
In the Southeast area, sign-ups for the quarter totaled 730 homes. As we talked about on the last call, we expect this area to be a solid performer, as last year's merger added both great people and land positions to our existing operations in this area. Overall, the business was relatively stable through the quarter, with most of the markets experiencing a typical, albeit modest, seasonal pickup as the months progress. 
Sign-ups in our Midwest area totaled 560 homes with relatively stable year-over-year demand throughout most of the markets. Our home state of Michigan, however, continued to struggle with weak economic conditions. Hopefully, improving conditions among car manufacturers can translate into jobs and an overall improving economy, both here and Michigan and in the surroundings states. 
Once again, PulteGroup's Gulf Coast operations experienced another good quarter of activity in reporting 1,551 sign-ups for the period. While Florida remains once of the most difficult operating environments, we did see some pickup in our North and South Florida operations. Central Florida has yet to see much of a rebound. 
Moving to the West, demand in Texas remained stable across all markets. Continuing further West to our Southwest area, Phoenix and Las Vegas continue to face very difficult conditions as sign-ups for the quarter totaled 514 homes. Part of our struggle in Las Vegas is company specific. As we have a limited number of closer in [ph] communities currently operating. Long-term, Las Vegas is still a market where we see opportunities and we are looking at several land deals that can improve our market position in 2011 and beyond. 
Finally, sign-ups in our West area were 504 homes for the quarter. Activity remains generally stable without big swings in demand or pricing from month-to-month. Drilling down a little, we continued to see some weakness in the Central Valley, which we run from the Bay Area, as we didn't feel much of a seasonal lift. On the other hand, Sacramento and Southern California saw a modest year-over-year gain and sign-ups but on relatively small numbers. There are reasons to be optimistic about California as the broader economy improves and the state's new tax credit takes effect. Although, we'll have to wait and see how budget issues at the state level affect the rate of improvement. 
I touched briefly on the potential to be buying some lots in Las Vegas. So let me finish up my comments with some additional color about our land pipeline. We ended Q1 with just under 150,000 lots under control, of which, 92% were owned and the remaining 8% controlled B option [ph]. As was the case last quarter, about 1/3 of these lots are developed. We've remained active in the land market and continue to find small but profitable builds in many markets across the country. The basic project profile hasn't changed since we are primarily looking for finished lot deals that can be controlled via option agreement and that can pencil to a mid-20% return or better. 
In the first quarter, we completed roughly 20 transactions accounting for approximately 1,700 lots. So obviously, these are not big communities. The deals represent an eventual capital outlay of approximately $110 million, although minimal cash went out the door in initially tying up these positions. These new communities offer an average margin from the high teens into the low-20% range. 
We continue to see land acquisition opportunities that make sense and where we are effectively buying the position at a price that is below replacement cost. That said, land prices in the more preferred submarkets are starting to rise, making the deals more challenging from a return standpoint. We'll have to wait and see if the higher prices bring more opportunities into the market. As of right now, that has not been the case. Echoing Richard's comments, we've gotten off to a good start and we're in a strong position heading into an uncertain period, given the state of the economy, the expiration of the tax credit and the potential for rising interest rates. Our operating teams have done a great job aligning their businesses with the market.

We're not going to give guidance on that, obviously, but what we'll tell you is, is that our focus -- and you kind of saw it in some of our land acquisition. Our focus has been on to improve absorptions per community as we move forward, and that has been the message to our operating teams, both on, certainly, the number of sales per community, but also on the margin performance and the overall operating performance within those communities. We have a lot of active stores. We did see a big runoff in the first quarter. We had a difficult first quarter comp on a pro forma basis, as both Pulte and Centex had different operating goals in the first quarter of last year. Ours was to move specs and raise cash and so was Centex. And so we feel pretty comfortable as we move forward to say, ""Let's focus on the land that we have and let's focus on the opportunities there."" We have repositioned product. We have aligned things with brand. We have done a lot of good things in the first quarter that put us in a better position on a sales per community basis as we move forward, and we feel pretty comfortable with that direction. Whether that results in 20% year-over-year growth or 50% year-over-year growth, that's more probably indicative of market condition.

But going forward, again, volume-related leverage is what we're anticipating as we come through the balance of this year."

I mean as I talked about, a 1,700 lot acquisition in the first quarter is certainly very modest and we like our land positions. They were long land positions. Many of the impairments that we've taken over the last few years are still embedded in those land positions, but where we see opportunities to go out and buy land at below market value in great submarkets, we're continuing to do that, but we don't see that as a significant part of our business from a closing standpoint this year. The second part is on the lumber price increases and some of the commodity price increases, we price -- and the way we work is we work on a trailing 13-week basis and we buy our materials direct and we have great visibility, great transparency into the lumber portion. So we have seen lumber price increases. There's no doubt about it. Probably to the tune of maybe $400 a house that'll impact closings in the second quarter and maybe a little bit more than that as we go into the third quarter. But we've been able to offset those with further efficiencies on the labor side and, certainly, efficiencies on many of the things we're doing in trip charges and those type of things. You can offset these, as long as you componentize the breakdown of building the house. And we've done a tremendous amount of work on that so that on a net-net basis, the overall costs to frame a house for us, we haven't seen that much change at all relative to the lumber price increase.

So again, relative to the peer group, again, as Steve mentioned, some of them may be blending in more of the land that they buy currently, but we're still playing this for the long-term, not just a quarter-by-quarter. And a lot of the lots out there that are for sale are extremely limited. They're not in mass quantities in any particular location. So again, as we've see them, you buy 10 lots, 10 lots there.

I want to add something to what Roger and Steve were just talking about on the land side. Others have talked about margin expansion for new communities being a significant portion of their total and that's because their lot position, in many cases, was significantly down. So therefore, any land they bring on is going to be a bigger piece. We made our bet with the large combination with Pulte and Centex and 55,000 lots that were acquired and the resulting accounting from that. I would suggest that our forecast for margin growth in the future, as Roger indicated, is sustainable and driven by things we can control, our own operating efficiencies and not reliant on future land prices. And while we want to be opportunistic on land purchases where we can, our view is that that's not going to last very long, and so whether we get margin benefit from opportunistic land for another quarter or two, that's great, but what happens in 2011 and 2012, et cetera? I would argue that we are going to have a land basis that's very appropriately valued for the long run and that's why we're continuing to forecast margin growth.

Most of the revolvers, and there's only a couple left in the industry today, have been used for letter of credit. So there's not much available from that standpoint that people are relying upon to build working capital going forward. So as we look at it, certainly, we've got to have cash to put back in on the vertical side because you're putting $2 to $3 for every dollar of land into the vertical side and so, of course, velocity's going to be important on that, so it's going to be exactly what the pace is going to be is going to drive how much actually we're going to use for working capital. So there's no quantification that I have to give you but cash will go into that. I think we've said easily could see maybe $500 million, $700 million, depending on where the market is and how much volume is out there from the market standpoint to put back into that side. And then again, a lot of what we've been doing on the land development side has been to try to be more cash constrained than efficient on development side. So rather than developing 300 lots in a community, we prefer maybe to develop less than 100 to make sure that from a liquidity standpoint, we're in good shape just to weather another downturn.
So all those things are factors that we're doing today in running it a lot smarter on the cash side that we can capture costs going forward if we feel good about the liquidity side. So again, those things that we are considering, but we have to have a better view of the market overall before we start to what I would say is move back into a normalized view of how we run the operations day to day."

I think that initially, when Roger talked at the last call, we talked about maybe putting up to $700 million, $800 million into land development this year that were in our cash-flow projections. Now certainly, maybe a quarter of that to a third of that is some soft cost relative to property taxes and various assessment districts and those type of things. But the rest is physical hard development, and clearly we're doing that in some communities where we have proper demand and, as Roger spoke about earlier, we're doing it smartly. We're developing smaller pods of lots and not putting that much land out in front of us. 
What we're really looking at on the acquisition side is, where we can improve our position? I spoke about -- we clearly -- we know what it costs to develop land. We know the raw basis that you can buy land at today in the market. And if you can go out and get a developed lot in a preferred sub-market to target the consumer that we’re very good at serving, that's below those costs, it just makes good business sense for us to go out and buy those lots as well, and we did -- approximately 20, 25 transactions in the first quarter. And the $110 million I talked about was the total cash outlay eventually on those deals as we take down all the lots, not what we put out in the first quarter to acquire those lots. So for us, it's clearly a blend. 
We like our land positions that we have. We've said that for a long time. Unfortunately, we’ve had to impair those positions as the market downturn has been here over the last couple of years. But we haven't burned through those positions. Those impairments are trapped now into the new basis of that land, and as we look out and we start to see some activity in these preferred sub-markets where we own land as well, we see a very good situation emerging for us. And as Richard talked about, our opportunity to improve margin doesn't lie totally in our ability to have to buy land at below-market value, and we feel pretty good about that. So I think that, hopefully, that answers your question, but that's really what we're looking at. I mean there's a combination for us, but I think we're more weighted towards our current projects, and that's why. when I was asked the question, I mean we're really focused on improving absorptions in those communities that we already own."

So I was wondering if you could maybe walk us through. Was that a mixed issue? Why was the closings ratio lower than we might have anticipated?"

What we think is happening is there’s just a very short supply of this readily available land that we believe is below replacement cost. You can’t go out and buy the raw dirt and develop it for that. And builders are buying that to sell it into the price that’s being absorbed in the submarket.  What we think is going to happen is that number one, you’re going to increase the overall supply of homes.  It’s going to be moved from a supply of land or a supply of homes, obviously, and typically, unless you see more demand in that submarket relatively speaking, that tends to have some kind of a downward pressure on pricing. And we think it's going to be flat to maybe slightly up or down, depending on the builders that actually bought the land and how aggressive they go in there with new products and new housing and then, obviously, what the corresponding retail market looks like. So it's probably not and endless supply of price increases because everybody's buying up the land. I just think that in what we've seen is, is that the returns just continue to get tighter and tighter on trying to make it work at the current pricing, and that's really our jumping-off point.

Our first call is the newly named PulteGroup. I'm very pleased to discuss PulteGroup's first quarter results as they demonstrate the significant gains we continue to realize in the critical areas of margin expansion and overhead leverage. The expected benefits from last year's merger with Centex are clearly evident in the numbers and in accelerating PulteGroup's progress toward profitability. In planning for 2010 during last year's budgeting process, we worked under the assumption that demand for new homes in 2010 would be comparable to what we experienced in 2009. We were looking for volume and pricing to remain relatively stable, similar to what we saw in the back half of 2009, with the potential for volatility from month-to-month. At the time, this view was less optimistic than many economists held, but with one quarter down, it looks like 2010 is unfolding more in line with our expectations. Given the planning assumption of relatively stable industry demand, we organized our operations to be successful within this environment while being positioned to respond to more robust demand if it materialized. 
We continue to advance initiatives focused on expanding margins, gaining overhead leverage and protecting our balance sheet. We also continue to shift away from a sales model that emphasizes the production of spec inventory to one that focuses more on leveling production and building to an existing order. By properly organizing and sizing our operations in alignment with anticipated market conditions, we generated significantly better financial results. On what we would call relatively modest revenue and closing volumes for the first quarter, PulteGroup reported a net loss for the period of approximately $12 million or $0.03 per share. In contrast to the roughly $2.00 per share loss in Q1 of last year, we made tremendous gains by emphasizing profitability over volume and by dramatically improving overhead leverage. 
Improved earnings for the quarter reflect a combination of factors: first, better gross margins, which continue to expand in the quarter. Since bottoming out in late 2008 and early 2009, we have realized steadily improving margins within our homebuilding operations. We still have a lot of work to do on improving margins over the long term, but we have made solid progress during the past year. Second, we captured critical overhead leverage on the combined Pulte-Centex volumes and delivered on the underlying merger strategy of running two businesses essentially on one overhead structure. And third, the absence of significant impairment charges. Given more stable demand and pricing conditions in the market and improving margins, we believe that the worst of the impairment process should be behind us. 
Of course, a key component to the year-over-year gains PulteGroup realized in the quarter was last year's merger with Centex and the aggressive actions taken to capture the targeted $440 million in savings and synergies. When we announced the merger, we talked about the critical underlying strategic benefits supporting this transaction, including significant cost savings and operating efficiencies, overhead leverage, acquisition of critical land assets and some unique branding opportunities. At that time, we also talked about how the merger with Centex could help accelerate PulteGroup's progress in these key areas and, in particular, advance our return to profitability. Given PulteGroup's strong start in 2010, our Q1 results demonstrate clearly that we are realizing the significant operating and financial benefits associated with the Centex merger. With the opportunity to realize ongoing margin expansion, additional SG&A leverage and improved closing volumes, assuming market conditions for the housing industry remain stable, we expect PulteGroup to be profitable for 2010. 
With regard to the merger integration work, I will tell you that we are  effectively done and operating as one company. There are still projects to complete in important areas as we transition information systems and complete the integration work supporting our operations and financial processes, but I feel comfortable in saying that the bigger merger risks are behind us. Now it's a matter of completing select tasks and capturing any additional synergy opportunities, particularly in the areas of construction efficiencies and purchasing. As I said at the outset of this call, I think we've gotten off to a solid start in a year that may not be as robust as some had expected. I think the U.S. Housing Industry is finding and may have already found the bottom, but that's different from saying that a recovery is at hand. 
We believe that any meaningful sustained improvement will require employment gains and in turn, better consumer confidence. To the latter point, while unemployment is high at roughly 10%, that still means that 90% of people are working but not many of them are buying homes right now. Even a modest uptick in employment could have a significant impact on demand, assuming it drives greater confidence among this larger group. PulteGroup is in an excellent position to meet current and optimistically increasing demand given our strong land pipeline and robust cash position, which benefited from the tax refunds associated with last year's NOL legislation. The 20-plus land transactions primarily involved finished lots, so we can move quickly to selling and constructing new homes, which can provide new jobs and help the economic recovery at both a local and national level. As always, I want to thank our associates for the great work they continue to do in delivering superior product quality and an unmatched home buying experience to our customers. Now let me turn the call over to Roger Cregg for additional details on PulteGroup's first quarter financial results. Roger?

294550,100728329,59641,"PulteGroup, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 05, 2010",2010-05-05,"Earnings Calls","PulteGroup, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Richard, and good morning. Revenues from home settlements for the homebuilding operations increased approximately 73% from the prior year quarter to approximately $1 billion. The increased revenues reflect the increase in unit closings that were a",1394,"Thanks, Richard, and good morning. Revenues from home settlements for the homebuilding operations increased approximately 73% from the prior year quarter to approximately $1 billion. The increased revenues reflect the increase in unit closings that were above prior year by approximately 77%. The average sales price decreased approximately 2% versus the prior-year quarter to an average of $257,000. This decrease is attributed to the mix of greater first time home buyer volume due to the Centex merger, in addition to the geographical and product mix of homes closed during the quarter.
In the first quarter, land sales generated approximately $13 million in total revenues, which is an increase of approximately $12 million versus the prior year's quarter. The sales in the quarter mainly reflect lot sales to other builders and several land parcel sales negotiated before the merger. Homebuilding gross profits from home settlements for the quarter, including homebuilding interest expense, was approximately $127 million versus the loss of $333 million in the prior year quarter. For those with access to the webcast slides, I refer you to Slide 6, the adjusted margin analysis, which outlines our gross margins in the following detail: Homebuilding gross margins from home settlements as a percentage of revenues was 13%, compared to a negative 59% in the first quarter of 2009. Adjusting the current quarter's gross margins for land and community valuation charges, interest expense and the acquisition accounting write-up for the Centex work in process, resulted in a conversion of 16.3% compared to 14.2% for the fourth quarter of 2009 or an improvement of 210 basis points. On a comparative basis versus the previous year's first quarter, conversion of 8.6%, the adjusted increase of 770 basis points. We expect that sequential quarterly improvements in gross margins as we worked our way through the backlog of higher incentives in early 2009, along with the house cost reductions initiatives we executed during last year plus the added benefits of the merger. 
Homebuilding interest expense decreased during the quarter to approximately $27 million versus approximately $55 million in the prior year. Included in the interest expense of the $27 million is an additional $1 million of expense relating to land and community valuation adjustments taken in the current quarter. Also included in the gross margin for the quarter was a charge related to land and community valuation adjustment in the amount of approximately $4 million. For the first quarter, we tested approximately 18 communities for potential impairment and valuation adjustments. The recorded valuation adjustments on approximately 10 communities for the quarter, of which approximately 9 communities have been previously impaired.
The total net gain from land sales posted for the quarter was approximately $4 million. The gain is mainly attributed to the sale of lots and several parcels of land in the quarter, offset by the fair value adjustment in land sold and land being held for disposition in the amount of approximately $600,000, which is included in the land cost of sales. Homebuilding SG&A expenses as a percentage of home sales for the quarter was approximately 15.4% or $151 million, an increase of approximately $31 million or approximately 26% versus the prior year quarter. This increase reflects the additional overhead as a result of the merger with the Centex operations. In addition, the first quarter includes approximately $3 million for employee severance and related costs. 
If we look at the SG&A line on a pro forma basis, our expenses reflect a reduction of approximately $88 million or 37% from the combined Pulte and Centex SG&A expenses from the previous year's quarter. In addition, relative to our SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009, we reduced the expense sequentially by $37 million or approximately 20%. In the homebuilding, other income and expense category for the quarter, the income of approximately $8 million includes a write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs resulting from the decision not to pursue certain land acquisitions in the amount of $500,000 and valuation adjustments and unconsolidated joint ventures of approximately $2 million. 
Also included in the category for the quarter is an expense of approximately $1.4 million associated with overhead expense reductions for lease exit and related costs. The homebuilding pretax loss for the quarter of approximately $11.8 million resulted in a pretax margin of approximately a negative 1% on total homebuilding revenues. The pretax loss is inclusive of the charges related to the valuation adjustments and land inventory and investments, land held for sale, severance and lease-exit-related charges and the acquisition accounting write-up for the Centex work in process. The pretax income from Pulte's financial service operations for the first quarter was approximately $5 million or an increase compared with the previous year's quarter of approximately $6 million. The pretax income increase is primarily the result of the increased home settlements reflecting the Centex merger volume. Total mortgage principal origination dollars were $498 million, an increase of 45% when compared to the same period last year. The increases related to greater home settlements from the homebuilding closing activity for the quarter. Total agency originations were $469 million, non-agency originations were approximately $6 million and broker or non-funded loans were approximately $23 million. Additionally, within the funded agency originations, FHA loans were approximately 40% of the loans funded from the financing line in the quarter compared to approximately 45% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Pulte Mortgage's capture rate for the current quarter was approximately 75% and the average FICO score for the quarter was 748. 
In the other non-operating category, pretax loss from the first quarter of approximately $8 million includes corporate expenses of approximately $10 million, partially offset by net interest income of $2 million resulting from our invested cash balances. If we look at the corporate expense line on a pro forma basis, our expenses reflect a reduction of approximately $25 million or 70% from the combined Pulte and Centex corporate expenses from the previous year's quarter.
For the first quarter, the company's pretax loss was approximately $14.5 million. This pretax loss for the quarter is inclusive of the charges related to the valuation adjustments in land inventory and investments, land held for sale, severance and lease-exit and related costs and the acquisition accounting for the Centex work-in-process write-off. The net loss for the first quarter was approximately $12.5 million or a loss of $0.03 per share as compared to a net loss of approximately $515 million or a loss of $2.02 per share for the same period last year. 
The quarter reflects a tax benefit of approximately $2 million, primarily due to the Accounting Standard Codification 740 or formerly FIN 48 accounting for uncertainty for income taxes. The number of shares used in the EPS calculation was approximately 377.7 million shares for the first quarter of 2010. The total shares outstanding in March 31, 2010, were approximately 382.5 million shares. 
Reviewing the balance sheet for the quarter, we ended with a cash balance of approximately $2.6 billion, increasing approximately $722 million from the fourth quarter of 2009. We received approximately $778 million in cash refunds during the first quarter related to our NOL carrybacks. Subsequently, in April, we received an additional $103 million in refunds for a total of approximately $880 million related to the NOL carrybacks. 
House and land inventory ended the quarter at approximately $5 billion. The increase in house and land inventory and land held for sale consumed approximately $30 million in cash from the fourth quarter of 2009. During the first quarter, our new investments in land were enrolling lot option takedowns and purchases of approximately $164 million and land development spending of approximately $108 million, offset by a modest reduction in house inventory by approximately $14 million. With approximately $2.6 billion in cash to end the quarter, we had no outstanding balance drawn on the revolving credit facility at the end of the quarter. The company's gross debt-to-total capitalization ratio was approximately 57.3% and on the net basis, 34.7%. Interest incurred amounted to approximately $69 million in the quarter, compared to $54 million for the same period last year. PulteGroup shareholder equity for the first quarter was approximately $3.2 billion. We repurchased no shares during the quarter, and the company has approximately $102 million remaining on our current authorization. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for some additional comments on the quarter. Steve?

As Richard touched on, actual housing demand for the first quarter of 2010 was likely below many estimates. As we've talked about before, our expectations for market demand heading into the year were",1437,"Thanks, Roger, and once again, good morning, everyone. As Richard touched on, actual housing demand for the first quarter of 2010 was likely below many estimates. As we've talked about before, our expectations for market demand heading into the year were pretty modest, and Q1 demand was about what we expected, so we were properly positioned to realize significant overhead leverage. Our operations did a great job staying focused on the critical business drivers, closings, margins and overhead leverage and on capturing the opportunities related to our merger with Centex. 
In the markets, our process change work was ongoing in the quarter, as we continued to shift our operating model to focus more on building to order and away from our historical emphasis on carrying a higher level of spec inventory. We likely gave up some sales in the quarter, but we also realized a 4% decrease in our unsold inventory position from the fourth quarter of 2009. We ended Q1 with fewer than 2,700 unsold inventory homes. More importantly, the majority of the decrease was in spec finals, which fell by 15% to about 1,100 homes. Along with helping to control our unsold inventory positions, our process change work continues to benefit construction efficiency and purchasing activities, which over time, can translate into further margin expansion. The enhanced Pulte operating system has been rolled out to all markets. When we started rolling out the system, our operating divisions were at different stages of development, but all are quickly moving up the learning curve and adopting the critical processes and related information systems. 
We are tracking a number of performance metrics and critical operating categories, including material cost, cycle times and delivered quality. Once our Pulte operating system is fully implemented, we will be in a much better position to consistently track and measure critical sales and construction metrics across all communities in a market and across all of our markets around the country. Layering on top of this work, our Purchasing group has gotten through much of the data collection, analysis and initial vendor discussions associated with efforts to capture the target of the $150 million to $200 million in purchasing synergies. The group is now transitioning to the bidding and contracting stage. A number of important categories, including flooring, appliances and cabinets, will be entering the RFP process in the second and third quarters of 2010. These are important next steps as we work to capture the targeted merger synergies. 
Moving on to other data points for the quarter. On a reported basis, net sign-ups for the quarter totaled 4,320 homes, which is an increase of 43% over the same period last year and in line with our expectations. Maybe more relevant, given the timing of the merger close, orders were up 15% from the fourth quarter 2009 as absorptions per community improved. While direct comparisons are difficult, assuming PulteGroup and Centex were combined in 2009, reported Q1 orders were down roughly 26% compared to last year. The year-over-year change reflects a combination of a 19% decrease in community count and a change in our sign-up process implemented at the start of the year. Consistent with our build-to-order strategy, we are now taking buyers deeper into the mortgage approval process before counting them as a sign-up. As a result of this process change, which is designed to help lower our cancellation rate and ensure that buyers ultimately close on the home, there were approximately 450 pending sales that would have previously been counted as sign-ups. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter sign-ups, which were consistent with our plans heading into the year. 
PulteGroup's reported backlog at quarter end totaled approximately 6,500 homes, more than double last year's number with a value of approximately $1.7 billion. 
Moving past the data analysis, I'll provide some high-level comments about how our geographic areas performed during the first quarter. As I discussed on the last call, the merger makes direct comparisons of sign-ups less meaningful, so I'll try to provide commentary as to the underlying business conditions. Reported sign-ups for the Northeast, which covers an area from Southern Virginia through Washington, D.C. and into Massachusetts, totaled 461 homes. As you've probably heard many times, the D.C. market has been one of the better performing areas of the country, even with the difficult weather conditions to start this year. Offsetting this somewhat was weakness in our Delaware value markets. 
In the Southeast area, sign-ups for the quarter totaled 730 homes. As we talked about on the last call, we expect this area to be a solid performer, as last year's merger added both great people and land positions to our existing operations in this area. Overall, the business was relatively stable through the quarter, with most of the markets experiencing a typical, albeit modest, seasonal pickup as the months progress. 
Sign-ups in our Midwest area totaled 560 homes with relatively stable year-over-year demand throughout most of the markets. Our home state of Michigan, however, continued to struggle with weak economic conditions. Hopefully, improving conditions among car manufacturers can translate into jobs and an overall improving economy, both here and Michigan and in the surroundings states. 
Once again, PulteGroup's Gulf Coast operations experienced another good quarter of activity in reporting 1,551 sign-ups for the period. While Florida remains once of the most difficult operating environments, we did see some pickup in our North and South Florida operations. Central Florida has yet to see much of a rebound. 
Moving to the West, demand in Texas remained stable across all markets. Continuing further West to our Southwest area, Phoenix and Las Vegas continue to face very difficult conditions as sign-ups for the quarter totaled 514 homes. Part of our struggle in Las Vegas is company specific. As we have a limited number of closer in [ph] communities currently operating. Long-term, Las Vegas is still a market where we see opportunities and we are looking at several land deals that can improve our market position in 2011 and beyond. 
Finally, sign-ups in our West area were 504 homes for the quarter. Activity remains generally stable without big swings in demand or pricing from month-to-month. Drilling down a little, we continued to see some weakness in the Central Valley, which we run from the Bay Area, as we didn't feel much of a seasonal lift. On the other hand, Sacramento and Southern California saw a modest year-over-year gain and sign-ups but on relatively small numbers. There are reasons to be optimistic about California as the broader economy improves and the state's new tax credit takes effect. Although, we'll have to wait and see how budget issues at the state level affect the rate of improvement. 
I touched briefly on the potential to be buying some lots in Las Vegas. So let me finish up my comments with some additional color about our land pipeline. We ended Q1 with just under 150,000 lots under control, of which, 92% were owned and the remaining 8% controlled B option [ph]. As was the case last quarter, about 1/3 of these lots are developed. We've remained active in the land market and continue to find small but profitable builds in many markets across the country. The basic project profile hasn't changed since we are primarily looking for finished lot deals that can be controlled via option agreement and that can pencil to a mid-20% return or better. 
In the first quarter, we completed roughly 20 transactions accounting for approximately 1,700 lots. So obviously, these are not big communities. The deals represent an eventual capital outlay of approximately $110 million, although minimal cash went out the door in initially tying up these positions. These new communities offer an average margin from the high teens into the low-20% range. 
We continue to see land acquisition opportunities that make sense and where we are effectively buying the position at a price that is below replacement cost. That said, land prices in the more preferred submarkets are starting to rise, making the deals more challenging from a return standpoint. We'll have to wait and see if the higher prices bring more opportunities into the market. As of right now, that has not been the case. Echoing Richard's comments, we've gotten off to a good start and we're in a strong position heading into an uncertain period, given the state of the economy, the expiration of the tax credit and the potential for rising interest rates. Our operating teams have done a great job aligning their businesses with the market. 
Let me now turn the call back over to Jim Zeumer. Jim?

We're not going to give guidance on that, obviously, but what we'll tell you is, is that our focus -- and you kind of saw it in some of our land acquisition. Our focus has been on to improve absorptions per community as we move forward, and that has been the message to our operating teams, both on, certainly, the number of sales per community, but also on the margin performance and the overall operating performance within those communities. We have a lot of active stores. We did see a big runoff in the first quarter. We had a difficult first quarter comp on a pro forma basis, as both Pulte and Centex had different operating goals in the first quarter of last year. Ours was to move specs and raise cash and so was Centex. And so we feel pretty comfortable as we move forward to say, ""Let's focus on the land that we have and let's focus on the opportunities there."" We have repositioned product. We have aligned things with brand. We have done a lot of good things in the first quarter that put us in a better position on a sales per community basis as we move forward, and we feel pretty comfortable with that direction. Whether that results in 20% year-over-year growth or 50% year-over-year growth, that's more probably indicative of market condition. But we think on our community count, we can continue to drive more absorptions per community almost regardless of market growth. We think we can do that just relative to flat conditions like Richard talked about in his comments. Mike?

I'll answer part of that and Roger's got part of the answer on the margin piece as we go forward. On an overall basis, yes, we're blending the land in. I mean as I talked about, a 1,700 lot acquisition in the first quarter is certainly very modest and we like our land positions. They were long land positions. Many of the impairments that we've taken over the last few years are still embedded in those land positions, but where we see opportunities to go out and buy land at below market value in great submarkets, we're continuing to do that, but we don't see that as a significant part of our business from a closing standpoint this year. The second part is on the lumber price increases and some of the commodity price increases, we price -- and the way we work is we work on a trailing 13-week basis and we buy our materials direct and we have great visibility, great transparency into the lumber portion. So we have seen lumber price increases. There's no doubt about it. Probably to the tune of maybe $400 a house that'll impact closings in the second quarter and maybe a little bit more than that as we go into the third quarter. But we've been able to offset those with further efficiencies on the labor side and, certainly, efficiencies on many of the things we're doing in trip charges and those type of things. You can offset these, as long as you componentize the breakdown of building the house. And we've done a tremendous amount of work on that so that on a net-net basis, the overall costs to frame a house for us, we haven't seen that much change at all relative to the lumber price increase. Roger?

But again, we still feel very comfortable with the efforts that we're making and the stride we're making on continuing to see the opportunity for increasing our overall margin as we go forward. So again, relative to the peer group, again, as Steve mentioned, some of them may be blending in more of the land that they buy currently, but we're still playing this for the long-term, not just a quarter-by-quarter. And a lot of the lots out there that are for sale are extremely limited. They're not in mass quantities in any particular location. So again, as we've see them, you buy 10 lots, 10 lots there. There's not a great deal that you're going to build a big business on for a long period of time. So short-term gain, again, it's relatively a long=term view.

I want to add something to what Roger and Steve were just talking about on the land side. Others have talked about margin expansion for new communities being a significant portion of their total and that's because their lot position, in many cases, was significantly down. So therefore, any land they bring on is going to be a bigger piece. We made our bet with the large combination with Pulte and Centex and 55,000 lots that were acquired and the resulting accounting from that. I would suggest that our forecast for margin growth in the future, as Roger indicated, is sustainable and driven by things we can control, our own operating efficiencies and not reliant on future land prices. And while we want to be opportunistic on land purchases where we can, our view is that that's not going to last very long, and so whether we get margin benefit from opportunistic land for another quarter or two, that's great, but what happens in 2011 and 2012, et cetera? I would argue that we are going to have a land basis that's very appropriately valued for the long run and that's why we're continuing to forecast margin growth. So I just wanted to emphasize maybe some of the difference there in the way we're thinking about it. We don't need a lot of new land in order to expand margins.

And we did have a lot of Centex and Pulte communities rolling off. So what we're hearing from our sales teams out there, and Steve can comment more, is that the Del Webb buyer is beginning to come back and beginning to shop a lot more. They've not yet pulled the trigger in terms of big purchases yet, but you can sense the momentum building as the market has improved. And this buyer, we've known all along, takes a longer period of time in order to make their decisions. So our expectations are that the Del Webb business improves from here. We don't expect it to rocket up or anything like that, but we do expect improvement. But I don't know, Roger, if you want to give more color.

Again, there's a lot of dynamics going on in the market from lending, from bank revolvers. What's available there today is a lot less than what it used to have been. Most of the revolvers, and there's only a couple left in the industry today, have been used for letter of credit. So there's not much available from that standpoint that people are relying upon to build working capital going forward. So as we look at it, certainly, we've got to have cash to put back in on the vertical side because you're putting $2 to $3 for every dollar of land into the vertical side and so, of course, velocity's going to be important on that, so it's going to be exactly what the pace is going to be is going to drive how much actually we're going to use for working capital. So there's no quantification that I have to give you but cash will go into that. I think we've said easily could see maybe $500 million, $700 million, depending on where the market is and how much volume is out there from the market standpoint to put back into that side. And then again, a lot of what we've been doing on the land development side has been to try to be more cash constrained than efficient on development side. So rather than developing 300 lots in a community, we prefer maybe to develop less than 100 to make sure that from a liquidity standpoint, we're in good shape just to weather another downturn.
So all those things are factors that we're doing today in running it a lot smarter on the cash side that we can capture costs going forward if we feel good about the liquidity side. So again, those things that we are considering, but we have to have a better view of the market overall before we start to what I would say is move back into a normalized view of how we run the operations day to day.

I wanted to dig into that number. Are you folks also taking the view that you want to be risk-averse, “Let's not develop our own land,” that might still be 12 to 18 months out?

I think that initially, when Roger talked at the last call, we talked about maybe putting up to $700 million, $800 million into land development this year that were in our cash-flow projections. Now certainly, maybe a quarter of that to a third of that is some soft cost relative to property taxes and various assessment districts and those type of things. But the rest is physical hard development, and clearly we're doing that in some communities where we have proper demand and, as Roger spoke about earlier, we're doing it smartly. We're developing smaller pods of lots and not putting that much land out in front of us. 
What we're really looking at on the acquisition side is, where we can improve our position? I spoke about -- we clearly -- we know what it costs to develop land. We know the raw basis that you can buy land at today in the market. And if you can go out and get a developed lot in a preferred sub-market to target the consumer that we’re very good at serving, that's below those costs, it just makes good business sense for us to go out and buy those lots as well, and we did -- approximately 20, 25 transactions in the first quarter. And the $110 million I talked about was the total cash outlay eventually on those deals as we take down all the lots, not what we put out in the first quarter to acquire those lots. So for us, it's clearly a blend. 
We like our land positions that we have. We've said that for a long time. Unfortunately, we’ve had to impair those positions as the market downturn has been here over the last couple of years. But we haven't burned through those positions. Those impairments are trapped now into the new basis of that land, and as we look out and we start to see some activity in these preferred sub-markets where we own land as well, we see a very good situation emerging for us. And as Richard talked about, our opportunity to improve margin doesn't lie totally in our ability to have to buy land at below-market value, and we feel pretty good about that. So I think that, hopefully, that answers your question, but that's really what we're looking at. I mean there's a combination for us, but I think we're more weighted towards our current projects, and that's why. when I was asked the question, I mean we're really focused on improving absorptions in those communities that we already own.

And so the land price supports probably the current pricing. We do not price appreciation in or anything like that. What we think is happening is there’s just a very short supply of this readily available land that we believe is below replacement cost. You can’t go out and buy the raw dirt and develop it for that. And builders are buying that to sell it into the price that’s being absorbed in the submarket.  What we think is going to happen is that number one, you’re going to increase the overall supply of homes.  It’s going to be moved from a supply of land or a supply of homes, obviously, and typically, unless you see more demand in that submarket relatively speaking, that tends to have some kind of a downward pressure on pricing. And we think it's going to be flat to maybe slightly up or down, depending on the builders that actually bought the land and how aggressive they go in there with new products and new housing and then, obviously, what the corresponding retail market looks like. So it's probably not and endless supply of price increases because everybody's buying up the land. I just think that in what we've seen is, is that the returns just continue to get tighter and tighter on trying to make it work at the current pricing, and that's really our jumping-off point. If we can’t get the returns that we want to get, we let it go to somebody else.

The slides will be archived on the site for the next 30 days for those who want to review it later. As a reminder, on August 18, 2009, PulteGroup completed its merger with Centex Corporation. Unless otherwise identified, results reported and released and on the call reflect the inclusion of Centex's operations for the first quarter of 2010, although results for the comparable prior year period have not been adjusted for this merger. Finally, I want to alert everyone that certain statements and comments made during the course of this call must be considered forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. PulteGroup believes that such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but there are no assurances that actual outcomes will not be materially different from those discussed today. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to the company on the date of this call, and the company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information in the future.
Participants in today's call should refer to PulteGroup's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and this morning's press release for a detailed list of risks and uncertainties associated with the business. Certain statements during this call also contain references to non-GAAP financial measures. See this morning's press release, which is available on our corporate website, pultegroupinc.com, for reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP numbers. As always, at the end of our prepared comments, we will have time for Q&A. We wait until then to open the queue for questions.

Our first call as the newly named PulteGroup. I'm very pleased to discuss PulteGroup's first quarter results as they demonstrate the significant gains we continue to realize in the critical areas of margin expansion and overhead leverage. The expected benefits from last year's merger with Centex are clearly evident in the numbers and in accelerating PulteGroup's progress toward profitability. In planning for 2010 during last year's budgeting process, we worked under the assumption that demand for new homes in 2010 would be comparable to what we experienced in 2009. We were looking for volume and pricing to remain relatively stable, similar to what we saw in the back half of 2009, with the potential for volatility from month-to-month. At the time, this view was less optimistic than many economists held, but with one quarter down, it looks like 2010 is unfolding more in line with our expectations. Given the planning assumption of relatively stable industry demand, we organized our operations to be successful within this environment, while being positioned to respond to more robust demand if it materialized. 
We continue to advance initiatives focused on expanding margins, gaining overhead leverage and protecting our balance sheet. We also continue to shift away from a sales model that emphasizes the production of spec inventory to one that focuses more on leveling production and building to an existing order. By properly organizing and sizing our operations in alignment with anticipated market conditions, we generated significantly better financial results. On what we would call relatively modest revenue and closing volumes for the first quarter, PulteGroup reported a net loss for the period of approximately $12 million or $0.03 per share. In contrast to the roughly $2.00 per share loss in Q1 of last year, we made tremendous gains by emphasizing profitability over volume and by dramatically improving overhead leverage. 
Improved earnings for the quarter reflect a combination of factors: First, better gross margins, which continue to expand in the quarter. Since bottoming out in late 2008 and early 2009, we have realized steadily improving margins within our homebuilding operations. We still have a lot of work to do on improving margins over the long term, but we have made solid progress during the past year. Second, we captured critical overhead leverage on the combined Pulte-Centex volumes and delivered on the underlying merger strategy of running two businesses essentially on one overhead structure. And third, the absence of significant impairment charges. Given more stable demand and pricing conditions in the market and improving margins, we believe that the worst of the impairment process should be behind us. 
Of course, a key component to the year-over-year gains PulteGroup realized in the quarter was last year's merger with Centex and the aggressive actions taken to capture the targeted $440 million in savings and synergies. When we announced the merger, we talked about the critical underlying strategic benefits supporting this transaction, including significant cost savings and operating efficiencies, overhead leverage, acquisition of critical land assets and some unique branding opportunities. At that time, we also talked about how the merger with Centex could help accelerate PulteGroup's progress in these key areas and, in particular, advance our return to profitability. Given PulteGroup's strong start in 2010, our Q1 results demonstrate clearly that we are realizing the significant operating and financial benefits associated with the Centex merger. With the opportunity to realize ongoing margin expansion, additional SG&A leverage and improved closing volumes, assuming market conditions for the housing industry remain stable, we expect PulteGroup to be profitable for 2010. 
With regard to the merger integration work, I will tell you that we are  effectively done and operating as one company. There are still projects to complete in important areas as we transition information systems and complete the integration work supporting our operations and financial processes, but I feel comfortable in saying that the bigger merger risks are behind us. Now it's a matter of completing select tasks and capturing any additional synergy opportunities, particularly in the areas of construction efficiencies and purchasing. As I said at the outset of this call, I think we've gotten off to a solid start in a year that may not be as robust as some had expected. I think the U.S. housing industry is finding and may have already found the bottom, but that's different from saying that a recovery is at hand. 
We believe that any meaningful sustained improvement will require employment gains and in turn, better consumer confidence. To the latter point, while unemployment is high at roughly 10%, that still means that 90% of people are working but not many of them are buying homes right now. Even a modest uptick in employment could have a significant impact on demand, assuming it drives greater confidence among this larger group. PulteGroup is in an excellent position to meet current and optimistically increasing demand given our strong land pipeline and robust cash position, which benefited from the tax refunds associated with last year's NOL legislation. The 20-plus land transactions primarily involved finished lots, so we can move quickly to selling and constructing new homes, which can provide new jobs and help the economic recovery at both a local and national level. As always, I want to thank our associates for the great work they continue to do in delivering superior product quality and an unmatched home buying experience to our customers. Now let me turn the call over to Roger Cregg for additional details on PulteGroup's first quarter financial results. Roger?"
294550,100728329,61028,"PulteGroup, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 05, 2010",2010-05-05,"Earnings Calls","PulteGroup, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Richard, and good morning. Revenues from home settlements for the homebuilding operations increased approximately 73% from the prior year quarter to approximately $1 billion.

Revenues from home settlements for the homebuilding operations increased approximately 73% from the prior year quarter to approximately $1 billion. The increased revenues reflect the increase in unit closings that were above prior year by approximately 77%. The average sales price decreased approximately 2% versus the prior-year quarter to an average of $257,000. This decrease is attributed to the mix of greater first time home buyer volume due to the Centex merger, in addition to the geographical and product mix of homes closed during the quarter.
In the first quarter, land sales generated approximately $13 million in total revenues, which is an increase of approximately $12 million versus the prior year's quarter. The sales in the quarter mainly reflect lot sales to other builders and several land parcel sales negotiated before the merger. Homebuilding gross profits from home settlements for the quarter, including homebuilding interest expense, was approximately $127 million versus the loss of $333 million in the prior year quarter. For those with access to the webcast slides, I refer you to Slide 6, the adjusted margin analysis, which outlines our gross margins in the following detail: Homebuilding gross margins from home settlements as a percentage of revenues was 13%, compared to a negative 59% in the first quarter of 2009. Adjusting the current quarter's gross margins for land and community valuation charges, interest expense and the acquisition accounting write-up for the Centex work in process, resulted in a conversion of 16.3% compared to 14.2% for the fourth quarter of 2009 or an improvement of 210 basis points. On a comparative basis versus the previous year's first quarter, conversion of 8.6%, the adjusted increase of 770 basis points. We expect that sequential quarterly improvements in gross margins as we worked our way through the backlog of higher incentives in early 2009, along with the house cost reductions initiatives we executed during last year plus the added benefits of the merger. 
Homebuilding interest expense decreased during the quarter to approximately $27 million versus approximately $55 million in the prior year. Included in the interest expense of the $27 million is an additional $1 million of expense relating to land and community valuation adjustments taken in the current quarter. Also included in the gross margin for the quarter was a charge related to land and community valuation adjustment in the amount of approximately $4 million. For the first quarter, we tested approximately 18 communities for potential impairment and valuation adjustments. The recorded valuation adjustments on approximately 10 communities for the quarter, of which approximately 9 communities have been previously impaired.
The total net gain from land sales posted for the quarter was approximately $4 million. The gain is mainly attributed to the sale of lots and several parcels of land in the quarter, offset by the fair value adjustment in land sold and land being held for disposition in the amount of approximately $600,000, which is included in the land cost of sales. Homebuilding SG&A expenses as a percentage of home sales for the quarter was approximately 15.4% or $151 million, an increase of approximately $31 million or approximately 26% versus the prior year quarter. This increase reflects the additional overhead as a result of the merger with the Centex operations. In addition, the first quarter includes approximately $3 million for employee severance and related costs. 
If we look at the SG&A line on a pro forma basis, our expenses reflect a reduction of approximately $88 million or 37% from the combined Pulte and Centex SG&A expenses from the previous year's quarter. In addition, relative to our SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009, we reduced the expense sequentially by $37 million or approximately 20%. In the homebuilding, other income and expense category for the quarter, the income of approximately $8 million includes a write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs resulting from the decision not to pursue certain land acquisitions in the amount of $500,000 and valuation adjustments and unconsolidated joint ventures of approximately $2 million. 
Also included in the category for the quarter is an expense of approximately $1.4 million associated with overhead expense reductions for lease exit and related costs. The homebuilding pretax loss for the quarter of approximately $11.8 million resulted in a pretax margin of approximately a negative 1% on total homebuilding revenues. The pretax loss is inclusive of the charges related to the valuation adjustments and land inventory and investments, land held for sale, severance and lease-exit-related charges and the acquisition accounting write-up for the Centex work in process. The pretax income from Pulte's financial service operations for the first quarter was approximately $5 million or an increase compared with the previous year's quarter of approximately $6 million. The pretax income increase is primarily the result of the increased home settlements reflecting the Centex merger volume. Total mortgage principal origination dollars were $498 million, an increase of 45% when compared to the same period last year. The increases related to greater home settlements from the homebuilding closing activity for the quarter. Total agency originations were $469 million, non-agency originations were approximately $6 million and broker or non-funded loans were approximately $23 million. Additionally, within the funded agency originations, FHA loans were approximately 40% of the loans funded from the financing line in the quarter compared to approximately 45% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Pulte Mortgage's capture rate for the current quarter was approximately 75% and the average FICO score for the quarter was 748. 
In the other non-operating category, pretax loss from the first quarter of approximately $8 million includes corporate expenses of approximately $10 million, partially offset by net interest income of $2 million resulting from our invested cash balances. If we look at the corporate expense line on a pro forma basis, our expenses reflect a reduction of approximately $25 million or 70% from the combined Pulte and Centex corporate expenses from the previous year's quarter.
For the first quarter, the company's pretax loss was approximately $14.5 million. This pretax loss for the quarter is inclusive of the charges related to the valuation adjustments in land inventory and investments, land held for sale, severance and lease-exit and related costs and the acquisition accounting for the Centex work-in-process write-off. The net loss for the first quarter was approximately $12.5 million or a loss of $0.03 per share as compared to a net loss of approximately $515 million or a loss of $2.02 per share for the same period last year. 
The quarter reflects a tax benefit of approximately $2 million, primarily due to the Accounting Standard Codification 740 or formerly FIN 48 accounting for uncertainty for income taxes. The number of shares used in the EPS calculation was approximately 377.7 million shares for the first quarter of 2010. The total shares outstanding in March 31, 2010, were approximately 382.5 million shares. 
Reviewing the balance sheet for the quarter, we ended with a cash balance of approximately $2.6 billion, increasing approximately $722 million from the fourth quarter of 2009. We received approximately $778 million in cash refunds during the first quarter related to our NOL carrybacks. Subsequently, in April, we received an additional $103 million in refunds for a total of approximately $880 million related to the NOL carrybacks. 
House and land inventory ended the quarter at approximately $5 billion. The increase in house and land inventory and land held for sale consumed approximately $30 million in cash from the fourth quarter of 2009. During the first quarter, our new investments in land were enrolling lot option takedowns and purchases of approximately $164 million and land development spending of approximately $108 million, offset by a modest reduction in house inventory by approximately $14 million. With approximately $2.6 billion in cash to end the quarter, we had no outstanding balance drawn on the revolving credit facility at the end of the quarter. The company's gross debt-to-total capitalization ratio was approximately 57.3% and on the net basis, 34.7%. Interest incurred amounted to approximately $69 million in the quarter, compared to $54 million for the same period last year. PulteGroup shareholder equity for the first quarter was approximately $3.2 billion. We repurchased no shares during the quarter, and the company has approximately $102 million remaining on our current authorization. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for some additional comments on the quarter. Steve?"
294550,100728329,61028,"PulteGroup, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 05, 2010",2010-05-05,"Earnings Calls","PulteGroup, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Roger, and once again, good morning, everyone. As Richard touched on, actual housing demand for the first quarter of 2010 was likely below many estimates. As we've talked about before, our expectations for market demand heading into the year were",1436,"Thanks, Roger, and once again, good morning, everyone. As Richard touched on, actual housing demand for the first quarter of 2010 was likely below many estimates. As we've talked about before, our expectations for market demand heading into the year were pretty modest, and Q1 demand was about what we expected, so we were properly positioned to realize significant overhead leverage. Our operations did a great job staying focused on the critical business drivers, closings, margins and overhead leverage and on capturing the opportunities related to our merger with Centex. 
In the markets, our process change work was ongoing in the quarter, as we continued to shift our operating model to focus more on building to order and away from our historical emphasis on carrying a higher level of spec inventory. We likely gave up some sales in the quarter, but we also realized a 4% decrease in our unsold inventory position from the fourth quarter of 2009. We ended Q1 with fewer than 2,700 unsold inventory homes. More importantly, the majority of the decrease was in spec finals, which fell by 15% to about 1,100 homes. Along with helping to control our unsold inventory positions, our process change work continues to benefit construction efficiency and purchasing activities, which over time, can translate into further margin expansion. The enhanced Pulte operating system has been rolled out to all markets. When we started rolling out the system, our operating divisions were at different stages of development, but all are quickly moving up the learning curve and adopting the critical processes and related information systems. 
We are tracking a number of performance metrics in critical operating categories, including material cost, cycle times and delivered quality. Once our Pulte operating system is fully implemented, we will be in a much better position to consistently track and measure critical sales and construction metrics across all communities in a market and across all of our markets around the country. Layering on top of this work, our Purchasing group has gotten through much of the data collection, analysis and initial vendor discussions associated with efforts to capture the target of $150 million to $200 million in purchasing synergies. The group is now transitioning to the bidding and contracting stage. A number of important categories, including flooring, appliances and cabinets, will be entering the RFP process in the second and third quarters of 2010. These are important next steps as we work to capture the targeted merger synergies. 
Moving on to other data points for the quarter. On a reported basis, net sign-ups for the quarter totaled 4,320 homes, which is an increase of 43% over the same period last year and in line with our expectations. Maybe more relevant, given the timing of the merger close, orders were up 15% from the fourth quarter 2009 as absorptions per community improved. While direct comparisons are difficult, assuming PulteGroup and Centex were combined in 2009, reported Q1 orders were down roughly 26% compared to last year. The year-over-year change reflects a combination of a 19% decrease in community count and a change in our sign-up process implemented at the start of the year. Consistent with our build-to-order strategy, we are now taking buyers deeper into the mortgage approval process before counting them as a sign-up. As a result of this process change, which is designed to help lower our cancellation rate and ensure that buyers ultimately close on the home, there were approximately 450 pending sales that would have previously been counted as sign-ups. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter sign-ups, which were consistent with our plans heading into the year. 
PulteGroup's reported backlog at quarter end totaled approximately 6,500 homes, more than double last year's number with a value of approximately $1.7 billion. 
Moving past the data analysis, I'll provide some high-level comments about how our geographic areas performed during the first quarter. As I discussed on the last call, the merger makes direct comparisons of sign-ups less meaningful, so I'll try to provide commentary as to the underlying business conditions. Reported sign-ups for the Northeast, which covers an area from Southern Virginia through Washington, D.C. and into Massachusetts, totaled 461 homes. As you've probably heard many times, the D.C. market has been one of the better performing areas of the country, even with the difficult weather conditions to start this year. Offsetting this somewhat was weakness in our Delaware value markets. 
In the Southeast area, sign-ups for the quarter totaled 730 homes. As we talked about on the last call, we expect this area to be a solid performer, as last year's merger added both great people and land positions to our existing operations in this area. Overall, the business was relatively stable through the quarter, with most of the market experiencing a typical, albeit modest, seasonal pickup as the months progress. 
Sign-ups in our Midwest area totaled 560 homes with relatively stable year-over-year demand throughout most of the markets. Our home state of Michigan, however, continued to struggle with weak economic conditions. Hopefully, improving conditions among car manufacturers can translate into jobs and an overall improving economy, both here in Michigan and in the surroundings states. 
Once again, PulteGroup's Gulf Coast operations experienced another good quarter of activity in reporting 1,551 sign-ups for the period. While Florida remains one of the most difficult operating environments, we did see some pickup in our North and South Florida operations. Central Florida has yet to see much of a rebound. 
Moving to the West, demand in Texas remained stable across all markets. Continuing further West to our Southwest area, Phoenix and Las Vegas continue to face very difficult conditions as sign-ups for the quarter totaled 514 homes. Part of our struggle in Las Vegas is company specific, as we have a limited number of closer in [ph] communities currently operating. Long-term, Las Vegas is still a market where we see opportunities and we are looking at several land deals that can improve our market position in 2011 and beyond. 
Finally, sign-ups in our West area were 504 homes for the quarter. Activity remains generally stable without big swings in demand or pricing from month-to-month. Drilling down a little, we continued to see some weakness in the Central Valley, which we run from the Bay Area, as we didn't feel much of a seasonal lift. On the other hand, Sacramento and Southern California saw a modest year-over-year gain and sign-ups but on relatively small numbers. There are reasons to be optimistic about California as the broader economy improves and the state's new tax credit takes effect. Although, we'll have to wait and see how budget issues at the state level affect the rate of improvement. 
I touched briefly on the potential to be buying some lots in Las Vegas. So let me finish up my comments with some additional color about our land pipeline. We ended Q1 with just under 150,000 lots under control, of which, 92% were owned and the remaining 8% controlled B option [ph]. As was the case last quarter, about 1/3 of these lots are developed. We've remained active in the land market and continue to find small but profitable builds in many markets across the country. The basic project profile hasn't changed since we are primarily looking for finished lot deals that can be controlled via option agreement and that can pencil to a mid-20% return or better. 
In the first quarter, we completed roughly 20 transactions accounting for approximately 1,700 lots. So obviously, these are not big communities. The deals represent an eventual capital outlay of approximately $110 million, although minimal cash went out the door in initially tying up these positions. These new communities offer an average margin from the high teens into the low-20% range. 
We continue to see land acquisition opportunities that make sense and where we are effectively buying the position at a price that is below replacement cost. That said, land prices in the more preferred submarkets are starting to rise, making the deals more challenging from a return standpoint. We'll have to wait and see if the higher prices bring more opportunities into the market. As of right now, that has not been the case. Echoing Richard's comments, we've gotten off to a good start and we're in a strong position heading into an uncertain period, given the state of the economy, the expiration of the tax credit and the potential for rising interest rates. Our operating teams have done a great job aligning their businesses with the market. 
Let me now turn the call back over to Jim Zeumer. Jim?"

We're not going to give guidance on that, obviously, but what we'll tell you is, is that our focus, and you kind of saw it in some of our land acquisition. Our focus has been on to improve absorptions per community as we move forward, and that has been the message to our operating teams, both on, certainly, the number of sales per community, but also on the margin performance and the overall operating performance within those communities. We have a lot of active stores. We did see a big runoff in the first quarter. We had a difficult first quarter comp on a pro forma basis, as both Pulte and Centex had different operating goals in the first quarter of last year. Ours was to move specs and raise cash and so was Centex. And so we feel pretty comfortable as we move forward to say, ""Let's focus on the land that we have and let's focus on the opportunities there."" We have repositioned product. We have aligned things with brand. We have done a lot of good things in the first quarter that put us in a better position on a sales per community basis as we move forward, and we feel pretty comfortable with that direction. Whether that results in 20% year-over-year growth or 50% year-over-year growth, that's more probably indicative of market condition.

The second part is on the lumber price increases and some of the commodity price increases, we price -- and the way we work is we work on a trailing 13-week basis and we buy our materials direct and we have great visibility, great transparency into the lumber portion. So we have seen lumber price increases. There's no doubt about it. Probably to the tune of maybe $400 a house that'll impact closings in the second quarter and maybe a little bit more than that as we go into the third quarter. But we've been able to offset those with further efficiencies on the labor side and, certainly, efficiencies on many of the things we're doing in trip charges and those type of things. You can offset these, as long as you componentize the breakdown of building the house. And we've done a tremendous amount of work on that so that on a net-net basis, the overall costs to frame a house for us, we haven't seen that much change at all relative to the lumber price increase.

Some do more, some do less. So I think you need to actually get to the operating margin side. But again, we still feel very comfortable with the efforts that we're making and the stride we're making on continuing to see the opportunity for increasing our overall margin as we go forward. So again, relative to the peer group, again, as Steve mentioned, some of them may be blending in more of the land that they buy currently, but we're still playing this for the long-term, not just a quarter-by-quarter. And a lot of the lots out there that are for sale are extremely limited. They're not in mass quantities in any particular location. So again, as we've see them, you buy 10 lots, 10 lots there. There's not a great deal that you're going to build a big business on for a long period of time. So short-term gain, again, it's relatively a long=term view. So I think there are some dynamics that are going on right now that will, again, will be washing out as we come through two, three quarters from now."

I want to add something to what Roger and Steve were just talking about on the land side. Others have talked about margin expansion for new communities being a significant portion of their total and that's because their lot position, in many cases, was significantly down. So therefore, any land they bring on is going to be a bigger piece. We made our bet with the large combination with Pulte and Centex and 55,000 lots that were acquired and the resulting accounting from that. I would suggest that our forecast for margin growth in the future, as Roger indicated, is sustainable and driven by things we can control, our own operating efficiencies and not reliant on future land prices. And while we want to be opportunistic on land purchases where we can, our view is that that's not going to last very long, and so whether we get margin benefit from opportunistic land for another quarter or two, that's great, but what happens in 2011 and 2012, et cetera? I would argue that we are going to have a land basis that's very appropriately valued for the long run and that's why we're continuing to forecast margin growth. So I just wanted to emphasize maybe some of the difference there in the way we're thinking about it. We don't need a lot of new land in order to expand margins."

Our Del Webb business was actually sequentially up a little bit, community-by-community. Velocities from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of this year and on a year-over-year basis was fairly flat, quite frankly, largely, driven by the fact that we did not have a lot of the Del Webb communities rolling off. And we did have a lot of Centex and Pulte communities rolling off. So what we're hearing from our sales teams out there, and Steve can comment more, is that the Del Webb buyer is beginning to come back and beginning to shop a lot more. They've not yet pulled the trigger in terms of big purchases yet, but you can sense the momentum building as the market has improved. And this buyer, we've known all along, takes a longer period of time in order to make their decisions. So our expectations are that the Del Webb business improves from here. We don't expect it to rocket up or anything like that, but we do expect improvement. But I don't know, Roger, if you want to give more color."

Again, there's a lot of dynamics going on in the market from lending, from bank revolvers. What's available there today is a lot less than what it used to have been. Most of the revolvers, and there's only a couple left in the industry today, have been used for letter of credit. So there's not much available from that standpoint that people are relying upon to build working capital going forward. So as we look at it, certainly, we've got to have cash to put back in on the vertical side because you're putting $2 to $3 for every dollar of land into the vertical side and so, of course, velocity's going to be important on that, so it's going to be exactly what the pace is going to be is going to drive how much actually we're going to use for working capital. So there's no quantification that I have to give you but cash will go into that. I think we've said easily could see maybe $500 million, $700 million, depending on where the market is and how much volume is out there from the market standpoint to put back into that side. And then again, a lot of what we've been doing on the land development side has been to try to be more cash constrained than efficient on development side. So rather than developing 300 lots in a community, we prefer maybe to develop less than 100 to make sure that from a liquidity standpoint, we're in good shape just to weather another downturn.
So all those things are factors that we're doing today in running it a lot smarter on the cash side that we can capture costs going forward if we feel good about the liquidity side. So again, those things that we are considering, but we have to have a better view of the market overall before we start to what I would say is move back into a normalized view of how we run the operations day to day."

And some of your other peers – or I’d say most of your other peers -- that have a lengthy land supply are kind of going for the idea that, yes, we have a lot of land, some of them have a lot of land, as well, but to develop it and bring it to market might be 12, 18 months-plus, and being risk-aversed there, saying, “Okay, let’s rather go out and buy finished lots.”  And I know you're doing that to some extent, as well, but I think Steve mentioned $100 million in land-development expenditures. I wanted to dig into that number. Are you folks also taking the view that you want to be risk-averse, “Let's not develop our own land,” that might still be 12 to 18 months out?

I think that initially, when Roger talked at the last call, we talked about maybe putting up to $700 million, $800 million into land development this year that were in our cash-flow projections. Now certainly, maybe a quarter of that to a third of that is some soft cost relative to property taxes and various assessment districts and those type of things. But the rest is physical hard development, and clearly we're doing that in some communities where we have proper demand and, as Roger spoke about earlier, we're doing it smartly. We're developing smaller pods of lots and not putting that much land out in front of us. 
What we're really looking at on the acquisition side is, where we can improve our position? I spoke about -- we clearly -- we know what it costs to develop land. We know the raw basis that you can buy land at today in the market. And if you can go out and get a developed lot in a preferred sub-market to target the consumer that we’re very good at serving, that's below those costs, it just makes good business sense for us to go out and buy those lots as well, and we did -- approximately 20, 25 transactions in the first quarter. And the $110 million I talked about was the total cash outlay eventually on those deals as we take down all the lots, not what we put out in the first quarter to acquire those lots. So for us, it's clearly a blend. 
We like our land positions that we have. We've said that for a long time. Unfortunately, we’ve had to impair those positions as the market downturn has been here over the last couple of years. But we haven't burned through those positions. Those impairments are trapped now into the new basis of that land, and as we look out and we start to see some activity in these preferred sub-markets where we own land as well, we see a very good situation emerging for us. And as Richard talked about, our opportunity to improve margin doesn't lie totally in our ability to have to buy land at below-market value, and we feel pretty good about that. So I think that, hopefully, that answers your question, but that's really what we're looking at. I mean there's a combination for us, but I think we're more weighted towards our current projects, and that's why when I was asked the question, I mean we're really focused on improving absorptions in those communities that we already own."

What we think is going to happen is that number one, you’re going to increase the overall supply of homes.  It’s going to be moved from a supply of land or a supply of homes, obviously, and typically, unless you see more demand in that submarket relatively speaking, that tends to have some kind of a downward pressure on pricing.

For those of you who have access to the Internet, a slide presentation, available at pultegroupinc.com will accompany this discussion. The slides will be archived on the site for the next 30 days for those who want to review it later. As a reminder, on August 18, 2009, PulteGroup completed its merger with Centex Corporation. Unless otherwise identified, results reported and released and on the call reflect the inclusion of Centex's operations for the first quarter of 2010, although results for the comparable prior year period have not been adjusted for this merger. Finally, I want to alert everyone that certain statements and comments made during the course of this call must be considered forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. PulteGroup believes that such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but there are no assurances that actual outcomes will not be materially different from those discussed today. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to the company on the date of this call, and the company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information in the future.
Participants in today's call should refer to PulteGroup's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and this morning's press release for a detailed list of risks and uncertainties associated with the business. Certain statements during this call also contain references to non-GAAP financial measures. See this morning's press release, which is available on our corporate website, pultegroupinc.com, for reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP numbers. As always, at the end of our prepared comments, we will have time for Q&A. We wait until then to open the queue for questions.

Our first call as the newly named PulteGroup. I'm very pleased to discuss PulteGroup's first quarter results as they demonstrate the significant gains we continue to realize in the critical areas of margin expansion and overhead leverage. The expected benefits from last year's merger with Centex are clearly evident in the numbers and in accelerating PulteGroup's progress toward profitability. In planning for 2010 during last year's budgeting process, we worked under the assumption that demand for new homes in 2010 would be comparable to what we experienced in 2009. We were looking for volume and pricing to remain relatively stable, similar to what we saw in the back half of 2009, with the potential for volatility from month-to-month. At the time, this view was less optimistic than many economists held, but with one quarter down, it looks like 2010 is unfolding more in line with our expectations. Given the planning assumption of relatively stable industry demand, we organized our operations to be successful within this environment, while being positioned to respond to more robust demand if it materialized. 
We continue to advance initiatives focused on expanding margins, gaining overhead leverage and protecting our balance sheet. We also continue to shift away from a sales model that emphasizes the production of spec inventory to one that focuses more on leveling production and building to an existing order. By properly organizing and sizing our operations in alignment with anticipated market conditions, we generated significantly better financial results. On what we would call relatively modest revenue and closing volumes for the first quarter, PulteGroup reported a net loss for the period of approximately $12 million or $0.03 per share. In contrast to the roughly $2.00 per share loss in Q1 of last year, we made tremendous gains by emphasizing profitability over volume and by dramatically improving overhead leverage. 
Improved earnings for the quarter reflect a combination of factors: First, better gross margins, which continue to expand in the quarter. Since bottoming out in late 2008 and early 2009, we have realized steadily improving margins within our homebuilding operations. We still have a lot of work to do on improving margins over the long term, but we have made solid progress during the past year. Second, we captured critical overhead leverage on the combined Pulte-Centex volumes and delivered on the underlying merger strategy of running two businesses essentially on one overhead structure. And third, the absence of significant impairment charges. Given more stable demand and pricing conditions in the market and improving margins, we believe that the worst of the impairment process should be behind us. 
Of course, a key component to the year-over-year gains PulteGroup realized in the quarter was last year's merger with Centex and the aggressive actions taken to capture the targeted $440 million in savings and synergies. When we announced the merger, we talked about the critical underlying strategic benefits supporting this transaction, including significant cost savings and operating efficiencies, overhead leverage, acquisition of critical land assets and some unique branding opportunities. At that time, we also talked about how the merger with Centex could help accelerate PulteGroup's progress in these key areas and, in particular, advance our return to profitability. Given PulteGroup's strong start in 2010, our Q1 results demonstrate clearly that we are realizing the significant operating and financial benefits associated with the Centex merger. With the opportunity to realize ongoing margin expansion, additional SG&A leverage and improved closing volumes, assuming market conditions for the housing industry remain stable, we expect PulteGroup to be profitable for 2010. 
With regard to the merger integration work, I will tell you that we are  effectively done and operating as one company. There are still projects to complete in important areas as we transition information systems and complete the integration work supporting our operations and financial processes, but I feel comfortable in saying that the bigger merger risks are behind us. Now it's a matter of completing select tasks and capturing any additional synergy opportunities, particularly in the areas of construction efficiencies and purchasing. As I said at the outset of this call, I think we've gotten off to a solid start in a year that may not be as robust as some had expected. I think the U.S. housing industry is finding and may have already found the bottom, but that's different from saying that a recovery is at hand. 
We believe that any meaningful sustained improvement will require employment gains and in turn, better consumer confidence. To the latter point, while unemployment is high at roughly 10%, that still means that 90% of people are working but not many of them are buying homes right now. Even a modest uptick in employment could have a significant impact on demand, assuming it drives greater confidence among this larger group. PulteGroup is in an excellent position to meet current and optimistically increasing demand given our strong land pipeline and robust cash position, which benefited from the tax refunds associated with last year's NOL legislation. The 20-plus land transactions primarily involved finished lots, so we can move quickly to selling and constructing new homes, which can provide new jobs and help the economic recovery at both a local and national level. As always, I want to thank our associates for the great work they continue to do in delivering superior product quality and an unmatched home buying experience to our customers. Now let me turn the call over to Roger Cregg for additional details on PulteGroup's first quarter financial results. Roger?"
294550,100728329,61030,"PulteGroup, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 05, 2010",2010-05-05,"Earnings Calls","PulteGroup, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Richard, and good morning. Revenues from home settlements for the homebuilding operations increased approximately 73% from the prior year quarter to approximately $1 billion. The increased revenues reflect the increase in unit closings that were a",1394,"Thanks, Richard, and good morning. Revenues from home settlements for the homebuilding operations increased approximately 73% from the prior year quarter to approximately $1 billion. The increased revenues reflect the increase in unit closings that were above prior year by approximately 77%. The average sales price decreased approximately 2% versus the prior-year quarter to an average of $257,000. This decrease is attributed to the mix of greater first time home buyer volume due to the Centex merger, in addition to the geographical and product mix of homes closed during the quarter.
In the first quarter, land sales generated approximately $13 million in total revenues, which is an increase of approximately $12 million versus the prior year's quarter. The sales in the quarter mainly reflect lot sales to other builders and several land parcel sales negotiated before the merger. Homebuilding gross profits from home settlements for the quarter, including homebuilding interest expense, was approximately $127 million versus the loss of $333 million in the prior year quarter. For those with access to the webcast slides, I refer you to Slide 6, the adjusted margin analysis, which outlines our gross margins in the following detail: Homebuilding gross margins from home settlements as a percentage of revenues was 13%, compared to a negative 59% in the first quarter of 2009. Adjusting the current quarter's gross margins for land and community valuation charges, interest expense and the acquisition accounting write-up for the Centex work in process, resulted in a conversion of 16.3% compared to 14.2% for the fourth quarter of 2009 or an improvement of 210 basis points. On a comparative basis versus the previous year's first quarter, conversion of 8.6%, the adjusted increase of 770 basis points. We expect that sequential quarterly improvements in gross margins as we worked our way through the backlog of higher incentives in early 2009, along with the house cost reductions initiatives we executed during last year plus the added benefits of the merger. 
Homebuilding interest expense decreased during the quarter to approximately $27 million versus approximately $55 million in the prior year. Included in the interest expense of the $27 million is an additional $1 million of expense relating to land and community valuation adjustments taken in the current quarter. Also included in the gross margin for the quarter was a charge related to land and community valuation adjustment in the amount of approximately $4 million. For the first quarter, we tested approximately 18 communities for potential impairment and valuation adjustments. The recorded valuation adjustments on approximately 10 communities for the quarter, of which approximately 9 communities have been previously impaired.
The total net gain from land sales posted for the quarter was approximately $4 million. The gain is mainly attributed to the sale of lots and several parcels of land in the quarter, offset by the fair value adjustment in land sold and land being held for disposition in the amount of approximately $600,000, which is included in the land cost of sales. Homebuilding SG&A expenses as a percentage of home sales for the quarter was approximately 15.4% or $151 million, an increase of approximately $31 million or approximately 26% versus the prior year quarter. This increase reflects the additional overhead as a result of the merger with the Centex operations. In addition, the first quarter includes approximately $3 million for employee severance and related costs. 
If we look at the SG&A line on a pro forma basis, our expenses reflect a reduction of approximately $88 million or 37% from the combined Pulte and Centex SG&A expenses from the previous year's quarter. In addition, relative to our SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009, we reduced the expense sequentially by $37 million or approximately 20%. In the homebuilding, other income and expense category for the quarter, the income of approximately $8 million includes a write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs resulting from the decision not to pursue certain land acquisitions in the amount of $500,000 and valuation adjustments and unconsolidated joint ventures of approximately $2 million. 
Also included in the category for the quarter is an expense of approximately $1.4 million associated with overhead expense reductions for lease exit and related costs. The homebuilding pretax loss for the quarter of approximately $11.8 million resulted in a pretax margin of approximately a negative 1% on total homebuilding revenues. The pretax loss is inclusive of the charges related to the valuation adjustments and land inventory and investments, land held for sale, severance and lease-exit-related charges and the acquisition accounting write-up for the Centex work in process. The pretax income from Pulte's financial service operations for the first quarter was approximately $5 million or an increase compared with the previous year's quarter of approximately $6 million. The pretax income increase is primarily the result of the increased home settlements reflecting the Centex merger volume. Total mortgage principal origination dollars were $498 million, an increase of 45% when compared to the same period last year. The increases related to greater home settlements from the homebuilding closing activity for the quarter. Total agency originations were $469 million, non-agency originations were approximately $6 million and broker or non-funded loans were approximately $23 million. Additionally, within the funded agency originations, FHA loans were approximately 40% of the loans funded from the financing line in the quarter compared to approximately 45% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Pulte Mortgage's capture rate for the current quarter was approximately 75% and the average FICO score for the quarter was 748. 
In the other non-operating category, pretax loss from the first quarter of approximately $8 million includes corporate expenses of approximately $10 million, partially offset by net interest income of $2 million resulting from our invested cash balances. If we look at the corporate expense line on a pro forma basis, our expenses reflect a reduction of approximately $25 million or 70% from the combined Pulte and Centex corporate expenses from the previous year's quarter.
For the first quarter, the company's pretax loss was approximately $14.5 million. This pretax loss for the quarter is inclusive of the charges related to the valuation adjustments in land inventory and investments, land held for sale, severance and lease-exit and related costs and the acquisition accounting for the Centex work-in-process write-off. The net loss for the first quarter was approximately $12.5 million or a loss of $0.03 per share as compared to a net loss of approximately $515 million or a loss of $2.02 per share for the same period last year. 
The quarter reflects a tax benefit of approximately $2 million, primarily due to the Accounting Standard Codification 740 or formerly FIN 48 accounting for uncertainty for income taxes. The number of shares used in the EPS calculation was approximately 377.7 million shares for the first quarter of 2010. The total shares outstanding in March 31, 2010, were approximately 382.5 million shares. 
Reviewing the balance sheet for the quarter, we ended with a cash balance of approximately $2.6 billion, increasing approximately $722 million from the fourth quarter of 2009. We received approximately $778 million in cash refunds during the first quarter related to our NOL carrybacks. Subsequently, in April, we received an additional $103 million in refunds for a total of approximately $880 million related to the NOL carrybacks. 
House and land inventory ended the quarter at approximately $5 billion. The increase in house and land inventory and land held for sale consumed approximately $30 million in cash from the fourth quarter of 2009. During the first quarter, our new investments in land were enrolling lot option takedowns and purchases of approximately $164 million and land development spending of approximately $108 million, offset by a modest reduction in house inventory by approximately $14 million. With approximately $2.6 billion in cash to end the quarter, we had no outstanding balance drawn on the revolving credit facility at the end of the quarter. The company's gross debt-to-total capitalization ratio was approximately 57.3% and on the net basis, 34.7%. Interest incurred amounted to approximately $69 million in the quarter, compared to $54 million for the same period last year. PulteGroup shareholder equity for the first quarter was approximately $3.2 billion. We repurchased no shares during the quarter, and the company has approximately $102 million remaining on our current authorization. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve for some additional comments on the quarter. Steve?"

As Richard touched on, actual housing demand for the first quarter of 2010 was likely below many estimates. As we've talked about before, our expectations for market demand heading into the year were pretty modest, and Q1 demand was about what we expected, so we were properly positioned to realize significant overhead leverage. Our operations did a great job staying focused on the critical business drivers, closings, margins and overhead leverage and on capturing the opportunities related to our merger with Centex. 
In the markets, our process change work was ongoing in the quarter, as we continued to shift our operating model to focus more on building to order and away from our historical emphasis on carrying a higher level of spec inventory. We likely gave up some sales in the quarter, but we also realized a 4% decrease in our unsold inventory position from the fourth quarter of 2009. We ended Q1 with fewer than 2,700 unsold inventory homes. More importantly, the majority of the decrease was in spec finals, which fell by 15% to about 1,100 homes. Along with helping to control our unsold inventory positions, our process change work continues to benefit construction efficiency and purchasing activities, which over time, can translate into further margin expansion. The enhanced Pulte operating system has been rolled out to all markets. When we started rolling out the system, our operating divisions were at different stages of development, but all are quickly moving up the learning curve and adopting the critical processes and related information systems. 
We are tracking a number of performance metrics in critical operating categories, including material cost, cycle times and delivered quality. Once our Pulte operating system is fully implemented, we will be in a much better position to consistently track and measure critical sales and construction metrics across all communities in a market and across all of our markets around the country. Layering on top of this work, our Purchasing group has gotten through much of the data collection, analysis and initial vendor discussions associated with efforts to capture the target of $150 million to $200 million in purchasing synergies. The group is now transitioning to the bidding and contracting stage. A number of important categories, including flooring, appliances and cabinets, will be entering the RFP process in the second and third quarters of 2010. These are important next steps as we work to capture the targeted merger synergies. 
Moving on to other data points for the quarter. On a reported basis, net sign-ups for the quarter totaled 4,320 homes, which is an increase of 43% over the same period last year and in line with our expectations. Maybe more relevant, given the timing of the merger close, orders were up 15% from the fourth quarter 2009 as absorptions per community improved. While direct comparisons are difficult, assuming PulteGroup and Centex were combined in 2009, reported Q1 orders were down roughly 26% compared to last year. The year-over-year change reflects a combination of a 19% decrease in community count and a change in our sign-up process implemented at the start of the year. Consistent with our build-to-order strategy, we are now taking buyers deeper into the mortgage approval process before counting them as a sign-up. As a result of this process change, which is designed to help lower our cancellation rate and ensure that buyers ultimately close on the home, there were approximately 450 pending sales that would have previously been counted as sign-ups. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter sign-ups, which were consistent with our plans heading into the year. 
PulteGroup's reported backlog at quarter end totaled approximately 6,500 homes, more than double last year's number with a value of approximately $1.7 billion. 
Moving past the data analysis, I'll provide some high-level comments about how our geographic areas performed during the first quarter. As I discussed on the last call, the merger makes direct comparisons of sign-ups less meaningful, so I'll try to provide commentary as to the underlying business conditions. Reported sign-ups for the Northeast, which covers an area from Southern Virginia through Washington, D.C. and into Massachusetts, totaled 461 homes. As you've probably heard many times, the D.C. market has been one of the better performing areas of the country, even with the difficult weather conditions to start this year. Offsetting this somewhat was weakness in our Delaware value markets. 
In the Southeast area, sign-ups for the quarter totaled 730 homes. As we talked about on the last call, we expect this area to be a solid performer, as last year's merger added both great people and land positions to our existing operations in this area. Overall, the business was relatively stable through the quarter, with most of the market experiencing a typical, albeit modest, seasonal pickup as the months progress. 
Sign-ups in our Midwest area totaled 560 homes with relatively stable year-over-year demand throughout most of the markets. Our home state of Michigan, however, continued to struggle with weak economic conditions. Hopefully, improving conditions among car manufacturers can translate into jobs and an overall improving economy, both here in Michigan and in the surroundings states. 
Once again, PulteGroup's Gulf Coast operations experienced another good quarter of activity in reporting 1,551 sign-ups for the period. While Florida remains one of the most difficult operating environments, we did see some pickup in our North and South Florida operations. Central Florida has yet to see much of a rebound. 
Moving to the West, demand in Texas remained stable across all markets. Continuing further West to our Southwest area, Phoenix and Las Vegas continue to face very difficult conditions as sign-ups for the quarter totaled 514 homes. Part of our struggle in Las Vegas is company specific, as we have a limited number of closer in [ph] communities currently operating. Long-term, Las Vegas is still a market where we see opportunities and we are looking at several land deals that can improve our market position in 2011 and beyond. 
Finally, sign-ups in our West area were 504 homes for the quarter. Activity remains generally stable without big swings in demand or pricing from month-to-month. Drilling down a little, we continued to see some weakness in the Central Valley, which we run from the Bay Area, as we didn't feel much of a seasonal lift. On the other hand, Sacramento and Southern California saw a modest year-over-year gain and sign-ups but on relatively small numbers. There are reasons to be optimistic about California as the broader economy improves and the state's new tax credit takes effect. Although, we'll have to wait and see how budget issues at the state level affect the rate of improvement. 
I touched briefly on the potential to be buying some lots in Las Vegas. So let me finish up my comments with some additional color about our land pipeline. We ended Q1 with just under 150,000 lots under control, of which, 92% were owned and the remaining 8% controlled B option [ph]. As was the case last quarter, about 1/3 of these lots are developed. We've remained active in the land market and continue to find small but profitable builds in many markets across the country. The basic project profile hasn't changed since we are primarily looking for finished lot deals that can be controlled via option agreement and that can pencil to a mid-20% return or better. 
In the first quarter, we completed roughly 20 transactions accounting for approximately 1,700 lots. So obviously, these are not big communities. The deals represent an eventual capital outlay of approximately $110 million, although minimal cash went out the door in initially tying up these positions. These new communities offer an average margin from the high teens into the low-20% range. 
We continue to see land acquisition opportunities that make sense and where we are effectively buying the position at a price that is below replacement cost. That said, land prices in the more preferred submarkets are starting to rise, making the deals more challenging from a return standpoint. We'll have to wait and see if the higher prices bring more opportunities into the market. As of right now, that has not been the case. Echoing Richard's comments, we've gotten off to a good start and we're in a strong position heading into an uncertain period, given the state of the economy, the expiration of the tax credit and the potential for rising interest rates.

We're not going to give guidance on that, obviously, but what we'll tell you is, is that our focus, and you kind of saw it in some of our land acquisition. Our focus has been on to improve absorptions per community as we move forward, and that has been the message to our operating teams, both on, certainly, the number of sales per community, but also on the margin performance and the overall operating performance within those communities. We have a lot of active stores. We did see a big runoff in the first quarter. We had a difficult first quarter comp on a pro forma basis, as both Pulte and Centex had different operating goals in the first quarter of last year. Ours was to move specs and raise cash and so was Centex. And so we feel pretty comfortable as we move forward to say, ""Let's focus on the land that we have and let's focus on the opportunities there."" We have repositioned product. We have aligned things with brand. We have done a lot of good things in the first quarter that put us in a better position on a sales per community basis as we move forward, and we feel pretty comfortable with that direction. Whether that results in 20% year-over-year growth or 50% year-over-year growth, that's more probably indicative of market condition.

I'll answer part of that and Roger's got part of the answer on the margin piece as we go forward. On an overall basis, yes, we're blending the land in. I mean as I talked about, a 1,700 lot acquisition in the first quarter is certainly very modest and we like our land positions. They were long land positions. Many of the impairments that we've taken over the last few years are still embedded in those land positions, but where we see opportunities to go out and buy land at below market value in great submarkets, we're continuing to do that, but we don't see that as a significant part of our business from a closing standpoint this year. The second part is on the lumber price increases and some of the commodity price increases, we price -- and the way we work is we work on a trailing 13-week basis and we buy our materials direct and we have great visibility, great transparency into the lumber portion. So we have seen lumber price increases. There's no doubt about it. Probably to the tune of maybe $400 a house that'll impact closings in the second quarter and maybe a little bit more than that as we go into the third quarter. But we've been able to offset those with further efficiencies on the labor side and, certainly, efficiencies on many of the things we're doing in trip charges and those type of things. You can offset these, as long as you componentize the breakdown of building the house. And we've done a tremendous amount of work on that so that on a net-net basis, the overall costs to frame a house for us, we haven't seen that much change at all relative to the lumber price increase.

But again, we still feel very comfortable with the efforts that we're making and the stride we're making on continuing to see the opportunity for increasing our overall margin as we go forward. So again, relative to the peer group, again, as Steve mentioned, some of them may be blending in more of the land that they buy currently, but we're still playing this for the long-term, not just a quarter-by-quarter. And a lot of the lots out there that are for sale are extremely limited. They're not in mass quantities in any particular location. So again, as we've see them, you buy 10 lots, 10 lots there. There's not a great deal that you're going to build a big business on for a long period of time. So short-term gain, again, it's relatively a long=term view.

I want to add something to what Roger and Steve were just talking about on the land side. Others have talked about margin expansion for new communities being a significant portion of their total and that's because their lot position, in many cases, was significantly down. So therefore, any land they bring on is going to be a bigger piece. We made our bet with the large combination with Pulte and Centex and 55,000 lots that were acquired and the resulting accounting from that. I would suggest that our forecast for margin growth in the future, as Roger indicated, is sustainable and driven by things we can control, our own operating efficiencies and not reliant on future land prices. And while we want to be opportunistic on land purchases where we can, our view is that that's not going to last very long, and so whether we get margin benefit from opportunistic land for another quarter or two, that's great, but what happens in 2011 and 2012, et cetera? I would argue that we are going to have a land basis that's very appropriately valued for the long run and that's why we're continuing to forecast margin growth. So I just wanted to emphasize maybe some of the difference there in the way we're thinking about it. We don't need a lot of new land in order to expand margins."

Again, there's a lot of dynamics going on in the market from lending, from bank revolvers. What's available there today is a lot less than what it used to have been. Most of the revolvers, and there's only a couple left in the industry today, have been used for letter of credit. So there's not much available from that standpoint that people are relying upon to build working capital going forward. So as we look at it, certainly, we've got to have cash to put back in on the vertical side because you're putting $2 to $3 for every dollar of land into the vertical side and so, of course, velocity's going to be important on that, so it's going to be exactly what the pace is going to be is going to drive how much actually we're going to use for working capital. So there's no quantification that I have to give you but cash will go into that. I think we've said easily could see maybe $500 million, $700 million, depending on where the market is and how much volume is out there from the market standpoint to put back into that side. And then again, a lot of what we've been doing on the land development side has been to try to be more cash constrained than efficient on development side. So rather than developing 300 lots in a community, we prefer maybe to develop less than 100 to make sure that from a liquidity standpoint, we're in good shape just to weather another downturn.
So all those things are factors that we're doing today in running it a lot smarter on the cash side that we can capture costs going forward if we feel good about the liquidity side. So again, those things that we are considering, but we have to have a better view of the market overall before we start to what I would say is move back into a normalized view of how we run the operations day to day."

Let's focus on our land pipeline that we already have as opposed to being in a scramble out there in the market. And some of your other peers – or I’d say most of your other peers -- that have a lengthy land supply are kind of going for the idea that, yes, we have a lot of land, some of them have a lot of land, as well, but to develop it and bring it to market might be 12, 18 months-plus, and being risk-aversed there, saying, “Okay, let’s rather go out and buy finished lots.”  And I know you're doing that to some extent, as well, but I think Steve mentioned $100 million in land-development expenditures. I wanted to dig into that number. Are you folks also taking the view that you want to be risk-averse, “Let's not develop our own land,” that might still be 12 to 18 months out?  Are you different there? Is this land development expenditure simply things like longer multi-stage Del Webb communities? So I was wondering if maybe you could talk us through that a little bit."

I think that initially, when Roger talked at the last call, we talked about maybe putting up to $700 million, $800 million into land development this year that were in our cash-flow projections. Now certainly, maybe a quarter of that to a third of that is some soft cost relative to property taxes and various assessment districts and those type of things. But the rest is physical hard development, and clearly we're doing that in some communities where we have proper demand and, as Roger spoke about earlier, we're doing it smartly. We're developing smaller pods of lots and not putting that much land out in front of us. 
What we're really looking at on the acquisition side is, where we can improve our position? I spoke about -- we clearly -- we know what it costs to develop land. We know the raw basis that you can buy land at today in the market. And if you can go out and get a developed lot in a preferred sub-market to target the consumer that we’re very good at serving, that's below those costs, it just makes good business sense for us to go out and buy those lots as well, and we did -- approximately 20, 25 transactions in the first quarter. And the $110 million I talked about was the total cash outlay eventually on those deals as we take down all the lots, not what we put out in the first quarter to acquire those lots. So for us, it's clearly a blend. 
We like our land positions that we have. We've said that for a long time. Unfortunately, we’ve had to impair those positions as the market downturn has been here over the last couple of years. But we haven't burned through those positions. Those impairments are trapped now into the new basis of that land, and as we look out and we start to see some activity in these preferred sub-markets where we own land as well, we see a very good situation emerging for us. And as Richard talked about, our opportunity to improve margin doesn't lie totally in our ability to have to buy land at below-market value, and we feel pretty good about that. So I think that, hopefully, that answers your question, but that's really what we're looking at. I mean there's a combination for us, but I think we're more weighted towards our current projects, and that's why when I was asked the question, I mean we're really focused on improving absorptions in those communities that we already own."

And builders are buying that to sell it into the price that’s being absorbed in the submarket.  What we think is going to happen is that number one, you’re going to increase the overall supply of homes.  It’s going to be moved from a supply of land or a supply of homes, obviously, and typically, unless you see more demand in that submarket relatively speaking, that tends to have some kind of a downward pressure on pricing. And we think it's going to be flat to maybe slightly up or down, depending on the builders that actually bought the land and how aggressive they go in there with new products and new housing and then, obviously, what the corresponding retail market looks like. So it's probably not and endless supply of price increases because everybody's buying up the land.

Finally, I want to alert everyone that certain statements and comments made during the course of this call must be considered forward-looking statements, as defined by the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. PulteGroup believes such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but there are no assurances that actual outcomes will not be materially different from those discussed today. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to the company on the date of this call, and the company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information in the future. 
Participants in today's call should refer to PulteGroup's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and this morning's press release for a detailed list of risks and uncertainties associated with the business. Certain statements made during this call also contain references to non-GAAP financial measures. See this morning's press release, which is available at our corporate website, pultegroupinc.com, for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP numbers. 
As always, at the end of our prepared comments, we will have time for Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Richard Dugas for his opening comments. Richard?"

In preparing for today's discussion, I reviewed our comments from PulteGroup's last two quarterly conference calls. During those calls, we talked about expectations that new home sales in 2010 would likely be comparable to 2009, and how we had set up our business to be successful in that type of difficult macro environment. At the time, we also talked about how important the Centex merger would be in accelerating PulteGroup's overall pace of operating and financial improvement. The significant gains in PulteGroup's second quarter financial results demonstrate that we are achieving the goals that we have set for the company. 
As Roger will detail in a moment, we continued to realize improvement throughout our operations, as Homebuilding revenue roughly doubled to $1.3 billion. Homebuilding margins before land-related charges and interest costs expanded to 17.2%. SG&A dropped to 11.7% of home sale revenue. And reported earnings per share of $0.20 a share represent a major step in the process of rebuilding shareholder value for our investors. 
Successfully executing against a small number of key initiatives helped the company to deliver improved operating and financial results. The company significantly reduced year-over-year pretax loss of $6 million, which includes $45 million in land and mortgage-related charges, reflects lower impairments and the benefit of gross margin expansion and better overhead leverage within our Homebuilding operations. 
In combination with our ongoing work against these key initiatives, the dramatic improvement in PulteGroup's performance was driven in large part by last year's merger with Centex. By putting the two organizations together, it allowed us to meaningfully increase the number of homes we delivered and the corresponding revenue we recognized. 
In turn, having moved quickly to integrate the businesses and capture expected overhead synergies, we're able to realize a significant leverage on our SG&A spending which, as a percentage of settlement revenues, dropped by almost 600 basis points. We have been focused on our efforts to reduce overhead cost during the prolonged market slowdown, but achieving these results would have been difficult without the merger. The merger integration is all but complete, but the benefits will continue to support our results for many years to come. 
As concerns about potential integration risk rapidly dissipate, comments from more and more investors acknowledge the positive business impact the transaction is having on our business. Overall, we are pleased with our second quarter financial results and the progress we continue to make in strengthening our operations and improving our market position. PulteGroup associates throughout the country have worked hard to close homes, control cost and execute against our key business strategies. I want to thank them for their continued efforts in support of the company. 
Beyond the improvement in our second quarter numbers, we appreciate that the focus of the past couple of months was and remains the current state of housing, following the April 30 expiration of the federal tax credit. The falloff in demand has been well documented and in truth has likely exceeded just about all expectations. 
We believe that it is a positive sign and our demand has been stable since the initial pullback, but overall volumes remain well below normal seasonal demand. There is certainly no shortage of economic research attempting to estimate how much demand was pulled forward and how long any effects will be felt. Some believe the housing malaise could linger, while others think that some level of rebound could be evident within months. And while the industry could experience a modest seasonal lift in the back half of the year, within PulteGroup we'll continue to air on the side of caution in terms of how we manage our operations until a more sustained rebound is evident.
In the end, almost regardless of how future demand plays out, we still believe that the tax credit had to end. We need to know the true level of demand without government stimulus distorting the market, so that we can continue to properly position our business for ongoing improvement. Beyond the immediacy of any tax credit impact, for the industry to experience a meaningful and sustained rebound in demand over the long term, we need a stronger economy, job creation and better consumer confidence. At a run rate bouncing around 300,000 to 350,000 new home sales annually, our industry continues to face incredibly low demand. 
Supply, be it traditional home sales, vacancies, short sales, foreclosures, shadow or otherwise, is obviously important. But right now, the industry's biggest issue is a lack of buyers. The good news is that coming off such low levels, even a modest improvement in fundamental demand can be experienced relatively quickly. Given the low interest rate environment and incredible home values, even slight improvements in local market economies or consumer sentiment can help convert home shoppers into home buyers. 
Our operations are in a good position as we work through these next few months, with only 1,100 finished spec homes or just slightly more than one per community. Our inventory position is certainly manageable, as we are benefiting from our strategy of not chasing the tax credit buyer earlier in the year. 
Right now, let me turn the call over to Roger Cregg for additional details on PulteGroup's second quarter financial results. After which, I'll provide a little more detail on market conditions during the quarter. Roger?"
294550,109394797,72101,"PulteGroup, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-04-2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","PulteGroup, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Richard, and good morning, everyone. Revenues from home settlements for the Homebuilding operations increased approximately 93% from the prior-year quarter to approximately $1.3 billion. Increased revenues reflect the increase in unit closings",1408,"Thank you, Richard, and good morning, everyone. Revenues from home settlements for the Homebuilding operations increased approximately 93% from the prior-year quarter to approximately $1.3 billion. Increased revenues reflect the increase in unit closings that were above prior year by approximately 101%, mainly attributed to the merger with Centex. The average sales price decreased approximately 4% versus the prior year quarter to an average of $251,000. This decrease is attributed to the mix of greater first-time home buyer volume due to the Centex merger, in addition to the geographical and product mix of homes closed during the current quarter.
In the second quarter, land sales generated approximately $7 million in total revenues, which is an increase of approximately $3 million versus the previous year's quarter. The sales in the quarter mainly reflect the sale of lots and land parcels to other builders. 
Homebuilding gross profits from home settlements for the quarter, including Homebuilding interest expense, was approximately $159 million versus a loss of $71 million in the prior-year quarter. 
For those with access to the webcast slides, I refer you to Slide #6, the adjusted margin analysis which outlines our gross margins. Homebuilding gross margins from home settlements as a percentage of revenues was 12.6% compared with a negative 10.9% in the second quarter of 2009. 
Adjusting the current quarter's gross margins for land and community valuation charges, interest expense and the acquisition accounting write-up for the Centex work in process resulted in a conversion of 17.2% compared to an adjusted margin of 16.3% for the first quarter of 2010 or a sequential improvement of 90 basis points on an adjusted basis. On a comparative basis versus the previous year's second quarter conversion of 9.4%, the adjusted increase is 780 basis points. The improved margins are a direct result of lower sales incentives, house cost improvements and stable market pricing.
Homebuilding interest expense increased during the quarter to approximately $38 million versus approximately $33 million in the prior year. Included in the interest expense of $38 million is an additional $5 million of expense related to the land and community valuation adjustments taken in the current quarter. Also included in the gross margin for the quarter was a charge related to land and community valuation adjustments in the amount of approximately $20 million. 
Consistent with prior quarters, we have reviewed all of our communities for impairment indicators. Based on this review in the second quarter, we identified and tested approximately 30 communities for potential impairment and valuation adjustments. The recorded valuation adjustments on approximately 16 communities for the quarter, of which approximately nine communities or 56%, have been previously impaired.
Additionally, we impaired three projects which represented approximately $15 million or 75% of the total $20 million in impairments. Also for the quarter, the acquisition accounting work-in-process charge is approximately $500,000. 
The total net gain from land sales posted for the quarter was approximately $4 million. The gain is mainly attributed to the sale of lots and parcels of land in the quarter. 
Homebuilding SG&A expenses as a percent of home sales for the quarter was approximately 11.7% or $147 million, an increase of approximately $33 million or 29% versus the prior-year quarter. This increase reflects the additional incremental overhead associated with the merger of the Centex operations. 
In addition, the second quarter includes approximately $1 million for employee severance and related costs. If we look at the SG&A line on a pro forma basis, our expenses reflect the reduction of approximately $44 million or 23% from the combined Pulte and Centex SG&A expenses from the previous year's quarter. 
In the Homebuilding other income and expense category for the quarter, the expense of approximately $9 million includes a write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs, resulting from the decision not to pursue certain land acquisitions in the amount of $2.3 million. Also included in the category for the quarter is an expense of approximately $1.3 million associated with overhead expense reductions for lease exit and related costs, and an additional $1.4 million goodwill impairment charge related to the completion of a final valuation of self-insurance liabilities assumed in the Centex merger. 
The Homebuilding pretax income for the quarter of approximately $11.8 million resulted in a pretax margin of approximately 1% on total Homebuilding revenues. The pretax income is inclusive of charges related to the valuation adjustments in land inventory and investments, land held for sale, goodwill impairment, severance and related charges and the Centex work-in-process adjustment, for a total of approximately $32 million. 
The pretax loss from Pulte's Financial Services operations for the second quarter was approximately $9 million, relatively flat versus the previous year's quarter. The loss in the quarter is mainly attributed to an increase in loan repurchase loss reserves by approximately $17 million during the quarter, and the severance and lease exit costs related to the merger were approximately $1 million, all partially offset by an increase in loan origination principal volume from an increase in settlements.
Total mortgage principal origination dollars were $667 million, an increase of 65% when compared to the same period last year. The increase is related to greater home settlements from the Homebuilding closing activity for the quarter, with the addition of the Centex volume. 
Total agency originations was $622 million. Non-agency originations were approximately $10 million, and broker and non-funded loans were approximately $35 million. Additionally, within the funded agency originations, FHA [Federal Housing Administration] loans were approximately 43% of the loans funded from the financing line in the quarter compared to approximately 40% in the first quarter of 2010. Multi-mortgages capture rate for the current quarter was approximately 76%, and the average FICO score for the quarter was 741. 
In the other nonoperating category, pretax loss for the second quarter of approximately $9 million includes corporate expenses of approximately $10 million, partially offset by net interest income of $1 million resulting from an invested cash balances. If we look at this line on a pro forma basis, our expenses reflect a reduction of approximately $43 million or 81% from the combined Pulte and Centex expenses from the previous year's quarter. 
For the second quarter, the company's pretax loss was approximately $6 million. The pretax loss for the quarter is inclusive of $50 million in charges related to the valuation adjustments in land inventory and investments, land held for sale, severance and lease exit and related costs, acquisition accounting write-up for the Centex work-in-process inventory, loan repurchase loss reserves and the goodwill impairment.
The net income for the second quarter was approximately $76 million or $0.20 per share, as compared to a net loss of approximately $189 million or a loss of $0.74 per share for the same period last year. The quarter reflects a net benefit from income taxes of approximately $82 million, primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income taxes. The number of shares used in the EPS calculation was approximately 380.4 million diluted shares for the second quarter of 2010. The total shares outstanding at June 30 were approximately 382.7 million shares.
Reviewing the balance sheet for the current quarter, we ended with a cash balance of approximately $2.7 billion, increasing approximately $163 million from the first quarter of 2010. We received approximately $103 million in cash refunds during the second quarter related to our federal NOL carrybacks. 
House and land inventory ended the quarter at approximately $4.9 billion. The decrease in house and land inventory and land held for sale for the current quarter was approximately $146 million from the first quarter of 2010. 
During the second quarter, our new investments in land were enrolling lot option takedowns and purchases of approximately $62 million and land development spending of approximately $166 million, offset by a modest reduction in house inventory by approximately $53 million.
With approximately $2.7 billion in unrestricted cash at the end of the quarter, we had no outstanding balance drawn on our revolving credit facility. Company's gross debt to total capitalization ratio was approximately 56.6% and on a net basis, 31.9%. Interest incurred amounted to approximately $68 million in the quarter compared to $53 million for the same period last year. 
PulteGroup's shareholder equity for the second quarter was approximately $3.3 billion. We repurchased no shares during the quarter, and the company has approximately $102 million remaining on the current authorization. 
I will now turn the call back to Richard for some additional comments on the quarter. Richard?"

As we've done in the past, before opening the call to questions, we wanted to provide some additional details on market conditions during the quarter. Although given how well the industry demand has been tracked, it seems almost real-time during these past few months, I'm not sure there'll be much new information. 
Sign-ups for the quarter totaled 4,218 homes, which was an increase of 25% over the same period in 2009 and essentially flat with the first quarter of this year. On a pro forma basis, assuming Pulte and Centex were one company last year, second quarter sign-ups are down 32% on 9% fewer communities. 
I'm sure it won't be a surprise to hear that April was the strongest month of the second quarter, with year-over-year sign-ups slowing meaningfully as we moved through May and into June. Given the impact of the merger on year-over-year comparisons and the tax credit impact mid-quarter, I will focus more on sign-up trends within the second quarter of the year.
In terms of units sold month-to-month during the second quarter, our Gulf Coast, Southeast and Northeast operations held up the best. In fact, net sign-ups in the Gulf Coast and Southeast  areas improved May to June, led by gains in Texas, North and Central Florida and the Carolinas and Tennessee. Our Midwest, Southwest and West areas experienced more significant slowing during the quarter, with Arizona and Nevada facing the most difficult demand environment. This is consistent with demand conditions we have seen for much of the downturn, with Phoenix and Las Vegas being among the most challenged of the markets. 
From a product standpoint, I would highlight that sign-ups within our Del Webb brand were consistent year-over-year for the second quarter, as well as for the first six months of the year. Active adult represents roughly 1/3 of PulteGroup's business and is an area that has been under pressure since the fourth quarter of 2008. Demand stability and obviously growth sometime in the future within this buyer segment is important for us. 
Del Webb communities are much larger than traditional single-family communities and can drive tremendous same-store sales volume when demand is healthy. Assuming this buyer segment has found its footing, the timing could be advantageous as we will be moving in to the stronger fall and winter selling season for many of the Del Webb destination communities, which are located in warm-weather markets. 
In some, demand pulled back after April 30, which was to be expected, although the pullback was greater than expected. Demand has been relatively stable after the initial change, but it's going to take a few months before we have a truer read on demand. 
One point I'd like to make is to caution people who keep slicing demand data segments smaller and smaller. You hear people attempting to gauge business conditions based on shorter and shorter time frames. While useful, there can be a lot of noise in this data. 
Moving beyond sign-ups, we ended the quarter with 150,000 lots under control, of which 90% were owned and 10% were under option. Of these lots, approximately 48,000 were fully developed, with an additional 21,000 currently in the development pipeline. 
During the second quarter, we remained active in the land market, having approved 31 new investments. Total lots involved were just over 2,200, so you can see that the basic project profile remains the same; and that we're focusing in on smaller finished lot deals that can be controlled via an option agreement, and that can pencil through a mid-20% return or better. 
As we've talked about before, good deals are getting harder and harder to find. Land development has been close to nonexistent over the past several years, so few new developed lots are coming into the market. From a location standpoint, most of the A location properties have been picked over and pricing has been moving higher, so it's getting tougher to make deals pencil to an acceptable return. 
We have certainly been opportunistic in pursuing these deals, but we have always known that you couldn't build a sustainable business strategy on the backs of these small transactions. With the recent demand softness, you may see the deal flow ease a little which isn't an issue, given our strong land position. We'll have to see if the pause is long enough for land prices to pull back a little. Given our balance sheet, we can remain actively involved in the process. But given our supply of finished lots, we can certainly be selective in what we buy. 
In conclusion, we made great progress in the quarter and the first half of 2010 and entered the second half of the year as a much stronger, more efficient company. We'll be optimistic that demand conditions improve, while remaining cautious in how we operate the business. As we've said in the past, we're well positioned to take advantage of the market opportunities that develop. 
Let me now turn the call back to Jim."

So Roger, maybe if you could just elaborate a little bit more on the details of what you have that is arguably on a watch list. Horton [D.R. Horton] disclosed a watch list yesterday. I don't know if you guys have ever done that. But how much of your land is undeveloped that may have been mothballed and therefore, really has potential with more capital investment in the ground to reserve than price that need to be put in place, could arguably be at risk of not getting your money back when you think about the cash that you invested initially? Just kind of give us some comfort that pricing -- how much does pricing have to go down before you would be worried, Roger? And recognizing, as you said, it's market by market. It's project to project. But I think we need, as analysts, more comfort from you guys to know that some things are coney and have to happen in order for you to see a big increase, as opposed to quarterly, if it's $10 million, $20 million, $30 million here and there. We understand that's going to happen, but a huge wave coming."

First of all, I just want to assure everybody that our strategy is not to lower price from here on a widespread basis to try to drive volume. Frankly, I've been very close to the operations recently. And I'm not hearing anybody say that we are in need of wholesale price adjustments, frankly largely because the market operators don't feel that it's going to drive that much incremental volume, maybe a little bit here and there. So actions we're likely to take on price are very specific and isolated to communities. And frankly, well over half of our impairments this quarter were driven from things unrelated to price. In one case, a strategy change on a large project and in a couple of other cases, estimate changes in the individual projects. So I just want to reassure folks that we do not see at this point big impairments returning. That's not to say that isolated projects can't be there. So with that kind of backdrop, overall, maybe Roger can give some color about the watch list, so to speak, in that."

When we look at where we've been over the last, almost four years, the adjustments can be taking -- many of them constantly, quarter after quarter after quarter. We set the level of pricing based on the formulas that the accounting dictates. So you can't be all too aggressive to write everything down as zero, and naturally you wouldn't want to. I think you can see by the level of the margins that are coming through, we've been spreading that gap. And the gap's been spreading because we've been more disciplined on the pricing. Now if we have become undisciplined, that creates a whole, another level of environmental change on impairments, in general. But that's not been our strategy. So we think we have a fair amount of cushion in there for further decreases, if that were the case. And then again, you just need to look at, again, the overhead levels that you support. As Richard said, you could go back to the overheads and adjust those if pricing continues or would continue to deteriorate significantly. So I think from a major project, the largest projects, we feel comfortable where we are, where the values are. We've taken them down on the book. And then again, just environment, community-by-community, is going to dictate the level that goes on, I think, each quarter there going forward.

So recognizing if you're across the street from them or even in neighboring community, a few blocks down, it could have an impact on appraisal.

In terms of trying to compete against any individual builder or Horton or others, we are clearly subject to what they do on a community-by-community basis. But I would tell you that is isolated to the communities where we directly compete with them. You're right around appraisals. But the way I'm thinking about it, Ivy, is if you go back to 2007 and '08, the market was on a wholesale free fall decline. And no one could find any footing, no matter what was happening. So price kept spiraling down, and obviously hundreds of millions of dollars of impairments per quarter resulted from that. I'm not seeing that kind of environment despite what Horton is doing or a couple of other builders. Our opinion, collectively, internally, is that price is not going to move the business a lot. And therefore, I suspect on the edges, you're going to see some competition there and we'll have to deal with appraisals and other issues like that. But I'm not expecting things to drop 10% from here. And again, as I've been talking to our operators, it does not appear that, that's moving a lot of product. It's not a price problem. It's a consumer confidence issue. So we'll have to compete community-by-community, but I think that's going to be more spotty. So it's not keeping me up at night."

So you could very well, which we're doing today, buying land for less than what we have on our books in some instances, which given ourselves opportunities to improve margins. And I think you've heard that from the other builders as well. Some of them are focusing more of their attention on doing acquisitions than actually using the land that they own today to be able to capitalize on that type of margin improvement.

This quarter, we mentioned again about the $86 million, if you followed the script. So that's about $200 million in the two quarters. I didn't go back and try to calculate the fourth quarter for you. But again, there was some savings there as we put the companies together in the fourth quarter. Interest, alone, was probably at a half a year probably about $65 million. So this year, we'll probably run at $265 million. I would tell you we're probably in the $300-plus million range, and two more quarters to go till we're at the end of the year. So we outlined about $440 million. We're well on track to that number. We talked about another $150 million to $200 million in the purchasing side. We're starting to see some of that come along in the margins. You do see some of the improvements in the margin is being helped by some of the house cost savings that we're able to get by putting vendors together. More of that should come as we move in the future. Now what I always said was that number in the purchasing side was always soft because you don't always get to demonstrate it if you have commodity costs beginning to rise. So when we think we had an opportunity to save money in that $150 million to $200 million, if commodity costs go up, which they have earlier this year on a year-to-date basis, pretty significantly, that also plays in the headwind of actually dropping it to the gross margin line. So well on track for the $440 million and again, the other $150 million to $200 million, we're seeing that starting to come through the gross margin side and will, hopefully, in the next couple of quarters as well."

Or what would we need to see to take another material goodwill charge? That's just following up on that question. Second question on the gross margins, you saw some nice sequential improvement. Actually, some of your peers saw some sequential declines. How much of that was driven by some of the improvement in house costs, which might be merger-related versus incentives? And going forward, I believe you said that you expect gross margins to be in a similar range or neighborhood. Does that mean 16% to 18%? Is there a little bit of downward buyer's risks, given how incentives have maybe increased modestly? If you can give us some thoughts around that as well."

You have to look at your allocation of goodwill across the markets and then how those actually perform. It is a future view. So you're looking at what the future value of that generation is of the assets as well. And so again, that's why it's pretty complicated.

You folks still have the largest cash balance in the industry. If you kind of think about the two main ways investors think about that cash balance: first, as an opportunity fund to pursue incremental new land purchase opportunities; and second, from a kind of security or safety or liquidity perspective, just as a buffer against weak market conditions. On the first front, you folks have been very, very consistent in saying we have a great land position, and that's our primary focus going forward. And on the second front, with the second quarter and obviously, nice achievement, first positive EPS number. According to our numbers, your first positive operating margin impairments have come down, gross margins have stabilized. So there's less need on that front as well. So given that conditions may be weak for some time further here depending on how the economy recovers, is it the right time to be considering scaling back the balance sheet to reflect a kind of shrunken housing market?"

Our preference would be to put it in inventory, if we could. But frankly -- and what I mean by that is land inventory. However, we're being very cautious and selective on what we're buying. We indicated we're seeing some price pressure in the market on the land side, and we don't want to chase things. 150,000 lots under control.

I would tell you though, remember, the banks control all the small builders in the industry. And if you add up all the big builders combined, you're still not more than 25% or 30% of the total new housing market. So there's an awful lot of folks out there who don't have the ability to cut price, frankly, because they can't build any inventory at all because all they're able to build is sold inventory based on the overall shutdown of lending in the industry. So I personally think to say a builder or two builders or three builders who are chasing pricing are going to influence the new homebuilding market is a little bit of a stretch. It is not the environment we're in, in '07 and '08 where there was a constant downward spiral. Everyone was stealing everyone else's backlog. Things kept spiraling down. We're not seeing that. So yes, we're going to have to be pragmatic. But does that mean it's going to affect 5% of our communities, 10% of our communities? I don't see it being a majority of our communities because each individual asset is asset independent. I'll just point out an obvious fact. I hope it's not lost on everyone. 30% of our assets are in Del Webb. They don't have any significant competition. I'm not sure why I'd lower price in any Del Webb community. So that wipes out roughly a third of our competitive impact right there. So just to point that out, we're going to be pragmatic and focused as we need to be, but it's not across the board."

I'll point out that even if we get that, I'm not talking about any exciting level of demand, right? But it's not impossible that new home sales could go from $300,000 to $350,000 or $360,000 later this year or some number approaching that, which, on a headline basis, would look like a big percentage improvement.

The slides will be archived on the site for the next 30 days for those who want to review it later. As a reminder, on August 18, 2009, PulteGroup completed its merger with Centex Corporation. Results reported in the release and on this call reflect the inclusion of Centex's operations for the second quarter and six months of 2010, although results for the comparable prior period have not been adjusted for this merger. 
Finally, I want to alert everyone that certain statements and comments made during the course of this call must be considered forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. PulteGroup believes such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but there are no assurances that actual outcomes will not be materially different from those discussed today. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to the company on the date of this call, and the company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information in the future.
Participants in today's call should refer to PulteGroup's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and this morning's press release for a detailed list of risks and uncertainties associated with the business. Certain statements during this call also contain references to non-GAAP financial measures. See this morning's press release, which is available on our corporate website, pultegroupinc.com, for reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP numbers.

In preparing for today’s discussion, I reviewed our comments from PulteGroup’s last two quarterly conference calls. During those calls, we talked about expectations that new home sales in 2010 would likely be comparable to 2009, and how we had set up our business to be successful in that type of difficult macro-environment. 
At the time, we also talked about how important the Centex merger would be in accelerating PulteGroup’s overall pace of operating and financial improvement. The significant gains in PulteGroup’s second quarter financial results demonstrate that we are achieving the goals that we have set for the company. 
As Roger will detail in a moment, we continue to realize improvement throughout our operations. As homebuilding revenue roughly doubled to $1.3 billion, homebuilding margins, before land-related charges and interest costs, expanded to 17.2%. SG&A dropped to 11.7% of home sale revenue, and reported earnings per share of $0.20 a share represent a major step in the process of rebuilding shareholder value for our investors.
Successfully executing against a small number of key initiatives helped the company to deliver improved operating and financial results. The company significantly reduced a year over year pre-tax loss of $6 million, which includes $45 million in land- and mortgage-related charges and reflects lower impairments and the benefit of gross margin expansion and better overhead leverage within our homebuilding operations. 
In combination with our ongoing work against these key initiatives, the dramatic improvement in PulteGroup’s performance was driven in large part by last year’s merger with Centex. By putting the two organizations together, it allowed us to meaningfully increase the number of homes we delivered and the corresponding revenue we recognized. In turn, having moved quickly to integrate the businesses and capture expected overhead synergies, we were able to realize significant leverage on our SG&A spending, which as a percentage of settlement revenues dropped by almost 600 basis points.
We have been focused on our efforts to reduce overhead costs during the prolonged market slowdown, but achieving these results would have been difficult without the merger. The merger integration is all but complete, but the benefits will continue to support our results for many years to come. As concerns about potential integration risk rapidly dissipate, comments from more and more investors acknowledge the positive business impact the transaction is having on our business. 
Overall, we are pleased with our second quarter financial results and the progress we continue to make in strengthening our operations and improving our market position. PulteGroup associates throughout the country have worked hard to close homes, control costs, and execute against our key business strategies. I want to thank them for their continued efforts in support of the company.
Beyond the improvement in our second quarter numbers, we appreciate that the focus of the past couple of months was, and remains, the current state of housing following the April 30 expiration of the federal tax credit. The falloff in demand has been well documented and in truth has likely exceeded just about all expectations.
We believe that it is a positive sign that our demand has been stable since the initial pullback, but overall volumes remain well below normal seasonal demand. There is certainly no shortage of economic research attempting to estimate how much demand was pulled forward, and how long any effects will be felt. Some believe the housing malaise could linger, while others think that some level of rebound could be evident within months. And while the industry could experience a modest seasonal lift in the back half of the year, within PulteGroup we’ll continue to err on the side of caution in terms of how we manage our operations until a more sustained rebound is evident.
In the end, almost regardless of how future demand plays out, we still believe that the tax credit had to end. We need to know the true level of demand without government stimulus distorting the market so that we can continue to properly position our business for ongoing improvement. 
Beyond the immediacy of any tax credit impact, for the industry to experience a meaningful and sustained rebound in demand over the long term we need a stronger economy, job creation, and better consumer confidence. At a run rate bouncing around 300,000 to 350,000 new home sales annually, our industry continues to face incredibly low demand. Supply, be it traditional home sales, vacancies, short sales, foreclosures, shadow or otherwise, is obviously important, but right now the industry’s biggest issue is a lack of buyers.
The good news is that coming off such low levels, even a modest improvement in fundamental demand can be experienced relatively quickly. Given the low interest rate environment and incredible home values, even slight improvements in local market economies, or consumer sentiment, can help convert home shoppers into home buyers.
Our operations are in a good position as we work through these next few months. With only 1,100 finished spec homes, or just slightly more than one per community, our inventory position is certainly manageable, as we are benefitting from our strategy of not chasing the tax credit buyer earlier in the year. 
Right now let me turn the call over to Roger Cregg for additional details on PulteGroup’s second quarter financial results, after which I’ll provide a little more detail on market conditions during the quarter.
Roger?

Revenues from home settlements for the home building operation increased approximately 93% from the prior year quarter to approximately $1.3 billion.

Revenues from home settlements for the home building operation increased approximately 93% from the prior year quarter to approximately $1.3 billion. Increased revenues reflect the increase in unit closings that were above prior year by approximately 101%, mainly attributed to the merger with Centex. 
The average sales price decreased approximately 4% versus the prior year quarter, to an average of $251,000. This decrease is attributed to the mix of greater first-time homebuyer volume due to the Centex merger in addition to the geographical and product mix of homes closed during the current quarter.
In the second quarter, land sales generated approximately $7 million in total revenues, which is an increase of approximately $3 million versus the previous year’s quarter. The sales in the quarter mainly reflect the sale of lots and land parcels to other builders.
Homebuilding gross profits from home settlements for the quarter, including homebuilding interest expense, was approximately $159 million, versus a loss of $71 million in the prior year quarter. For those with access to the webcast slides, I refer you to slide number six, the adjusted margin analysis, which outlines our gross margins. 
Homebuilding gross margins from home settlements as a percentage of revenues was 12.6% compared with a -10.9% in the second quarter of 2009. Adjusting the current quarter’s gross margins for land and community valuation charges, interest expense and the acquisition accounting write-up for the Centex work in process resulted in a conversion of 17.2% compared to an adjusted margin of 16.3% for the first quarter of 2010 or a sequential improvement of 90 basis points on an adjusted basis. On a comparative basis versus the previous year’s second quarter conversion of 9.4% the adjusted increase is 780 basis points. The improved margins are a direct result of lower sales incentives, house cost improvements, and stable market pricing. 
Homebuilding interest expense increased during the quarter to approximately $38 million, versus approximately $33 million in the prior year. Included in the interest expense of $38 million is an additional $5 million of expense related to the land and community valuation adjustment taken in the current quarter. Also included in the gross margin for the quarter was a charge related to land and community valuation adjustments in the amount of approximately $20 million. 
Consistent with prior quarters, we have reviewed all of our communities for impairment indicators. Based on this review in the second quarter, we identified and tested approximately 30 communities for potential impairment in valuation adjustments. The recorded valuation adjustments on approximately 16 communities for the quarter, of which approximately 9 communities, or 56%, had been previously impaired. Additionally, we impaired three projects which represented approximately $15 million, or 75% of the total $20 million in impairments. 
Also for the quarter, the acquisition accounting work-in-process charge is approximately $500,000. The total net gain from land sales posted for the quarter was approximately $4 million. The gain is mainly attributed to the sale of lots and parcels of land in the quarter. 
Homebuilding SG&A expenses as a percent of home sales for the quarter was approximately 11.7% or $147 million, an increase of approximately $33 million or 29% versus the prior year quarter. This increase reflects the additional incremental overhead associated with the merger of the Centex operations. In addition, the second quarter includes approximately $1 million for employee severance and related costs. If we look at the SG&A line on a pro forma basis, our expenses reflect a reduction of approximately $44 million, or 23% from the combined Pulte and Centex SG&A expenses from the previous year’s quarter. 
In the homebuilding other income and expense category for the quarter, the expense of approximately $9 million includes the write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs resulting from the decision not to pursue certain land acquisitions in the amount of $2.3 million. Also included in the category for the quarter is an expense of approximately $1.3 million associated with overhead expense reductions for lease exit and related costs and an additional $1.4 good will impairment charge related to the completion of a final valuation of self-insurance liabilities assumed in the Centex merger.
The homebuilding pre-tax income for the quarter of approximately $11.8 million resulted in a pre-tax margin of approximately 1% on total homebuilding revenues. The pre-tax income is inclusive of charges related to the valuation adjustments in land inventory and investments, land held for sale, good will impairment, severance and related charges, and the Centex work in process adjustment for a total of approximately $32 million. 
The pre-tax loss from Pulte’s financial services operations for the second quarter was approximately $9 million, relatively flat versus the previous quarter. The loss in the quarter is mainly attributed to an increase in loan repurchase loss reserves by approximately $17 million during the quarter in severance and lease exit costs related to the merger of approximately $1 million, all partially offset by an increase in loan origination principal volume from an increase in settlements. 
Total mortgage principal origination dollars was $667 million, an increase of 65% when compared to the same period last year. The increase is related to greater home settlements from the homebuilding closing activity for the quarter, with the addition of the Centex volume. Total agency originations were $622 million. Non-agency originations were approximately $10 million, and broker or non-funded loans were approximately $35 million. Additionally, within the funded agency originations, FHA loans were approximately 43% of the loans funded from the financing line in the quarter, compared to approximately 40% in the first quarter of 2010.
Pulte Mortgage’s capture rate for the current quarter was approximately 76% and the average FICO score for the quarter was 741. In the other non-operating category, pre-tax loss for the second quarter of approximately $9 million includes corporate expenses of approximately $10 million, partially offset by net interest income of $1 million resulting from invested cash balances. 
If we look at this line on a pro forma basis our expenses reflect a reduction of approximately $43 million or 81% from the combined Pulte and Centex expenses from the previous year’s quarter. For the second quarter the company’s pre-tax loss was approximately $6 million. The pre-tax loss for the quarter is inclusive of $50 million in charges related to the valuation adjustments in land inventory and investments, land held for sale, severance and lease action and related costs, acquisition accounting write-up for the Centex work in process inventory, loan repurchase loss reserves, and the goodwill impairment. 
The net income for the second quarter was approximately $76 million, or $0.20 per share as compared to a net loss of approximately $189 million, or a loss of $0.74 per share for the same period last year. The quarter reflects a net benefit from income taxes of approximately $82 million, primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income taxes. The number of shares used in the EPS calculation was approximately 380.4 million diluted shares for the second quarter of 2010. The total shares outstanding at June 30 were approximately 382.7 million.
Reviewing the balance sheet for the current quarter, we ended with a cash balance of approximately $2.7 billion, increasing approximately $163 million from the first quarter of 2010. We received approximately $103 million in cash refunds during the second quarter, related to our federal NOL carrybacks. House and land inventory ended the quarter at approximately $4.9 billion. The decrease in house and land inventory and land held for sale for the current quarter was approximately $146 million from the first quarter of 2010. During the second quarter, our new investments in land were in rolling lot option takedowns and purchases of approximately $62 million and land development spending of approximately $166 million, offset by a modest reduction in house inventory by approximately $53 million. 
With approximately $2.7 billion in unrestricted cash at the end of the quarter, we had no outstanding balance drawn on our revolving credit facility. The company’s gross debt to total capitalization ratio was approximately 56.6% and on a net basis 31.9%. Interest incurred amounted to approximately $68 million in the quarter, compared to $53 million for the same period last year. 
PulteGroup shareholder equity for the second quarter was approximately $3.3 billion. We repurchased no shares during the quarter and the company has approximately $102 million remaining on the current authorization. 
I will now turn the call back to Richard for some additional comments on the quarter. Richard?

As we’ve done in the past, before opening the call to questions we wanted to provide some additional details on market conditions during the quarter. Although given how well the industry demand has been tracked, it seems almost real time during these past few months. I’m not sure there’ll be much new information. 
Signups for the quarter totaled 4,218 homes, which is an increase of 25% over the same period in 2009, and essentially flat with the first quarter of this year. On a pro forma basis, just assuming Pulte and Centex were one company last year, second quarter signups are down 32% on 9% fewer communities. I’m sure it won’t be a surprise to hear that April was the strongest month of the second quarter with year over year signups slowing meaningfully as we moved through May and into June. 
Given the impact of the merger on year over year comparisons and the tax credit impact mid-quarter, I will focus more on signup trends within the second quarter of the year. In terms of units sold month to month during the second quarter, our Gulf Coast, Southeast, and Northeast operations held up the best. In fact, net signups in the Gulf Coast and Southeast areas improved May to June, led by gains in Texas, North and Central Florida, and the Carolinas and Tennessee. 
Our Midwest, Southwest, and West areas experienced more significant slowing during the quarter, with Arizona and Nevada facing the most difficult demand environment. This is consistent with demand conditions we have seen for much of the downturn, with Phoenix and Las Vegas being among the most challenged of the markets. 
From a product standpoint, I would highlight that signups within our Del Webb brand were consistent year over year for the second quarter, as well as for the first six months of the year. Active adult represents roughly one third of PulteGroup’s business and is an area that has been under pressure since the fourth quarter of 2008. Demand stability, and obviously growth, sometime in the future within this buyer segment is important for us. Del Webb communities are much larger than traditional single family communities and can drive tremendous same-store sales volume when demand is healthy. Assuming this buyer segment has found its footing, the timing could be advantageous as we will be moving into the stronger fall and winter selling season for many of the Del Webb destination communities which are located in warm-weather markets.
In sum, demand pulled back after April 30, which was to be expected, although the pullback was greater than expected. Demand has been relatively stable after the initial change, but it’s going to take a few months before we have a truer read on demand. One point I’d like to make is to caution people who keep slicing demand data segments smaller and smaller. You hear people attempting to gauge business conditions based on shorter and shorter timeframes. While useful, there can be a lot of noise in this data.
Moving beyond signups, we ended the quarter with 150,000 lots under control, of which 90% were owned and 10% were under option. Of these lots, approximately 48,000 were fully developed, with an additional 21,000 currently in the development pipeline. During the second quarter, we remain active in the landmark at having approved 31 new investments. Total lots involved were just over 2,200, so you can see that the basic project profile remains the same in that we’re focusing in on smaller finished lot deals that can be controlled via an option agreement and that can pencil to a mid-20% return or better. 
As we’ve talked about before, good deals are getting harder and harder to find. Land development has been close to non-existent over the past several years, so few new developed lots are coming into the market. From a location standpoint, most of the “A” location properties have been picked over and pricing has been moving higher, so it’s getting tougher to make deals pencil to an acceptable return. We have certainly been opportunistic in pursuing these deals, but we have always known that you couldn’t build a sustainable business strategy on the backs of these small transactions. 
With the recent demand softness, you may see the deal flow ease a little, which isn’t an issue given our strong land position. We’ll have to see if the pause is long enough for land prices to pull back a little. Given our balance sheet, we can remain actively involved in the process, but given our supply of finished lots we can certainly be selective in what we buy.
In conclusion, we made great progress in the quarter and the first half of 2010 and enter the second half of the year as a much stronger, more efficient company. We’ll be optimistic that demand conditions improve while remaining cautious in how we operate the business. As we’ve said in the past, we’re well positioned to take advantage of the market opportunities that develop.
Let me now turn the call back to Jim.

I think when we take a look at each one of those, as the markets go through they’re looking at the competition, and what they have to do to sell homes. And typically what we’ve done in the past if we need to compete and prices continue to fall significantly we were competing in dropping our pricing. And so that was creating the weight from the impairment side as margins were diminishing. 
Again, you look at the volume as well, and so volume’s an indicator of price as well, so if you’re not selling anything, maybe because you’re out of bed on the pricing in general, and so those are the indicators that the markets continue to look at and adjust to. So I would tell you, again, competitively across the country it’s not systemic across all the markets and all the communities. I know you continue to hear that from builders, but they’re isolated. There might be isolated situations where they are in a particular market, or segments of markets, where they are adjusting price to move some volume. 
And again, we end up looking at how deep that volume happens to be in the market relative to where we are in position, and whether we have to react to that or not. So each one of those is very specific, but very detailed to the market in looking at what your local competition is doing and how deep that supply is.

Just kind of give us some comfort that pricing. How much does pricing have to go down before you would be worried, Roger? And recognizing as you said it’s market by market, it’s project by project, but I think we need, as analysts, more comfort from you guys to know that something draconian has to happen in order for you to see a big increase as opposed to quarterly, if it’s $10, $20, $30 million here and there, we understand that’s going to happen, but a huge wave coming?

Frankly, largely because the market operators don’t feel that it’s going to drive that much incremental volume. Maybe a little bit here and there. So actions we’re likely to take on price are very specific and isolated to communities and frankly well over half of our impairments this quarter were driven from things unrelated to price. In one case, a strategy changed on a large project, and in a couple of other cases the estimate changes in the individual project. So I just want to reassure folks that we do not see, at this point big impairments returning. That’s not to say that isolated projects can’t be there, so with that kind of backdrop overall, maybe Roger can give some color about the watch list so to speak, and that.

When we look at where we’ve been over the last almost 40 years, the adjustments we’ve taken, many of them constantly quarter after quarter after quarter we set the level of pricing based on the formulas that the accounting dictates. So you can’t be ultra-aggressive to write everything down to zero, and naturally you wouldn’t want to. I think you can see by the level of the margins that are coming through we’ve been spreading that gap. And the gap’s been spreading because we’ve been more disciplined on the pricing. Now if we were to become undisciplined that creates a whole other level of environmental change on impairments in general, but that’s not been our strategy. So we think we have a fair amount of cushion in there for further decreases if that were the case. And then again, you just need to look at, again, the overhead levels that you support, as Richard said you could go back to the overheads and adjust those if pricing continues or would continue to deteriorate significantly. So I think from a major projects, the largest projects we feel comfortable where we are, with where the values are, where we’ve taken them down on the book, and then again, just environment community by community is going to dictate the level that goes on, I think each quarter there going forward. But we don’t feel exposed as significantly as we had in the past, just given the more stable pricing environment.

But I would tell you that is isolated to the communities where we directly compete with them. You’re right around appraisals, but the way I’m thinking about it, Ivy, is if you go back to 2007 and 2008, the market was on a wholesale, free-fall decline, and no one could find any footing, no matter what was happening, so price kept spiraling down, and obviously hundreds of millions of dollars of impairments per quarter resulted from that. I’m not seeing that kind of environment, despite what Horton is doing or a couple of other builders. You know, our opinion collectively internally is that price is not going to move the business a lot, and therefore I suspect on the edges you’re going to see some competition there, and we’ll have to deal with appraisals and other issues like that, but I’m not expecting things to drop 10% from here. And again, as I’ve been talking to our operators it does not appear that that’s moving a lot of product. Things are - it’s not a price problem. It’s a consumer confidence issue.

It’s the house pricing, the margins, the pace, and those types of things that will typically drive the impairment. So you could very well, which we’re doing today, buying land for less than we have on our books in some instances, which has given ourselves opportunities to improve margins. I think you’ve heard that from the other builders as well. Some of them are focusing more of their attention on doing acquisitions than actually using the land that they own today to be able to capitalize on that type of margin improvement.

This quarter we mentioned again about $86 million if you followed the script. So that’s about $200 million in the two quarters. I didn’t go back and try to calculate the fourth quarter for you, but again, there was some savings there as we put the companies together in the fourth quarter. Interest alone was probably at a half a year probably about $65 million, so this year we’re probably running $265 million. I would tell you we’re probably in the $300+ million range in two more quarters to go until we’re at the end of the year. So, we outlined about $440 million. We’re well on track to that number. 
We talked about another $150 million to $200 million in the purchasing side. We’re starting to see some of that come along in the margins. You do see some of the improvements in the margin as being helped by some of the cost, house cost savings that we’re able to get by putting vendors together. More of that should come as we move in the future. Now what I always said was that number in the purchasing side was always soft, because you don’t always get to demonstrate it if you have commodity costs beginning to rise. So when we think we had an opportunity to save money in that $150 million to $200 million, if commodity costs go up, which they have earlier this year on a year to date basis pretty significantly, that also plays in the headwind of actually dropping it to the gross margin line. So well on track for the $440 million and then again the other $150 million to $200 million we’re seeing that starting to come through the gross margin side and will hopefully in the next couple quarters as well.

It’s an indicator, and again what you look at as you book we added back deferred tax assets because, again, the market gives us value for that relative to what the book has. So, in and of itself, the market cap did not drive impairment this quarter. And again, we took a look at any other indicators that might have been there and again, none rose to the level that would indicate a full-blown impairment would be taken.

That’s just following up on that question. 
Second question, on the gross margins you saw some nice sequential improvement. Actually, some of your peers saw some sequential declines. How much of that was driven by some of the improvement in house costs, which might be merger-related, versus incentives? And going forward I believe you said that you expect gross margins to be in a similar range, or neighborhood. Does that mean 16% to 18%? Is there a little bit of downward bias risk given how incentives have maybe increased modestly? If you can give us some thoughts around that as well.

So you could have markets that deteriorate that could cause goodwill on a particular asset in those markets. And so it is not as easy as just saying I look at one indicator and I can feel comfortable or uncomfortable about it. It is, again, a complicated formula. You have to look at your allocation of goodwill across the markets, and then how those actually perform. It is a future view, so you’re looking at what the future value of that generation is of the assets as well. And so, again, that’s why it’s pretty complicated, but no, you can’t just say that there’s no risk because the market cap goes up or stays the same. And those are things that we continue to look at market by market, as we would do that goodwill impairment test.

You folks still have the largest cash balance in the industry.

I would tell you, though, remember the banks control all the small builders in the industry and if you add up all the big builders combined you’re still not more than 25% or 30% of the total new housing market. So there’s an awful lot of folks out there who don’t have the ability to cut price frankly, because they can’t build any inventory at all because all they’re able to build is sold inventory based on the overall shutdown of lending in the industry. 
So I personally think to say a builder or two builders or three builders who are chasing price are going to influence a new home building market is a little bit of a stretch. It is not the environment we were in in ’07 and ’08 where there was a constant downward spiral. Everyone was stealing everyone else’s backlog. Things kept spiraling down. We’re not seeing that. So yes we’re going to have to be pragmatic, but does that mean it’s going to affect 5% of our communities? 10% of our communities? I don’t see it being a majority of our communities, because each individual asset is asset independent. 
I’ll just point out an obvious fact. I hope it’s not lost on everyone. 30% of our assets are in Del Webb. They don’t have any significant competition. I’m not sure why I’d lower price in any Del Webb community. So that wipes out roughly a third of our competitive impact right there. So just to point that out. We’re going to be pragmatic and focused as we need to be but it’s not across the board.

First, Richard, you said in your opening commentary I believe that there could possibly be a seasonal uplift in the back half of the year. So just wanted to follow up on that. Typically that’s not really how we see seasonality, at least from the order front in the back half of the year. So are you saying that our seasonality is a little bit off this year, because of the pullback, and we could see an upturn, or does it have to do with something you’re seeing in the market right now?

I’ll point out that even if we get that I’m not talking about any exciting level of demand, right? But it’s not impossible that new home sales could go from 300,000 to 350,000 or 360,000 later this year or some number approaching that, which on a headline basis would look like a big percentage improvement. So that’s what I’m speaking about. In order to get sustainable real change, 450,000, 500,000, 600,000 new home sales it’s going to take job growth, and we get that.

So that’s really been the driver, and we had a slight expense this quarter, roughly about $600,000.

So again, if we continue to deplete the inventory over the next two to four quarters, we could see some pressure on bringing that back to the P&L as an interest expense without capitalizing it.

This is James Zeumer, Vice President of Investor Relations for PulteGroup, and I want to thank everyone for joining this morning's call to discuss our third quarter results and nine-month results for the period ended September 30, 2010. 
On the call with me today are Richard Dugas, Chairman, President and CEO; Roger Cregg, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Schweninger, Vice President, Controller.

As a reminder, on August 18, 2009, PulteGroup completed its merger with Centex Corporation. Results reported in the release and on this call reflect the inclusion of Centex's operations for the third quarter of 2010, although results for the comparable prior period have not been adjusted for this merger.
Finally, I want to alert everyone that certain statements and comments made during the course of this call must be considered forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. PulteGroup believes such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but there are no assurances that the actual outcomes will not be materially different from those discussed today. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to the company on the date of this call, and the company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information in the future. Participants in today's call should refer to PulteGroup's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and this morning's press release for a detailed list of risks and uncertainties associated with the business. 
Certain statements during this call also contain references to non-GAAP financial measures. See this morning's press release and the accompanying slide presentation, which is available at our corporate website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP numbers.
As always, at the end of our prepared comments, we'll have time for Q&A. We will wait until then to open the queue. I'm now turning the call over to Richard Dugas for his opening comments.  Richard?"

Revenues for the quarter from Home Settlements, from the Homebuilding operations, decreased approximately 3% from the prior year quarter to approximately $1 billion. Decreased revenues reflect lower unit clo",2470,"Thank you, Richard, and good morning, everyone. Revenues for the quarter from Home Settlements, from the Homebuilding operations, decreased approximately 3% from the prior year quarter to approximately $1 billion. Decreased revenues reflect lower unit closings that were below prior year by approximately 7%. The average sales price increased 5% versus the prior year quarter to an average of $265,000. This increase is attributed to the geographical and product mix of homes closed during the quarter. 
In the third quarter, land sales generated approximately $6 million in total revenues, which is an increase of approximately $3 million versus the previous year's quarter. The sales in the quarter mainly reflect the sale of lots and land parcels to other builders. Homebuilding gross profits from Home Settlements for the quarter, including homebuilding interest expense, was approximately $72 million versus a loss of $26 million in the prior year quarter. 
For those who have access to the webcast slides, I refer you to Slide #6, the adjusted margin analysis, which outlines our gross margins. Homebuilding gross margins from Home Settlements, as a percentage of revenues, was 7% compared with a negative 2.5% in the third quarter of 2009. Adjusting the current quarter's gross margins for land and community valuation charges, interest expense and the acquisition accounting write-up for the Centex work in process resulted in a conversion of 16.7% compared to an adjusted margin of 17.2% from the second quarter of 2010, or on a sequential basis, a decrease of 50 basis points on an adjusted basis. This decrease is mainly attributed to the increase in commodity costs experienced earlier in the year. On a comparative basis versus the previous year's third quarter conversion of 13.1%, the adjusted increase is approximately 360 basis points. The improved margins versus the previous year's quarter are a direct result of lower sales incentives, house cost improvements and relatively stable market prices.
Homebuilding interest expense increased during the quarter to approximately $49 million versus approximately $36 million in the prior year. Included in the interest expense of $49 million is an additional $8 million of expense related to land and community valuation adjustments taken in the current quarter. Also included in gross margin for the quarter was a charge related to land and community valuation adjustments in the amount of approximately $50 million. 
Consistent with prior quarters, we have reviewed all of our communities for impairment indicators. Based on this review in the third quarter, we identified and tested 48 communities for potential impairments and valuation adjustments. We recorded valuation adjustments on 28 committees for the quarter, of which 14 committees or 50% have been previously impaired. Additionally, the larger impairments for quarter, which represented approximately $40 million or 80% of the total $50 million in impairments were mainly concentrated in Central Florida, Las Vegas and the Tucson markets. Also for the quarter, the acquisition accounting work-in-process charge is approximately $900,000. 
The total net gain from land sales posted for the quarter was approximately $2 million. The gain is mainly attributed to the sale of lots and parcels of land in the quarter, offset by the fair market value adjustment in the current quarter for land being held for disposition and land sold in the amount of approximately $600,000, which is included in the land cost of sales. 
Homebuilding SG&A expenses, as a percent of home sales for the quarter, was approximately 40.7% or $417 million, an increase of approximately $208 million or 100% versus the prior year quarter. The previous year's quarter included transaction and integration costs and severance associated with the Centex merger of approximately $51 million. During the current quarter, we expensed approximately $272 million to increase our insurance reserves primarily related to general liability reserves. During the quarter, we experienced a greater frequency of newly reported claims and an increase in specific case reserves related to known claims for homes closed in prior years. 
Our specific case reserves related to these known claims increased by approximately $46 million or 17% of the total charge in the quarter. These reserves are based on an actuarial analysis of historical claims and trends. The actuarial analysis includes estimates of claims incurred but not reported, which make up a significant portion of these estimates, and for the quarter, represent approximately 80% of the amount reserved. The calculation of the incurred but not reported reserve is a process that requires judgment, and the result of which may remain uncertain for several years, as claims either do or do not materialize. These estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a number of factors including: Changes in the timing, frequency and severity of claims reporting and resolution patterns; third-party recoveries; insurance industry practices; state regulatory, environment and legal precedent.  Changes in any number of these factors will significantly impact the estimate of these reserves and are reflected in the incurred but not reported reserves.
In addition, the third quarter includes approximately $7 million for employee severance and related costs, associated with organizational changes and operational realignment implemented during the quarter. If we look at the SG&A line on a pro forma basis, excluding the insurance adjustment in the current quarter and the Centex transaction and integration costs related to the merger in the previous year, our expenses reflect a reduction of approximately $45 million or 23% from the combined Pulte and Centex SG&A expenses from the previous year's quarter.
In the Homebuilding, other income and expense category for the quarter, the expense of approximately $675 million includes a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $655 million. It also includes write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs resulting from the decision not to pursue certain land acquisitions in the amount of approximately $1 million and an expense of approximately $7 million associated with overhead expense reductions for lease exit and related costs. 
The goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year, or when events or changes and circumstances indicate the carrying value amount may not be recoverable. 
During the quarter, we performed an event-driven assessment of the recoverability of goodwill following the deterioration in market conditions and our operating results falling below previously forecasted levels, including a significant loss in the third quarter and a sustained decline in our market capitalization. The decline in the company's market capitalization occurred in spite of an increase in the company's tangible book value since the previous goodwill assessment as of October 31, 2009. The increase in the company's tangible book value resulted primarily from income tax refund and other tax-related matters. Accordingly, the implied fair value of the Homebuilding business experienced an even more significant decline than the company's market capitalization. 
We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by following a two-step process. Step one involves comparing the carrying value of each of our reporting units to their estimated fair value. We determine the fair value of each reported unit using accepted valuation methods, including discounted cash flow supplemented by market-based assessments of fair value. As a result of step one of the September 30, 2010, goodwill impairment test, we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the majority of our reporting units with goodwill. Step two involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities, with the excess representing implied goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized if the goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. Again, the impairment loss is recognized if the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. As a result, we determined that a significant portion of our goodwill balance was impaired, and thus the $655 million impairment. 
The Homebuilding pretax loss for the quarter of approximately $1,020,000,000 is inclusive of the targeted to goodwill impairment, insurance and related charges, valuation adjustments in land inventory and investments, land held for sale, severance and related charges and the Centex work-in-process adjustment, for a total of approximately $1,001,000,000. The pretax income for Pulte's financial services operation for the third quarter was approximately $3 million. The quarter also includes severance and lease exit cost of approximately $2 million. The increase of a approximately $12 million versus the previous year's quarter is primarily attributed to no repurchase loss reserve adjustments in the current quarter versus a charge of $11 million in the prior year quarter. 
Total mortgage principal origination dollars were $509 million, a decrease of 18% when compared to the same period last year. The decrease is primarily related to the decrease in unit closing volumes. Total agency originations were $475 million, non-agency originations were approximately $5 million and brokered non-funded loans were approximately $29 million. Additionally, within the funded-agency originations, FHA loans were approximately 37% of the loans funded from the financing line in the quarter compared to approximately 43% in the second quarter of 2010. Pulte mortgages for the current quarter was approximately 78%, and the average FICO score for the quarter was 754.  
While not significant to our third quarter results, I thought I would take a minute to address the subject of mortgage putbacks since there has been so much interest in the subject recently. Also, you will find several slides included in the webcast presentation materials for your reference. 
From 2005 through 2008, the combined entities of Pulte Mortgage and CTX Mortgage originated approximately 316,000 loans, and to date, have had repurchase requests received of only 2,400 loans or about 8/10 of 1%. While others have focused on 2005 through 2008, given our experience and nature of the loans, we believe our risk is primarily associated with originations from 2006 and 2007. For 2010, the putback volumes increased early in the year, and although volatile from month to month, have been running at an average of approximately 100 per month. On a combined basis, on average, we have been able to successfully refute immediately half of these initial repurchase requests. Any mortgage request we immediately do not  refute, then undergoes an extensive analysis to identify any potential liability. Then, if needed, we will attempt to correct the underlying issue, and when required, to confirm the dollar amount of exposure. 
As you're also aware, Centex maintained a sub-prime mortgage business, which was sold in 2006, and not included in the above mortgage originations. There have been no mortgages putback or repurchase requests made at any time since the sale. The original sale agreement caps any potential exposure for loan losses at $100 million, but we do not expect any significant exposure given the terms and conditions of the agreement, the experience and the passage of time from the transaction.
Putbacks are typically recourse only to our mortgage operations, which is a non-guarantor of the debt of the corporation. Under an existing agreement, PulteGroup agreed to stand behind CTX Mortgage on approximately $4 billion of loans with respect to the liability for breaches of representations and warranties. In addition, there is a pool of loans originated in 2006 and 2007 by CTX Mortgage with a principal balance of $7 billion from which the servicing rights were primarily purchased by a large national bank. The investor that purchased the associated  loans generally have first sought recourse for any breaches in representations and warranties against this bank. However, the investor also has recoursed to CTX Mortgage. And for this limited pool of loans, this recourse to the investor is backed by PulteGroup. Given our experience to date, we do not expect any incremental liability for PulteGroup under this agreement. 
We have been dealing with mortgage putbacks for the better part of two years and have tried to be realistic in our assessment of the problem and clearer discussions of the possible dollars involved. Based upon facts in our possession, our judgment, experience to date and our estimate of our probable exposure to these losses, we have accounted for approximately $190 million to date in charges, including reserves totaling approximately $100 million at the end of the third quarter. We have posted several charge to the website, pultegroupinc.com, for anyone interested in more details on this issue. 
In the Other Nonoperating category, pretax loss for the quarter of approximately $7 million includes corporate expenses of approximately $9 million, partially offset by net interest income of $2 million resulting from invested cash balances. If we look at this on a pro forma basis, our expenses reflect a reduction of approximately $7 million from the combined Pulte and Centex expenses from the previous year's quarter.
For the third quarter, the company's pretax loss was approximately $1,024,000,000. The pretax loss for the quarter is inclusive of $1,003,000,000 and charges related to goodwill impairment, insurance-related charges, valuation adjustments in land inventory and investments, landed held for sale, severance and lease-exit and related costs, and the acquisition accounting write-up for the Centex work-in-process inventory. The net loss for the third quarter was approximately $995 million or a loss of $2.63 per share as compared to a net loss of approximately $361 million or a loss of $1.15 per share for the same period last year. The quarter reflects a net benefit from income taxes of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters. The number of shares used in the EPS calculation was approximately 378.8 million diluted shares for the third quarter of 2010. The total shares outstanding at September 30, 2010, were approximately 382.4 million shares. 
Reviewing the balance sheet for the quarter. We ended with a cash balance of approximately $2.7 billion. House and land inventory ended the quarter at approximately $4.9 billion. The increase in house and land inventory and land held for sale for the quarter was approximately $96 million from the second quarter of 2010. During the third quarter, our new investment in land were enrolling lot option takedowns and purchases of approximately $110 million and land development spending of approximately of $169 million, with a modest increase in house inventory by approximately $28 million.
With approximately $2.7 billion in cash to end the third quarter, we had no outstanding balance drawn on our revolving credit facility. The company's gross debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 65.1% and on a net basis, 42%. During the third quarter, we announced a debt tender offer to purchase up to $500 million of aggregate principal amount of currently outstanding debt. We successfully completed the $500 million offer to purchase the notes and provided the funding for it early in the fourth quarter. Interest incurred amounted to approximately $69 million in the quarter compared to $61 million for the same period of last year. PulteGroup shareholder equity for the third quarter was approximately $2.3 billion. We also repurchased no shares during the quarter, and the company has approximately $102 million remaining on the current authorization. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Richard. Richard?"

So before we open the call for questions, I want to provide a",1241,"Thank you, Roger. For obvious reasons, since the April tax credit expiration and the immediate pullback demand, there is intense interest in how home buyers will act over the remainder of 2010. So before we open the call for questions, I want to provide a few comments on our business. What we saw in the third quarter was an industry where demand continue to move along the bottom as buyers elected to remain on the sidelines. Even as low home prices and record low interest rates combined to create unprecedented affordability, potential buyers are hesitant given weak economic conditions, limited job growth and overall uncertainty about near-term opportunities. 
Last year, working under the assumption that industry demand would remain challenged, PulteGroup pursued its merger with Centex. The merger allowed us to accelerate a number of key initiatives geared to deliver greater improvements in overhead leverage, operating efficiency and overall cost reductions. The obvious goal was, and remains, returning the business to consistent profitability. As demonstrated in the first half of 2010, the merger allowed PulteGroup to more quickly move the business back toward making money. While we can appreciate that the third quarter charges make it difficult to see the core business, the underlying run rate for our operations remains close to the break-even mark. 
As discussed during our second quarter conference call, higher material costs compressed gross margin sequentially, but they still remain above last year, up 360 basis points after adjusting for land impairment and interest charges in the Centex WIP impact. The merger benefits have been clearly demonstrated within PulteGroup's operating numbers, but the gains in overall progress have not been enough to push us solidly into the black for each and every quarter. As a result, we are implementing additional actions to lower cost and push the company further along the path of consistent profitability. 
Early in the third quarter, we announced a flatter organizational structure. After this announcement, we have continued to reconfigure our organization to reduce overhead costs and drive greater leverage. Among the additional steps recently implemented, we have reduced the number of operating areas from six down to four, allowing us to completely remove two area team and associated costs. We will begin reporting results under this new structure in the fourth quarter. Underneath the areas, we have consolidated divisions in Arizona, Florida, and in our New York, New Jersey operations. Along with our field operations, we have further reduced corporate staffing across a number of functions as we continue to streamline our operating process. In modifying our organizational structure and implementing a series of changes and/or reductions, we are working to reduce overall SG&A spending. On a year-over-year basis, we expect to reduce 2011 SG&A by approximately $100 million when compared with 2010. These actions will result in a fourth quarter charge, but with many forecasting demand in 2011 will show only modest gains, we are acting proactively now to ensure we maximize the savings opportunity.
Complementing our never-ending work on lowering costs, we continue to strengthen our competitive position through the acquisition of well-placed land throughout our markets. In the third quarter, we approved another 28 deals for roughly 1,700 lots. This brings our total to roughly 7,000 lots of approved since the start of 2009, which is in addition to the 50,000 lots acquired with the Centex merger. Given the favorable terms under which we purchased these distressed assets, they can have a positive impact on our results as the underlying communities start selling and closing homes in 2011 and beyond. 
In terms of specific results for the quarter, sign-ups for Q3 totaled 3,566 homes, which is down roughly 12% from reported results for the third quarter of last year. On a pro forma basis, assuming Pulte and Centex were one company for all of last year's third quarter, year-over-year sign-ups were down approximately 31% on 17% fewer communities. Sequentially, third quarter sign-ups were down approximately 15% from the second quarter of 2010, which in part reflects normal seasonality of the business and likely some lingering impact from the tax credit expiration. Monthly sign-ups were relatively stable during the quarter, while our cancellation rate for the period was 19.1%. 
Last year's merger makes specific comparisons of year-over-year sign-ups difficult, so let me provide some qualitative comments about market conditions in the quarter. Within the quarter, demand in our Northeast area held up relatively well as strength in our new England and Delaware Valley markets offset some weakness in the Mid-Atlantic. Our Southeast operations experienced a similar pattern with solid demand in Atlanta and Nashville, offset by some demand softness in the Carolinas. 
Once again, our Gulf coast operations, which span Texas and Florida, were our strongest performers. We saw consistent demand throughout Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio, as well as in our North and Central Florida operations. Our operations in South Florida experienced some demand softness, and we'll have to see if that's anything more than a typical summer slowing. The Midwest and Southwest areas continue to face challenges, with Las Vegas, Phoenix and St. Louis under noticeable pressure. Phoenix and Las Vegas have lots of existing inventory sitting on the ground facing limited demand right now. 
The good news is that travel and booking data suggest that the Las Vegas tourism business is starting to show signs of life. We'll have to see if this gains momentum. We have acquired some well-placed finished lots under attractive terms in both Phoenix and Vegas, which can provide some incremental improvement going forward. 
Out West, the Middle and Northern parts of California held up well as did the Pacific Northwest. Southern California was weaker as a combination of soft demand and excess inventory in the market has been slow to work off. Overall, demand in the quarter was choppy as we move from week to week and from market to market. 
I'll just finish up with a couple of additional data points, and then we can open up the call. At quarter end, our lot position remained just shy of 150,000 lots, of which roughly 1/3 are developed. As we said earlier, during the third quarter, we approved 28 new investments representing just over 1,700 lots. Between price appreciation and limited supply, good land deals are getting harder to find. We certainly remain engaged in the process throughout the markets given the positive margin impact these deals can have when acquired under the right terms. 
In conclusion, while we're planning for challenging conditions to remain, there are nonetheless, factors in place that could allow for acceleration to the upside. With elections now over, there may be more success in efforts to get the economy started, which we believe is the linchpin of more meaningful gains in housing demand. And while attention always seems to focus on existing or potential future supply, the more pressing issue really is the absence of demand. 
With excellent pricing, low mortgage rates and manageable inventory of new homes in most markets around the country, it won't take much of an increase in fundamental demand to materially improve overall market conditions. Looking beyond today's headline numbers, PulteGroup continues to make steady year-over-year progress. In a market environment where conditions remain uncertain, we are taking proactive steps today to further reduce overhead costs, gain greater efficiencies and aggressively manage the factors within our control. 
Thanks for your time today, and let me turn the call back over to Jim."

So as we saw a development during this quarter in certain areas of claims, we have to go back and take a look at our overall reserves from that standpoint, from claims development. In addition, in the quarter, we wound up taking a look at a methodology change where typically, you would smooth these on an actuarial standpoint over a given number of years. And again because of the frequency that we were seeing, we changed to probably a more conservative approach in the years that we were using, which also increased the reserve from that standpoint of taking a shorter period of higher frequency of claims in themselves. So with that, it's sort of like the 100-year flood, you not only have it one time but you have now to prepared for it for the second time. So that's what the incurred but not reported comes down to is, if you had one, there must be one out there that would be similar to it, and you should basically put a reserve up for it.

First of all, the $100 million that we're looking to take out is a combination of field overhead savings from the realignment of areas and divisions, as well as a very significant move in corporate cost as well. And both are very significant in that $100 million. As we look at fixed versus variable, one person's fixed is another's variable, Steve. So we got to be careful what we say here. Generally speaking, at the corporate office, particularly after these changes we're making, we're probably down to what I would call 70% plus on the fixed side. In terms of cost in the field, it depends on whether you one them off all things or continue operating in certain markets, that  type of thing. So I guess, theoretically, you could say all of those costs are variable, although that's probably not accurate given leases and things like that, that you have the say. But we are making these changes to get proactive. We're looking at a relatively similar demand environment as we go into next year from what we've seen this year, which is clearly depressed. We're not doing this, anticipating a gigantic fall-off in demand, although since nobody knows, we thought it was appropriate to be proactive now. We're frustrated to be able to be bumping around at the break-even level, a little bit above, a little bit below, at any given quarter on our core business. And that's not acceptable.

At this point, I would say the trend is still going to be down, we're still formulating our plans for 2010. I don't know exactly how far down it will be, probably not as far down as this year.  But with that, we have the benefit, coming into 2011, of the first significant slug of closings that will come from communities acquired in '09 and '10 to date, which as others have indicated are certainly attractive from, not only a margin standpoint, but a return standpoint as well. We'll have to see how much that we can bring online as a percentage of our total to drive community count going forward. But at this point, I would say the trend is still down. Don't have an exact number for you as we're still kind of formulating everything for '11. But I just wanted to get that comment in there that if you have 100 committees with 10 lots or less, which is plus or minus what we had with part of the combination, you're going to have a lot of community count burn-off that is not necessarily maybe as relevant as if it were a lot of your core communities. So agree with you that community count is important and certainly something we're watching. We have been acquiring land. We're trying to be prudent about it.

As mentioned, October has been relatively consistent, absent maybe a little seasonality the from the previous quarter. My personal opinion is that foreclosures had been choppy all through this downturn as they come to market. I don't think the recent news, if you will, has had any kind of an immediate impact on less homes on the market right away or anything like that. Because in  my opinion, it's been this way for the last 18 to 24 months. It doesn't always get reported, but this has not been a very level process in a way foreclosures get processed, whether it's one bank or one different entity taking a little different position than someone else. So no, I have not heard from our sales teams that, that's made a difference in business."

It is very complicated because when you build houses over periods of times, they fall in different years. The insurance affects it by which you could have bought for insurance in those particular years. So let's say some of them were back 2004, 2005, you could have a claim in those years and then you could have different impact on an actuarial basis because of the way you bought insurance in those particular years. So really, the tail on our business is, a lot of it is mandated by state governments. And so, you got a tail on it that could last 10 years. And so with that, you've got claims that can come in and basically, any point in time. But some of our more severe ones were '05, '06 timeframe. '04 timeframe seemed to be at the peak. Some of them also correlate to when the market started to turn down. And again, correlate those last four years, as pricing has come down significantly, we've seen the increase in the number of claims. I'm not saying that those are absolutely related, but when you look at what's happened in the four years, as prices and values have come down, you'll also see a significant increase in a number of claims. So it is a bit of art and science when you go through this. Sort of throw it in the black box and come up with it. But clearly, when we have issues, we're certainly addressing them. And then, again, some we're more proactive on, which in itself creates a little bit more liability from us because we do that. So all of our approach to this, as well as the operating procedures, the way we bought insurance, the way the claims are coming in, and there is some, for instance, where all of a sudden, you've got rain in areas where you haven't had rain before, significant rain. Again, not an excuse, but standards that were set for construction standards in a particular point in time may not be appropriate given the changes that we're seeing there. So again, I know I'm not being specific, but there's a lot of different items that make that up. And they're not easily just carved out to one little piece that created it."

Let me see if I can help a little bit more as well. It's important to understand when Roger was talking earlier in his script about some of the changes in timeframes for the estimates, et cetera, when you have a spike in experience level here and you use a different timeframe for estimates that can dramatically affect the actuarial estimates. So again, depending on claims levels going forward, it's possible that the reserves that we have now posted would be well within the tolerance level and cover those for some period of time. It's also possible they'd have to get adjusted depending on what happens. It's kind of like the mortgage reserves that we posted in Q2 based on what we saw then. And if you look the slides we accompanied the presentation with, you notice that our experience level went up slightly around the Q2 timeframe. And since then, it's been trending down a little bit. So I just point out that there's not necessarily a direct correlation in what you've just taken and what you're going to take. We obviously adjust these assumptions with hopes that you now got it covered for the foreseeable future. But as Roger indicated, it's a tough science to nail down."

And the reason I ask is because at the time of the acquisition you guys talked about, you didn't think there was going to be a lot of land in the market at really attractive prices, and so, you make the big land move up front. And I'm wondering how that -- how your perspective has changed couple of -- a year, 18 months after the deal closed. Are you finding more lots than you've thought?

Still believe that. It's a question, I think, of how long the downturn continues at this rate overall. Relative to the individual margins on Centex product, Roger, I don't know if you can give more color there."

So those are the opportunities we're picking up. We're not doing a lot of land to develop, because a lot of those still don't pencil. So there's still a good degree of a spread between what we have and carrying in our books relative to what those opportunities offer us. We've seen others though that quite finally would be comparable to what we carry. So again some of those we're not doing.

It doesn't mean necessarily that two quarters from now or even next quarter, we may have a different view based on our experience.

So again, a lot of judgment, a lot of assumptions that go behind that, that create that thinking. So I wouldn't necessarily say that you'd see really anything comparable to margin, it was just SG&A and insurance. You could possibly see a reversal in the reserve because if we determined that, the size of that reserve was not sustainable because we're not seeing any more development happen in the homes that we built, then you would adjust that reserve downward and take it back.

Again, depending on what the underwriting was at that point in time. So when I look at the direct investor, that's where the guarantee was. And then, the bank itself, again because we have a guarantee with an investor, it's covered through that bank as well. But the bank is the first stop, and then CTX Mortgage would be the second stop."

As a reminder, on August 18, 2009, PulteGroup completed its merger with Centex Corporation. Results reported in the release and on this call reflect the inclusion of Centex operations for the third quarter of 2010, although results for the comparable prior period have not been adjusted for this merger.
Finally, I want to alert everyone that certain statements and comments made during the course of this call must be considered forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. PulteGroup believes such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but there are no assurances that the actual outcomes will not be materially different from those discussed today. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to the company on the date of this call, and the company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information in the future. Participants in today's call should refer to PulteGroup's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and this morning's press release for a detailed list of risks and uncertainties associated with the business. 
Certain statements during this call also contain references to non-GAAP financial measures. See this morning's press release and the accompanying slide presentation, which is available at our corporate website, for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP numbers.
As always, at the end of our prepared comments, we'll have time for Q&A. We will wait until then to open the queue. I'll now turn the call over to Richard Dugas for his opening comments.  Richard?"

Revenues for the quarter from Home Settlements, from the Homebuilding operations, decreased approximately 3% from the prior year quarter to approximately $1 billion. Decreased revenues reflect lower unit clo",2474,"Thank you, Richard, and good morning, everyone. Revenues for the quarter from Home Settlements, from the Homebuilding operations, decreased approximately 3% from the prior year quarter to approximately $1 billion. Decreased revenues reflect lower unit closings that were below prior year by approximately 7%. The average sales price increased 5% versus the prior year quarter to an average of $265,000. This increase is attributed to the geographical and product mix of homes closed during the quarter. 
In the third quarter, land sales generated approximately $6 million in total revenues, which is an increase of approximately $3 million versus the previous year's quarter. The sales in the quarter mainly reflect the sale of lots and land parcels to other builders. Homebuilding gross profits from Home Settlements for the quarter, including homebuilding interest expense, was approximately $72 million versus a loss of $26 million in the prior year quarter. 
For those with access to the webcast slides, I refer you to Slide #6, the adjusted margin analysis, which outlines our gross margins. Homebuilding gross margins from Home Settlements as a percentage of revenues, was 7% compared with a negative 2.5% in the third quarter of 2009. Adjusting the current quarter's gross margins for land and community valuation charges, interest expense and the acquisition accounting write-up for the Centex work in process resulted in a conversion of 16.7% compared to an adjusted margin of 17.2% from the second quarter of 2010, or on a sequential basis, a decrease of 50 basis points on an adjusted basis. This decrease is mainly attributed to the increase in commodity costs experienced earlier in the year. On a comparative basis versus the previous year's third quarter conversion of 13.1%, the adjusted increase is approximately 360 basis points. The improved margins versus the previous year's quarter are a direct result of lower sales incentives, house cost improvements and relatively stable market pricing.
Homebuilding interest expense increased during the quarter to approximately $49 million versus approximately $36 million in the prior year. Included in the interest expense of $49 million is an additional $8 million of expense related to land and community valuation adjustments taken in the current quarter. Also included in the gross margin for the quarter was a charge related to land and community valuation adjustments in the amount of approximately $50 million. 
Consistent with prior quarters, we have reviewed all of our communities for impairment indicators. Based on this review in the third quarter, we identified and tested 48 communities for potential impairments and valuation adjustments. We recorded valuation adjustments on 28 communities for the quarter, of which 14 communities or 50% have been previously impaired. Additionally, the larger impairments for the quarter, which represented approximately $40 million or 80% of the total $50 million in impairments were mainly concentrated in Central Florida, Las Vegas and the Tucson markets. Also for the quarter, the acquisition accounting work-in-process charge is approximately $900,000. 
The total net gain from land sales posted for the quarter was approximately $2 million. The gain is mainly attributed to the sale of lots and parcels of land in the quarter, offset by the fair market value adjustment in the current quarter for land being held for disposition and land sold in the amount of approximately $600,000, which is included in the land cost of sales. 
Homebuilding SG&A expenses, as a percent of home sales for the quarter, was approximately 40.7% or $417 million, an increase of approximately $208 million or 100% versus the prior year quarter. The previous year's quarter included transaction and integration costs and severance associated with the Centex merger of approximately $51 million. During the current quarter, we expensed approximately $272 million to increase our insurance reserves primarily related to general liability reserves. During the quarter, we experienced a greater frequency of newly reported claims and an increase in specific case reserves related to known claims for homes closed in prior years. 
Our specific case reserves related to these known claims increased by approximately $46 million or 17% of the total charge in the quarter. These reserves are based on an actuarial analysis of historical claims and trends. The actuarial analysis includes estimates of claims incurred but not reported, which make up a significant portion of these estimates, and for the quarter, represent approximately 80% of the amount reserved. The calculation of the incurred but not reported reserve is a process that requires judgment, and the results of which may remain uncertain for several years, as claims either do or do not materialize. These estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a number of factors including: Changes in the timing, frequency and severity of claims reporting and resolution patterns; third-party recoveries; insurance industry practices; state regulatory, environment and legal precedent.  Changes in any number of these factors will significantly impact the estimates of these reserves and are reflected in the incurred but not reported reserve.
In addition, the third quarter includes approximately $7 million for employee severance and related costs, associated with organizational changes and operational realignments implemented during the quarter. If we look at the SG&A line on a pro forma basis, excluding the insurance adjustment in the current quarter and the Centex transaction and integration costs related to the merger in the previous year, our expenses reflect a reduction of approximately $45 million or 23% from the combined Pulte and Centex SG&A expenses from the previous year's quarter.
In the Homebuilding, other income and expense category for the quarter, the expense of approximately $675 million includes a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $655 million. It also includes write-off of deposits and pre-acquisition costs resulting from the decision not to pursue certain land acquisitions in the amount of approximately $1 million and an expense of approximately $7 million associated with overhead expense reductions for lease exit and related costs. 
The goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year or when events or changes and circumstances indicate the carrying value amount may not be recoverable. 
During the quarter, we performed an event-driven assessment of the recoverability of goodwill following deterioration in market conditions and our operating results falling below previously forecasted levels, including a significant loss in the third quarter and a sustained decline in our market capitalization. The decline in the company's market capitalization occurred in spite of an increase in the company's tangible book value since the previous goodwill assessment as of October 31, 2009. The increase in the company's tangible book value resulted primarily from income tax refund and other tax-related matters. Accordingly, the implied fair value of the Homebuilding business experienced an even more significant decline than the company's market capitalization. 
We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by following a two-step process. Step one involves comparing the carrying value of each of our reporting units to their estimated fair value. We determine the fair value of each reporting unit using accepted valuation methods, including discounted cash flow supplemented by market-based assessments of fair value. As a result of step one of the September 30, 2010, goodwill impairment test, we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the majority of our reporting units with goodwill. Step two involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities, with the excess representing implied goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized if the goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. Again, the impairment loss is recognized if the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. As a result, we determined that a significant portion of our goodwill balance was impaired, and thus the $655 million impairment. 
The Homebuilding pretax loss for the quarter of approximately $1,020,000,000 is inclusive of the charges related to goodwill impairment, insurance and related charges, valuation adjustments in land inventory and investments, land held for sale, severance and related charges and the Centex work-in-process adjustment, for a total of approximately $1,001,000,000. The pretax income from Pulte's financial services operation for the third quarter was approximately $3 million. The quarter also includes severance and lease exit costs of approximately $2 million. The increase of approximately $12 million versus the previous year's quarter is primarily attributed to no repurchase loss reserve adjustments in the current quarter versus a charge of $11 million in the prior year quarter. 
Total mortgage principal origination dollars were $509 million, a decrease of 18% when compared to the same period last year. The decrease is primarily related to the decrease in unit closing volumes. Total agency originations were $475 million, non-agency originations were approximately $5 million and brokered non-funded loans were approximately $29 million. Additionally, within the funded-agency originations, FHA loans were approximately 37% of the loans funded from the financing line in the quarter compared to approximately 43% in the second quarter of 2010. Pulte Mortgage’s capture rate for the current quarter was approximately 78%, and the average FICO score for the quarter was 754.  
While not significant to our third quarter results, I thought I would take a minute to address the subject of mortgage putbacks since there has been so much interest in the subject recently. Also, you will find several slides included in the webcast presentation materials for your reference. 
From 2005 through 2008, the combined entities of Pulte Mortgage and CTX Mortgage originated approximately 316,000 loans, and to date, have had repurchase requests received of only 2,400 loans or about 8/10 of 1%. While others have focused on 2005 through 2008, given our experience and nature of the loans, we believe our risk is primarily associated with originations from 2006 and 2007. For 2010, the putback volumes increased early in the year, and although volatile from month-to-month, have been running at an average of approximately 100 per month. On a combined basis, on average, we have been able to successfully refute immediately half of these initial repurchase requests. Any mortgage request we initially do not refute then undergoes an extensive analysis to identify any potential liability. Then, if needed, we will attempt to correct the underlying issue, and when required, to confirm the dollar amount of exposure. 
As you're also aware, Centex maintained a sub-prime mortgage business, which was sold in 2006, and not included in the above mortgage originations. There have been no mortgages put back or repurchase requests made at any time since the sale. The original sale agreement caps any potential exposure for loan losses at $100 million, but we do not expect any significant exposure given the terms and conditions of the agreement, the experience and the passage of time from the transaction.
Putbacks are typically recourse only to our mortgage operations, which is a non-guarantor of the debt of the corporation. Under an existing agreement, PulteGroup agreed to stand behind CTX Mortgage on approximately $4 billion of loans with respect to the liability for breaches of representations and warranties. In addition, there is a pool of loans originated in 2006 and 2007 by CTX Mortgage with a principal balance of $7 billion from which the servicing rights were primarily purchased by a large national bank. The investor that purchased the associated loans generally has first sought recourse for any breaches in representations and warranties against this bank. However, the investor also has recourse to CTX Mortgage. And for this limited pool of loans, this recourse to the investor is backed by PulteGroup. Given our experience to date, we do not expect any incremental liability for PulteGroup under this agreement. 
We have been dealing with mortgage putbacks for the better part of two years and have tried to be realistic in our assessment of the problem and clear in discussions of the possible dollars involved. Based upon facts in our possession, our judgment, experience to date and our estimate of our probable exposure to these losses, we have accounted for approximately $190 million to date in charges, including reserves totaling approximately $100 million at the end of the third quarter. We have posted several charge to the website, pultegroupinc.com, for anyone interested in more details on this issue. 
In the Other Nonoperating category, pretax loss for the third quarter of approximately $7 million includes corporate expenses of approximately $9 million, partially offset by net interest income of $2 million resulting from invested cash balances. If we look at this on a pro forma basis, our expenses reflect a reduction of approximately $7 million from the combined Pulte and Centex expenses from the previous year's quarter.
For the third quarter, the company's pretax loss was approximately $1,024,000,000. The pretax loss for the quarter is inclusive of $1,003,000,000 and charges related to goodwill impairment, insurance-related charges, valuation adjustments in land, inventory and investments, land held for sale, severance and lease-exit and related costs, and the acquisition accounting write-up for the Centex work-in-process inventory. The net loss for the third quarter was approximately $995 million or a loss of $2.63 per share as compared to a net loss of approximately $361 million or a loss of $1.15 per share for the same period last year. The quarter reflects a net benefit from income taxes of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters. The number of shares used in the EPS calculation was approximately 378.8 million diluted shares for the third quarter of 2010. The total shares outstanding at September 30, 2010, were approximately 382.4 million shares. 
Reviewing the balance sheet for the quarter. We ended with a cash balance of approximately $2.7 billion. House and land inventory ended the quarter at approximately $4.9 billion. The increase in house and land inventory and land held for sale for the quarter was approximately $96 million from the second quarter of 2010. During the third quarter, our new investment in land were in rolling lot option takedowns and purchases of approximately $110 million and land development spending of approximately $169 million, with a modest increase in house inventory by approximately $28 million.
With approximately $2.7 billion in cash to end the third quarter, we had no outstanding balance drawn on our revolving credit facility. The company's gross debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 65.1% and on a net basis, 42%. During the third quarter, we announced a debt tender offer to purchase up to $500 million of aggregate principal amount of currently outstanding debt. We successfully completed the $500 million offer to purchase the notes and provided the funding for it early in the fourth quarter. Interest incurred amounted to approximately $69 million in the quarter compared to $61 million for the same period of last year. PulteGroup shareholder equity for the third quarter was approximately $2.3 billion. We also repurchased no shares during the quarter, and the company has approximately $102 million remaining on the current authorization. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Richard. Richard?"

For obvious reasons, since the April tax credit expiration and the immediate pullback in demand, there is intense interest in how home buyers will act over the remainder of 2010. So before we open the call for questions, I want to provid",1241,"Thank you, Roger. For obvious reasons, since the April tax credit expiration and the immediate pullback in demand, there is intense interest in how home buyers will act over the remainder of 2010. So before we open the call for questions, I want to provide a few comments on our business. What we saw in the third quarter was an industry where demand continued to move along the bottom as buyers elected to remain on the sidelines. Even as low home prices and record low interest rates combined to create unprecedented affordability, potential buyers are hesitant, given weak economic conditions, limited job growth and overall uncertainty about near-term opportunities. 
Last year, working under the assumption that industry demand would remain challenged, PulteGroup pursued its merger with Centex. The merger allowed us to accelerate a number of key initiatives geared to deliver greater improvements in overhead leverage, operating efficiency and overall cost reductions. The obvious goal was, and remains, returning the business to consistent profitability. As demonstrated in the first half of 2010, the merger allowed PulteGroup to more quickly move the business back toward making money. While we can appreciate that the third quarter charges make it difficult to see the core business, the underlying run rate for our operations remains close to the breakeven mark. 
As discussed during our second quarter conference call, higher material costs compressed gross margin sequentially, but they still remain above last year, up 360 basis points after adjusting for land impairment and interest charges in the Centex WIP impact. The merger benefits have been clearly demonstrated within PulteGroup's operating numbers, but the gains and overall progress have not been enough to push us solidly into the black for each and every quarter. As a result, we are implementing additional actions to lower cost and push the company further along the path of consistent profitability. 
Early in the third quarter, we announced a flatter organizational structure. After this announcement, we have continued to reconfigure our organization to reduce overhead costs and drive greater leverage. Among the additional steps recently implemented, we have reduced the number of operating areas from six down to four, allowing us to completely remove two area teams and associated costs. We will begin reporting results under this new structure in the fourth quarter. Underneath the areas, we have consolidated divisions in Arizona, Florida, and in our New York, New Jersey operations. Along with our field operations, we have further reduced corporate staffing across a number of functions as we continue to streamline our operating process. In modifying our organizational structure and implementing a series of changes and/or reductions, we are working to reduce overall SG&A spending. On a year-over-year basis, we expect to reduce 2011 SG&A by approximately $100 million when compared with 2010. These actions will result in a fourth quarter charge, but with many forecasting demand in 2011 will show only modest gains, we are acting proactively now to ensure we maximize the savings opportunity.
Complementing our never-ending work on lowering cost, we continue to strengthen our competitive position through the acquisition of well-placed land throughout our markets. In the third quarter, we approved another 28 deals for roughly 1,700 lots. This brings our total to roughly 7,000 lots approved since the start of 2009, which is in addition to the 50,000 lots acquired with the Centex merger. Given the favorable terms under which we purchased these distressed assets, they can have a positive impact on our results as the underlying communities start selling and closing homes in 2011 and beyond. 
In terms of specific results for the quarter, sign-ups for Q3 totaled 3,566 homes, which was down roughly 12% from reported results for the third quarter of last year. On a pro forma basis, assuming Pulte and Centex were one company for all of last year's third quarter, year-over-year sign-ups were down approximately 31% on 17% fewer communities. Sequentially, third quarter sign-ups were down approximately 15% from the second quarter of 2010, which in part reflects normal seasonality of the business and likely some lingering impact from the tax credit expiration. Monthly sign-ups were relatively stable during the quarter, while our cancellation rate for the period was 19.1%. 
Last year's merger makes specific comparisons of year-over-year sign-ups difficult, so let me provide some qualitative comments about market conditions in the quarter. Within the quarter, demand in our Northeast area held up relatively well as strength in our New England and Delaware Valley markets offset some weakness in the Mid-Atlantic. Our Southeast operations experienced a similar pattern with solid demand in Atlanta and Nashville, offset by some demand softness in the Carolinas. 
Once again, our Gulf Coast operations, which span Texas and Florida, were our strongest performers. We saw consistent demand throughout Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio, as well as in our North and Central Florida operations. Our operations in South Florida experienced some demand softness, but we'll have to see if that's anything more than a typical summer slowing. The Midwest and Southwest areas continue to face challenges, with Las Vegas, Phoenix and St. Louis under noticeable pressure. Phoenix and Las Vegas have lots of existing inventory sitting on the ground facing limited demand right now. 
The good news is that travel and booking data suggest that the Las Vegas tourism business is starting to show signs of life. We'll have to see if this gains momentum. We have acquired some well-placed finished lots under attractive terms in both Phoenix and Vegas, which can provide some incremental improvement going forward. 
Out West, the Middle and Northern parts of California held up well, as did the Pacific Northwest. Southern California was weaker, as a combination of soft demand and excess inventory in the market has been slow to work off. Overall, demand in the quarter was choppy as we moved from week to week and from market to market. 
I'll just finish up with a couple of additional data points, and then we can open up the call. At quarter end, our lot position remained just shy of 150,000 lots, of which roughly one-third are developed. As we said earlier, during the third quarter, we approved 28 new investments representing just over 1,700 lots. Between price appreciation and limited supply, good land deals are getting harder to find. We certainly remain engaged in the process throughout the markets given the positive margin impact these deals can have when acquired under the right terms. 
In conclusion, while we're planning for challenging conditions to remain, there are nonetheless factors in place that could allow for acceleration to the upside. With elections now over, there may be more success in efforts to get the economy started, which we believe is the linchpin to more meaningful gains in housing demand. And while attention always seems to focus on existing or potential future supply, the more pressing issue really is the absence of demand. 
With excellent pricing, low mortgage rates and manageable inventory of new homes in most markets around the country, it won't take much of an increase in fundamental demand to materially improve overall market conditions. Looking beyond today's headline numbers, PulteGroup continues to make steady year-over-year progress.

And some of it is picked up by the third-party insurance companies, some of them are picked up by the trades’ insurance companies, and then some are picked up by the company themself because we’re self-insured beyond a certain point. So as we saw a development during this quarter in certain areas of claims, we have to go back and take a look at our overall reserves from that standpoint, from claims development. In addition, in the quarter, we wound up taking a look at a methodology change where typically, you would smooth these on an actuarial standpoint over a given number of years. And again, because of the frequency that we were seeing, we changed to probably a more conservative approach in the years that we were using, which also increased the reserve from that standpoint of taking a shorter period of higher frequency of claims in themselves. So with that, it's sort of like the 100-year flood, you not only have it one time but you have to now prepare for it for the second time. So that's what the incurred but not reported comes down to is, if you had one, there must be one out there that would be similar to it, and you should basically put a reserve up for it.

First of all, the $100 million that we're looking to take out is a combination of field overhead savings from the realignment of areas and divisions, as well as a very significant move in corporate cost as well. And both are very significant in that $100 million. As we look at fixed versus variable, one person's fixed is another's variable, Steve. So we got to be careful what we say here. Generally speaking, at the corporate office, particularly after these changes we're making, we're probably down to what I would call 70-plus percent on the fixed side. In terms of cost in the field, it depends on whether you want to mothball things or continue operating in certain markets, that type of thing. So I guess, theoretically, you could say all of those costs are variable, although that's probably not accurate given leases and things like that, that you have to say. But we are making these changes to get proactive. We're looking at a relatively similar demand environment as we go into next year from what we've seen this year, which is clearly depressed. We're not doing this, anticipating a gigantic fall-off in demand, although since nobody knows, we thought it was appropriate to be proactive now. We're frustrated to be able to be bumping around at the breakeven level, a little bit above, a little bit below, at any given quarter on our core business. And that's not acceptable.

If you remember back with the acquisition of Centex and some of our commentary there, there were a very large number of communities that had a very small number of lots that were part of the acquisition. So I just caution everyone that community count, while certainly a relevant indicator, is not the only indicator of kind of revenue performance going forward. At this point, I would say the trend is still going to be down. We're still formulating our plans for 2010. I don't know exactly how far down it’ll be, probably not as far down as this year.  But with that, we have the benefit, coming into 2011, of the first significant slug of closings that will come from communities acquired in '09 and '10 to date, which as others have indicated are certainly attractive from not only a margin standpoint but a return standpoint as well. We'll have to see how much that we can bring online as a percentage of our total to drive community count going forward. But at this point, I would say the trend is still down. Don't have an exact number for you as we're still kind of formulating everything for '11. But I just wanted to get that comment in there that if you have 100 communities with 10 lots or less, which is plus or minus what we had with part of the combination, you're going to have a lot of community count burn-off that is not necessarily maybe as relevant as if it were a lot of your core communities. So agree with you that community count is important and certainly something we're watching. We have been acquiring land. We're trying to be prudent about it. We don't want to clearly acquire anything that would ultimately get impaired. So we're trying to be very cautious. But nevertheless, we are finding success on distressed assets."

And again, pretty early to guess, but what do you see the percent of closings in '11, even in rough terms, just to give us a ballpark from those new communities?"

It is very complicated because when you build houses over periods of times, they fall in different years. The insurance affects it by what you could have bought for insurance in those particular years. So let's say some of them were back in 2004 and 2005. You could have a claim in those years, and then you could have different impact on an actuarial basis because of the way you bought insurance in those particular years. So really, the tail on our business is, a lot of it’s mandated by state governments. And so, you got a tail on it that could last 10 years. And so with that, you've got claims that can come in, in basically any point in time. But some of our more severe ones were '05, '06 time frame. '04 time frame seemed to be at the peak. Some of them also correlate to when the market started to turn down. And again, correlate those last four years, as pricing has come down significantly, we've seen the increase in the number of claims. I'm not saying that those are absolutely related, but when you look at what's happened in the four years, as prices and values have come down, you also see a significant increase in the number of claims. So it is a bit of art and science when you go through this. Sort of throw it in the black box and come up with it. But clearly, when we have issues, we're certainly addressing them. And then, again, some of them we're more proactive on, which in itself creates a little bit more liability from us because we do that. So all of our approach to this, as well as the operating procedures, the way we bought insurance, the way the claims are coming in, and there are, for instance, where all of a sudden, you've got rain in areas where you haven't had rain before, significant rain. Again, not an excuse, but standards that were set for construction standards in a particular point in time may not be appropriate given the changes that we're seeing there. So again, I know I'm not being specific, but there's a lot of different items that make that up. And they're not easily just carved out to one little piece that created it."

Let me see if I can help a little bit more as well. It's important to understand when Roger was talking earlier in his script about some of the changes in time frames for the estimates, et cetera, when you have a spike in experience level here and you use a different time frame for estimates, that can dramatically affect the actuarial estimates. So again, depending on claims levels going forward, it's possible that the reserves that we have now posted would be well within the tolerance level and cover those for some period of time. It's also possible they'd have to get adjusted depending on what happens. It's kind of like the mortgage reserves that we posted in Q2 based on what we saw then. And if you look the slides we accompanied the presentation with, you notice that our experience level went up slightly around the Q2 time frame. And since then, it's been trending down a little bit. So I’d just point out that there's not necessarily a direct correlation in what you've just taken and what you're going to take. You obviously adjust these assumptions with hopes that you now got it covered for the foreseeable future. But as Roger indicated, it's a tough science to nail down."

And I was wondering if we could get little bit more fine on that point. And what I was hoping to do was compare the new lot acquisitions that you guys are doing margins relative to the acquired lots from Centex. And the reason I ask is because at the time of the acquisition, you guys talked about, you didn't think there was going to be a lot of land in the market at really attractive prices, and so you make the big land move up front. And I'm wondering how that -- how your perspective has changed a couple -- a year, 18 months after the deal closed. Are you finding more lots than you'd thought? And is the margin that you were able to achieve on the Centex lots comparable to what you were able to get in the broader market today?"

Still believe that. It's a question, I think, of how long the downturn continues at this rate overall.

And so those are the opportunities we're picking up. We're not doing a lot of land to develop, because a lot of those still don't pencil. So there's still a good degree of a spread between what we have and carrying in our books relative to what those opportunities offer us. We've seen others, though, that quite finally would be comparable to what we carry. So again, some of those we're not doing.

And that's resulted in some significant choices that we've made on what's directly adding value today, given the size of our business. So I agree with you. It's a big number.

For those of you who have access to the Internet, a slide presentation, available at www.pultegroupinc.com will accompany this discussion. The slides will be archived on the site for the next 30 days for those who want to review it later. As a reminder, on August 18, 2009, PulteGroup completed its merger with Centex Corporation. Results reported in the release and on this call reflect the inclusion of Centex's operations for the third quarter of 2010, although results for the comparable prior period have not been adjusted for this merger. 
Finally, I want to alert everyone that certain statements and comments made during the course of this call must be considered forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. PulteGroup believes such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but there are no assurances that actual outcomes will not be materially different from those discussed today. All forward-looking statements are based on information available to the company on the date of this call, and the company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information in the future.
Participants in today's call should refer to PulteGroup's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and this morning's press release for a detailed list of risks and uncertainties associated with the business. Certain statements during this call also contain references to non-GAAP financial measures. See this morning's press release, and the accompanying slide presentation, which is available on our corporate website for reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP numbers. As always, at the end of our prepared comments, we will have time for Q&A. We will wait until then to open the queue. I’ll now turn over the call over to Richard Dugas for his opening comments.

Revenues from the quarter for home settlements, from the home building operation decreased approximately 3% from the prior year quarter, to approximately $1 billion. Decrease revenues reflect lower unit closings that were below prior year by approximately 7%. The average sales price increased by a percent versus the prior year quarter, to an average of $265,000. This increase is contributed to the geographical and product mix of homes closed during the quarter.  
In Q3, land sales generated approximately $6 million in total revenues, which is an increase  of approximately $3 million versus the previous year’s quarter. The sales in the quarter mainly reflect  the sales of lot and land parcels to other builders. Home building gross profits for home settlements for the quarter, including home building interest expense is approximately $72 million versus a loss of $26 million in the prior year quarter. 
For those of us with access to the webcast slides, I refer you to slide number six, the adjusted margin analysis, which outlines our gross margins.  Home building gross margins from home settlements as a percentage of revenues was 7% compared with a negative 2.5% in Q3 2009. Adjusting the current quarter’s gross margins for land and community valuation charges, interest expense and the acquisition accounting write up for the Centex work in progress, resulted in a conversion of 16.7%, compared to an adjusted margin of 17.2% for Q2 2010. Or, on a sequential basis, a decrease of 50 basis points on an adjusted basis. 
This decrease is mainly attributed to the increase in commodity cost, experienced earlier in the year.  On a comparative basis versus the previous year’s Q3 conversion of 13.1%, the adjusted increase is approximately 360 basis points. The improved margins versus the previous year’s quarter are a direct result of lower sales incentives, house cost improvements, and relatively stable market prices. 
Home building interest expense increased during the quarter to approximately $49 million versus approximately $36 million in the prior year.  Included in the interest expense of $49 million is an additional $8 million of expense related to land and community valuation adjustment taken in the current quarter. 
Also included in the gross margin for the quarter was a charge related to land and community valuation adjustment in the amount of approximately $50 million. Consistent with prior quarters, we have reviewed all of our communities for impairment indicators. Based on this review in Q3, we identified and tested 48 communities for potential impairments and valuation adjustments. We recorded valuation adjustments on 28 communities for the quarter, of which 14 communities, or 50%, have been previously impaired. 
Additionally, the larger impairments for the quarter, which represented approximately $40 million or 80% of the total $50 million impairments were mainly concentrated in central Florida, Las Vegas, and the Tucson markets. Also for the quarter the acquisition accounting work and process charge is approximately $900,000. The total net gain from land sales posted for the quarter was approximately $2 million.  The gain is mainly attributed to the sales of lots and parcels of land in the quarter, offset by the fair market value adjustment in the current quarter for land being held for disposition, and land sold in the amount of approximately $600,000, which is included in the land cost of sales. 
Home building SG&A expenses, that’s a percent of home sales for the quarter, was approximately 40.7% or $417 million, an increase of approximately $208 million, or 100% versus the prior year quarter. The previous year’s quarter included transaction and integration costs and severance associated with the Centex merger of approximately $51 million. 
During the current quarter, we expensed approximately $272 million to increase our insurance reserves, primarily related to general liability reserves. During the quarter, we experienced a greater frequency of newly reported claims, and an increase in specific case reserves related to known claims for homes closed in prior years. Our specific case reserves related to these know claims increased to approximately $46 million, or 17% of the total charge in the quarter. 
These reserves are based on an actuarial analysis of historical claims and trends. The actuarial analysis included estimates of claims incurred but not reported, which make up a significant portion of these estimates, and for the quarter, represent approximately 80% of the amount reserved. The calculation of the incurred but not reported reserve is a process that requires judgment and the results of which may remain uncertain for several years, as claims either do or do not materialize. 
The estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainly, due to a number of factors including changes in the timing, frequency and severity of claims reporting and resolution patterns; third party recoveries, insurance industry practices, state regulatory environment and legal precedent. Changes in any number of these factors will significantly impact the estimates of these reserves and are reflected in the incurred but not reported reserve. 
In addition, Q3 includes approximately $7 million for employee severance and related cost, associated with organizational changes and operations realignment implemented during the quarter.  If we look at the SG&A line, on a pro forma basis, excluding the insurance adjustment in the current quarter and the Centex transaction and integration cost related to the merger in the previous year, our expenses reflect a reduction of approximately $45 million, or 23% from the combined Pulte and Centex SG&A expenses from the previous year’s quarter. 
In the home building other income and expense category for the quarter, the expense of approximately $675 million includes a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $655 million. It also includes write off of deposit to pre-acquisition cost resulting from the decision not to pursue certain land acquisitions in the amount of approximately $1 million, and an expense of approximately $7 million associated with overhead expense reductions for lease exit and related costs. 
The goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test in Q4 of each year, or when events or changes or circumstances indicate the carrying value amount may not be recoverable. During the quarter, we performed an event driven assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, following deterioration in market conditions and our operating results falling below previously forecasted levels, including a significant loss in Q3, and a sustained decline in our market capitalization. 
The decline in the company’s market capitalization occurred in spite of an increase in the company’s tangible book value, since the previous goodwill assessment as of October 31, 2009. The increase in the company’s tangible book value resulted primarily from income tax refund and other tax related matters. According, the implied fair value of the home building business experienced an even more significant decline than the company’s market capitalization. 
We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by following a two step process. Step one involves comparing the carrying value of each of our reporting units to their estimated fair value. We determine the fair value of each reporting unit using accepted valuation methods, including discounted cash flow supplemented by market based assessments of fair value.  
As a result of step one of the September 30, 2010 goodwill impairment test, we determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the majority of our reporting units with goodwill. Step two involves allocating the fair value of the reporting to its assets and liabilities, with the excess representing implied goodwill. Impairment loss is recognized if the goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. Again, the impairment loss is recognized if the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill.  
As a result, we determined that a significant portion of our goodwill balance was impaired and that’s the $655 million impairment. The home building pre-tax loss for the quarter of approximately$1.02 billion, inclusive of the charges related to good will impairment, insurance and related charges, valuations adjustments and land inventory investments, land held for sale, severance and related charges, and the Centex work in process adjustment for a approximately $1.001 billion. 
The pretax income for Pulte’s financial services was approximately $3 million.  The quarter also includes severance and lease exit cost of approximately $2 million. The increase of approximately $12 million versus the previous year quarter is primarily attributed to no repurchase loss adjustment in the current quarter, versus a charge of $11 million in the prior year quarter. 
Total mortgage principle origination dollars were $509 million, a decrease of 18% when compared to the same period last year. The decrease is primarily related to the decrease in unit closing volumes.  Total agency originations were $475 million, non agency originations were approximately $5 million, and brokered non funded loans were approximately $29 million. 
Additionally, within the funded agency originations, FHA loans were approximately37% of the loans funded from the financing line in the quarter, compared to approximately 43% in Q2 2010. Pulte Mortgages capture rate for the current quarter was approximately 78%, and the average FICO score for the quarter was 754. 
While not significant to Q3 results, I thought I would take a moment to address the subject of mortgage put backs, since there’s been so much interest in the subject recently. Also, you will find several slides included in the webcast presentation materials for your reference. From 2005 through 2008 the combined entities of Pulte Mortgage and CTX Mortgage originated approximately 316,000 loans and to date have had repurchase requests received of only 2400 loans, for about eight-tenths of one percent. While others are focused on 2005 to 2008, given our experience and nature of the loans, we believe our risk is primarily associated with originations from 2006 and 2007. 
For 2010, the put back volumes increased early in the year, and although volatile from month to month, have been running at an average of approximately 100 per month. On a combined basis, on average, we have been able to successfully refute immediately half of these initial repurchase requests.  Any mortgage request we do not refute then undergoes an extensive analysis to identify any potential liability. Then, if needed, we will attempt to correct the underlying issue, and when required to confirm the dollar amount of exposure. 
As you are also aware, Centex maintained a sub-prime mortgage business, which was sold in 2006, and not included in the above mortgage origination. There have been no mortgages put back or repurchase requests made at any time since the sale. The original sale agreement caps any potential exposure for loan losses at $100 million. But we do not expect any significant exposure, given the terms and conditions of the agreement, the experience, and the passage of time from the transaction.
Put backs are typically recourse only to our mortgage operations, which is a non-guarantor of the debt of the corporation. Under an existing agreement, Pulte Group agreed to stand behind CTX Mortgage on approximately $4 billion of loans with respect to the liability for breaches of representations and warranties. In addition, there is a pool of loans originated in 2006 and 2007, by CTX Mortgage with a principle balance of $7 billion, from which the servicing rights were primarily purchased by a large national bank. 
The investor that purchased the associated loans generally has first sought recourse for any breaches in representation and warranties against this bank. However, the investor also has recourse to CTX Mortgage, and for this limited pool of loans, this recourse to the investor is backed by Pulte Group. Given our experience to date, we do not expect any incremental liability for Pulte Group under this agreement. 
We have been dealing with mortgage put backs for the better part of two years, and have tried to be realistic in our assessment of the problem, and clear in our discussions of the possible dollars involved. Based upon facts in our possession, our judgment, experience to date, and our estimate of our probably exposure to these losses, we have accounted for approximately $190 million to date in charges, including reserves totaling approximately $100 million at the end of Q3.  
We have posted several charts to the website, www.Pultegroupinc.com , for anyone interested in more details on this issue. 
In the other non operating category, pre-tax loss for Q3 of approximately $7 million includes corporate expenses of approximately $9 million, partially offset by net interest income of $2 million, resulting from invested cash balances. If we look at this on a pro forma basis, we expenses reflect a reduction of approximately $7 million on the combined Pulte and Centex expenses from the previous year quarter. 
For Q3, the company’s pre-tax loss was approximately $1.024 billion.  The pre-tax loss for the quarter is inclusive of $1.003 million related to goodwill and impairments, insurance related charges, valuation adjustments and land inventory and investments, land held for sale, severance and lease exit and related costs, and the acquisition accounting write up for the Centex work in process inventory.
The net loss for Q3 was approximately $959 million, for a loss of $2.63 per share, as compared to a net loss of approximately$361 million, for a loss of $1.15 per share for the same period last year. The quarter reflects a net benefit from net income tax of approximately $29 million, primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain federal and state income tax matters. 
The number of shares used in the EPS calculation was approximately378.8 million diluted shares for Q3 2010. The total shares outstanding at September 30, 2010 were approximately 382.4 million shares. 
Reviewing the balance sheet for the quarter, we ended with a cash balance of approximately $2.7 billion. House and land inventory ended the quarter at approximately $4.9 billion. The increase in house and land inventory and land held for sale for the quarter was approximately $96 million from Q2 2010. During Q3, our new investments in land were in rolling lot option takedowns and purchases of approximately $110 million, and land development spending of approximately $169 million, with a modest increase  in house inventory by approximately $28 million. 
With approximately $2.7 billion in cash end of Q3, we had no outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility.  The company’s gross debt to capitalization ratio was approximately 65.1%, and on the net basis, 42%. During Q3, we announced a debt tender offer to purchase up to $500 million of aggregate principal amount of currently outstanding debt. We successfully completed the $500 million offer to purchase the notes, and provided the funding for it early in Q4. 
Interest incurred amounted to approximately $69 million in the quarter, compared to $61 million for the same period last year. Pulte Group shareholder equity for Q3 was approximately $2.3 billion. We also repurchased no shares during the quarter, and the company has approximately $102 million remaining on the current authorization. With that, I’ll now turn the call back over to Richard.

For obvious reasons, since the April tax credit expiration and the immediate pullback in demand, there’s intense interest in how home buyers will act over the remainder of 2010. So before we open the call for questions, I want to provide a few comments on our business. 
What we saw in Q3 was an industry where demand continued to move along the bottom, as buyers elected to remain on the sidelines. Even as low home prices and record low interest rates combined to create unprecedented affordability, potential buyers are hesitant, given weak economic conditions, limited job growth, and overall uncertainty about near term opportunities. 
Last year, working under the assumption that industry demand would remain challenged, Pulte Group pursued its merger with Centex. The merger allowed us to accelerate a number of key initiatives geared deliver greater improvements in overhead leverage, operating efficiency, and overall cost reductions. The obvious goal was and remains returning the business to consistent profitability. As demonstrated in the first half of 2010, the merger allowed Pulte Group to move quickly - to more quickly move the business back toward making money. 
While we can appreciate that the Q3 charges make it difficult to see the core business, the underlying run rate for our operations remains close to the break even mark.  As discussed during our Q2 conference call, higher material cost compressed gross margins sequentially, but they still remain above last year, up 360 basis points after adjusting for land impairment and interest charges and the Centex whip impact. 
The merger benefits have been clearly demonstrated within Pulte Groups top rated numbers, but the gains and overall progress have not been enough to push us solidly into the black for each and every quarter. As a result, we are implementing additional actions to lower cost and push the company further along the path to consistent profitability. Early in Q3, we announced a flatter organizational structure. After this announcement, we have continued to reconfigure our organization to reduce overhead costs and drive greater leverage. 
Among the additional steps recently implemented, we have reduced the number of operating areas from six down to four, allowing us to completely remove two area teams and associated costs.  We will begin reporting results under this new structure in Q4. Underneath the areas, we have consolidated divisions in Arizona, Florida, and in our New York/New Jersey operations. Along with our field operations, we have further reduced corporate staffing across a number of functions as we continue to streamline our operating process.
In modifying our organizational structure and implementing a series of changes and/or reductions, we are working to reduce overall SG&A spending. On a year over  year basis, we expect to reduce 2011  SG&A by approximately $100 million, when compared with 2010. These actions will result in a Q4 charge, but with many forecasting demand in 2011 will show only modest gains, we are acting proactively to ensure we maximize the savings opportunity. 
Complementing our never ending work on lowering cost, we can continue to strengthen our competitive position through the acquisition of well placed land throughout our markets. In Q3, we approved another 28 deals for roughly 1700 lots. This brings our total to roughly 7000 lots approved since the start of 2009, which is in addition to the 50,000 lots acquired with the Centex merger. 
Given the favorable terms under which we purchased these distressed assets, they can have a positive impact on our results as the underlying community starts selling and closing homes in 2011  and beyond. In terms of specific results for the quarter, signups for Q3 totaled 3566 homes, which was down roughly 12% from reported results for Q3 last year. 
On a pro forma basis, assuming Pulte and Centex were one company for all of last year’s Q3, year over  year sign ups were down approximately 31% on 17% fewer communities. Sequentially, Q3 signups were down approximately 15% from Q2 2010, which in part reflects normal seasonality of the business, and likely some lingering impact from the tax credit expiration.
Monthly signups were relatively stable during the quarter, while our cancellation rate for the period was 19.1%. Last year’s merger made specific comparisons of year over  year signups difficult, so let me provide some qualitative comments about market conditions in the quarter. Within the quarter, demand in our northeast area held up relatively well, as strength in our New England and Delaware valley markets offset some weakness in the mid-Atlantic. 
Our southeast operations experienced a similar pattern with solid demand in Atlanta and Nashville, offset by some demand softness in the Carolinas. Once again, our Gulf Coast operations, which span Texas and Florida, were are strongest performers. We say consistent demand throughout Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio; as well as in our north and central Florida operations. Our operations in South Florida experienced some demand softness.  We’ll have to see if that’s anything more than a typical summer slowing.
The Midwest and Southwest areas continue to face challenges, with Las Vegas, Phoenix, and St. Louis under noticeable pressure. Phoenix and Las Vegas have lots of existing inventory sitting on the ground, facing limited demand right now. The good news is that travel and booking data suggest that the Las Vegas tourism business is starting to show signs of life.  We’ll have to see if this gains momentum. 
We have acquired some well place finished lots under attractive terms in both Phoenix and Vegas, which can provide some incremental improvement going forward.  Out west, the middle and northern parts of California held up well, as did the Pacific Northwest. Southern California was weaker, as a combination of soft demand and excess inventory in the market has been slow to work off. Overall, demand in the quarter was choppy as we moved from week to week, and from market to market. 
I’ll just finish up with a couple of additional data points, and then we can open up the call.  At quarter end, our lie position remained just shy of 150,000 lots, of which roughly one-third are developed. As we said earlier, during Q3 we approved 28 new investments representing just over 1700 lots. Between price appreciation and limited supply, good land deals are getting harder to find. We certainly remain engaged in the process throughout the markets, given the positive margin impact these deals can have when acquired under the right terms. 
In conclusion, while we’re planning for challenging conditions to remain, there are nonetheless factors in place that could allow for acceleration to the upside. With elections now over, there may be more success in efforts to get the economy started, which we believe is the lynchpin to more meaningful gains in housing demand. 
While attention always seems to focus on existing or potential future supply, the more pressing issue really is the absence of demand. With excellent pricing, low mortgage rates, and manageable inventory of new homes in most markets around the country, it won’t take much of an increase in fundamental demand to materially improve overall market conditions. Looking beyond today headline numbers, Pulte Group continues to make steady year over year progress. 
In a market environment where conditions remain uncertain, we are taking proactive steps today to further reduce overhead cost, gain greater efficiencies and aggressively manage the factors within our control. Thanks for your time today, and let me turn the call back over to Jim.

In terms of pricing, certainly selected communities we can drive - pace with price, but it’s not significant, and it tends to be very specific to different assets. In some cases, price is not moving inventory, so we’ve not seen a big issue where price is all of a sudden going to accelerate a lot of activity.

Roger, with that any more detail?

Some of this picked up by the third party insurance company, some of them are picked up by the trades insurance company and then some are picked up by the company itself, because we’re self insured past a certain point. So as we saw development during this quarter, in certain areas of claims, we have to go back and take a look at our overall reserves from that standpoint from claims development. 
In addition, in the quarter we wound up taking a look at a methodology change where typically you would smooth these on an actuarial standpoint over a given number of years.  Again, because of the frequency we were seeing, we changed to probably a more conservative approach, in the years that we were using, which also increased the reserve from that standpoint, of taking a shorter period of higher frequency of claims themselves. So with that, it’s sort of like the hundred year flood. You not only have it the one time, but you have to now prepare for it for the second time. So that’s what the incurred but not reported comes down to. If you had one, there must be one out there that would be similar to it, and you should basically put a reserve up for it. So again, that’s where 80% of the reserve was generated from, was more of these incurred but not reported based on some of the developments that we saw over the last quarter.

And both are very significant in that $100 million.  As we look at fixed versus variable, one person’s fixed is another’s variable, Steve, so we’ve got to be careful what we say here.  Generally speaking, at the corporate office, particularly after these changes we’re making, we’re probably down to what I would call 70% plus on the fixed side.  In terms of the cost in the field, it depends on whether you want mothball things or continue operating in certain markets, that type of thing. So I guess theoretically all those costs are variable, although that’s probably not accurate given leases and things like that that you have to say, but we are making these changes to get proactive.  We’re looking at a relatively similar demand environment as we go into next year, from what we’ve seen this year, which is clearly depressed. We’re not doing this anticipating a gigantic fall off in demand, although since nobody knows, we thought it was appropriate to be proactive now. We’re frustrated to be able to be bumping around at the breakeven level a little bit above, a little bit below any given quarter, on our core business.  That’s not acceptable.  We want to be solidly profitable, so that’s why we’re taking the actions. In terms of raw materials, maybe Roger can give some color there.

So even as we look at our backlog, as we look at kind of what we delivered this quarter, not a big change one direction or another. We are not seeing a significant rise in incentives.  I know some have talked about that. Again, potentially our mix could be different.  You know, we have still a significant portion of our business in the active adult sector as well, but I would say gross margins appear relatively flat to us.  Clearly, we’re working hard to improve them, overall, but as of now I wouldn’t see a significant change going forward.  Roger, anything more there?

A couple of things - if you remember back to the acquisition of Centex and some of our commentary there, there were a very large number of communities that had a very small number of lots that were part of the acquisition. So I just caution everyone that community count, while certainly a relevant indicator, is not the only indicator of kind of revenue performance going forward.  At this point, I would say the trend is still going to be down.  We’re still formulating our plans for 2011, don’t know exactly how far down it will be. Probably not as far down as this year, but with that, we have the benefit coming in 2011 of the first significant slug of closings that will come from communities acquired in ’09 and ’10 to date. Which, as others have indicated, are certainly attractive from not only a margins standpoint, but a returns standpoint as well? We’ll have to see how much of that we can bring online as a percentage of our total, to drive community count going forward.  But at this point, I would say the trend is still down.  I don’t have an exact number for you, as we’re still kind of formulating everything for ’11, but I just want to get that comment in there, that if you have 100 communities with 10 lots or less, which is plus or minus what we had with part of the combination, you’re going to have a lot of community count burn off that is not necessarily as relevant as if it were a lot of your core communities.  So agree with you that community count is important, and certainly something we’re watching.  We have been acquiring land, we’re trying to be prudent about it.  We don’t want to acquire anything that would ultimately get impaired, so we’re trying to be very cautious.  But nevertheless, we are finding success on distressed assets.

There’s been, across the competitors, one builder even said that they’re roughly equal, gross margins and new communities versus older ones; others had said even 5 to 600 bpts more.  How are you coming out on that, and again, pretty early to guess, but what do you see the percent of closings in ’11?  Even in rough terms, just to give us a ballpark from those new communities.

There is no way to give you a very short answer to this.  It is very complicated, because when you build houses, over periods of time they fall on different years, the insurance affects it by what you could have bought for insurance in those particular years. So you know, let’s say some of them were back in 2004, 2005, you know, you could have a claim in those years, and then you could have a different impact on an actuarial basis because of the way you bought insurance in those particular years. So really, the tail in our business is a lot of it’s mandated by state governments, and so you have a tail on it that could last ten years. So with that, you’ve got claims that can come in at basically any point in time, but some of our more severe ones were ’05, ’06 timeframe.  ’04 timeframe seemed to be at the peak, some of them also correlate to when the market started to turn down, and again, correlate those last four years, as pricing has come down significantly, we’ve seen the increase in the number of claims.  I’m not saying those are absolutely related, but when you look at what’s happened in the four years, as prices and values have come down, you also see a significant increase in the number of claims.  So you know, it is a bit of art and science when you go through this, sort of throw it in the black box and come up with it.  But clearly, when we have issues, we’re certainly addressing them, and then some of them we’re more proactive on, which in itself creates a little bit more liability from us, because we do that.  So all of our approach to this, as well as the operating procedures, the way we bought insurance, the way the claims are coming in, and there’s some for instance, where all of a sudden you’ve got rain in areas where you haven’t had rain before.  Significant rain, again, not an excuse, but standards that were set for construction standards at a particular point in time may not be appropriate given the changes that we’re seeing there.  I know I’m not being specific, but there’s a lot of different items that make that up, and they’re not easily just carved out to one little piece that created it.

Let me see if I can help a little bit more as well. It’s important to understand when Roger was talking earlier in his script about some of the changed in timeframes for the estimates, etc., when you have a spike in experience level here, and you use a different timeframe for estimates, that can dramatically affect the actuarial estimate.  So again, depending on claims levels going forward, it’s possible that the reserves that we have now posted, would be well within the tolerance level and cover those for some period of time.  It’s also possible they have to get adjusted, depending on what happens. It’s kind of like the mortgage reserves that we posted in Q2, based on what we saw then, and if you look at the slides, we accompany the presentation with, you notice that our experience level went up slightly around the Q2 timeframe, and since then it’s been trending down a little bit. So I just point out that there’s not necessarily a direct correlation in what you’ve just taken and what you’re going to take.  You obviously adjust these assumptions with hopes that you’ve now got it covered for the foreseeable future, but as Roger indicated, it’s a tough science to nail down.

I’m wondering how your perspective has changed.

Again, you know, most of them are incurred but not reported. What that means is that the house is already built, so you must have a claim out there that hasn’t been identified yet, so it must be there.  That’s what that means, incurred but not reported.  Now, it wouldn’t be for future homes that you might build that it’s for, everything that would be sort of in your historical database, if you will. So we’re not projecting anything that we haven’t built yet. Now what this does in, actuarially an assumption that because you had one, you should have another one.  Again, it’s sort of like the hundred year flood. It doesn’t mean it’s necessarily going to happen, it doesn’t mean necessarily that two quarters from now, or even next quarter, we may have a different view based on our experience.  But given the experience that we saw develop, you know, I’d say over the last three or four years, where typically you might smooth it over ten years, that’s actuarially how you take a look at those things.  Again, there’s a lot of judgment, a lot of assumptions that go behind that that create that thinking.  So I wouldn’t necessarily say that you’d see really anything come to margins, with just SG&A and insurance, you could possibly see a reversal and a reserve.  If we could determine that the size of that reserve was not sustainable because we’re not seeing any more development happen in the homes that we built, then you would adjust that reserve downward and take it back. But other than that, changing business practices or anything else like that could benefit margins, but nothing directly from the insurance charge that you took.

That you guys would be taking a larger reserve up front?  That is my first question, and then my sort of data questions are what is your DTA at the end of the quarter, and also what was the number of specs that you guys sold in the quarter?

Again, that would be a change in conditions and circumstances based on how development happens. So you know, each quarter we have been taking charges. Q1 we took about $10 million, Q2 we took another $10 million, in charges relative to this.  Again, the development happened as we came into Q3.  As we moved through Q3, we saw some of these claims develop, gave rise to taking a look at our assumption, how well we thought those assumptions were based, and then making the adjustments to those.  Some of that is changing methodology as well, trying to look at a shorter period than a longer period as a trend.  So again, I would say that you shouldn’t see those type of charges going forward. As far as the DTA, Mike?

A significant portion of that is the cost to consolidate two areas and the division moves we made in three geographic areas.  I don’t have the exact split, but you know, it’s probably more than 25 of 30% of the number, maybe less than 50% of the number. A big portion is at the corporate office.  Not a significant change in marketing spend or anything like that. Quite frankly, what we’ve asked ourselves is given the state of business we have at this kind of run rate, if we were starting a company from scratch, what would we build from the ground up, as opposed to looking at it from the standpoint of what we’ve had through the last several years, and that’s resulted in some significant choices that we’ve made on what’s directly adding value today, given the size of our business.  So I agree with you, it’s a big number.  I will tell you it’s very achievable.  We’re not putting that number out there to miss it, and we fully intend to get there. We have actions that have already been undertaken to get us there, overall. So a big portion of it is in the corporate office, Carl, and when you look at all the different pieces that go into it, it might be bigger than you think, but that, combined with  the field gets us there.

Yes, what we’re looking at is what channels they come back through.  I don’t have, specifically, the number one came out of that or not, but I would imagine that out of the pool of everything we’ve done, there may be some that come out of that.  Again, depending on what the underwriting was at that point in time. So when I look at the direct investor, that’s where the guarantee was, and then the bank itself, again because we have a guarantee with an investor, he’s covered through that bank as well. But the bank is the first stop and then CTX Mortgage would be the second stop.

We’re very comfortable that our reserves are adequate, given everything that we’ve seen in total without breaking it out specifically one investor at a time.

The biggest thing to factor in here though, is the frequency with which it came up. The frequency that came up was significantly different than we had seen in any prior quarter, thus the significant not only direct impact, if you will, but then the actuarial change is the vast majority of it, overall.  We certainly did not see it coming, it was unforeseen, but it was not one individual project.  It was a number of them.  Why they all flowed in one particular quarter we don’t know.  We’re certainly examining everything we did, but as I answered to someone earlier, we’re not aware of anything we did different, frankly, than anyone else. Either from sub-contractors we employed or construction techniques or what have you, hopefully it’s just one of those things that happened that won’t occur again, but that’s why the big jump there was based on the frequency, not one particular community.
