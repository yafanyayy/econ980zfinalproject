When we held our call just about one year ago, I outlined three priorities that would drive our actions",773,"Thanks, Ahmed, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning to review our performance for 2009 and also to talk about our plans going forward. When we held our call just about one year ago, I outlined three priorities that would drive our actions throughout 2009. As you may remember, at the time we held the call, we're facing pretty volatile financial markets, and our ability to raise new capital from the markets was unclear. Therefore, our first priority was to manage our liquidity and the cash flow generation from our operating businesses throughout the year, so as to be able to meet the investment needs for our construction pipeline, as well as to selectively invest in new opportunities and our pipeline of advanced development projects. The second priority was to manage our construction program effectively, so as to bring new plants online that would start generating additional cash flows for our portfolio going forward. And our third priority was to pursue development projects selectively that represented low-cost options to invest in value accretive transactions. Our construction pipeline delivered good growth for 2012, the one [ph] that's create the opportunities to deliver attractive growth and the value of our stock beyond 2012.As I look back to what we achieved in 2009, I think we did a reasonably good job in terms of achieving the results that we targeted. As in the past, we benefited from our geographic diversity but more importantly, we benefited from the commitment of the 27,000 people in AES businesses around the globe to rally to hit our targets in a very difficult economic environment. Starting with liquidity at the AES current level, we funded approximately $400 million of equity in our growth investments in 2009, reduced our debt by approximately $200 million and ended 2009 with liquidity balance of $1.26 billion. Going into 2010, we expect to fund the already approved equity investments of approximately $400 million and repay approximately $200 million of maturing debt. We also expect committed asset sales to generate approximately $350 million, an additional cash to parent, although a bit less than half of this would be used to pay down debt to maintain credit neutrality. Adding to that, the expected proceeds of $1.58 billion from the CIC transaction plus free cash flow to AES, we would have approximately $2 billion of cash available at the parent level for new investments in 2010. In terms of our performance in construction, we brought 11 projects with combined capacity of 1,300 megawatts in the commercial operation to date. This included wind projects in the U.S., Europe and China, coal-fired plants in Chile and gas and oil-fired plants in Europe, Middle East and Africa. There was one major disappointment for us on the construction front, however, with our Campiche coal-fired plant in Chile, having its construction suspended with issues associated with zoning, and I'll provide more detail on that later in the call.I'll also talk more about our development activities after Victoria covers the financial results but we did add a significant number of megawatts to our pipeline during this year, particularly with respect to renewable energy projects. Many of you will also recall that we held an Investor Day in May of last year, where we introduced the proportional free cash flow metric, which many of you had encouraged us to do. This is basically a measure of our share of the free cash flows generated by our businesses, less the associated maintenance CapEx. This is the metrics that we believe is a good indicator of value, the one on which we place an intense focus. As you can see from our published financial results, we saw the proportional free cash flow increased to $899 million in 2009 from $466 million in 2008. In addition, our cash distributions from subsidiaries reached a record level of $1.25 billion for 2009, and we saw both of these measures increase despite all of the challenges we faced in the global economic environment. I'd also like to note that providing this proportional cash flow metric provides additional visibility into our financial performance, as we continue to see many one-time non-cash items that are captured by GAAP EPS, in the many cases, our adjusted EPS numbers. And as Victoria reviews our results for the year, she will discuss some of these items. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Victoria who will review the results in detail for the last year and provide guidance looking forward. Following her comments, I'll talk more about our construction development pipelines, as well as our outlook and priorities looking forward. Victoria?"

We met or exceeded guidance metrics with all of our key cash flow measures closing the year at the high-end of the range. We also exceeded our guidance for proportional free cash flow as well as adjusted EPS, particularly when adjusted for our businesses in Oman and Pakistan which have been moved into discontinued operations, as we expect to close these asset sales later this spring. We're also pleased with subsidiary distributions of $1.25 billion, the highest level we've ever achieved, a true testament to the renewed focus on improving day sales outstanding or DSO, efficiency efforts and expense reductions across all functions and businesses. These results not only help generate increase cash to the bottom-line but also helped us to offset foreign currency headwinds and depress demand in many geographies impacted by the recession, particularly in North America. Before I address the numbers specifically, let me provide some context for the types of operational improvement initiatives, through which we continue to maximize value and improved margins this past year. Here are some specifics. In the Philippines, our 660-megawatt Masinloc facility focused this year on building value in three key areas: increase production, reduce exposure to the spot market and improve plant operation. During 2009, improved plant and grid availability helped to increase the plant's production by 62%. Additionally, in line with our strategy to reduce price volatility at the plant, we decreased our reliance on the spot market by selling more power through medium term contracts, with contracted volume increasing 66% to two gigawatt hours in 2009.  Finally, we were able to improve the plant heat rate by 13% due to higher dispatch, as well as a series of technical improvements we implemented over the past year. As a result, Masinloc's gross margin improved by approximately $100 million during 2009. Another example of the financial benefits we have derived from operational improvements this year is at TEG, our 230-megawatt petroleum coal-fired plant in Mexico. Within two years of the acquisition, we have demonstrably improved the operations of the plant. By year-end 2009, availability increased from 73% to 93%, an overall generation output increased by 36% to almost two gigawatt hours. Plant heat rate also improved by 7%. These improvements collectively represent more than $25 million of annualized returns that have now been unlocked there. With these kinds of improvements in place, we were able to produce strong cash flows throughout 2009. Effective working capital management and our continued efforts to reduce our permanent cost structure by $150 million versus the prior year also contributed to cash flow. Reductions include the benefits of our centralization of functions or hobbing, as well as creation of procurement and fuel purchasing synergies.Improvements in working capital were primarily driven by faster collection of receivables, particularly at our Generation businesses in Chile and Pakistan, as well as lower investment in fuel inventories as the result of the decline in fuel prices. As Paul stated earlier, our global diversity stabilized our financial results in a period of extreme market volatility. Although we experienced lower demand in certain markets, we benefited from positive trends in certain businesses outside the U.S. For example in Brazil, where demands within the first nine months of the year was down 1%, we saw a volume increase of 3.6% in the first quarter as that economy emerged more quickly from the recession, led by the growth in the industrial and commercial sectors. In fact, early indicators on 2010 follow a similar upward trajectory, as evidenced by the year-over-year increase of energy sold in Brazil for the month of January of over 4%. Likewise in northern Chile, where the copper mining industry is a large power consumer, we saw 3.6% increase in demand. There, our TermoAndes gas-fired plant was able to increase its production by 45% compared to prior year as demand grew. In central Chile, profitability also improved due to a significant decline in fuel prices combined with the benefits of our new, more efficient plants such as Guacolda 3 and Santa Lidia coming online, which helped to reduced the marginal cost of production by 40%. By contrast and consistent with what the industry has seen across North America for much of the past 12 to 18 months, our operations in New York was adversely affected by lower natural gas prices throughout the year, which declined by more than 50% from 2008. The decline in gas prices resulted in lower demand for coal based generation. As a result, volume at our New York plants decline by 20% compared to 2008. During the second half of 2009, when gas prices were higher than today, we were able to increase forward sales to nearly 50% of expected generation in 2010, hedging somewhat against future price volatility. Likewise, our utility in Indiana experienced a decrease in volume of 6%, similar to what was experienced by other U.S. utilities during the recession. Now let's discuss some specific results for the fourth quarter. On a consolidated basis, our operating cash flow was $316 million versus $609 million in 2008, which was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis when excluding the Brazilian receipts payment acceleration. As you may recall, last quarter, we mentioned a one-time tax payment in Brazil during the quarter. This payment of $331 million was made in the fourth quarter and is the primary driver of the lower year-over-year cash flow, which will be offset in 2010. Subsidiary distributions were $296 million in the fourth quarter. This was in line with our expectations, which puts us at the midpoint of our full year guidance range for this metric. Now turning to several other key cash metrics, which we believe continue to demonstrate the health and stability of the business overall. At the parent level, our capital structure worked to pay down and refinance debt over the prior several quarters has put us in a very comfortable position, as we now have only $240 million in parent debt maturing in 2010. This is very manageable given our parent liquidity of $1.3 billion, including $677 million in cash. We see similar trends at our subsidiaries, where we have $2.7 billion of liquidity including $1.1 billion in cash, sufficient to pay down about $1.8 billion of non-recourse debt maturities due within the next 12 months, should we determine refinancing if they are not cost-effective.Now turning to earnings. For the quarter, EPS was benefited from improved operating performance at our businesses in the Philippines, a lower effective tax rate due to nontaxable earnings at our Brazilian businesses and favorable foreign currency such as the Brazilian real, which appreciated 24% in the fourth quarter of 2009 relative to the same quarter in 2008. Our consolidated gross margin increased $163 million or 24% relative to 2008. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates benefited the quarter by $90 million. Additionally, our Masinloc plant in the Philippines continued to realize the benefit of performance improvements initiative. These gains were partially offset by lower energy sales at our merchant plants in New York, as I just discussed. On a proportional basis, we earned $481 million of gross margin, an increase of $112 million or fully 30% over 2008. Adjusted EPS increased $0.01 to $0.22 due to favorable gross margin, as well as lower effective tax rate. These gains were offset in the quarter by a non-cash charge related to hypothetical liquidation cost and our non-controlling interest calculation at several U.S. Wind businesses of approximately $0.04. These accounting estimates changes do not have an impact to the life of the projects as they will reverse in 2012 and beyond. The quarter also achieved a lower effective tax rate of 23% versus 37% in the same quarter of 2008, due in part to nontaxable earnings at our Brazilian businesses. Now let's recap our results for the full year and how they compared to 2009 guidance.As I mentioned earlier, I'm pleased to report our full year results met or beat our key guidance metrics. In particular, I was very pleased with the cash results for both the consolidated and proportional metrics. Our consolidated operating cash flow of $2.2 billion place us at the top of our 2009 guidance range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. Maintenance CapEx is $622 million, was near the low end of our guidance of $600 million to $700 million. As a result, our consolidated free cash flow exceeded our guidance by approximately $40 million. Likewise, our proportional cash flow metrics reflect similar results. Proportional operating cash flow of $1.3 billion was also within our guidance range. After adjusting for proportional maintenance CapEx of $438 million, our proportional free cash flow was $899 million for the year, exceeding our guidance by approximately $25 million. Subsidiary distributions to the parent for the year were $1.25 billion. This is consistent with our expectations and an increase of almost $200 million versus 2008. Consolidated gross margins of $3.5 billion fell just shy of our guidance of $3.55 billion to $3.65 billion . However, adjusting for the Oman and Pakistan asset sales which have been moved to discontinued operations, we were well within the guidance range. On the same basis, proportional gross margin of $2 billion is also within the guidance range of $2.1 billion to $2.15 billion. Now turning to adjusted EPS. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 was within the range of $1.07 to $1.11. However, adjusting for the $0.05 negative impact to EPS associated with discontinued operations, as well as the $0.04 negative non-cash charge for the change in hypothetical liquidation calculations for wind, we were actually above the range. In closing, we are very pleased with the results for 2009, particularly in the context of a very challenging macroeconomic environment. Now I'll spend a few minutes reviewing our outlook for 2010 and 2011.  Before I begin, please keep in mind that the following discussions does not reflect the impacts of the pending CIC equity transaction nor the wind joint venture, either with respect to the receipt of cash or the issuance of shares. That said, our guidance does assume that our Pakistan and Oman asset sale transactions closed in the first half of 2010 and they are on track to do so. In addition, we will also receive a $102 million payment from our Kazakhstan termination agreement and approximately $150 million of proceeds from our Brazil wind investment both of which will add to our liquidity in 2010. All of these items will be reflected in our investing cash flows but not in operating cash, so it will have no impact on adjusted EPS or proportional free cash flow. Overall, our 2010 cash flow metrics are at or above our previous guidance, while adjusted earnings per share and subsidiary distributions are lower due to number of drivers we've already seen in 2009. While we've experienced favorable foreign currency movements since the month of May 2009 guidance update, there are several offsetting factors that I will outline in a moment.Let me provide a little more detail around the 2010 guidance first and how it trends relative to 2009. Our proportional operating cash flow guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion is an increase over 2009 actuals of $1.3 billion. Likewise, guidance and proportional free cash flow of $900 million to $1.1 billion is also an increase when compared to 2009. For subsidiary distributions, we have lowered the high end of the range by $100 million to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. This decrease reflects our anticipation of lower dividends from Hungary and New York, as well as the loss of dividends from Pakistan and Oman. These decreases are expected to be partially offset by improved operations in Chile and Brazil.Our current 2010 adjusted EPS guidance range is $1 to $1.05, which is lower than our prior guidance by approximately $0.08. As I've previously discussed, a portion of this is driven by the non-cash hypothetical liquidation tax revision at certain U.S. wind businesses and the pending sale of our Oman and Pakistan assets whose earnings are now reported in discontinued operations. In addition, lower demand in the U.S. wholesale markets, the effective spot prices on Hungary's operations and rising business development costs all negatively impact earnings as well. These items are somewhat offset by favorable foreign currency impact and the early stages of contribution from 1,500 megawatts coming online in new projects by year end.When compared to 2009, the outlook for this year from an operational perspective is roughly in line with prior trends. That said, certain benefits that we realized in 2009 will not recur this year, which by definition negatively impacts year-over-year comparables. For example, the earnings of $0.12 from our Kazakhstan performance bonus will not recur in 2010 or 2011. Likewise, the significantly lower effective tax rate we saw in 2009 of approximately 26% is expected to return to a more normalized midrange of 30% -- in the 30 in 2010. We also believe that the merchant plants in New York and Hungary will continue to be impacted by lower demand and spot prices. In addition, we expect weaker demand for our North American utility IPL through 2011 leading to negative growth rate. Finally, we will spend more on business development as our efforts to advance in our development pipeline accelerates. Now turning to 2011.  Continuing the trend of stable and growing cash flows, our cash flow metrics are at or above the prior guidance. That said, adjusted EPS is expected to be similarly impacted by nearly the same set of drivers as 2010 but offset to a greater degree by 800 additional megawatts coming in line by year end. As a result, 2011 adjusted EPS expectations decreased by $0.05 from a range $1.20 to $1.30 to a new range of $1.15 to $1.25. Barring any significant macroeconomic shift, what we would have projected to be favorable currency and commodity moves in 2011 are expected to be largely offset by $0.12 headwinds related to lower capacity fees and lower demand for several of our generational plants worldwide particularly in Hungary.Similar to 2010, we also lowered expectations by $0.04 again due to the impact of the non-cash charge related to taxes for the hypothetical liquidation of non-controlling interest at several of our U.S. Wind businesses, as well as lower production at our wind facilities in Texas due to curtailment and lower wind resources. We also anticipate a $0.03 higher spending for business development cost.And finally, we're excluding for now the previously projected $0.03 earnings uptick from Campiche, our 270-megawatt project in Chile will be a temporarily suspended construction pending resolution of the dispute over the environmental permit there. As I mentioned earlier, our guidance does not include any dilution or benefit related to the CIC equity transaction. Our plan is to deploy these proceeds into value-accretive development projects or acquisitions once the transaction is closed. While this will not all occur overnight, the expected dilution in 2010 ranges from $0.07 to $0.09. The low end of this range assumes either a $1.5 billion debt pay down or the midyear investment of $500 million and the mid-teens return project with the remaining $1 billion split evenly between cash and debt pay down. The upper end of the range assumes to only pay down $500 million in debt in the near term and retain the remainder in cash for investment in our pipeline of development projects or strategic acquisitions.In summary, 2009 was a good year. We achieved our financial goals while at the same time, laying the foundations for continued growth in 2010 with stable and cost-effective platform on which to scale. We're comfortable that we have the right people and plans in place to ensure the highest levels of execution as we pursue these investments. With that, let me turn it back over to Paul."

As we look out into 2010, our priorities remain similar to those that we outlined a year ago. One, strengthen liquidity and cash flow generation, so as to be able to execute on investment opportunities. Two, successfully build out our remaining construction pipeline and three, deploy our liquidity to value accretive M&A and Greenfield development opportunities. Let me now talk a bit about our construction program.As I mentioned earlier, we've already completed 1,300 megawatts of our construction pipeline but we also have another 2,000 megawatts that will come online by the end of 2011. This capacity includes wind projects in Europe and China, solar projects in Europe, coal projects in Chile and Bulgaria and hydro projects in Latin America and Turkey. One project that isn't included in the above numbers is our 270-megawatt Campiche project in Chile. Work in this project remains suspended as we continue to seek resolution of the permitting issues that we discussed during previous calls. Since our last report, the governor of Chile has resolved the zoning issue related to the project. We subsequently applied for new environmental permit in January, which was approved on February 22. While we're encouraged by the developments, there are few additional conditions to resolve before we can restart construction. These include an appeal period, as well as securing final construction permits. And once we have all the permits, we intend to recommence construction. Now I'd like to give you an update on our view of the growth opportunities and some related points.It's worth noting that many of the markets where we have been developing Greenfield projects have continued to see increased demand for power unlike here in the United States. We also continue to see high growth rates in demand for renewable projects globally. Because of this, we continued developing projects in both renewable energy and in geographic areas with continued needs for new thermal generating capacity. For example in Asia, we have a pipeline of more than 4,000 megawatts including two 1200-megawatt coal-fired projects in India, a 1200-megawatt coal-fired project in Vietnam and an expansion of our 600-megawatt Masinloc facility in the Philippines. We're also pursuing wind, hydro and solar projects in Asia, which is becoming an increasingly robust market for renewable energy. We also continued development of other renewable projects globally through the various incentives in different countries. In wind, we grew our pipeline to 1,200 megawatts of projects in advanced stages of development in the U.S., Europe and China. In AES Solar Energy, out joint venture with Riverstone which has an advanced pipeline of 600 megawatts focused on Europe and now to an increasing extent, is looking towards the United States and India, where markets are improving due to the increased levels of government support. We currently have a total of over 9,000 megawatts of Greenfield projects, both renewables and thermal power in advanced stages of development. Of these, the majority of the opportunities are in Asia in terms of location and 42% are in renewable energy sectors in terms of fuel types. In addition, once we have the capital available from our asset sales and the CIC transaction, we will be positioned to pursue select M&A opportunities, where the cash flows and earnings will be more immediate than Greenfield construction projects. In terms of our pending equity transaction with CIC, in which it will invest $1.58 billion in exchange for an approximate 15% interest in AES, we're making good progress with securing the required regulatory approvals. We'll keep you posted on our progress in the coming weeks. And regarding the letter of intent with CIC to purchase an interest in our Wind business, we're also making good progress. Our expectation is that the transaction could close during the second quarter of 2010. If successfully executed, this transaction would result in an investment of $571 million in exchange for a 35% interest in AES Wind Generation. I do want to point out however, that the LOI is non-binding and subject to due diligence which is currently ongoing. In closing, we had a good year in 2009. We did what we set out to do and have positioned ourselves to capitalize on attractive opportunities in our industry globally. We have a strong pipeline of projects in construction and in development. We also have the capital needed to execute our Greenfield program and selectively pursue attractive M&A opportunities, and we'll be keeping you updated as the various opportunities progress over time. Thanks again for joining us today and now we'll open up the call for questions and answers. And Julie, would you please open up the lines for questions?"

I think we're looking for M&A opportunities wherever we think we can see good value, whether that be the United States or Asia or somewhere else. But I do think also what -- as I see us developing, what's really happening is the real opportunities for us are in renewable energy in the developed markets, Europe and the U.S. We're seeing that with wind and solar and we're seeing in terms of thermal power, the traditional coal-fired , gas-fired power plants, the biggest demand for that is coming in the developing markets particularly in places like Asia. We're also seeing in Asia the ability to get some -- and Latin America to get some small, medium-sized hydro plants than we do renewables. So I think you're going to continue to see us do more in the developed markets in the renewables sector. We're seeing a lot of good growth in wind, that's one of the reasons why we wanted to pursue additional capital from CIC for that investment because it's going to be a big consumer of capital for us. In addition to solar, in solar we're just seeing a lot of opportunities and the U.S. market has really picked up to where we believe there are attractive deals out there now with the utility scale PV projects in the United States. We're already seeing that in Europe where we have projects in construction there. The renewables sector, I think, the other thing we saw over the last year was how that has now expanded beyond the borders of the developed world. So we're seeing the platforms we set up here in the U.S. and Europe with respect to renewables are now -- we're able to expand those to the other countries. I think it's very small right now but I would expect over the next five years, you're going to see that expand considerably. So I think that's going to help us with respect to growth also. But I do think we're looking at just -- in terms of the Greenfield versus M&A, it's probably going to be a balance, I'd say 50/50 between Greenfield and M&A opportunities. Again, it's going to depend on the returns we can get but that's how I would see it playing out, it's probably about half and half in terms of deploying new capital."

So in case they've ended up being a little bit higher. A lot of depends on where the wind resource turns out, how it turns out to be relative to projections. But what I've say that's the kind of the range that we've seen. With solar projects, with our joint venture with Riverstone, we've set a hurdle rate of -- I believe it's north of 15%, we're looking for 15% to 17% type of returns for those projects. We've been able to find those in Europe. We also think with the incentive in place, we may be able to get some solar projects that will come into that range in the United States. What we're really focused on is how can you reduce the costs of building those plants. What we found is, one, the cost of panels has been coming down but also the cost of constructing those plants, the actual construction cost putting them together is a significant amount that we think could be optimized. So Bob Hemphill and his team  had spent a lot of time trying to figure out how we do that, but we think those returns can be in the 15% to 17% range at least for right now. And in terms of development time, the wind projects are probably shorter development times than the thermal projects but they can still take a long time with respect to wind studies and getting environmental permits. Solar project are a lot easier. They can get done more quickly in terms of permits just because they don't have as much impact, also in terms of getting them built because you can get those things built through out the rest of the year. So when you take that on to account, renewables have a big advantage in terms of time. You start spending money to the time you get it back but particularly in solar projects, we're seeing that."

We're seeing more of those just because now people recognize that we have CIC's capital coming in. Plus we also have CIC as a potential partner in some of these transactions if they have adequate size. They indicated a strong interest in co-investing with us in transactions where there are opportunities. So I do think there's going to be a lot of good opportunities out there.

So we basically kept those -- we want to keep those projects moving forward but some of them was on a life support because we wouldn't want to rush them through. Now that we have a capital we can move them more quickly. The key things, we'll start with Vietnam, the critical things are to get the power purchase agreement signed with the government, which we believe should happen in the next couple of months but the basic  terms have been agreed. And the next key item there would be getting the financing for the project, which we think we'll probably take into the early part of 2011. I think with India, there's been a project, it's a mine melt [ph] project. The key items there to get the final permits and land rights that we need and to get the coal allocations to cover the coal we might need during the construction, early parts of the project before the coal mine is finally developed and then it's going to need the financing of it. We think in both cases the financing is doable. I think it's the one area that we're going to test out very quickly but it's really getting probably in the second half of the year, we'll start that financing process in earnest as we start moving those projects forward. Since we get in India, the projects are getting financed and the domestic financial markets are very strong and should not be a problem getting a financing for India. I think with Vietnam, it's going to depend on the multilateral sources of capital that would be available for this project, or whether if we go for Chinese equipment there will be Chinese financing available for the project. So a couple of different ways we'll be looking at that. We're also expecting that Vietnam will take on a partner for that in Asia. Somebody who would also -- that would probably help with getting the financing either from the export credit agencies whether it be Japan or Korea or possibly China."

When we held our call just about one year ago, I outlined three priorities that would drive our actions",773,"Thanks, Ahmed, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning to review our performance for 2009 and also to talk about our plans going forward. When we held our call just about one year ago, I outlined three priorities that would drive our actions throughout 2009. As you may remember, at the time we held the call, we're facing pretty volatile financial markets, and our ability to raise new capital from the markets was unclear. Therefore, our first priority was to manage our liquidity and the cash flow generation from our operating businesses throughout the year, so as to be able to meet the investment needs for our construction pipeline, as well as to selectively invest in new opportunities and our pipeline of advanced development projects. The second priority was to manage our construction program effectively, so as to bring new plants online that would start generating additional cash flows for our portfolio going forward. And our third priority was to pursue development projects selectively that represented low-cost options to invest in value accretive transactions. Our construction pipeline delivered good growth for 2012, the one [ph] that's create the opportunities to deliver attractive growth and the value of our stock beyond 2012.As I look back to what we achieved in 2009, I think we did a reasonably good job in terms of achieving the results that we targeted. As in the past, we benefited from our geographic diversity but more importantly, we benefited from the commitment of the 27,000 people in AES businesses around the globe to rally to hit our targets in a very difficult economic environment. Starting with liquidity at the AES current level, we funded approximately $400 million of equity in our growth investments in 2009, reduced our debt by approximately $200 million and ended 2009 with liquidity balance of $1.26 billion. Going into 2010, we expect to fund the already approved equity investments of approximately $400 million and repay approximately $200 million of maturing debt. We also expect committed asset sales to generate approximately $350 million, an additional cash to parent, although a bit less than half of this would be used to pay down debt to maintain credit neutrality. Adding to that, the expected proceeds of $1.58 billion from the CIC transaction plus free cash flow to AES, we would have approximately $2 billion of cash available at the parent level for new investments in 2010. In terms of our performance in construction, we brought 11 projects with combined capacity of 1,300 megawatts in the commercial operation to date. This included wind projects in the U.S., Europe and China, coal-fired plants in Chile and gas and oil-fired plants in Europe, Middle East and Africa. There was one major disappointment for us on the construction front, however, with our Campiche coal-fired plant in Chile, having its construction suspended with issues associated with zoning, and I'll provide more detail on that later in the call.I'll also talk more about our development activities after Victoria covers the financial results but we did add a significant number of megawatts to our pipeline during this year, particularly with respect to renewable energy projects. Many of you will also recall that we held an Investor Day in May of last year, where we introduced the proportional free cash flow metric, which many of you had encouraged us to do. This is basically a measure of our share of the free cash flows generated by our businesses, less the associated maintenance CapEx. This is the metrics that we believe is a good indicator of value, the one on which we place an intense focus. As you can see from our published financial results, we saw the proportional free cash flow increased to $899 million in 2009 from $466 million in 2008. In addition, our cash distributions from subsidiaries reached a record level of $1.25 billion for 2009, and we saw both of these measures increase despite all of the challenges we faced in the global economic environment. I'd also like to note that providing this proportional cash flow metric provides additional visibility into our financial performance, as we continue to see many one-time non-cash items that are captured by GAAP EPS, in the many cases, our adjusted EPS numbers. And as Victoria reviews our results for the year, she will discuss some of these items. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Victoria who will review the results in detail for the last year and provide guidance looking forward. Following her comments, I'll talk more about our construction development pipelines, as well as our outlook and priorities looking forward. Victoria?"

We met or exceeded guidance metrics with all of our key cash flow measures closing the year at the high-end of the range. We also exceeded our guidance for proportional free cash flow as well as adjusted EPS, particularly when adjusted for our businesses in Oman and Pakistan which have been moved into discontinued operations, as we expect to close these asset sales later this spring. We're also pleased with subsidiary distributions of $1.25 billion, the highest level we've ever achieved, a true testament to the renewed focus on improving day sales outstanding or DSO, efficiency efforts and expense reductions across all functions and businesses. These results not only help generate increase cash to the bottom-line but also helped us to offset foreign currency headwinds and depress demand in many geographies impacted by the recession, particularly in North America. Before I address the numbers specifically, let me provide some context for the types of operational improvement initiatives, through which we continue to maximize value and improved margins this past year. Here are some specifics. In the Philippines, our 660-megawatt Masinloc facility focused this year on building value in three key areas: increase production, reduce exposure to the spot market and improve plant operation. During 2009, improved plant and grid availability helped to increase the plant's production by 62%. Additionally, in line with our strategy to reduce price volatility at the plant, we decreased our reliance on the spot market by selling more power through medium term contracts, with contracted volume increasing 66% to two gigawatt hours in 2009.  Finally, we were able to improve the plant heat rate by 13% due to higher dispatch, as well as a series of technical improvements we implemented over the past year. As a result, Masinloc's gross margin improved by approximately $100 million during 2009. Another example of the financial benefits we have derived from operational improvements this year is at TEG, our 230-megawatt petroleum coal-fired plant in Mexico. Within two years of the acquisition, we have demonstrably improved the operations of the plant. By year-end 2009, availability increased from 73% to 93%, an overall generation output increased by 36% to almost two gigawatt hours. Plant heat rate also improved by 7%. These improvements collectively represent more than $25 million of annualized returns that have now been unlocked there. With these kinds of improvements in place, we were able to produce strong cash flows throughout 2009. Effective working capital management and our continued efforts to reduce our permanent cost structure by $150 million versus the prior year also contributed to cash flow. Reductions include the benefits of our centralization of functions or hobbing, as well as creation of procurement and fuel purchasing synergies.Improvements in working capital were primarily driven by faster collection of receivables, particularly at our Generation businesses in Chile and Pakistan, as well as lower investment in fuel inventories as the result of the decline in fuel prices. As Paul stated earlier, our global diversity stabilized our financial results in a period of extreme market volatility. Although we experienced lower demand in certain markets, we benefited from positive trends in certain businesses outside the U.S. For example in Brazil, where demands within the first nine months of the year was down 1%, we saw a volume increase of 3.6% in the first quarter as that economy emerged more quickly from the recession, led by the growth in the industrial and commercial sectors. In fact, early indicators on 2010 follow a similar upward trajectory, as evidenced by the year-over-year increase of energy sold in Brazil for the month of January of over 4%. Likewise in northern Chile, where the copper mining industry is a large power consumer, we saw 3.6% increase in demand. There, our TermoAndes gas-fired plant was able to increase its production by 45% compared to prior year as demand grew. In central Chile, profitability also improved due to a significant decline in fuel prices combined with the benefits of our new, more efficient plants such as Guacolda 3 and Santa Lidia coming online, which helped to reduced the marginal cost of production by 40%. By contrast and consistent with what the industry has seen across North America for much of the past 12 to 18 months, our operations in New York was adversely affected by lower natural gas prices throughout the year, which declined by more than 50% from 2008. The decline in gas prices resulted in lower demand for coal based generation. As a result, volume at our New York plants decline by 20% compared to 2008. During the second half of 2009, when gas prices were higher than today, we were able to increase forward sales to nearly 50% of expected generation in 2010, hedging somewhat against future price volatility. Likewise, our utility in Indiana experienced a decrease in volume of 6%, similar to what was experienced by other U.S. utilities during the recession. Now let's discuss some specific results for the fourth quarter. On a consolidated basis, our operating cash flow was $316 million versus $609 million in 2008, which was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis when excluding the Brazilian receipts payment acceleration. As you may recall, last quarter, we mentioned a one-time tax payment in Brazil during the quarter. This payment of $331 million was made in the fourth quarter and is the primary driver of the lower year-over-year cash flow, which will be offset in 2010. Subsidiary distributions were $296 million in the fourth quarter. This was in line with our expectations, which puts us at the midpoint of our full year guidance range for this metric. Now turning to several other key cash metrics, which we believe continue to demonstrate the health and stability of the business overall. At the parent level, our capital structure worked to pay down and refinance debt over the prior several quarters has put us in a very comfortable position, as we now have only $240 million in parent debt maturing in 2010. This is very manageable given our parent liquidity of $1.3 billion, including $677 million in cash. We see similar trends at our subsidiaries, where we have $2.7 billion of liquidity including $1.1 billion in cash, sufficient to pay down about $1.8 billion of non-recourse debt maturities due within the next 12 months, should we determine refinancing if they are not cost-effective.Now turning to earnings. For the quarter, EPS was benefited from improved operating performance at our businesses in the Philippines, a lower effective tax rate due to nontaxable earnings at our Brazilian businesses and favorable foreign currency such as the Brazilian real, which appreciated 24% in the fourth quarter of 2009 relative to the same quarter in 2008. Our consolidated gross margin increased $163 million or 24% relative to 2008. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates benefited the quarter by $90 million. Additionally, our Masinloc plant in the Philippines continued to realize the benefit of performance improvements initiative. These gains were partially offset by lower energy sales at our merchant plants in New York, as I just discussed. On a proportional basis, we earned $481 million of gross margin, an increase of $112 million or fully 30% over 2008. Adjusted EPS increased $0.01 to $0.22 due to favorable gross margin, as well as lower effective tax rate. These gains were offset in the quarter by a non-cash charge related to hypothetical liquidation cost and our non-controlling interest calculation at several U.S. Wind businesses of approximately $0.04. These accounting estimates changes do not have an impact to the life of the projects as they will reverse in 2012 and beyond. The quarter also achieved a lower effective tax rate of 23% versus 37% in the same quarter of 2008, due in part to nontaxable earnings at our Brazilian businesses. Now let's recap our results for the full year and how they compared to 2009 guidance.As I mentioned earlier, I'm pleased to report our full year results met or beat our key guidance metrics. In particular, I was very pleased with the cash results for both the consolidated and proportional metrics. Our consolidated operating cash flow of $2.2 billion place us at the top of our 2009 guidance range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. Maintenance CapEx is $622 million, was near the low end of our guidance of $600 million to $700 million. As a result, our consolidated free cash flow exceeded our guidance by approximately $40 million. Likewise, our proportional cash flow metrics reflect similar results. Proportional operating cash flow of $1.3 billion was also within our guidance range. After adjusting for proportional maintenance CapEx of $438 million, our proportional free cash flow was $899 million for the year, exceeding our guidance by approximately $25 million. Subsidiary distributions to the parent for the year were $1.25 billion. This is consistent with our expectations and an increase of almost $200 million versus 2008. Consolidated gross margins of $3.5 billion fell just shy of our guidance of $3.55 billion to $3.65 billion . However, adjusting for the Oman and Pakistan asset sales which have been moved to discontinued operations, we were well within the guidance range. On the same basis, proportional gross margin of $2 billion is also within the guidance range of $2.1 billion to $2.15 billion. Now turning to adjusted EPS. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 was within the range of $1.07 to $1.11. However, adjusting for the $0.05 negative impact to EPS associated with discontinued operations, as well as the $0.04 negative non-cash charge for the change in hypothetical liquidation calculations for wind, we were actually above the range.  In closing, we are very pleased with the results for 2009, particularly in the context of a very challenging macroeconomic environment. Now I'll spend a few minutes reviewing our outlook for 2010 and 2011.  Before I begin, please keep in mind that the following discussions does not reflect the impacts of the pending CIC equity transaction nor the wind joint venture, either with respect to the receipt of cash or the issuance of shares. That said, our guidance does assume that our Pakistan and Oman asset sale transactions closed in the first half of 2010 and they are on track to do so. In addition, we will also receive a $102 million payment from our Kazakhstan termination agreement and approximately $150 million of proceeds from our Brazil wind investment both of which will add to our liquidity in 2010. All of these items will be reflected in our investing cash flows but not in operating cash, so it will have no impact on adjusted EPS or proportional free cash flow. Overall, our 2010 cash flow metrics are at or above our previous guidance, while adjusted earnings per share and subsidiary distributions are lower due to a number of drivers we've already seen in 2009. While we've experienced favorable foreign currency movements since the May 2009 guidance update, there are several offsetting factors that I will outline in a moment.Let me provide a little more detail around the 2010 guidance first and how it trends relative to 2009. Our proportional operating cash flow guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion is an increase over 2009 actuals of $1.3 billion. Likewise, guidance and proportional free cash flow of $900 million to $1.1 billion is also an increase when compared to 2009. For subsidiary distributions, we have lowered the high end of the range by $100 million to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. This decrease reflects our anticipation of lower dividends from Hungary and New York, as well as the loss of dividends from Pakistan and Oman. These decreases are expected to be partially offset by improved operations in Chile and Brazil.Our current 2010 adjusted EPS guidance range is $1 to $1.05, which is lower than our prior guidance by approximately $0.08. As I've previously discussed, a portion of this is driven by the non-cash hypothetical liquidation tax revision at certain U.S. wind businesses and the pending sale of our Oman and Pakistan assets whose earnings are now reported in discontinued operations. In addition, lower demand in the U.S. wholesale markets, the effective spot prices on Hungary's operations and rising business development costs all negatively impact earnings as well. These items are somewhat offset by favorable foreign currency impact and the early stages of contribution from 1,500 megawatts coming online in new projects by year end.When compared to 2009, the outlook for this year from an operational perspective is roughly in line with prior trends. That said, certain benefits that we realized in 2009 will not recur this year, which by definition negatively impacts year-over-year comparables. For example, the earnings of $0.12 from our Kazakhstan performance bonus will not recur in 2010 or 2011. Likewise, the significantly lower effective tax rate we saw in 2009 of approximately 26% is expected to return to a more normalized midrange of 30% -- in the 30 in 2010. We also believe that the merchant plants in New York and Hungary will continue to be impacted by lower demand and spot prices. In addition, we expect weaker demand for our North American utility IPL through 2011 leading to negative growth rate. Finally, we will spend more on business development as our efforts to advance in our development pipeline accelerates. Now turning to 2011.  Continuing the trend of stable and growing cash flows, our cash flow metrics are at or above the prior guidance. That said, adjusted EPS is expected to be similarly impacted by nearly the same set of drivers as 2010,, but offset to a greater degree by 800 additional megawatts coming in line by year end. As a result, 2011 adjusted EPS expectations decreased by $0.05 from a range $1.20 to $1.30 to a new range of $1.15 to $1.25. Barring any significant macroeconomic shift, what we would have projected to be favorable currency and commodity moves in 2011 are expected to be largely offset by $0.12 headwinds related to lower capacity fees and lower demand for several of our generational plants worldwide particularly in Hungary.Similar to 2010, we also lowered expectations by $0.04 again due to the impact of the non-cash charge related to taxes for the hypothetical liquidation of non-controlling interest at several of our U.S. Wind businesses, as well as lower production at our wind facilities in Texas due to curtailment and lower wind resources. We also anticipate a $0.03 higher spending for business development cost.And finally, we're excluding for now the previously projected $0.03 earnings uptick from Campiche, our 270-megawatt project in Chile will be a temporarily suspended construction pending resolution of the dispute over the environmental permit there. As I mentioned earlier, our guidance does not include any dilution or benefit related to the CIC equity transaction. Our plan is to deploy these proceeds into value-accretive development projects or acquisitions once the transaction is closed. While this will not all occur overnight, the expected dilution in 2010 ranges from $0.07 to $0.09. The low end of this range assumes either a $1.5 billion debt pay down or the midyear investment of $500 million and the mid-teens return project with the remaining $1 billion split evenly between cash and debt pay down. The upper end of the range assumes to only pay down $500 million in debt in the near term and retain the remainder in cash for investment in our pipeline of development projects or strategic acquisitions.In summary, 2009 was a good year. We achieved our financial goals while at the same time, laying the foundations for continued growth in 2010 with stable and cost-effective platform on which to scale. We're comfortable that we have the right people and plans in place to ensure the highest levels of execution as we pursue these investments. With that, let me turn it back over to Paul."

As we look out into 2010, our priorities remain similar to those that we outlined a year ago. One, strengthen liquidity and cash flow generation, so as to be able to execute on investment opportunities. Two, successfully build out our remaining construction pipeline and three, deploy our liquidity to value accretive M&A and Greenfield development opportunities. Let me now talk a bit about our construction program.As I mentioned earlier, we've already completed 1,300 megawatts of our construction pipeline but we also have another 2,000 megawatts that will come online by the end of 2011. This capacity includes wind projects in Europe and China, solar projects in Europe, coal projects in Chile and Bulgaria and hydro projects in Latin America and Turkey. One project that isn't included in the above numbers is our 270-megawatt Campiche project in Chile. Work in this project remains suspended as we continue to seek resolution of the permitting issues that we discussed during previous calls. Since our last report, the governor of Chile has resolved the zoning issue related to the project. We subsequently applied for new environmental permit in January, which was approved on February 22. While we're encouraged by the developments, there are few additional conditions to resolve before we can restart construction. These include an appeal period, as well as securing final construction permits. And once we have all the permits, we intend to recommence construction. Now I'd like to give you an update on our view of the growth opportunities and some related points.It's worth noting that many of the markets where we have been developing Greenfield projects have continued to see increased demand for power unlike here in the United States. We also continue to see high growth rates in demand for renewable projects globally. Because of this, we continued developing projects in both renewable energy and in geographic areas with continued needs for new thermal generating capacity. For example in Asia, we have a pipeline of more than 4,000 megawatts including two 1200-megawatt coal-fired projects in India, a 1200-megawatt coal-fired project in Vietnam and an expansion of our 600-megawatt Masinloc facility in the Philippines. We're also pursuing wind, hydro and solar projects in Asia, which is becoming an increasingly robust market for renewable energy. We also continued development of other renewable projects globally through the various incentives in different countries. In wind, we grew our pipeline to 1,200 megawatts of projects in advanced stages of development in the U.S., Europe and China. In AES Solar Energy, out joint venture with Riverstone which has an advanced pipeline of 600 megawatts focused on Europe and now to an increasing extent, is looking towards the United States and India, where markets are improving due to the increased levels of government support. We currently have a total of over 9,000 megawatts of Greenfield projects, both renewables and thermal power in advanced stages of development. Of these, the majority of the opportunities are in Asia in terms of location and 42% are in renewable energy sectors in terms of fuel types. In addition, once we have the capital available from our asset sales and the CIC transaction, we will be positioned to pursue select M&A opportunities, where the cash flows and earnings will be more immediate than Greenfield construction projects. In terms of our pending equity transaction with CIC, in which it will invest $1.58 billion in exchange for an approximate 15% interest in AES, we're making good progress with securing the required regulatory approvals. We'll keep you posted on our progress in the coming weeks. And regarding the letter of intent with CIC to purchase an interest in our Wind business, we're also making good progress. Our expectation is that the transaction could close during the second quarter of 2010. If successfully executed, this transaction would result in an investment of $571 million in exchange for a 35% interest in AES Wind Generation. I do want to point out however, that the LOI is non-binding and subject to due diligence which is currently ongoing. In closing, we had a good year in 2009. We did what we set out to do and have positioned ourselves to capitalize on attractive opportunities in our industry globally. We have a strong pipeline of projects in construction and in development. We also have the capital needed to execute our Greenfield program and selectively pursue attractive M&A opportunities, and we'll be keeping you updated as the various opportunities progress over time. Thanks again for joining us today and now we'll open up the call for questions and answers. And Julie, would you please open up the lines for questions?"

I think we're looking for M&A opportunities wherever we think we can see good value, whether that be the United States or Asia or somewhere else. But I do think also what -- as I see us developing, what's really happening is the real opportunities for us are in renewable energy in the developed markets, Europe and the U.S. We're seeing that with wind and solar and we're seeing in terms of thermal power, the traditional coal-fired , gas-fired power plants, the biggest demand for that is coming in the developing markets particularly in places like Asia. We're also seeing in Asia the ability to get some -- and Latin America to get some small, medium-sized hydro plants than we do renewables. So I think you're going to continue to see us do more in the developed markets in the renewables sector. We're seeing a lot of good growth in wind, that's one of the reasons why we wanted to pursue additional capital from CIC for that investment because it's going to be a big consumer of capital for us. In addition to solar, in solar we're just seeing a lot of opportunities and the U.S. market has really picked up to where we believe there are attractive deals out there now with the utility scale PV projects in the United States. We're already seeing that in Europe where we have projects in construction there. The renewables sector, I think, the other thing we saw over the last year was how that has now expanded beyond the borders of the developed world. So we're seeing the platforms we set up here in the U.S. and Europe with respect to renewables are now -- we're able to expand those to the other countries. I think it's very small right now but I would expect over the next five years, you're going to see that expand considerably. So I think that's going to help us with respect to growth also. But I do think we're looking at just -- in terms of the Greenfield versus M&A, it's probably going to be a balance, I'd say 50/50 between Greenfield and M&A opportunities. Again, it's going to depend on the returns we can get but that's how I would see it playing out, it's probably about half and half in terms of deploying new capital."

You start to get to a situation where that isn't a very effective motivating tool. What we have seen in the EPC market though is, if you go back two, three years ago, it was a very competitive market, competitive for people like us but the contractors had more of the power. I think what we've seen with the slowdown is there's a much stronger desire for contractors to get back into the business, and the terms are shifting a little bit more back to what we consider to be reasonable, more balanced terms. So that's been one positive impact of the slowdown here is it's put that back on the balance a little bit for us."

But in the short term, when we look at 2010, the impact will be $0.07 to $0.09, the low end of that dilution range of $0.07 would assume obviously either the $1.58 billion debt pay down or a midyear investment, so July, August of $500 million in the mid-teens type of return project. So we sort of on the middle of the road on an investment basis. But then we also take the remaining $1 billion and split it between cash and debt pay down. On the upper end, we would assume we would only pay down about $500 million and retain the remainder of cash assuming we needed it for investment and/or strategic acquisitions in the short term.

So in case they've ended up being a little bit higher. A lot of depends on where the wind resource turns out, how it turns out to be relative to projections. But what I've say that's the kind of the range that we've seen. With solar projects, with our joint venture with Riverstone, we've set a hurdle rate of -- I believe it's north of 15%, we're looking for 15% to 17% type of returns for those projects. We've been able to find those in Europe. We also think with the incentive in place, we may be able to get some solar projects that will come into that range in the United States. What we're really focused on is how can you reduce the costs of building those plants. What we found is, one, the cost of panels has been coming down but also the cost of constructing those plants, the actual construction cost putting them together is a significant amount that we think could be optimized. So Bob Hemphill and his team  had spent a lot of time trying to figure out how we do that, but we think those returns can be in the 15% to 17% range at least for right now. And in terms of development time, the wind projects are probably shorter development times than the thermal projects but they can still take a long time with respect to wind studies and getting environmental permits. Solar project are a lot easier. They can get done more quickly in terms of permits just because they don't have as much impact, also in terms of getting them built because you can get those things built through out the rest of the year. So when you take that on to account, renewables have a big advantage in terms of time. You start spending money to the time you get it back but particularly in solar projects, we're seeing that."

So we basically kept those -- we want to keep those projects moving forward, but some of them was on a life support because we wouldn't want to rush them through. Now that we have a capital we can move them more quickly. The key things, we'll start with Vietnam, the critical things are to get the power purchase agreement signed with the government, which we believe should happen in the next couple of months but the basic  terms have been agreed. And the next key item there would be getting the financing for the project, which we think we'll probably take into the early part of 2011. I think with India, there's been a project, it's a mine melt [ph] project. The key items there are to get the final permits and land rights that we need and to get the coal allocations to cover the coal we might need during the construction, early parts of the project before the coal mine is finally developed and then it's going to be the financing of it. We think in both cases the financing is doable. I think it's the one area that we're going to test out very quickly but it's really getting probably in the second half of the year, we'll start that financing process in earnest as we start moving those projects forward. Since we get in India, the projects are getting financed and the domestic financial markets are very strong and should not be a problem getting a financing for India. I think with Vietnam, it's going to depend on the multilateral sources of capital that would be available for this project, or whether if we go for Chinese equipment there will be Chinese financing available for the project. So a couple of different ways we'll be looking at that. We're also expecting that Vietnam will take on a partner for that in Asia. Somebody who would also -- that would probably help with getting the financing either from the export credit agencies, whether it be Japan or Korea or possibly China."

This morning, I would like to focus my comments in three areas. First, the performance for the quarter; second, an update on our construction program; and third, an update on our growth opportunities and a discussion about our general approach to capital allocation, which I want to be sure we continue to communicate to investors on a regular basis. 
First, our operating performance for the quarter, in line with our performance last quarter, our focus on operations resulted in improvements in nearly all of our financial metrics. For example, our proportional gross margin increased 19% while proportional operating cash flow also increased 14%. 
These improvements were reflected in our adjusted earnings per share of $0.23 despite a $0.04 impact of a higher share count associated with raising capital to invest in value accretive opportunities.
This quarter, we benefited from stronger economic growth and increased demand for electrical power in Asia and parts of Latin America such as Brazil. This was partially offset, however. In the US, we saw moderate demand growth and lower pricing and dark spreads for the merchant portion of our generating plea.
Now, I will turn the call over to Victoria to provide a more detailed review of our financial performance, and I will talk about the construction and development, which will be driving our future earnings growth. Victoria.

As you have already heard, the second quarter of 2010 continues to reflect the favorable operating results and higher demand in several key markets.

As you have already heard, the second quarter of 2010 continues to reflect the favorable operating results and higher demand in several key markets. Proportional gross margin improved quarter-over-quarter on higher volume and rates in Latin America and Asia, as well as favorable foreign exchange primarily in Brazil. 
This growth in gross margin translated into higher proportional operating cash flow, which increased by 14% compared to the second quarter of 2009. Adjusted EPS of $0.23 while down a penny compared to the same quarter last year is actually relatively strong reflecting the strength of business operations, particularly in light of this quarter’s higher share account and higher effective tax rate, as well as a fact that there was a $0.05 one-time gain in the same quarter of 2009 due to a construction claim settlement that contributed to earnings then.
Now, let’s discuss results for the second quarter in greater detail. From a macroeconomic perspective, our trends this quarter are similar to what we saw in first quarter. Volume growth continued unabated in key markets in Asia and Latin America. For example, demand in the Philippines as well as Brazil continued their upward trajectory with 12% and 5% year-over-year improvements respectively, with GDP growth driving both power demand and new construction starts in these markets. 
Volume also increased in Columbia due to higher water inflows at [Tubos] Reservoir, while Panama experienced higher dispatch volumes as water conservation measures there eased during the same period. In addition, higher prices due to the final tariff settlement in July 2009 continued to increase earnings at our Latin American utility. 
Our generation plants and other geographies also benefited from higher prices due to factors such as system-wise supply constraints in the Philippines and Panama and the dry season in Columbia. These beneficial trends more than offset challenges from the compressed margins in North America where our coal-fired merchant plants were impacted by lower gas prices again this quarter leading to a 36% decrease in energy margins there.
Foreign currency exchange rates, while somewhat mixed also moved overall in our favor when compared to the second quarter of 2009. For example, the Brazil Real and Columbian Peso appreciated 16% and 15% respectively, while the Euro and the Argentine Peso declined 6% and 5% respectively.
Our consolidated gross margin was $982 million, an increase of $179 million or 22% relative to 2009, with favorable foreign currency exchange rates accounting for $54 million of the uptake. Even excluding foreign exchange impact, these results were considerably higher than the second quarter of 2009 by $125 million driven by favorable volume and rate in both Asia and Latin America.
On a proportional basis, we earned $572 million of gross margin, an increase of $93 million or 19% over 2009 driven by Asia generation and Latin America. During the second quarter, tax expenses unfavorable as our effective tax rate increased from 19% in the second quarter of 2009 to 48% in the second quarter of 2010. The quarterly effective rate this year is unusually high due in part to the increased tax expense associated with $115 million gain on the sale of our equity investment in CEMIG, a Brazilian utility.
In addition, the year-over-year rate has been negatively impacted throughout the year by the 12/31/09 expiration of a favorable US tax law related to the treatment of certain non-US transactions. As we’ve indicated in prior calls, while renewal this legislation has been pending for some time, we remain uncertain about it at this time, although we have had positive operating results help to offset this for the first half of the year if not renewed, this would create $0.11 drag on earnings for the full year.
We will continue to monitor the legislation as well as continue to work on mitigating its potential impact and update you accordingly. Given the number of other one-time items in the quarter, we provided a bridge from our second quarter 2009 adjusted EPS of $0.24 to this quarter is $0.23 to help identify the drivers between years on slide 6 of the arranged presentation available online.
As a reminder, during the same quarter last year, we booked a $0.05 after-tax gain as a result of a construction claim settlement at one of our European subsidiaries. In addition, that same period last year benefited from a tax restructuring at a subsidiary, which lowered our effective tax rate for the $0.06 per share impact, when compared to the second quarter of this year.
Similarly, there were several other significant transactions recorded during the second quarter of this year, which largely offset each other. These include a negative $0.03 realized foreign exchange transaction loss, triggered upon the repatriation of a Euro-denominated Brazil wind loan at $0.02 loss on the write-off previously capitalized costs that were incurred in connection with the potential transaction involving our wind business and a $0.06 gain net of tax from the sale of our equity investment in a Brazilian utility, CEMIG. None of these items impacted operating cash flow for 2010, however.
In summary, when you consider all these factors to take away for the quarter is that there is a favorable trend again this quarter in earnings that is consistent with the growth and gross margin and cash flow driven by continued contributions from the Latin America and Asian components of our portfolio of businesses.
Now, to address cash flow, on a consolidated basis our operating cash flow increased $210 million over the last year to $747 million. This increase was the result of higher gross margin and favorable working capital in Latin America and Asia. On a proportional basis, our operating cash flow also increased $44 million of our last year to $349 million. 
Likewise, free cash flow has increased too, up $180 million to $588 million driven by higher operating cash flow, offset partially by higher maintenance CapEx. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow increased $21 million to $232 million driven primarily by our Asian businesses.
Now turning to our full-year guidance, our financial and operational performance in the second quarter was very similar to the first quarter. The key macroeconomic and business drivers remain relatively consistent between quarters, and are building toward our full-year guidance expectations. 
Through the second quarter, we have already achieved 50% or more for each of our guidance metrics. We expect to remain on phase for the remainder of the year and have updated the commodity price in foreign currency forecast as of June 30.
Diluted EPS from continuing operations has been negatively impacted by $0.03, to $0.80 to $0.85 range to reflect the unrealized foreign currency losses from the second quarter. Given the non-cash nature of these charges, there is no impact on operating cash flow or to our adjusted EPS metrics.
Before I hand the call back to Paul to discuss our progress on our pipeline of investments, let me first touch briefly on our overall liquidities, which will allow us to pursue those options. 
Our parent liquidity remains at a historically high level at $2.2 billion as compared to $1.3 billion as of June 30 of last year. With $232 million from the subsidiaries during the quarter, net of corporate overhead and interest expense as well as $60 million in net proceeds from the sale of our Pakistan assets. These cash contributions set us up well to make sound capital allocations during the quarter.
For example, as previously mentioned, we pre-paid $500 million of debt as a temporary use of liquidity. We also funded a $166 million of investments related to our ongoing construction and growth initiatives. Finally, in June, we also announced a $500 million share buyback program. As you saw reference in the 10-Q, during the quarter our revolver commitments stepped down by $180 million as anticipated under the terms of existing credit agreement.
However, also during the quarter, we refinanced our revolver and increased the overall credit capacity from $605 million to $800 as of July 29. Under the terms of the new revolver, we also extended a maturity date from July 2011 to January 2015 and lowered pricing by 50 basis points.
Beyond these economic terms, we also obtained amendments to certain covenant provisions, which will provide additional business flexibility. Some of the major benefits of those changes include an increase in the allowable first lien debt the at AES Corp from $1.75 million to $3 billion and an increase in the measure which allows restricted payments to grow as parent cash flow.
We were very pleased with the terms of the revolver refinancing and for the ongoing confidence in AES provided by our banks. Many investors have asked us about the possible uses of this cash. We continue to exercise the capital allocation strategy focused on the greatest return of shareholder value. 
In addition to the share repurchase program just discussed, we also prepaid $500 million of debt during the second quarter, including $400 million of secondly lean parent debt and $95 million of non-recourse debt at one of our subsidiaries in China.
This discretionary payment not only added more debt capacity, but also saved approximately $45 million in annualized interest expense. During the quarter, we also announced the acquisition of the 1246-megawatt natural gas fired by Ballylumford plant in Northern Ireland for $150 million, which will generate earnings for us beginning in 2011.
We are also considering the pay down of parent debt of $240 million, which is maturing through 2011. Having said that, if other value creative opportunities present themselves, we may refinance. Examples of these other types of opportunities include the $1.4 billion advanced development pipeline we’ve discussed previously, as well as M&A and the remainder of the 9000-megawatt advanced development projects.
In summary, operations continue to improve over last year and we are delivering on our guidance metrics. Our credit metrics remain strong and we are investing our increasing liquidity in the best available options ranging from stock repurchase, debt retirement, M&A or Greenfield development.
With that, let me turn it back to Paul, to provide additional commentary on our development pipeline.
"
35312,111282390,73871,"The AES Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-06-2010",2010-08-06,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Okay, thanks Victoria. Now, what I would like to do is before talking about development, turn to the progress we are making on our construction program. We are making good progress with construction. In the second quarter, we completed two win projects wi",1980,"Okay, thanks Victoria. Now, what I would like to do is before talking about development, turn to the progress we are making on our construction program. We are making good progress with construction. In the second quarter, we completed two win projects with combined capacity of just under 100 megawatts in China. Both of these projects in which we owned 49% stakes were completed on time and on budget. 
That leaves approximately 1900 megawatts in aggregate in construction. Of this amount, 1676 megawatts is expected to come online through 2011, in line with our previous estimates. We expect 793 megawatts to come online before the end of this year including the 670-megawatt Maritsa East coal plant in Bulgaria. This plant has already achieved full load operation on the first unit generating over 330 megawatts. We have successfully fired the second unit on oil with current schedule for both units projecting to be completed by year-end.
We also have another 883 megawatts of capacity in aggregate projected to come online during 2011. This includes our 520-megawatt Angamos coal plant in the mining region in the north of Chile. While we successfully hydro tested the boilers and are on schedule to fire coal in the coming months, it will meet our commitment of finishing the project during the second half of 2011. 
Additionally, our 220-megawatt Changuinola hydroelectric project in Panama has completed approximately 80% of the tunneling required for the powerhouse, hydro testing of the turbines has been completed and progress continues with construction of the dam. We expect the Changuinola project to be completed by the first half of 2011 as scheduled.
I am also pleased to report that we have reached a significant milestone in resuming construction of our 270 megawatt Campiche coal plant in Chile. As you recall, construction was suspended following a court ruling against the Chilean environmental authorities, which invalidated the project’s environmental permit. 
The new environmental permit was subsequently issued and recently [Headar] reached an agreement with the local municipality and other groups opposed to the project. While final construction approvals are still pending, we believe construction will resume later this year with completion expected in the second half of 2012.
Next, I would like to talk about our capital allocation program. As you know, we raised $1.6 billion from CIC, China Investment Corporation, in March of this year. We entered 2010 with a strong development pipeline of 9000 megawatts of advanced Greenfield development projects, which could require more than $2.5 billion of equity billed out. 
In addition to having capital available for our Greenfield development pipeline, we felt that having access to ready capital might also allow us to capitalize on opportunistic acquisitions, very much like we did this quarter with our acquisitions very much like we did this quarter with our acquisitions of plants in Northern Ireland and the hydro plants in China. 
Having access to this capital also allowed us to buy back stock as we did this past month, when our stock price dropped the levels far below what we believe represent the true of the company, representing an opportunity to create additional value for shareholders. 
When I meet with investors, I get a lot of questions about capital allocation and how we at AES think about that, very simply we looked to create the most value per share that we can by deploying capital where we can create the greatest net present value per dollar invested.  In some cases that will mean investing in new Greenfield plants or in acquisitions where we can earn a meaningful spread above our cost of capital. 
In other cases it may involve buying back AES stock or even possibly serve our public subsidiaries where we can buy substantial discount to what we have projected to be the underlying value of these shares.  We may also sell some of our businesses when we see if the market values exceed to what we believe to be the undervalue, of the underlying value of these businesses.  
So, while we see NPV positive growth, is one very significant way to increase value per share, it isn’t the only way to do so. For example, we have recently sold assets in Pakistan, in the Middle East around the same time that we announced $500 million of stock buyback. For us, this is a good trade to sell assets at attractive prices and buyback AES shares at a discount to intrinsic value and then therefore increase the underlying value per share of our stock.
As Victoria mentioned earlier, we currently have cash at the parent of approximately $2.1 billion counting the $300 million of asset sales proceeds, we are forecasting to receive in the third quarter. This liquidity when supplemented by our internally generated cash flow to the parent over the next 18 months could be used to fund up to $2.5 billion of uses of cash over that same time frame. 
Those potential uses include the $500 million stock repurchase program approved by the board in June, $200 million of debt maturities in 2010 if we choose not to refinance them, $300 billion for projects currently in construction and a very visible and tangible near-term development pipeline, which we have already shared with you of approximately $1.5 billion. And this does not conclude any opportunistic value accretive acquisitions such as we just completed in China and Northern Ireland that I mentioned earlier. 
This very visible intangible near-term development pipeline includes the recently announced Ballylumford gas facility in the UK, the 1200 megawatt Mong Duong coal-fired plant in Vietnam, the Alto Maipo hydro plant in Chile and a 1200 megawatt expansion of our $420 megawatt coal-fired plant in Orissa, India.
As I mentioned, we see stock repurchases as a way that we can create value in today’s market also. Accordingly in July, we launched a $500 million stock buyback program, to date we have only purchased about $50 million worth of shares at an average price of just slightly under $10 per share to the extent we can continue to create value by buying back stock at a substantial discount to fair value we will likely do so.
Let me now touch upon the progress we are making on our development pipeline, which we think of is our pipeline of options to invest and create that present value. We are seeing some real momentum across all regions and lines of businesses. For example in Vietnam, we’ve signed a 25-year power purchase and fuel supply agreements for our 1200-megawatt coal plant. 
The EPC or construction contract negotiations are progressing well. We expect to execute a definitive construction agreement during this quarter, which would allow us to close financing for this project in the first half of 2011.
With regard to solar, this quarter we began construction of 27.5 megawatts in Italy, which brings our total solar PV capacity to 115 megawatts. In addition, AES solar raised $38 million of non-recourse financing for solar PV project in Italy, and executed a 15-megawatt PPA in India. We expect to have approximately $250 megawatts of additional solar projects commencing construction between now and the end of 2011.
In terms of wind, we feel good about the prospects for wind generation globally. We are currently focused on markets with favorable regulatory incentives for renewables, particularly in attractive markets outside of The United States such as Europe and Asia. 
In Europe, we acquired a 353 megawatt development pipeline in Poland of which 158 megawatts is expected to begin construction in 2011. We view Poland as a strong growth market for wind, due to its wind resources and its mandate to add renewable energy in order to diverse away from coal generation. To meet its 15% renewable target, Poland needs to add approximately 10,000 megawatts of wind capacity.
The first project in this pipeline is a 34-megawatt [Inaudible] project, which is on track to close and begin construction by the end of this year. We also have one of the development projects, the 29 megawatt Sorne Hill wind project which was part of the Your Energy UK development pipeline acquired this year, also expecting to close in 2010, and another project in the UK also received its final clearance to construct. 
We also feel good about the prospects for wind in the US, but currently only in selective locations such as California and PJM. We intend to continue to build portfolios in those states that have renewable portfolios standards. For example, in West Virginia we started construction on our 92-megawatt Laurel Mountain wind project, which is integrated with the 32-megawatt energy storage system. This project is expected to sell electricity into the PJM market. 
The integrated energy storage system will both enable the wind facility to meet emerging ramp rate control standards and generate additional revenue by providing ancillary services into the PJM market. We are building this project with turbines we already had in order and the plan is to fund the majority of the remaining construction cost by way of the 30% treasury ITC cash grant, which would be received shortly after COD. The project will be fully operational by the second quarter of 2011.
In California, our 49-megawatt Mountain View Fort project has all its permits and their connection agreements in place and is targeting a closing by year-end. While many of these wind and solar projects are smaller in size, they do add up when aggregated. We also like the fact that they can be constructed quickly and start generating earnings within year of closing.
M&A also continues to be something of very high interest to us. We believe that there will be attractive opportunities to acquire assets or even portfolios of assets in various parts of the world of prices that are value accretive to AES. In many of these cases, we can take advantage of the synergies in our platform, as well as our demonstrated ability to upgrade and turn around certain businesses.
One good example is our recently announced acquisition of the 1246-megawatt Ballylumford natural gas fired plant in Northern Ireland for $150 million. We expect this field to close in the second half of 2010 once we have obtained the necessary regulatory approvals. This acquisition demonstrates how we can leverage our existing local presence in Northern Ireland with our nearby Kilroot Plant and the strengths of our liquidity that uses to deliver near-term accretive results.
In China, we also recently acquired a 35% interest in a 241-megawatt portfolio of operating hydro facilities in China, with an additional 14% interest that is expected to close by the end of 2010, for a total of approximately $50 million of investment. 
The added attraction on this transaction is the extensive experience of our joint venture partner, China Three Gorges New Energy, in developing, constructing and operating for hydro plants in the region. We are already working together on additional opportunities in China to grow our Asian hydro business.
Overall, we are making very good progress in deploying capital, the acquisitions described earlier, Ballylumford and China Hydros are consistent with our M&A strategy to focus on regions with higher growth prospects and/or areas we have local knowledge and relationships from our existing operations.
We will continue to invest our cash when we can make the highest risk-adjusted returns and create the greatest NPV per share whether that would be in buying back our stock at attractive prices, investing in Greenfield projects, pursuing M&A opportunities or in buying back debt to create financial flexibility.
In summary, we are hitting our financial targets and completing our construction pipeline. We also have a sound capital allocation program and a strong liquidity position with which to execute it.
Thanks for joining us today and for your attention this morning. We look forward to your questions and comments. Diane, could you please open up the line for questions now?

We just don’t see enough opportunities for that to justify the investment we have to put in place to build up that capability. So, I think we are interested in our core power business, gas and coal plants; renewal business, wind and solar. I think there are plenty of opportunities that we see around the world just to be focusing on those opportunities, but we don’t seek getting into nuclear.
I think the other part is, just a development, the length of time it takes to develop nuclear and to construct nuclear clearly makes it tough to justify putting a lot of money into those projects for us, but thanks for the question.

We still look at wind as the business that we might eventually go out and do an IPL. We took all the steps necessary to get it ready to go and as Victoria, mentioned it’s going to remain ready to go. 
In terms of accounting though, because we didn’t have a transaction out there where we could take it public or sell it right away. We decided to just go ahead and write that off, which is the appropriate accounting treatment. But in terms of the investment we made, we will be ready to go, if and when the market comes back, where it would be an attractive opportunities. 
I talked about portfolio management, I could see us doing more things like that where we could take some of our assets and take them public as a way to do portfolio management, but it’s going to depend on the markets.
Our solar business would be for example another one, but we in Riverstone will continue to look at the opportunities to monetize that asset, potentially monetize a part of that business because we are seeing tremendous growth, we are seeing a lot of good projects there. We will look for ways that we can do some portfolio management down the road. So, doing this kind of accounting, something we wanted to do we have it ready to do, but it’s more of the accounting treatment.
I should also comment on the CIC. I know I’ve got a lot of questions, when I was on the road is to why didn’t CIC proceed with the investment in the wind business? I think, I was out there meeting with them and I think there were a number of issues going on at the time with respect to US regulatory environment, questions about what’s going to happen with our US policy to renewables that I think gave them and of course others pause about what’s the future of renewables policy in the United States.
What we agreed was that we set an artificial deadline out there to get this done by a certain date, and we agreed that it really wasn’t critical for us to do it now. We don’t need the capital today, they didn’t feel the need to invest, but we have agreed that we would continue discussions and it’s very possible at some point down the road they would come back into that business prior to us doing an IPO. 
I think they still see the renewable business globally as being attractive, but the urgency wasn’t there to do it right away and we felt the same way. Quite frankly, it would have added more capital, would have caused more dilution to us. We felt it’s probably not the appropriate time to be taking on more capital. 
So, that’s the reason why we decided to just let the LOI elapse, but it doesn’t mean they don’t continue to have an interest on a longer-term basis.

The answer to that is I mean very simply, we built up a big infrastructure, our G&A costs are high. The advantage we have with that though is we are really geared up to do a lot with respect to financial statements, financial reporting. 
So, as I see it, if we can do some things like IPOs, we should be able to do that very cost effectively. I do feel like those and in terms of G&A, this is going to be a major effort for us in the second half of the year, is becoming leaner. We had to go through a period of time where we had restatements; we had to build up the infrastructure. We now need to get to the point where we can do this more efficiently and I think we are now at a great point to do that.
This could be a combination of having the capabilities available to us where we could do more, and also starting to skinny it down a little bit. If we don’t wind up doing IPOs, we probably have the ability to tighten down a little bit more, even more on that G&A cost.

I think that’s true with, if you took any collection of our assets, if we saw an opportunity to do an IPO down the road where we had the critical mass, where the markets offered attractive pricing, it might be a way to take advantage of either local markets or particular markets for types of assets that would allow us to raise more capital cheaply than we might at the parent.
If you look at where our parent stock is today, it’s painfully obvious that there are better places to raise capital than in the US markets for the kind of assets we have, and that’s something that’s going on the back of our minds about, our strategy going forward is to how we raise capital as we continue to grow in particular areas.

It’s got a peaking plant, which will come off line in 2015, so that we expect that would be shut down. 
The other piece of that which is roughly 600 something megawatt is a combined cycle plant which would continue operating and is contracted through 2018, so that would be the piece that we continue operating, we think has the long-term potential, but the peak would be shut down.
In terms of the value from that plant, earnings accretion from that unit is probably in the range of about $0.04 per share coming from Ballylumford in 2011, that’s partly because it’s front loaded. And if we talk about our hurdle rate as being 15% and this exceeded that hurdle rate for us. 
And again I think it’s because we have a plant not too far away, we know the market, we can operate it probably more efficiently by sharing resources, having some share procurement between the facilities, but given that we know the market and we can move quickly because we have liquidity, we think it enables us to get an attractive deal on that asset.

Once we had a certain knowledge we were restricted as to what we could actually go do, but we’ll continue to evaluate that depending on how the stock price moves. 
Obviously we don’t want to be chasing all the way up, because we do see some good opportunities for investments and acquisitions, and we won’t want to loose the ability to do that also, but we are going to balance that. When the stock is attractively priced, we’ll do that, but we’ll do it at levels that enable us to get that benefit. But that’s okay, we and the Board will continue to evaluate what’s the right limit price to do that. 
And just in 2009, the reason we stopped there, and I think its relevant, was that we started to get business back -- I’m sorry, its actually 2008 I believe we did this. August 2008, when we saw our price dropping and we thought, well this is great, we are getting stock at a fantastic price, but then when the world was falling apart for us and everybody else, we started to get concerned about liquidity and we just held back, and that’s why when we looked at the CIC transaction, we begin to realize that if you got liquidity, if you’ve got cash, there’s a lot you can do and you could take advantage things.
Quite frankly, if we hadn’t raised the money from CIC, we would not have been able to buy back stock at prices that were just under $10. That wasn’t our intention at the time, but at the same time its important to have the flexibility, the financial flexibility to go do things for value accreted for shareholders. So, there we didn’t stop because we didn’t like the price, we stopped because we were worried about liquidity. We are beyond that point now and I think we’ve got the financial flexibility to do many things.

It was a combination of the semi gain and the transactional gain that we recognized in the quarter, as well as the lack of that legislation having been enacted. The 48% on an adjusted basis would still be sort of at the mid 35%, 36%. 
What I was referring to in terms of just the legislative piece of this alone, which would be recurring in nature obviously if not extended, which would have had an $0.11 impact on EPS for full year, we’ve had enough operating benefits, that we’ve offset some portion of that through the year so far. 
I was flagging the fact that obviously the legislation still has not been enacted if we fight that, I think in our MG&A both quarters now, and so we will continue to look for offsetting opportunities as the years goes on, but it has been an underlying assumption going into this year, that that would have been reenacted and that it was at about $0.11 full year impact. So that’s just context for those moving parts. 
If we do not get it for example, though we would be higher than we would have projected on an effective tax rate, probably in the closer to the mid 30s than the low 30s on a percentage basis, and all of that of course is non-cash impacting.

I think if you go out a couple of years though, I think we start to generate a lot of cash and whether or not we’ll see enough value accretive opportunities to deploy that cash, I think it’s very possibly that you could see or start to look at dividend as a meaningful way to do that. 
Right now our current free cash flow is about $400 million, and that’s the cash we have on hand after paying interest to all the corporate charges, but our objective is to really start to build that up, so it’s a meaningful amount and gives us plenty of cushion. 
Once we get to number that, where we feel more comfortable, I know it’s something that we at the Board level had been talking about, so I don’t think we are there today. We will clearly be at a point where we could do something like that in couple or three years and the real question is, at what point in time would we actually want to go do that. 
So we’ll keep looking at that and we are open to it, but it’s really our focus is to generate more current free cash flow, so we got the ability to comfortably put out a dividend that’s meaningful.

Today, I'll briefly comment on our financial performance for the year-to-date numbers. I'll then give an update on our construction pipeline which will be delivering additional cash flow in earnings next year. In addition, both Victoria and I will comment on how we're thinking about allocating capital between our various investment opportunities including our own stock and debt securities.
First, our year-to-date operating performance. Overall we earned $0.68 of adjusted EPS in the first three quarters of 2010. At the same time last year, we earned $0.85 a share, although this included $0.17 a share of one-time payments in 2009. These included earn-out payment associated with the sale of our Kazakhstan asset and a settlement of our gas powered plant in Spain. So excluding those one-time payments, our performance was essentially constant on a year-to-year comparison basis.
The reality is that the underlying performance of our business improved a lot in 2010 and those improvements were needed to overcome the significant negative effects of lower dark spreads in the U.S. as well as a higher book income tax rate. In order to understand the underlying performance of our business better, it's useful to think about all big categories that have impacted our performance to date relative to last year.
These being, one, operations and FX primarily resulting from the strong performance of businesses in Latin America and Asia; two, commodity prices which includes the impacts of lower dark spreads in the U.S.; three, a higher share count associated with building up a cash balance for new investment opportunities; and four, a higher book tax rate.
We compared 2010 to 2009; there was an improvement of $0.17 from our underlying operations and FX, which by the way I netted out the increased BD expenses if you look at slide 17. This positive performance completely overcame the negative variances we experienced, those being $0.07 from commodities, lower dark spreads, $0.08 from higher share count and $0.02 from a tax rate. And even with the negative impacts of lower margins in our U.S. merchant businesses, our strong operating performance did result in increased proportional free cash flow on year-to-date basis allowing us to deliver $970 million of proportional free cash flow to date, which is $127 million or 15% higher than the same period last year. 
So despite the compression in U.S. dark spreads, we've been able to meet our targets for both earnings and cash flow.
Now, I'll turn over the call to Victoria who will discuss our performance for the financials in more detail.

As you've heard, the third quarter was in line with our expectations.

As you've heard, the third quarter was in line with our expectations. Proportional gross margin rose 2% attributable to higher volume in North America, high volume and rates in Asia, as well as favorable foreign exchange, primarily in Brazil.
Cash flow is relatively flat this quarter versus the same period in 2009, but has increased when you consider the businesses sold earlier this year. Adjusted EPS of $0.20, declined by $0.04, mostly driven by a higher share count. Adjusting to this, adjusted EPS is in line with last year, which is no small feat given commodity price moves and slower than expected economic recovery in some global markets.
Now, let's discuss the results for the third quarter in greater detail, starting with the most significant drivers affecting gross margins. 
Our trends this quarter are similar to what we've seen in the prior two quarters. Economic expansion in Asia and Latin America continued to spur power demand growth as both manufacturing and construction in these markets surged. In the US, demand also increased during the warm weather this summer, which is especially evident in IPLs result, showing a 12% increase in retail volume. 
Market prices also remained above prior year levels at certain businesses, most notably in the Philippines and in Argentina. Our generation plants in Argentina benefited from higher market prices while the Philippines saw both higher spot and contracted rates for generation. These beneficial price trends were offset by challenges from the compressed margins in North America, where our coal and pet coke fired merchant plants were impacted by lower gas prices again this quarter. We expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter and beyond.
The favorable year-over-year trends in foreign currency exchange rates have slowed compared to earlier this year, but are still favorable when compared to the third quarter of 2009. For example, quarter-over-quarter, the Brazilian real and Columbian peso appreciated 7% and 10%, respectively.
Our consolidated gross margin was $985 million, an increase of $18 million or 2% relative to 2009 with favorable foreign currency exchange rates accounting for $32 million of the uptick. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, gross margin is down by $14 million versus the third quarter of 2009. This decrease is driven primarily by the recovery of $57 million receivable in 2009 at our Brazilian utility Eletropaulo that had been previously written off.
In addition, declining dark spreads in New York, a cumulative adjustment to regulatory liabilities at Eletropaulo and higher fuel cost at Gener all applied downward pressure on gross margin. These negative drivers were mostly offset by favorable volume in North America and higher prices and volume at Masinloc in the Philippines.
Excluding the non-recurring items in Brazil related to regulatory liabilities and receivable recoveries, gross margin would have increased by 10%. 
On a proportional basis, we earned $553 million of gross margin, an increase of $11 million or 2% over 2009. Excluding foreign currency exchange impacts, proportional gross margin decreased to $51 million (ph).
In the third quarter, we earned $0.05 of diluted EPS from continuing operations. Excluding the impacts of impairments and unrealized non-cash foreign currency gains, adjusted EPS was $0.20.
I'd like to take a moment to review the impairments we booked this quarter. In total, these accounted for $314 million or $0.26 a share on a GAAP basis. The largest driver of this expense is at one of our gas-fired generation plants in California, whose impairment was caused by recently passed once-through cooling regulation 316(b) of the U.S. Clean Water Act. In addition, we recorded an impairment charge at our merchant business in Hungary as a result of our third quarter negotiations with the offtaker. Hungary continues to experience decreases in demand and margins resulting from the significant downturn in their economy as we've discussed on previous call. 
Please remember that these are non-cash items impacting a GAAP EPS from continuing operations but they are excluded from adjusted EPS.
Also, on an adjusted basis, tax expense was unfavorable with the effective tax rate increasing from 35% in the third quarter 2009 to 37% in the third quarter of 2010. This puts our ongoing year-to-date tax rate at 33%, subsequent to the impacts of the Cemig transaction recorded last quarter. As indicated then, our actual results reflect higher tax rate due to the December 31, 2009 expiration of a favorable U.S. tax loss related to the treatment of certain non-U.S. transactions.
If this tax was not renewed, had been anticipated at the time we issued our 2010 guidance earlier this year, it would have had the effect of negatively impacting our full year earnings by approximately $0.11. We've identified mitigating actions that will offset $0.05 of this increase, bringing the net negative impact to $0.06.
We've summarized these drivers on slide 7, which bridges last year's third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.24 to this year's $0.20. Favorable operating performance and foreign exchange offset partially by higher business development costs drive a $0.03 improvement this year. In addition, our higher effective tax rate resulted in $0.01 decline. Commodities moved against this by $0.02 and the higher share count negatively impacted EPS by $0.04.
Now let's discuss cash flow. On a consolidated basis, our operating cash flow decreased $7 million from last year to $1 billion, and declined $13 million on a proportional basis. These results demonstrate the strength of the portfolio's ability to generate cash flow, given that we sold businesses that contributed $78 million of operating cash flow in the third quarter of 2009. These sales, which earned returns in excess of 20%, are excellent examples of our portfolio management opportunities.
Similarly, consolidated free cash flow decreased by $32 million to $827 million for the quarter, driven mostly by the businesses sold. In addition, higher maintenance CapEx at our Brazilian utilities and environmental CapEx at IPL contributed to the decrease in free cash flow. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow decreased $37 million to $412 million as a result of these same drivers.
Now, turning to full year 2010 guidance. Overall, we're very pleased that we remain on track to hit our key operational and financial guidance metrics. Through the third quarter, we have already achieved approximately 75% or more for each of the guidance metrics, except for diluted earnings per share, which includes the impact of the non-cash impairment charges I mentioned earlier. 
Given the impact of these impairments, we have lowered our diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.17 to $0.63 to $0.68.
Cash flow has exceeded our expectations and we are, therefore, raising our consolidated operational cash flow and free cash flow guidance by $175 million. Likewise, our proportional operating cash flow and proportional free cash flow metrics have also been raised by $50 million.
Adjusted EPS guidance remains unchanged at $0.90 to $0.95 assuming the renewal of the U.S. tax law I discussed earlier. Should this not occur, our adjusted EPS expectation range would be $0.85 to $0.90, reflecting the impact of both a higher tax expense as well as the mitigating actions we are taking. 
Potentially offsetting some of these actions is the renegotiation of a fuel related contract within one of our Latin American subsidiaries. While the timing of these discussions is uncertain, we expect it could be within the next three to nine months and could have a negative impact to adjusted EPS after tax of a $0.01 to $0.02. We'll continue to monitor this and update you accordingly.
Now turning to parent company liquidity. Our parent liquidity of $2.1 billion is relatively flat versus the second quarter of this year and has increased $689 million over September 30, 2009. During the quarter, liquidity increased by $221 million for business sales and subsidiary distribution, net of corporate overhead, and interest expense. Additionally, the revolver capacity was expanded by $221 million.
I am also pleased to announce that while not included in this balance, we also closed the sale of our Qatar business in October and received $180 million of net proceeds to-date subsequent to quarter end. In turn, these proceeds have helped position us to opportunistically repurchase $90 million in AES stock since July when we saw market discount to our intrinsic value.
Beyond this repurchase, our uses of liquidity included the retirement of our September 2010 notes for $214 million and funding of $354 million in new projects moving into construction and investments in growth initiatives. 
Also, subsequent to quarter end figures, we paid down the remaining $290 million of our 2013 senior secured notes in October. 
We're pleased to have such attractive opportunities for use of cash. In that light, I want to take a minute to review the financial framework through which we evaluate and allocate AES capital. 
As we previously said, our strategy is to invest capital to maximize shareholder returns over both the medium and longer term as it fits any capital-intensive business. We believe we can achieve this objective through a combination of efforts. We serve to reduce our cost structure and fund future value accretive growth projects. We group these options into three categories; return of capital to shareholders, investing in growth projects, and paying down debt.
AES's objective is to allocate incremental capital by the levers that provide the greatest risk-adjusted return to our shareholders at any given point in time. While external factors such as share price, access to credit markets and growth opportunities will dictate the timing of use of these levers, our selection criteria does not change. Prior to making an allocation decision, we forecast cash requirements and then seek to invest any access to the most economically impactful alternative. 
The first lever, returning capital to shareholders can be achieved in two ways. We believe that stock repurchase option delivers better risk adjusted returns when the stock is trading significantly below intrinsic value. In the future, we could also return capital to shareholders by initiating a dividend. We believe this is something that could be considered in the medium to long term once our construction program comes online and projects reach maturity. 
Another lever is growth investment, which includes greenfield development and M&A. Our goal is to earn at least 200 basis points to 300 basis points spread over project cost of equity. Given our geographic and technological diversity, it is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Instead, we calibrate the return requirements for factors such as country risk and project risk. We focus our development efforts on opportunities that leverage our existing footprint or in new areas with high growth potential.
The third lever is debt paydown and cost reduction. This not only increases our future financial flexibility but also creates future borrowing capacity. So here are some tangible ways in which we've executed within this capital allocation of framework very recently.
Stock buyback: as I've already mentioned, we repurchased $90 million worth of AES stock at an average price of $11.86 and have our authorization to repurchase another $410 million.
Growth: over the past few months, we've demonstrated success in both M&A and greenfield development. We completed the acquisition of the 1,246 megawatt natural gas-fired Ballylumford plant in Northern Ireland for $160 million, where we expect to earn after-tax returns of 18%. 
Business sales: as I discussed before, this year alone we sold three businesses for a total of $390 million.
Debt paydown: in the third quarter, we retired $214 million of note maturing in September. In October, we redeemed the remaining $290 million of our 2013 senior secured notes. This brings our total debt paydown by the parent company to approximately $1 billion during 2010, reducing carrying cost by $68 million. With these redemptions, our recourse debt now stands at $4.6 billion.
In summary, operations continue to execute well. Market demand is increasing in select markets, positioning us well to deliver on guidance metrics. In addition, our current metrics remain strong as we invest in the best available options, ranging from stock repurchase, debt retirement, M&A, or greenfield development.
With that, let me turn it back over to Paul to provide additional commentary on our construction program and development pipeline.

Now, I'll discuss those items that will drive the growth in our financial metrics in 2011 and beyond. These are important to cover as it will be helping to offset, one, the negative impacts of lower commodity prices, particularly the lower dark spreads in our U.S. merchant businesses as well as, two, a possible higher book tax rate in the event that TIPRA is not extended for 2011.
First, I'd like to review the status of our construction program, which continues to progress well. We currently have over 1,900 megawatts of capacity under construction of which 1,650 megawatts or 85% is expected to come online by the end of 2011. By the beginning of next year, we expect 720 megawatts to begin operations, including our 670 megawatts Maritza East coal plant in Bulgaria. The plant has already achieved full load operation during its testing and commissioning and is scheduled to be fully operational by year-end. This project represents an important foreign investment in Bulgaria and a successful completion marks an important milestone for the country and for AES.
We also have another 940 megawatts of capacity projected to come online during 2011. This includes our 520 megawatt Angamos coal plant in Northern Chile, which is the location of much of the county's copper mining operations. 
We have already commenced preliminary testing of the first unit and are on schedule to commence testing of the second unit in the coming months, which puts us on track to meet or even possibly beat our target of finishing the project during the second half of 2011.
Additionally, our 220 megawatt Changuinola hydroelectric project in Panama has completed the tunneling required for the powerhouse. The construction of the dam itself is approximately 60% complete and we expect the Changuinola project to be completed on schedule during the first half of 2011.
Now, I would like to review a bit more about how we are thinking about allocating our capital. As Victoria discussed, we will always compare the returns of stock buybacks or debt paydowns with investing in greenfield or acquisitions opportunities. What I would like to do now is to update you on some of these opportunities, many of which we have discussed with you previously.
Let me start by just pointing out that right now we have $1.4 billion of cash available at the corporate level. Of that, $300 million has been approved for investments in the projects already closed and in construction, and this leaves us with $1.1 billion available for new investments, which could include acquisitions, investments into wind and solar projects or large thermal power projects like Mong Duong in Vietnam, OPGC in India or the Masinloc expansion project in the Philippines. Very simply this $1.1 billion of available cash has a potential to create something in the order of $0.18 to $0.21 a share of additional earnings, assuming returns of 13% to 15%, depending on when we deploy the cash and when it starts generating earnings.
A good example of this earnings power, as Victoria mentioned, is the Ballylumford acquisition which we completed this year. Ballylumford is expected to generate earnings of $0.05 per share in 2011 based on an investment of $160 million, which came from the proceeds of the CIC equity raise. 
It's worth keeping in mind that our cash on hand has significant power to generate future earnings and cash flow, and that's why we are selectively focused on high quality acquisition opportunities in places like Asia, Turkey, Latin America and the U.S. in addition to greenfield opportunities that will generate longer term earnings growth.
And we do have a portfolio of attractive greenfield opportunities, and I would like to review a few of those with you now. 
In our wind business, the wind business continues to evolve rapidly and globally based on local incentives and market conditions. Therefore, we are pursuing a geographically diverse and flexible wind strategy, focusing on a number of key markets across the US, Europe and Asia.
One of the benefits of our multi-market focus is that it affords us the flexibility to ramp up or down our development efforts in specific regions as fundamentals strengthen or weaken, such as they have in the US, without impacting our overall momentum. This is something unique to AES as a global power company. We truly do have a globally diversified set of investment opportunities and we're not constrained by the policy changes at any one particular market or country or region as others might be.
In our wind business, we currently have 1,750 megawatts of wind capacity in operation, 175 megawatts in construction and 1,250 megawatts in advanced development, of which about half of that amount is outside of the United States. 
In the U.S. wind market in the near term we see weak fundamentals and uncertain policy environment and a lack of long-term offtake contracts. As a result, we have scaled back our development efforts in the U.S. wind market in the near term. Our current U.S. wind strategy is to focus only on the markets in California in PJM as these regions offer strong regional renewable portfolio standards in the absence of national legislation.
During the quarter we did achieve an important milestone on our 49 megawatt Mountain View IV project in California by signing a 20-year power sale agreement with the California Utility. We plan to start construction of the project in Q4 2010 with completion expected by the end of 2011. Progress is also made in PJM where we secured permits on the 50 megawatt Fox Hill project in Pennsylvania, which is expected be completed by the end of 2011.
In Europe, we see a much stronger market for renewables, including wind. We've increased our development activities in 2010 by acquiring large attractive development pipelines in both the U.K. and Poland. We anticipate reaching financial close in projects with a cumulative capacity of 65 megawatts during the fourth quarter of this year and we expect more to follow the 2011 to 2013 timeframe.
In Asia, in addition to our wind projects in China, we started some development in India, a country that desperately needs more generating capacity, which is also the fifth largest market for wind power. We have recently defined the definitive agreement to develop, construct, and commission our first wind power in India, 40 megawatt project in the state of Gujarat.
The project is expected to reach financial close by the end of 2010, with completion being scheduled for June of 2011. We are assessing other opportunities there and view the Indian wind market as increasingly attractive, due to the positive policy initiatives taken by the government over the past few years.
And with regards to the solar, our solar joint venture with Riverstone, although smaller than wind is rapidly catching up. The solar business is also subject to different incentives and market conditions around the world. We've decided to pursue a globally flexible solar business that could scale up or down based on how we perceive the various markets. This business currently has 123 megawatts in operation and construction.
We also have another 1000 megawatts in development in Europe, US and Asia. This quarter alone, we executed power purchase agreements for 47 megawatts in Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and India. Consistent with our other solar PV projects capacity under these agreements will be sold under long-term contracts. We think that it is fairly likely that this joint venture will have all of its $1 billion of committed equity invested by the end of 2011, with our portion of this investment being the $500 million. So things are going very well in our solar business.
Turning to our core power business, which includes our thermal power plants, our focus continues to be in rapidly growing emerging markets. We’re seeing many new opportunities in Latin America, Asia and Turkey. In the Philippines, we’re pursuing a platform expansion of our existing Masinloc coal-fired facility to meet the growing need electricity in the country. This year demand grew by 10% in this market.
Electricity demand in the Philippines is expected to grow by more than 5% every year. The current system is dependent on hydro and oil-fired generation, which creates opportunity to leverage our existing coal-fired asset to provide an additional, reliable, and economic source of generation.
Our existing 600 megawatt Masinloc facility was built in a way that included much of the critical infrastructure for an expansion unit, allowing us to provide one of the lowest cost alternatives for platform expansion, which we are currently pursuing. The expansion project will be another 600 megawatt unit that will leverage the existing facilities such as, transmission, interconnection, coal yard, ship unloading and an ash pond. We’re currently in the process of securing environmental permits and expect this project to reach financial close by the end of 2011.
In India, we’re also continuing the development of our expansion project in the state of Orissa, which is one of the largest coal resources of the country. This will be a 1300-megawatt coal-fired facility. We expect to reach financial closure by the end of 2011.
And finally, in Vietnam, subsequent to signing the 25-year power purchase agreement and fuel supply agreements for our 1200 megawatt coal plant, called Mong Duong, we have been focused on finalizing the construction contract and project financing. And based on the project progress to date, we expect to reach financial close in mid 2011.
All-in, we feel that we have a very compelling set of investment opportunities in development. In some cases, we expect to take on partners and capture some of the value created through development fees or similar compensation structures. But it's important to emphasize that we have been and we'll continue to be disciplined in our approach to allocating capital.
Having the capital available to invest in acquisitions through Greenfield opportunities, stock buybacks or paying down debt gives us an incredible amount of flexibility to create value on a per share basis. And given the cash flow generation of our businesses, coupled with a robust portfolio of management process, that only adds to our ability to create additional shareholder value over time.
I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today and I'll turn the call back to the operator, who will open up the call for your questions.

And beyond that I think what we'll always be doing is looking at the opportunities and the returns you can get on those opportunities. 
I don't currently expect that we're going to be short of opportunities to grow the company good returns, but that's something we'll continue to evaluate and look at that we have better returns than paying dividends. So I think if you look at the places where we're investing capital, or we have established strong positions in places like India, we're developing good positions in Turkey, Southeast Asia, Brazil, Chile, and all these places have big needs for more capacity in the future. 
And by becoming one of the biggest established players in these regions, I could look out to see easily at least another five years of higher return opportunities. But I think Victoria's point is that while we get through the construction - when these plants all get into construction, we stop investing in new projects, we'll be generating a lot of cash flow. And if we don't see good opportunities to reinvest the capital, then you could expect - we did look at a dividend. 
And once we get to point, we don't think they are good returns, but we'd look at what's the best way to use capital whether it's buying back stock, paying down debt, or distributing capital back to the shareholders through dividends.

We look at that as we talked about in the past in terms of what's the cost to capital for a given project, and can we beat that substantially to create net present value, really net present value per share. But there are a lot of different ways you can do that. And it's not just the cash flow coming from our operations, it's the cash that we might generate through portfolio management, and we've seen some good opportunities to do that over the past few years. The recent asset sales in the Middle East are another good example of how we will do that. 
So, I think we see the opportunity to source capital in ways that we can get the lowest source per cost for capital, for example selling assets where those are available where we can sell it effectively at low yields and then take that capital investment to higher yields, and that could be, as Victoria said, that could be investing in our stock, that would be investing in new projects. And ff we don't see those kinds of opportunities then it would be - we have the opportunity to then dividend cash back to shareholders. 
At some point, I would expect we get there. But your timeframe of three to five years, I think is probably valid to say. We probably don't see ourselves in that timeframe having a lot of spare cash to dividend, but it's something we'll continue to evaluate each year.

As Victoria mentioned, the Ballylumford one, we exceeded that, that's really the objective. But it's almost a view that if you weren't beating it by enough, it's almost not worth doing in terms of shareholders value creation. It also gets to some extent to the size of the investment because we also think about in terms of NPV. And if you create a certain amount of NPV divided by 800 million shares, how valuable is that. 
So it's a matter of how many deals are out there, how attractive are they and then how much can you invest. But it really comes down to what's the net impact per share in terms of the per share value that we create.

One of the things we're looking hard at is where do we see the best opportunities for the future, where do we want to set up our - put the focus of our development efforts in which markets. We see a lot of really interesting and interactive markets out there. 
We'll, probably as we do that, look at some markets and say they aren't as strategic in terms of growth opportunities, and those are places where if we can see assets where we could get good prices from selling them, they'd probably be good sources of capital or good ways to raise some capital, which should give us more money to buy back stock, to invest in new opportunities. But those asset sales typically take several months to get through. So there's a little bit of a lag time there, but that's something we will be and have been looking at pretty aggressively. I think we found a lot of success. 
What we found is we may invest on a project which would have returns that would be in the mid teens, but by going through portfolio management process, and if the timing is right, you can sometimes get your return on capital be - the return on equity to be in the range of 20%. And that's going to create some opportunities for us to do some things that will allow us to, again, just get higher returns on the capital by flowing in through more quickly and taking advantage of the opportunities to divest those assets which strategically aren't that critical to us and it would give us more capital to then use for higher value opportunities, whether that be buying back our stock or investing in new opportunities.

So the trade-off that we keep looking at, as Victoria said, we look out and try and figure what are the near-term cash needs.

And final question; as I look at your Greenfield profile and the large projects that you have under development, the bulk of those are going to come on line 2015 and beyond. Your current construction portfolio is going to be largely complete by the end of next year as it stands. So when we look at the years between, say, 2012 and '15, the three-year period, is it fair to say the accretion we should think about is either acquisitions or share buybacks in terms of an EPS accretion? Is that the way to think about bridging the current construction end and the contribution from the new portfolio coming on?

The renewables tend to have shorter timeframes for coming on line. Solar and wind, you’re talking about a year or less, from the time you started, the time they come on line. So that will be part of it. We've got a lot of investment going into wind and solar projects as I talked about. 
M&A is going to create some opportunities. For example, the privatizations in Turkey, if those were to go through, they are already operating. So I think its acquisitions it would be renewables, long-term Greenfield. 
The other thing that we're finding is with some of these Greenfield opportunities particularly this large equity commitments to bring on partners would be a way to off load some of that Greenfield investment need, but at the same time maybe creating some development fees in the process. 
Now that might come through additional carrying interest or management contracts, don't know how that shows up in the earnings, but it would be a way to potentially monetize some of those development opportunities as we going forward, because we do have a lot of projects that we're seeing interest on the part of partners to come in, in minority positions into some of our more advanced Greenfield development projects.

It is fair to say that they are more favorable on cash from our perspective than they are on earnings in the early years and they ultimately, as they should, balance out over time.

And so we had to run, for example, Nueva Renca plants on diesel and that's really drove off the cost of fuel and energy purchases in Latin America. 
Regarding Brazil you had the Parcel A discussions at the beginning of - actually end of last year, beginning of this year with ANEEL. And as a result of that, we had a slight decrease in the tariff in one of the sectors. It was a negotiation between the Association of [inaudible] and ANEEL, the regulator. 
The other issue that we had was the forecasted CapEx spend at Eletropaulo. The actual CapEx spend was less, and therefore, we did not receive the return on that capital which we did not invest. So those are really the items that we've had affecting this quarter's result. 
As you know, they've come out with a new proposal going forward for tariffs in Brazil that has a - main element that says a lower WACC for the country risk, which is dropping from around 9 to 7.15. It's a proposal and I think the market has expecting 8. We're, again, in negotiations. Over the next four months we'll have a final resolution of that. 
And the market in Brazil for companies like, Eletropaulo, CEMIG expect to have reflected this change. So those are the changes in tariff in Brazil. Backward looking it was really the Parcel A specific case. It was having invested less in Eletropaulo and going forward is this new proposal from ANEEL.

I think the Board will be evaluating is, because it might be negative for a month, how do you think it's going to be the following year? We tend to think about things from our cash flow standpoint. 
In other words, if you don't have to provide cash in then you'd certainly want to keep that option around if prices move around, because the prices have been volatile. The downside is you won't have much of a cash drag, but you might an earnings drag, because of depreciation, because of the lease payment. So that's what Ned and his team working through, what can we do to really mitigate that and how do we work through that. 
And that's why, we’re not able to give lot of clarity in guidance right now, but it's something we're working through. But do I look at that and say if things are where they are today in terms of prices, the total impact of, if we just kept going probably $0.10 or less in terms of the negative impact of that. But on the positive side, we've got these other plants coming on line, which is going to make up for that. But that's really the issue for us just to think about how far would you take this before you just say, we're not going to keep going on this. 
So that's really the issue that we and many others in the industry are facing right now.
