This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL's website at www.xlcapital.com. We posted to our website several documents, including our quarterly financial supplement and our fixed income portfolio data. On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Capital's CEO, will offer opening remarks; Simon Rich, our Interim CFO, will review our financial results; followed by Chief Investment Officer, Sarah Street, who'll discuss our investment portfolio. Dave Duclos, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations; and Jamie Veghte, our Chief Executive of Reinsurance Operations, will review their segment results and market conditions. Mike will discuss our guidance for 2010, and we will open it up for your questions. Before they begin, I'd like to remind you that certain of the matters we'll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of which they were made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.Now in connection with our previously announced proposed redomestication to Ireland from the Cayman Islands, XL Capital has filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC. Investors and security holders are urged to read the definitive proxy statement related to the post-redomestication when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. We will not be taking questions with respect to redomestication today and refer you to the proxy statement for additional information. XL Capital, its directors and certain employees, may be soliciting proxies from shareholders in favor of the proposed redomestication. You can find information about these individuals and XL Capital's definitive proxy statement for the 2009 annual general meeting filed with the SEC on March 9, 2009. And you can obtain free copies of the definitive proxy statement when it becomes available and other documents filed by XL with the SEC at both the SEC's website and at www.xlcapital.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Mike McGavick."

The results we reported tonight confirmed that XL is, once again, a market of choice for brokers and customers around the world. The evidence is clear.

The results we reported tonight confirmed that XL is, once again, a market of choice for brokers and customers around the world. The evidence is clear. Our P&C top line for the fourth quarter was within three points of the same quarter last year, a fairly remarkable result given our replanning at the beginning of 2009. And as you can see in our highlights on Slide 3, our P&C combined ratio was a very solid 96.4% for the quarter and 93.6% for the full year.But wait, what may be most remarkable is that we engineered this turnaround and maintained our underwriting discipline and historically prudent reserving standards in the depth of a continued soft market. By lowering our expense base and increasing both our efficiency and capital strength, we have certainly improved our current performance, perhaps more importantly, we have put XL in a position of competitive advantage to endure the soft market and for when the P&C markets turned the corner. On the asset side, we continued to realign our investment portfolio. We worked down our legacy assets, primarily Non-Agency RMBS and CLOs to a level where we can now move on from de-risking to optimizing our portfolio. This means we see future OTTI and realized losses as being made as economics unfold rather than as a result of aggressive portfolio repositioning.So while we will certainly -- rationally if we find good opportunities to sell, we'd expect the bulk of our legacy positions now to wind down over time through natural cash flows and maturities. This results in a portfolio more closely reflecting a traditional P&C asset based, thus allowing the earnings from our P&C franchise to go toward building book value, and our book value did grow in the fourth quarter. For the third straight quarter, as we recorded a 3% increase in book value per share to $26.60 (sic) [$24.60] and a 4% increase in tangible book value per share to $22.13. Total shareholder equity increased from $9.2 billion to $9.4 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our 2009 net income of $206.6 million compared to a 2008 net loss of $2.6 billion. A turnaround indeed. We generated an operating and return on equity for the year of 13.5%. And in 2009, our tangible book value per ordinary share grew by 72%. While no one can state with certainty when or how the underwriting cycle will turn, we believe the steps we have taken put XL in a position of significant strength. We are ready both to endure well the industries current challenges and take the advantage of the opportunities that can come when the hardening market whenever it comes. And with that, I'll turn it over to Simon."

Operating income was $235.8 million or $0.69 per ordinary share for the fourth quarter, with an annualized operating ROE of 11.4%, compared to $189.5 million, $0.57 per ordinary share and 12.4%, respectively in the prior ye",593,"Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Operating income was $235.8 million or $0.69 per ordinary share for the fourth quarter, with an annualized operating ROE of 11.4%, compared to $189.5 million, $0.57 per ordinary share and 12.4%, respectively in the prior year quarter. Operating income for the year was $917.3 million, resulting in an operating ROE of 13.5%. With a lower ROE for the quarter, reflecting our growing shareholder's equity.Turning to our summary financial results Slide 4. P&C net premiums earned were down 10.6% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the rolling effects of prior periods lower written premium. This rate of change is better than previous quarters, reflecting the improving level of gross premiums written relative to the prior year that we have reported quarter-on-quarter this year. We expect the improving trends in net premiums earned to continue into 2010.The P&C combined ratio for fourth quarter of 96.4% benefited from favorable prior development of $30.8 million compared to $268.3 million in the prior year quarter. The latter included a one-time benefit of $81 million from an agreement in connection with the business we acquired from Winterthur. Our underlying combined ratio, excluding prior development, natural catastrophes and restructuring costs was a full 8.8 points better for the quarter than in the prior year, and was also 1.5 points better for the year as a whole.Our operating expenses of $289.1 million for the quarter were $8.7 million higher than the prior year quarter. However, the current quarter included $21.8 million in restructuring charges, $12.1 million more of performance-related compensation in the prior year quarter, some costs related to the redomestication of our parent company to Ireland, as well as being impacted negatively by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Our underlying expense base is now much lower than a year ago. In fact, our two restructuring initiatives are now essentially complete and are both within our initial cost assessment. We captured the targeted savings and our guidance for operating expenses in 2010 reflects this lower run rate. Our tax charge for the quarter was $54.7 million. After adjusting for the impact of net realized gains and losses on investments, which have a low effective tax rate, the underlying effect of tax rate was 21.5% for the quarter and 14.5% for the year. The rates for the quarter reflected the impact of our year end reserve review, and also contained a number of non-recurring items, which together resulted in a disproportionately high level of profit to rising in higher tax jurisdictions. These items added $29 million to our tax charge for the quarter. But looking forward to 2010, we expect our underlying tax rate to be between 12% and 15%, which is consistent with our guidance for prior years.Our book value increased for the third consecutive quarter from $23.84 per share at September 30, to $24.60 per share at year end, with the main driver being our operating earnings. This was offset by net realized losses on investments in the quarter of $254.8 million net of tax. This total included $10.9 million from the sale of XL Re Life America, a transaction that closed in the quarter.As set out on Slide 7, we end the year on a strong capital position with over $12 billion in total capital, an increase of over 23% from the position of December 2008. We also have in excess of $1.5 billion of cash and investments at the holding company to maintain financial flexibility. In this regard, we are well positioned for 2010. Now over to Sarah to discuss our investment portfolio."

We sold $1.2 billion",656,"Good evening, we've made great progress on our de-risking plans during the quarter. We took advantage of what we believe to be a technically driven rally in certain asset classes to reduce our holdings in a number of legacy positions. We sold $1.2 billion of assets including CMBS, a Non-Agency RMBS, where we saw market prices approaching intrinsic values or where the underlying clashful [ph] (35.14) is still exposed to weak fundamental. We also reduced a number of the hybrid securities in the Life portfolio through both sales and tenders.We have now reached 80% of our targeted P&C de-risking in terms of reducing the potential negative mark-to-market if the market events of January 2007 grew to March 2009 were to repeat themselves. As Mike mentioned, further reductions in remaining legacy assets principally Non-Agency RMBS and CLOs will likely occur over time from natural cash flows maturities and compel where the economics make sense.Slide 8 summarizes our de-risking actions to date as well as for the full year. During 2009, we have reduced our exposures to volatile asset classes by $5.6 billion. Slide 9 compares the current asset mix of the portfolio at the beginning of the current asset mix to the portfolio at the beginning of the credit crisis at June 2007. We have a substantial reduction in non-agency structured credit and other risk assets. Given where we standing today, we are now focusing on the optimal realignment of the P&C portfolio rather than pure de-risking actions. The competition of the P&C portfolio is not as close to our strategic benchmark as we would like it to be, but we are still somewhat defensively positioned. The best example is that we are overweight government and related sectors and underweight high-quality corporate. However, given what interest rates are currently low, we will take our time and be patient to moving towards our strategic benchmarks looking through attractive spread and absolute yields, but also a good risk adjusted return.I will also that due to the decision to put the Life portfolio into run off and given that we run these portfolios on a closely match basis to the liabilities, we designated $546 million worth of Euro-denominated long-duration government within our Life operations account to maturity, which means that interest rate movement will no longer impact our book value from these holdings on a U.S. GAAP basis.Turning to the fourth quarter investment results. During the quarter, the investment market was relatively quiet, leading to a positive mark-to-market of $112 million. Slide 10 shows the drivers of essentially spread tightening with [indiscernible] (37.41) offset by increasing rates in both the U.S. and the U.K. Slide 11 shows our net investment income on the P&C and Corporate portfolio with $233 million, a decline of 24% compared to the prior year quarter, and down 2% relative to third quarter. At the asset associate with the exited structured products businesses are a much smaller component of our portfolio now. We will now focus on P&C and Corporate net investment income in 2010.Lower net investment income continues to be driven by the floating rate assets and defensive positions in cash and government. The P&C book yield remains stable at 3.5% rest of expenses and duration is unchanged to 2.9 years. We continue to prudently redeploy cash, sales proceeds and maturity achieved a blended reinvestment rate in the P&C portfolio of 3% during the quarter.Our net income from investment from affiliate was $26 million, reflecting strong 2.4% returns in our equity accounted alternative portfolio and a favorable third quarter mark-to-market impact from our private investments. During the quarter, we realized losses of $264 million, including a $121 million of OTTI charges, primarily on now below investment grade Non-Agency RMBS securities.Our net realized losses through sales, as I talked about earlier, was $132 million, excluding $11 million related to the sale of XL Re Life America. Now over to Dave to talk about our insurance operations."

Insurance results for the fourth quarter were strong and exceeded the expectations we set in February 2009, despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions impacting many of our clients. Although renewable premiums remain down as a result of exposure base reductions globally, both underwriting income and revenues were better than expected. Our combined ratio of 98% for the quarter was five points greater than our Q4 2008 results of 93%, which have been favorably impacted by prior year reserve releases and the Winterthur-related gains Simon mentioned.Adjusting for restructuring charges, the Insurance segment's Q4 '09 combined ratio was a very respectable 96.2%. On a full year basis, excluding the benefits of prior year development and restructuring charges, we achieved a combined ratio of 99% in 2009 compared to a 104.2% combined ratio in 2008. Gross premiums written declined 5.9% or $64 million from Q4 2008, significantly better than the first half decline of 26% and continues improving trends we saw since mid-February. The small decline is due to underwriting actions, determination of two MGA programs specifically, the continued global economic pressures and our push for rates, partially offset by increase to the renewal retentions and new business.Net premiums earned were down 7% or $66 million, mostly due to earn through of lower gross premiums written, as well as FX movements, which accounted for $23 million. On the loss side, our strong Q4 2009 loss ratio of 64.4% reflects both very limited cat activity and relatively low large loss activity in our property book.My last comment on financial results relates to our Q4 '09 operating expense ratio of 21.5%. While 1.4. points greater than Q4 '08, when normalized for the restructuring charges, the ratio is 19.7% for the quarter and 17.7% year-to-date. This is in line with expectations and reflects decisions that we made and communicated to you earlier in the year.Before I move on to market conditions, a few words on subprime and Madoff. For these events, the number of new reported incidents decreased significantly as we move through 2009. Specifically, during the fourth quarter, there was only new policy notice added to the list of potential policy exposures that we are tracking related to subprime and the related credit crisis for years 2007 and 2008. For Madoff, there were two reported new notices in the fourth quarter. We will continue our regular monitoring of these matters due to their ultimate resolution and it's most recent activity reinforces our confidence in current reserve levels.Regarding the market, we continue to see clear and steady improvements in retentions and new business admissions throughout the book, and Q4 was no exception. Our premium retentions ended the year just under 80% for all lines despite the challenging market and economic conditions, with Property and Casualty lines in the low to mid-80s.Fourth quarter pricing also showed modest, but continued improvement with an aggregate price change of plus 1.4%. We saw more meaningful price increase as reflected in professional plus 2%, and aerospace at plus 9%. Property rates were down 2% for the quarter.Looking forward to 2010, I can also share some preliminary insights. In Continental Europe, we're just under 50% of the book renews. On '11, we experienced strong retentions again across all product lines, casualty at 88%, property at 86% based on accounts renewed today. Indications in other regions are also at or near historical levels.With regards to pricing, initial indications based on January 2010 renewals reflect continued albeit small rate improvement. With the rate movement currently projected at plus 1%, compared to a rate of decline of minus 2% in January 2009. And while we worked hard to keep loss business to a minimum in 2009 and we succeeded during our January renewals, we've been very successful at winning back some business that didn't move.Looking back at 2009, what's important is we can say one thing, we did what we intended to do this past year. Renewing existing books of business with improved rate outcomes. Selectively, writing new business at the right price, taking the necessary actions to lower our expenses and all are remaining disciplined and are underwriting and engage with our brokers and clients. And now to Jamie to cover Reinsurance."

This compares to a combined ratio of 79.6% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the benefit of prior year reserve releases, we achieve the combined ratio of 97%, which compares to 97.4% in 2008.Turning to top line, gross written premiums in the quarter were $133 million, a 28% increase over 2008. However, excluding the impact of a commutation on a structured products contracts in 2008, gross written premium in the quarter declined by about 5%.For the full year, we had a combined ratio of 82.1%, which compares favorably to the 90.4% combined at 2008. Excluding prior year releases, the combined ratio for 2009 was 96%, a 9.7 point improvement over 2008. This improvement relates primarily to our lower level of property catastrophe and risk losses in 2009 and a shift in business mix.Gross written premiums for the year declined 17.7% to approximately $1.9 billion, reflecting competitive market condition, particularly in long-tail lines. Net premiums earned for the year totaled approximately $1.6 billion, a 20% decline. As we've said repeatedly over the year, we will shrink our portfolio when we don't feel market conditions warrant deploying our capital. Overall, we are very pleased with our 2009 underwriting performance.Turning to market conditions, we had a very successful January 1 renewal despite the challenging market conditions. We entered the renewal season with $941 million of renewable premium and ended up writing $1 billion with 6% increase. Almost 50% of this increase or $28 million of written premium was driven by recaptured business that we had loss at the end of 2008, due to security concerns by customers.The remainder of the increase was driven by selected new business opportunity and increased tax capacity in certain geographies. Broadly, we would describe the renewal season as competitive but orderly. Many firm orders came in quite late, but the brokers had a very little difficulty placing even the largest of programs, provided pricing clear the major-league markets. We continue to see customers increased retentions and push for improved conditions. Direct cat renewals showed risk adjusted reductions of 7% to 10% in the U.S., and averaged 5% on international account.Long-tail lines while showing flat renewals globally remained the source of considerable concern to us. While the reinsurance market remains discipline, we are heavily impacted by conditions on the direct side where certain sectors of the market remained quite competitive. With that, I'll turn things back to Mike for guidance."

So that's the first thing we focus on. And we think the market would be well aware, we're certainly well aware that we're in a very comfortable position at this point. While we don't get into specific degrees of excess, we obviously are getting very comfortable with our capital position.

I believe that even in these difficult times, meaning relative to the insurance cycles, there are always opportunities for a great underwriting company in XL's",638,"The most exciting thing for us is we now get the opportunity to do what we came together to do. I believe that even in these difficult times, meaning relative to the insurance cycles, there are always opportunities for a great underwriting company in XL's history. It has shown it to be one of those. For example, right now, I would point out that we continue to see rate levels that encourage us to selectively write in our professional lines. We see rate levels that continue to encourage us to apply a bit more capital into some of the catastrophe zones. We continue to see rate levels that encourage us in the aviation space. So even though we would cite the overall trends as negative, there are opportunities for us to go out there and sell XL. And that's exactly what we'll be doing. Also, we have kind of an odd opportunity. It's not huge, but it's meaningfully different from what the market is experiencing. And that is, of course, during late 2008 and early 2009 when there were these concerns around XL. There were some counter-parties that chose to cut back their lines, or in even handfuls of extreme cases, not do business with us. Those are people who admire the XL, often did so with, they said, regret. And we're able to go back to them now and say, ""Remember how much you love this."" And sure enough, we're seeing opportunity get back on lines of business with clients we know very well, and know very well the appropriate rate levels for. And that's a little bit of a lift opportunity for XL that it's kind of oddly gained, but nonetheless, beneficial. So when we look at the marketplace, we see it with probably a little bit more excitement than maybe some do, with who might have different mixes of business or not have that odd little opportunity for lift. As we go through that, what you'll see us doing is continually trying to strengthen the franchise toward being more opportunistic, where there are pockets of real rate opportunity. And that will be true throughout this phase of the cycle, and then aggressively true as we see any sign of turn. We are building our capital, building our expense base and conditioning our people to be ready to take full and appropriate opportunities when that cycle turn comes. So it's about sticking to the soft market playbook in a very aggressive way. It's about keeping real focus where we do have opportunities, and making sure not to leave them on the table. And then, it's about being ready and positioned to take advantage of what comes. Who knows when it will come, but we know it can't last forever, and we know how to get through this kind of period. And so, it gets very exciting for us around here right now. I'll say it one last time, having weathered what we've weathered, we realized, all of us at XL realized the fact that people stuck together. And because our people stuck together, our clients stuck with us, by and large. That just sends a huge message to the marketplace about the resilience of this franchise. And it reveals to us, excess capacity. We not only know we have additional capital, against which we could write. We talked about that earlier. But we also know that, as a company, we have excess capacity as a group of people. Because as that burden receives into the long-ago past, we still have the energy that it left behind. And that energy will be applied to the benefit of our clients, through innovation and through pursuing growth where we think it's opportunistic. So if you were sitting in our places right now, you'd be as excited as we are."

First, for the loss ratio standpoint, we feel really good about the position we're in. And as you can see, when you strip out prior year and CAT activity, we have stemmed the development upwards, in terms of our accident year loss ratios. And that's a result, admittedly in 2009, of no CAT activity, minimal CAT activity. Really no large property losses to speak off. And we didn't have a subprime loan in 2009, which we did have in 2008. Also, that was important to understand as we've got a mix shift, in terms of our business. And as an example, more of our business is written in the professional lines, which earns a stronger ROE. And also underwriting actions. For the last two years, we've been taking tough actions around business that's marginal. And most of that work is now behind us. So from a loss ratio standpoint, we feel pretty good about the fact that we think the loss ratio in 2010 is going to hold steady, as to what we produced in 2009. Now specific to your question about inflation, when you look at all of our lines totaled up, our inflation assumption is just a little bit below 4%. We have not moved that. Keep in mind that we look at that and pay attention to it very carefully. I would draw your attention to the fact that we don't have a lot of more comps, which at this point in time, frankly, we like. We are selectively looking to right comp business. But on a percentage of book basis, it's pretty minimal. And professional, again, is a big chunk of our business. So from a loss ratio standpoint, that gives you a little bit color. The other piece to take into consideration when you think about our combined ratio in 2010, we did a lot of work for the last 18 months. And in addition to some of the work that Mike mentioned at the beginning of 2009, corporate ride around expense reductions. We also did some things specific in this segment that were communicated in the fourth quarter. Our expenses, from year to year, are going to drop materially from 2009 and 2010. That's going to flush through to the combined ratio. So actually, it's a tough market, tough environment. But in terms of how this franchise is positioned, I would echo Mike's comments, we feel a lot better about the position we're in today than we did 12 months ago. And that has nothing to do with the financial crisis issue. So Jamie, for reinsurance?"

But I can tell you that for the team that worked there, and certainly, for me and I know the team that works here, we don't calculate our success as related to avoiding crisis. We're pleased that we've done so and excited for where we stand. But we really count our success when we are outperforming our competition in various significant ways.

I’m pleased to report to you another quarter of solid operating results even as the global P&C industry experienced some of its worst quarter one-cat events ever. Our nearly break even P&C combined ratio of 100.5 included a 14.3 points from the Chilean earthquake and storm Xynthia as our estimates from these losses from these two events remains within the preliminary range we published in March.
We did see some offsets against these caps with 6.9 point of positive prior year development, mostly from short sale property lines in both Insurance and ReInsurance. For the fourth consecutive quarter, we grew out book value for ordinary share, this time another 7% to $26.38 and by 8% intangible book value per share to $23.92, and total shareholders’ equity increased from $9.4 billion to $10 billion.
The first quarter caps impact on operating income and the continued increase in our shareholders equity resulted in annualized operating ROE of 6.9% for the first quarter. Without the impact of the two named cats, our operating ROE would have been 14.2%.
We see these results as an endorsement of our continued discipline in both underwriting and risk management, and I’ve said before, and I’ll say it again, perhaps as much for the benefit of any XL underwriters who are listening in, XL will not write coverage at uneconomic price levels.
So while we grew our P&C top line by 2.3% year over year, much of that growth, as we had anticipated and predicted at the beginning of the  year, came from lines we found attractive, including aerospace, cat and DNO as well as several long time customers returning to XL. We welcomed them back.
Meanwhile, we continue to lower our premiums written for multi-year Insurance premiums and from uneconomic businesses such as casualty, factory and Insurance that we exited last year. 
It was a quiet quarter for our investment portfolio, which is looking more like the P&C portfolio should, as our optimization program continues. And while we saw the benefit of a $522 million in favorable marks to market this quarter, I should remind you that what goes up goes down and as interest rates can rise or fall, we’ll just have to see what happens next.
We do know that our excellent liquidity and well-matched asset liability profile will let us ride out any interest rate volatility.
On a risk management note, in March of 2009 we instructed our portfolio managers, and here I guess I’m more in line with current news, I instructed our managers back in March of 2009 to stop purchasing sovereign debt from Greece and Ireland and severely restricted exposures to the debt of Portugal, Italy and Spain.
So our cumulative exposure to sovereign debt from these five countries is down to approximately $34 million or less than one tenth of one percent of our entire investment portfolio, including no exposure to Greece.
Likewise, we made significant progress on another risk management initiative. Last week, as you well know, our ordinary shareholders approved several proposals, most notably our change of parent domicile from the Cayman Islands to Ireland.
There are several more conditions to satisfy before this move will be complete, but shareholder approval was a significant move in the right direction, and we thank our shareholders for supporting the recommendations of management and the Board.
Also in current news, as you noticed in our release yesterday, we are very pleased to announce that Irene Esteves has agreed to join XL as our Chief Financial Officer. She is a deeply experienced business leader and we’re delighted to have her on our team. Irene joins us on May 17.
You can also look forward to the release of our global loss triangles this week. Now I’ll finish my remarks on the first quarter by saying that XL is once again firing on all cylinders in a very difficult market condition. 
Our underlying P&C results are solid and showing positive trends. Our risk management efforts are proving out and our organization, we believe, is getting stronger by the day. While the entire P&C faces challenges deploying capital in this kind of pricing environment, we believe we can build on XL’s success by providing our brokers and customers with the coverage’s they value and the service they demand.
Before I turn it over to Simon, I should comment on the terrible events in the Gulf of Mexico. Like anyone on this call, we deeply mourn the loss of life and we’re all watching with horror the continuing and likely environmental damage. 
It’s much too early to know what the insurable losses are on a total basis, and what portion of these losses XL might cover, but we can say this. We believe that our total property damage exposure to the rig itself is approximately $30 million including $5 million in reinstatement premiums and we have in fact, already paid much of this in claims. For what it’s worth, that would equate to a roughly $900 million industry event.
Now as I hand it over to Simon, I would like to thank him publicly for his outstanding service as XL’s interim CFO since the first of the year. Thanks Simon, and on to you.

Before I comment on the results of the quarter, I wanted to take a moment to expand on the comment in our press release on our calculation of operating income.We manage foreign exchange volatility from an economic perspect",767,"Thanks Mike, and good evening. Before I comment on the results of the quarter, I wanted to take a moment to expand on the comment in our press release on our calculation of operating income.
We manage foreign exchange volatility from an economic perspective through the matching of assets and liabilities. However, GAAP provides an asymmetrical treatment for the movement of assets and liabilities with the results of a foreign exchange gain or loss in the income statement really doesn’t represent any underlying economics.
We’ve discussed this with a number of you and what you’ve told us is that you too, really don’t find it a relevant indicator of performance. Accordingly, we’ve decided that we will no longer include foreign exchange gains and losses within our operating income, and we’ve represented prior periods on a consistent basis.
Page 30 of our financial supplements shows the operating income for each of the quarters since the first quarter of 2009 on this new basis. And now to the results themselves.
Operating income for the quarter was $150 million or $0.44 per ordinary share with an annualized operation ROE of 6.9%. This compares to $191 million , $0.57 per ordinary share and 14.9% respectively in the prior year quarter.
Turning to our summary financial results on Slide 4, P&C gross premiums written were up by 2.3% from the prior year quarter, reflecting targeted new business growth including the recapture of certain business lost in 2009, and $15 million more of non catastrophe related reinstatement premiums than in the prior year quarter.
P&C net premiums written increased by 6.1% reflecting a reduction in the levels of seeded premium in the quarter. I would say that part of this is a timing difference and we expect some $25 million of ReInsurance purchases that would otherwise have been made in the first quarter to occur in later quarters this year.
P&C net premiums were down 4.4% in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009. This reflects the rolling effects of prior period’s lower written premium. The P&C combined ratio for the first quarter of 100.5% shows the effect of first quarter cats of $181 million, which as set out on Slide 5, added 14.3 points to the loss ratio for the quarter.
This was offset in part by favorable prior year development of $87 million, which is line with the $90 million recognized in the prior year quarter. In the current quarter, $72 million of the releases were from short tail lines.
Our underlying combined ratio excluding prior year development and natural catastrophe’s was 93.1%, 3.8 points better than the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects the restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2009, changes in our business mix and the benefits of the higher non-catastrophe reinstatement premiums I referred to earlier.
Investment income on the P&C portfolio decreased in Q1 compared to the prior year quarter. This was due to lower portfolio yield, driven by the decline in LIBOR, combined with high concentrations of cash and governments as we move towards a portfolio that’s more typical of a P&C insurer.
During the quarter, we put new money to work largely in investment grade credit, achieving an average rate of 3.2% and as a result P&C’s duration increased marginally to three years. At March 31, 2010, the P&C portfolio book yield gross of fees, was 3.6%.
As a result of recent developments in certain European government markets, we’ve added additional disclosures to our fixed income supplement. As you can see, within the Euro zone, 94% of our government holdings are in France and Germany. 
At $229 million of operating expenses for the quarter, with $39 million or 15% lower year over year. The reduction arises principally from the fact that we incurred some $40 million of restructuring costs in the prior year quarter, with this reduction offset in part by $6 million of higher reported expenses arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
In the first quarter, we recognized a gain to ordinary shareholders of $16.6 million from the further repurchase of Series C preference shares and now the remaining par value outstanding of those shares is only $71.9 million.
The main drivers of our 7% growth in book value per ordinary share were operating earnings and the favorable mark to market of $522 million during the quarter. This arose from tightening credit spreads and from lower interest rates, and as set out on Slide 3, we ended the first quarter with over $12.5 billion in total capital, an increase of over 4% in the quarter.
Now over to David.

Our combined ratio of 101.6% for the quarter was 2.7 points higher than our Q1 2009 results of 98.9%, which had been favorably impacted by limited cat activity. Adjusting for both cat and prior year development, the Insurance segment’s 2010 combined ratio of 96.4% was 2.7 points better than the same period last year.
Gross premiums written in Q1 increased 3.7% or $41 million year over year. We are fully aware of the difficult trading environment, and I can assure you that we are in no way relaxing our underwriting discipline. Our growth was led by selected business wins and increased participation in attractive lines including professional, marine, upper middle market and aviation.
As Mike mentioned, it also included some significant win backs in several lines including professional, which is particularly rewarding. Net premiums earned were down just over 1% or $13 million as we recognized the anticipated earn through of last year’s lower gross premiums written.
On the loss side, Q1 cat losses were partially offset by some favorable prior year development largely in our short tail lines.  Our Q1 2010 loss ratio was 72.3% compares to 67.6% last year. However, when adjusted for both cats and prior year development, our underlying loss rate ratio is slightly better year over year at 67.1% versus 67.85. This was driven primarily by a lack of property losses, exiting less attractive businesses and the related shift in business mix.
Acquisition expenses were up slightly, reflecting modestly higher brokerage commissions in some line as well as a change in our business mix to lines such as professional and specialty that have always had higher brokerage commission structures.
This was partially offset by reduced operating expenses as our previously announced expense and organizational initiatives took hold. Total expense ratio for Q1 2010 of 29.3% was two points lower than Q1 2009.
Before I move on to market conditions, let me provide a couple of comments on our Professional book and why our profitability outlook remains in line with expectations. First, we saw lower than expected claims activity during the first quarter in our core professional book as the overall industry SEC class action frequency was lower than for the same period of 2009.
Second, various financial crisis related matters from the 2007 and 2008 period developed favorably for XL along with the rest of the DNO industry during the quarter. As a result, we remain comfortable with our initial valuation of XL’s financial crisis exposure and the reserves we hold against it.
Regarding the market, despite the challenging macro economic conditions faced by many of our clients we continue to see clear and steady improvements in both retentions and new business submissions throughout our book. Our premium retentions for the first quarter were just over 85% on a segment basis, significantly better than the low 70’s experienced in Q1 2009. We are now back on track for historical retention levels.
What does give us concern is broad market pricing. After three quarters of modest increases of plus 1% and plus 2%, we saw some give back as our overall pricing declined 1% for the first quarter, slightly better than the Q1 2009 decline of 1.6%. We saw this reflected across most lines, with the only notable pricing increases recorded in our specialty book.
While we recognize the challenging market, we continue to build on our Insurance foundations of underwriting and claims bank. We successfully recruited two market leaders, [Zarana Mogg] and Patrick Tannic to join our team. Zarana will be joining us as Chief Executive of our North America P&C unit and Patrick is already on board as our Bermuda country manager. Welcome.
Operationally we turned the switch on our new centralized global claims management system in the U.S., Canada and Bermuda. We see improved customer service, faster response, and lower cost as only three of the benefits of this upgrade. We intend to expand the system throughout South American, Europe and Asia next year.
XL is approaching 2010 much as we finished 2009. We continue to renew existing books of business where rates are acceptable. We’re selectively writing new business at the right price, and we continue taking necessary actions to lower our expenses, all while remaining disciplined in our underwriting and engage with our brokers and clients.
I’ll finish with some observations we made at RIMS, which was held in Boston last week. XL hosted over 225 client meetings at RIMS and we heard time and again what they were looking for; a lead writer than can provide existing and new products and services supported by solid risk engineering, a clear history of claims performance and a global presence, all supported by a solid capital foundation. It was reassuring to hear that what they want, we can provide.
And now to Jamie to discuss ReInsurance.

XL RE also enjoyed a positive quarter in difficult market conditions and significant levels of natural catastrophe activity. Our underwriting results for the quarter were good with a combined ratio of 97.8% resulting in an underwriting profit of $8.1 million. This compares with a combined ratio of 77.2% in Q1 of 2009.
Embedded in these results were losses of $81.6 million and $19.9 million from the Chilean earthquake and windstorm Xynthia respectively. The result also included positive prior year reserve releases of $53.8 million.
Adjusting for cat losses and prior year releases, the segment had a combined ratio of 84.8%, a seven point improvement over the first quarter of 2009. This improvement was driven by 3.5 points on the expense ratio related to our U.S. crop portfolio, acquisition, the cost of adjustments in Bermuda and Europe and non-recurring severance charges from the first quarter of 2009.
The loss ratio also had a 3.5 point improvement driven by the benefit of reinstatement premiums in Europe on non property business and a mix of business impact on property increase proportionately and a decrease in our trade credit business.
Turning to top line gross net premiums written were $790 million and $695 million respectively, basically flat year over year growth and a 3% increase net driven by reduced sessions on our multi-carrier crop portfolio.
Finally, turning tour Life Operations, contribution during the quarter was $49 million. This included a one-time gain of $13.8 million as a result of three treaties being commuted with clients.
I’d like to comment briefly on the Chilean earthquake before turning to market conditions. While it’s still early, and we are relying heavily on model results to establish our net loss estimate, we feel very good about our performance in this event. Our Latin American business unit contributed $66 million of the $82 million total loss to the segment with the remainder emanating from Bermuda and our London retro book.
Based on our estimate market share as published by the Superintendant of Insurance in Chile and assuming an industry loss of $6 billion to $8 billion, which we believe to be the case, our net loss is well below what peer market share analysis would indicate. This is principally due to fairly aggressive use of what I would describe as spot retrocession purchasing in the region.
The distribution of this loss into the industry with perhaps upwards of 80% to 90% into the ReInsurance market, is reflective of some broader issues in emerging markets we believe need to be addressed by the industry. This would include heavy reliance on proportional Insurance, event or asses the limits on these structures at levels that make them virtually meaningless, inadequate underlying rate levels and commission structures that do not allow sufficient margin to fund events of this magnitude.
While the event will obviously provide the market with an opportunity to address underlying rate adequacy, we will also advocate significant structural change in the market, principally a reliance on non proportional ReInsurance, our preferred product.
As we’ve mentioned in our last few calls, market conditions remain challenging. We’ve kept our top line flat due principally to recaptured business that was lost at year end 2008 and selected new opportunities, mostly in Europe.
We are broadly concerned about market conditions however. For example, our Japanese cap portfolio jus turned over April 1, with a risk adjusted reduction in pricing of 5.5%. This is in a market that clearly needed more rate as we entered the renewal, and as a result, we reduced our position in this very important market yet again.
On the long tail side as David mentioned, there is broad competition across the market although we do see pockets of positive in some areas of the professional lines and U.K. for example. Overall, we’re very pleased with our underwriting performance against this backdrop and we will continue to be vigilant with our underwriting as this phase of the market plays itself out.
With that, I will turn it back to David for Q&A.

So we’re very pleased with that number. We examine ourselves very closely given the market conditions and remain pleased. On ReInsurance, it’s flattish over time, maybe even slightly negative. 
But in terms of pricing, I’ll let my colleagues who are even closer to the markets talk about that.

First, just to amplify what Mike said, from a premium standpoint in the segment, you’ve got to recall, we certainly do painfully, the first quarter of 2009 was the most challenging time for us and our retentions had actually dropped down to 73%.
This quarter, our retentions are up almost to 86% so keep that in mind as you think about growth quarter to quarter. The other piece is new business. We had planned for a considerable increase over the new business result we achieved last year this quarter. We actually surpassed new business on that basis, but we’re far short of what the planned assumption was primarily because of market conditions.
And I would also say as Mike commented on, that part of our new business success was tied to customers coming home if you will, people that we know very well in terms of profitability. So from a production standpoint, we feel good about the segment results when you flatten out all the one off anomalies.
Let me quickly also before I turn it over to Jamie, maybe address your observation on the loss ratio, and actually when you do strip out cat activity and prior year development, we saw a slight improvement from first quarter 2010 as compared to first quarter 2009, and actually a fairly stable result quarter to quarter.
And your point was how are we doing that despite rate earn through which would suggest a negative impact. First of all, we actually started to change the pricing trend about a year ago this time, but I would say that earning though now would create a bit of an increase in the loss ratio. But a couple of things to keep in mind, first in the first quarter, we had less non cat property losses, especially in our international book.
That is one positive effect. The other, we  have exited less attractive businesses over the past six quarters. Abco, W. Brown, and some parts of our environmental, U.S. Marine and the remaining remnants of our surety business. We are picking up a bit of it in a related shift if you will in related business.
And then the last one I’d say is we’ve continually become better at risk management and underwriting modeling. All those things have added up to stabilize the loss ratio despite pricing pressure.

In the first quarter of 2009, property cat represented 16% of our net earned premium. It’s now 21%. And we did reduce our position in the trade credit business quite substantially, so there’s a big business mix change.
In addition, during quarters three and four of 2009, we took 2.7 and 2.5 loss ratio points from impacts from old structured product contracts. And finally, during this quarter, we enjoyed the benefit of $12 million of reinstatement premium on a non property program in Europe, which contributed quite substantially.
In terms of growth, in ReInsurance we try not to predict things too much because it can be lumpy depending on the amount of renewal activity we have in each quarter. As you know, the first quarter is very heavy, the second quarter is reasonably light and then we move into July 1 very heavy and then virtually none the rest of the year. It’s all going to depend on market conditions.

They’re spending more time closer to the markets. I would only preface any comment with a simple observation that if logic dictated pricing, we wouldn’t talk about declining pricing in many of our segments at all. So we have to be careful before we predict where the market will do even with what logic would tell us what it should do.
On the win backs and sensitivity to ratings, gosh you know, we noticed throughout the crisis if the market had been overwhelming rating sensitive, we would have lost a lot of business. Instead, a lot of business stayed with us right through the challenges.
We like to think that’s because our front line people are so capable and stayed together. But that caused our clients to want to continue to be backed by XL. So where there are those cases where a long time client took kind of a holiday from us, we work hard to welcome them back and we’re very encouraged by that progress.
I don’t think it’s a change in their view in how rating agencies work. I just think it’s an increased comfort in XL and we think that’s terrific. Rating agencies are important to us and we’ll continue to work to improve our standing with the two, that being S&P and Fitch who still have us on a negative outlook.

I think around this table we have people who have been through several complete cycles and we all know that there is theoretical tea leaves and we also know that every cycle we either lived through or have examined on a historical basis, acted in an extremely unpredictable and idiosyncratic way.
The most obvious is when you have some massive change in the capital base of the industry. We saw signs of that happening due to the credit crisis and then as the credit crisis back off, everybody calmed down about capital as a part of the component.
At the same time, you have I think these days, on a relative scale compared to say a decade ago, you have fewer management teams running larger books of business with greater emphasis on bottom line results, and you would think that would start to kick in here as the results run out of the benefit of prior year reserves and run into more difficult conditions.
Those are obviously industry wide comments. And I just think you could get a turn from any of those things, but the reality is, right now whereas there were some optimistic signs in our pricing as you moved through last year toward the end of the year, it’s kind of reversed itself in a small way at this stage, and we’ll just have to wait and see.
I can’t give you a better answer than that. I think it will be what it will be and we know that our job is to manage through the cycle, and that means we stay disciplined about our underwriting criteria. We don’t let it lag, and we’re very cautious about the other inputs that could affect the book of business that’s in place like inflation and the rest.

XL Group provided investors with another quarter of solid results.
We generated net income to ordinary shareholders of $192 million or $0.56 per ordinary share.
For the fifth straight quarter, we grew book value per share, this time by 5% and tangible book value per share was up by 6%. These gains were driven by investment portfolio market to market and net income.
Operating return on equity for the quarter was 10.5%. Our investment portfolio’s favorable market to market of 349 million this quarter was driven by interest rate declines even as corporate credit spreads widen. We believe our repositions to be in sheet portfolio weathered this latest credit market turmoil relatively well aided by its limit of exposure to the impacted Euro denominated governments.
Our P&C combined ratio is 92.2% and was still at 99% excluding prior year development.
In addition, we made another big step forward to complete our focus on our core team sheet strategy with our previously announced termination of the Syncora EID guarantees.
In the quarter, we also completed our redomestication to Ireland and we are very pleased that both S&P and Russell decided to retain XL in their U.S. indexes.
Also, our advances in risk management continued to bear fruit. One example of this is the fact that Fitch (ph) recently confirmed our insurance financial strength rating at a strong and upgraded our outlook to stable. Another example of our ERM progress in seasoning is the fact that our current loss estimates for the Chilean earthquake and windstorm Cynthia remained within our original arrangements as has been true for every cat events since your current management team was assembled.
Likewise, we have seen no material change in the property losses, we announced for the Deepwater Horizon Tragedy. Now, I’m on this Deepwater topic, perhaps I can save some time later. Similar to our peers in the marine and excess casualty markets with regards to the reliability as too complex and we think still too early to predict anything meaningfully.
Before handing it off to Irene, I would like to take Tom Hutton for his service on XL’s Board of Directors and particularly for his role as Chairman with our Special Committee on Enterprise Risk. Tom’s time with us and his success during that time is well illustrated by our Board’s recent determination that ERM at XL is now seasoned enough to allow our Special Committee on Enterprise Risk to be merge into a newly combined Risk and Finance Committee, and you can look forward to seeing transparency around XL’s approach to risk management in our upcoming 10-Q.
Now, I’d like to turn it over to Irene Esteves. This is her first call, of course, as our CFO. I can tell you that she has hit the ground running, already made substantial contributions and we are delighted she is here. Irene?

Turning to our summary financial results on slide four, operating income for the second quarter was $243 million or 0.71 for ordinary share. An annualized operating ROE of 10.5% compared to $291 million or 0.85 for ordinary",697,"Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Turning to our summary financial results on slide four, operating income for the second quarter was $243 million or 0.71 for ordinary share. An annualized operating ROE of 10.5% compared to $291 million or 0.85 for ordinary share and 20.1% respectively in the prior year quarter.
P&C gross written premiums were up less than 1%, reflecting continued underwriting discipline.
P&C net premiums written were up 3.4% versus the second quarter of 2009, reflecting a continued reduction seeded premium as well select new business opportunities in the Reinsurance segment.
P&C net premiums earned decreased by 5.1%, primarily due to the rolling effect of prior period’s lower written premium.
 The P&C combined ratio for the second quarter of 92.2% were slightly better than prior year’s 93%, and includes $83 million of positive prior period development, which is inline of the same quarter last year - $47 million of the releases in the current quarter or from short tale lines.
A significant portion of the remainder of the favorable development relates to 2006 and prior years for professional lines, particularly from business written outside the U.S. This favorable development was partially offset by strengthening of casualty reserves related to U.S. primary and international excess casualty exposures.
Our underlying combined ratio excluding prior year development and natural catastrophe’s was 97.6% or 2.4 points better than the prior year quarter. This was driven primarily by lower current year losses in acquisition cost. Dave and Jamie will provide you with additional detail on this in a minute.
Turning to slide five, investment income on the P&C portfolio decreased in the second quarter compared to the prior year quarter. This was due to lower portfolio yield, driven by low U.S. interest rates along with the cumulative impact of holding a portfolio of a P&C insurer. New purchases were mainly in high quality investment grade corporate credit as well as agency mortgage back securities.
The average new investment rate was 2.1%, reflecting the lower absolute levels we are currently facing.
Our P&C duration decreased to 2.7 years and the P&C portfolio book yield gross of fees at the end of the quarter was 3.5%.
Please note that on page 31 of the financial supplement, we have expanded our disclosure on government and corporate holding by country of risk. I’d also like to mention that we have elected, effective August 1, 2010, to designate another $2.1 billion from our live books investment portfolio is held to maturity. This is in addition to the 546 million that we designated in Q4 2009 and is intended to reduce the interest rate sensitivity on our GAP space book value.
Slide six includes the con-covenants (ph) of our increase in market to market, which was driven by lower interest rates on government securities partially offset by widening credit spreads.
Our $245 million of operating expenses for the second quarter of 2010 were $19 million or 7% lower year over year, reflecting the benefits from prior expense management initiatives.
Turning to slide seven, the largest drivers are our 5% growth in book value per ordinary share in the second quarter or an increase in the value of our investment portfolio and our earnings for the quarter, offset in part by charge to currency translation account.
The overall impact of foreign exchange movement during the quarter was a reduction in shareholder’s equity of about $50 million reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollars much like NC (ph) or European currencies. While the capital of our European subsidiaries as reported in our 10-K, totals approximately $3 billion, part of that capitals already held in U.S. dollars.
In addition, we have active hedging programs in place to reduce our exposure to non-dollar currencies, net of these activities where now long non-dollar currencies by about $400 million using June 30th exchange rates.
We set out on slide eight, we ended the second quarter with $13 billion in total capital an increase of 3.7% in the quarter with common equity at $9.5 billion, up 5%, and or book value per share is now $27.74 up 12.8% for the year-to-date.
Now, I’ll turn it over to Dave to discuss our insurance business.

Insurance segment results for the second quarter were strong given current market conditions as we continue to enhance our risk management activities and operational effectiveness while lowering exposures to less attractive markets.Our",755,"Thank you, Irene. Insurance segment results for the second quarter were strong given current market conditions as we continue to enhance our risk management activities and operational effectiveness while lowering exposures to less attractive markets.
Our combined ratio of 97.6% for the quarter was 2.1 points better than our Q2 2009 results of 99.7%. Adjusting for both cuts (ph) and prior year development, the Insurance segment’s Q2 combined ratio of 99.6% was 4.1 points better than the same period last year.
We are fully aware of the difficulty in sea environment, so as we face market conditions as competitive as pre-9/11 in many lines in geographies, we continue to fix, call, and grow our Insurance lines on a very selective basis.
We wrote 38 million or 3.4% less in gross premiums in Q2 than in Q2 2009, primarily driven by programs that we acted last year. Walking away from new and renewal business due to market pricing is also impacting premiums adversely.
Our premiums written for the second quarter were just over 95% on a segment basis, significantly better than the low 70s experienced in the depths of last year. We are now back on track with historical retention levels, a good spot to be as we see no imminent change in how this market is pricing business, which is quite competitive.
Our Q2 2010 loss ratio 68.2% was basically flat compared to 67.9% last year. However, when adjusted for both cats and prior year development, our underlying loss ratio was slightly better year over year at 70.2% versus 71.9%. This improvement was driven primarily by a lack of property losses compared to prior year, exiting less attractive businesses and the related shift in business mix to a more profitable line.
We are well aware that the majority of this benefit continues to be offset by deteriorating rate environment that is adversely impacting the loss ratio.
Acquisition expenses were favorably impacted by true-ups and are guarantee fund assessments and other non-recurring adjustments. Excluding these adjustments, acquisition expenses as well as operating expenses were right in line with expectations and on par with 2009.
Before I move on to market conditions, let me comment on our Professional lines business. Claims trends year-to-date continue to lower than historical averages and our core professional DNO book, and while we continue to maintain reserves from Professional lines, which we consider appropriate given the uncertainty, we note that various financial crisis related matters from 2007 and 2008 developed favorably for XL along with the rest of the DNO industry.
Regarding the market, health economic conditions mean many of our clients are buying less insurance from an industry with more than enough capital to meet those needs. As a result, broad pricing pressure remains. This was reflected in our second quarter’s overall pricing decline of minus 1.8% following the Q2 2009 rise of plus 2.1%.
While macro conditions may not change soon, we can’t say that pricing does react often very quickly but sometimes not in the sustained matter to large loss events especially in aviation rates, the last year’s loss event is an example and of course, marine and offshore energy rates to this year’s events in the Gulf of Mexico.
We are also booking trends in global programs in terms of price particularly in casualty where our leadership role allows us to drive summary and we continue to see good margins in our Profession liability book.
Operationally, we continue to rollout of our claims processing initiatives, service is a vital part of our business, of course, especially claims performance and we are proud of our strong track record. A record which most recently included the number one rating in service from the American Consul then generic companies for our Design Professional business.
I mentioned selective growth earlier. We see that coming from several sources. Our expansion into Asian markets, our extensions in the U.S. and global general aviation, our pushes into lines that complement our existing strengths including U.K. Professional and targeted the up our middle markets in DNO. We’re also proud that we attract recognize names in this areas of growth, recent examples includes Bob Shine, who is now leading our North America Casualty team and Garry Kaplan in heading up our North American construction practice. They join an already strong team and accomplished a great deal here at XL. We believe all of our actions and results are demonstrating discipline in our underwriting and responsiveness to our brokers and clients.
And now to Jamie to discuss Reinsurance.

XL RE enjoys yet another strong quarter of underwriting results and market conditions that continue to provide significant challenges.During the period, we achieved the combined ratio 78.96% resulting in an underwriting p",519,"Thanks, David and good evening. XL RE enjoys yet another strong quarter of underwriting results and market conditions that continue to provide significant challenges.
During the period, we achieved the combined ratio 78.96% resulting in an underwriting profit of $73.4 million. This compares to combined ratio of 78.2% in second quarter of 2009. The results included positive prior year reserves development of $48.9 million, which compares to releases of $55.2 million in 2009.
Adjusting for both cat losses and prior year releases, the Reinsurance segment had a combined ratio of 92.7%, a 0.7% deterioration from last year. This delta is driven almost entirely by deterioration in the operating and expense ratio resulting from a reduced net earned premium year-over-year.
In fact, our current loss, year loss ratio of 58.6% is actually showing a slight improvement over the 59% produced last year.
Turning to top line, gross and net premiums written were $421 million and 357 million respectively, up 12% year-over-year on growth and 15% net. This was driven by new business opportunities in Bermuda, additional recaptured clients, some new business in Latin America and some timing issues in both Bermuda and Brazil.
As we’ve said before, the lumpy nature of Reinsurance portfolios sometimes creates movements of this nature in written premium and does not reflect broader issues around strategy or an improvement in market conditions. I can assure you the market is very tough and we remain very disciplined.
Turning to the market, the July 1st, renewal environment was certainly more challenging than we expected going in. As you’ve no doubt read and heard repeatedly over the last week, U.S. cat rates deteriorated on a risk adjusted basis by 10% and international rates were down 5% during the renewal.
With respect to floor to business, we were pleased to be named the first Bermuda Company named an eligible reinsurer by the insurance department in the State. This reduces our post loss collateral obligations substantially and allows us to operate more freely in this very important market.
In addition, significant amounts of property proportional business were moved. During last quarter’s call, I outlined what we believed are the necessary changes to that market. Frankly, while improvements were cheap it was nowhere near what we quoted or expected and we produced our capacity commitments in that market accordingly. This was a significant disappointment.
On the long tail side, we continue to see competitive conditions across the market with pockets of exceptions such as the U.K. motor market. The U.S. is very challenging across the market.
Finally, turning to our Life operations, the contribution before net realized losses during the quarter were $23 million. This quarter there was no one off gains from treaty computation, whereas few ones contribution of $49 included a one-time gain of $13.8 million as a result of three treaties being commuted with one client.
Overall, we are very pleases with our underwriting performance against a back draft of continued difficult market conditions and we will be vigilant as this phase of the market plays itself out.
With that, I will turn it back to David for Q&A.

And I would tell you that pricing in the DNO business, as evidence by the second quarter pricing has been under some pressure. But, and I hope - hopefully this comment doesn’t attract more attention to this line. We still feel really bullish about the profitability and in fact on new basis professional lines globally still present its more opportunities for helping returns in most other line, but you’re right on your spot relative to your observation on competition.

The last was - although it was about 10 million of sales that we made, we did actually reduced some of our exposure to some European banks earlier in the quarter as a result of the reviewing our exposure there.
And then the last chunk was on the corporate securities, which was really a board of change of intent to hold or more likely to not because it’s part of our de-leverage or de-risking activities. We’re looking at - before we expect it would deem out of some of our MTNs over the next couple of quarters. So, that’s really where we realized losses.
On the - where on we’re on the de-risking and I think as we’ve said, we still have some assets that we will look to work out overtime in terms of the Legacy portfolio, particularly in the non-agency RMDS and the CDOs, which is actually south (ph) of non-agency RMDS this quarter. It was about $50 million, so we’re actually pleased with the price that we achieved. But we are going to do it gradually when we see sort of prices that are economic and we’re much more focus on sort of the optimization of the portfolio today than we are on sort of pure de-risking.

As those conditions subsided, we often saw business come back very quickly because of that underlying depth of relationship. So, it wasn’t so much that someone else took it from us, but rather they just felt they couldn’t stay with us until things improved, and when it improved, they directed brokers or reach out to us and just got right back into the relationship. So, it’s really to us a testimony to the strength of our core book and the relationships we built over many years through the kind of quality service and particularly claims service we provide.

Our third quarter results reflect continued solid performance offset by an unusual number of unrelated larger losses. But to give weight to my view on our strong underlying results, I would point to the fact that our overall P&C loss ratio o",612,"Good evening. Our third quarter results reflect continued solid performance offset by an unusual number of unrelated larger losses. But to give weight to my view on our strong underlying results, I would point to the fact that our overall P&C loss ratio of 64% barely moved year-over-year, despite these difficult and soft market conditions and our reinsurance segment had another terrific quarter with a loss ratio of 43% and a combined ratio of 75%.
At the same time, this is a quarter in which our earnings were affected by an unusual number of smaller catastrophes and large losses, such as the New Zealand earthquake, floods in Germany and higher frequency of other news worthy loss events.
As I have mentioned in my previous calls, by the nature of XL’s global footprint and the large limits and complex risk XL takes on, this kind of lumpiness will happen from time-to-time. Importantly, after review, these losses were consistent with our risk management and underwriting standards.
Prior year reserve development was again a strong contributor in the quarter and while these benefits of past reserving actions are realized, we continue to exercise the disciplined approach to establishing current reserve levels.
In reinsurance, we had an $86.8 million in a positive prior year development and in insurance we had a $4.5 million reserve strengthening. But let me point out, that in the third quarter is not one in which we do a deep review of some of the lines in insurance that have been among our best performing recently.
The fourth quarter will affect a more comprehensive review of all of our product lines so stay tuned. As we again -- and we again delivered strong book value per share growth for the sixth straight quarter this time by 6.6% on a fully diluted basis. Our growth in book value was driven primarily by the positive impact on investment portfolio mark-to-market of lower U.S. and U.K. interest rates.
You may recall at the beginning of the year we forecast a low double-digit ROE for the year, since then, between the caps that hit earlier in the year combined with the exceptional strengthening of our balance sheet in the year-to-date have held our operating ROE in the single digits.
Likewise at the beginning of the year, we forecast we might be able to incur some growth in our P&C gross written premiums, but as the markets have developed of course, the competition has intensified and our view, for example, I would point out that aviation might have had the shortest hard market in history, and so, our view now as we look forward to the end of the year is -- it might be flat or slightly down in terms of total gross written premium. This current market pricing makes it unlikely that we would meet that top goal that we have laid out. Our underwriters are simply putting down them.
Since there are currently fewer acceptable places to put your money work however, we have begin -- back to shareholders. We started buying back shares in August, since then have bought back $375 million worth of shares and reduced our Q2 2010 share count by 5.5%. And with that authorization or exhausted our Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion share buyback program.
As I have said consistently our first priority is to put any excess capital to invest in our core business. But if there are no viable options to do that we will return our capital to shareholders. You can be assure that this deal is still the case.
Now, let me turn it over to Irene to discuss our financial results.

406440,114167460,84586,"XL Group plc, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","XL Group Ltd","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Turning to our summary financial results on slide four, P&C gross premiums written for the third quarter 2010 were down 3.7% year-over-year. As Mike mentioned, this reflects our disciplined underwriting in the current soft",1001,"Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Turning to our summary financial results on slide four, P&C gross premiums written for the third quarter 2010 were down 3.7% year-over-year. As Mike mentioned, this reflects our disciplined underwriting in the current soft pricing environment, including a limited appetite for viewing long-term business.
For example, accelerated premiums from insurance long-term agreements were down $24 million versus the same quarter last year. P&C net premiums written were down 2.4% versus the third quarter of 2009 with an increase of 3.3% in reinsurance offset by a decrease of 5.1% in the insurance segment.
P&C net premiums earned fell by 1.9%, primarily due to the rolling effects of prior periods lower premiums written. Prior year development in the quarter was a favorable $82.3 million or 6.5 loss ratio points. This reflects favorable development in the reinsurance segment, partially offset by small amount of strengthening in the insurance segment.
To put this in perspective, it is important to keep in mind how our reserving process works. Q3 is what we refer to as an actual versus expected or A versus E quarter for our insurance segment and the U.S. reinsurance business. Since we do our detailed roundup reserve reviews in the second and fourth quarters with the interim quarters based on actual versus expected, you would generally not expect to see much movement in prior year reserves in the first and third quarters for these portions of our business which account for 80% of our reserves.
In the A versus E reviews, we respond to movements in the shorter tail lines or to specific claim movements in older mature years and that’s what you see this quarter. With the $4 million strengthening in insurance relating primarily to specific property claims activity. The remaining 20% of our reserves are dominated by non-U.S. casualty and shorter tail reinsurance business for which reserves are reviewed quarterly with more comprehensive assumption updates performed annually.
This business is the source of a favorable development this quarter in reinsurance. These releases were somewhat higher than previous quarters due to favorable development in two specific areas. The processing of reinsurance to close of several whole account contracts from the 2000 year of account contributed $30 million in reserve releases and favorable developments on specific professional liability claims in the 2001 and 2002 report years contributed $25 million. The remaining favorable development for reinsurance was spread across all classes and all non-U.S. geographies.
Our $236 million of operating expenses for the third quarter of 2010 were basically flat year-over-year but expenses for the first three quarters of 2010 were down 7.4% versus the first three quarters of 2009, reflecting the run rate benefits from our prior expense management initiative. Operating income for the third quarter was $175 million or $0.52 per ordinary share with an annualized operating ROE of 7.2%.
Now turning to slide five, our investment income on the P&C portfolio of $218 million, decreased by 8% in the third quarter, compared to the prior year quarter. This was primarily due to the lower portfolio yields driven by lower U.S. interest rates. New purchases were mainly in high quality investment grade corporate credit. The average new investment rate was 2.3%, reflecting the lower absolute rate levels we are currently facing.
Our P&C duration was stable from the prior quarter at 2.7 years and during the quarter the P&C portfolio book yield net of fees was 3.14%. As of quarter end, the gross book yield on the P&C portfolio was 3.5%.
As of September 30th, the total of $2.8 billion from our Life books investment portfolio was designated as held to maturity and reduced the interest rate sensitivity of our GAAP based book value by approximately $300 million for every 100 basis point parallel interest rate change in the euro and sterling markets.
There was a favorable $436 million mark-to-market in the third quarter, driven by lower interest rates on U.S. and U.K. securities and modest spread tightening. This has brought our entire available for sale portfolio into a net unrealized gain position of $157 million and our total portfolio to a net gain position of $236 million after tax. Net income from investment fund affiliates was down substantially from last year due to challenging market conditions for alternative managers, compared to an exceptional result last year this quarter.
Now turning to slide six, the largest contributor to our third quarter growth in book value per share was $1.39 per share change in unrealized gains on investments. Our share buyback activity in Q3 added another $0.41 per share.
Since the beginning of the third quarter to date, we have purchased 18.8 million shares at an average cost of $19.95 for a total of $375 million. During Q3, we repurchased 13.9 million shares at an average cost of $19.33. We purchased another 4.9 million shares after the quarter close. At the end of the second quarter we started -- we have 342 million ordinary shares outstanding. At the end of the third quarter we had 328 million and as of today there’s approximately 323 million shares.
As Mike mentioned, we also announced in our release this afternoon that our Board has authorized another $1 billion worth of share buybacks. Our timing if and when we buyback shares will be driven by market conditions.
Please note that we also recognized $0.45 per share dilutive effect during the quarter. This was caused principally by our 2011 equity security units or ESUs moving into the money, as our share price rose above the price threshold of $18.88 for those units. I would remind you that XL will issue a maximum of just over 30.4 million shares in August 2011 in connection with these units.
With all of these changes, we ended up the third quarter with $29.56 book value per share, up $0.07 -- 7% from Q2 and up 20% from the beginning of the year.
With that, let me turn it over to Dave Duclos to review our insurance business.

From time-to-time we have quarters where our results are impacted by large non-cat losses. We last had this occur six quarters ago and it happened again in Q3 2010 as we had large property loss",593,"Thanks, Irene. XL ensures again specialized in complex risks. From time-to-time we have quarters where our results are impacted by large non-cat losses. We last had this occur six quarters ago and it happened again in Q3 2010 as we had large property losses, excess casualty and aviation losses. This is to be expected given the nature of our business.
The combined ratio for the quarter of 104% was 5.4 points higher than our Q3 2009 results of 98.6%. Adjusting for both cats and prior year development the segments Q3 combined ratio of 100.6% was 2.7 points higher than the prior result of 27.9%. The cat impact in this years third quarter result was 2.8 points as compared to a prior year cat impact of 1.7 points, driven by the New Zealand earthquake and the German floods. Our net cat loss in the quarter was $25 million.
On the loss side, the large non-cat loss I previously mentioned impacted our results by $36 million. While these losses negatively impacted the quarter, our year-to-date accident year loss ratio ex-cats the 68.1% was actually slightly better than the prior year ratio of 69.5%.
This loss ratio improvement was due to a mix of business changes offsetting rate reduction, as well as the favorable impact from a financial line contract, which benefited the current year loss ratio by 1.8 points and year-to-date by 0.6 points.
Gross premiums written in Q3 decreased 3% or $30 million. Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange premiums decreased 1.6%. Considering the challenging trading environment we find ourselves in we consider this an appropriate result given our focus on maintaining our underwriting discipline.
Net premiums earn were down 3.7% or $33 million, largely reflecting the earn-through of lower gross premiums written. As we have commented on in the past, we continue to remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves related to the financial crisis exposure.
Although, D&O claim trends and favorable developments of various financial crisis related matters from the 2007 and 2008 period might suggest to some a bit of conservatism on our part. The most recent financial institution developments serve as an example as to why a careful and cautious view is appropriate. Here, again, we are carefully monitoring and analyzing the financial institution situation to gauge the impact, if any, on our D&O and E&O books of business.
I expect my comments regarding market conditions won’t be surprise any of you. It’s a theme that you are hearing pretty consistently. Competition for business has gotten more intense in many areas and it’s clear that there’s an abundance of capital at work fighting for a shrinking insurance dollar.
The market is not headed in the right direction in the recent quarters pricing results with some lines in geographies at pre 9/11 pricing levels. Well, our retention and submission flow are at or better than expected in most of our businesses, soft pricing means we have decided to write less new business than we did last year.
That said, we continue to pursue selective growth initiatives including expansion into the Asian markets, build out of our European professional book, our U.S. and global general aviation initiative, as well as several other opportunities that are various stages of analysis and implementation like the new North America construction practice.
We are staying disciplined and focusing on where we can improve profit while positioning our business for growth, especially as it relates to distribution and network development, operational efficiency, emerging markets and expanding our product suite.
And now to Jamie to discuss reinsurance.

XL re-enjoyed another very strong quarter of underwriting results in challenging market conditions. During the period, we achieved a combined ratio of 75% resulting in an underwriting profit of $99.1 million. This compares to a combined ratio of 80.5% in the third quarter of 2009. Our results this quarter included positive prior year reserve development of $86.8 million, which compares to releases of $65.9 million in the third quarter of last year.
Adjusting for both cat losses and prior year releases, this segment had a combined ratio of 86.5%, which compares favorably to the 93.4% achieved in the third quarter of last year. The largest components of this improvement were reduced attritional property losses in our U.S. business unit representing 2.8 loss ratio points and a reduction in losses from our old structured product unit, representing 2.2 points and some business mix changes.
Turning to topline, gross net premiums written were $534 million and $389 million, respectively, a reduction of 5% on the gross and an increase of on the net of 3.3%. The reduction in the gross book came principally from the Bermuda and U.S. operations, and resulted from reductions on new and renewal business, some timing differences in Bermuda, and reduction in our U.S. crop portfolio. On the net side, the increase resulted from reduced sessions on this crop portfolio.
Finally, with respect to our Life operation the contribution during the quarter was $20.7 million, essentially flat from the third quarter of last year.
Turning to the market, we commented on the July 1 renewals on our last earnings call. In a nutshell cat market pricing was off 10% on a risk adjusted basis in the U.S. and 5% internationally. Long tail lines remain a significant challenge other than in very specific pockets of opportunity. Otherwise, the quarter was as usual, a quiet one for reinsurance business activity.
We have spent a significant amount of time with customers and brokers at various conferences such as Monte Carlo, PCI and CIAB. These discussions have been very encouraging relative to our franchise and in many long-term business relationships we have established over the years.
Nevertheless, there is clearly an expectation that competitive trading conditions will continue for some time in most sectors of the market. We are confident that the quality of our portfolio and our analytical capabilities will serve us well in these conditions. We believe this is an underwriters’ market and we will continue to exert discipline in our activities as we prepare for our year-end renewals.
With that, I’ll turn it back to David for Q & A.

So you are going to see that effect continue because those performing books continue to role off and have less influence.
At the same time we do have some lines of business well we are thrilled by the results and we are still find them adequate in and so in those lines we continue to be able to write some new business to offset the impact of the loss business from the discipline underwriting. So we have some pockets where we are okay with that and we can keep writing the business. We are continue to have an impact from the re-underwriting actions and those will continue to roll up and net of that is that so far tightened hard we can able to keep our loss ration fairly flat.

Once we have that taken care of then we do look at what’s left over after we’ve satisfied those things and our first objective is to improve the franchise, strengthen the franchise and we do look for opportunities that would meet our long-range hurdles.
And when we’re not excited by anything we see then we turn to giving this capital back to our shareholders, through as we have in this case, share repurchases. That same process will be an active process and an ongoing process and as periodically we evaluate those three factors and as Irene indicated where the market is we’ll make our adjustments accordingly.

Not abnormal as I said if you look at this over a full year basis but that’s about as much color that I’d give you and it’s nothing that causes any concern and the one thing I’d say is we’ve worked awful hard to get this franchise in the spot it is and we’re looking very carefully and underwriting quality.

This call is being simultaneously webcast on XL’s website at www.xlcapital.com. We’ve posted to our website several documents including our quarterly financial supplement and our fixed income portfolio data.
On our call today, Mike McGavick, XL Capital’s CEO will offer opening remarks. Simon Rich, our Interim CFO will review our financial results followed by David Duclos, our Chief Executive of Insurance Operations and Jamie Veghte, Chief Executive of ReInsurance operations who will review the segment results and market conditions. Sarah Street, our Chief Investment Officer is with us today and available for Q&A.
Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that certain of the matters we’ll discuss today are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and expectations. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements, and therefore you should not place undue reliance on them.
Forward-looking statements are sensitive to many factors including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other documents on file with the SEC that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation publicly to revise any forward-looking statement in response to new information, future developments or otherwise.
And with that, I’ll turn it over to Mike McGavick."

I’m pleased to report to you another quarter of solid operating results even as the global P&C industry experienced some of its worst quarter one-cat events ever. Our nearly breakeven P&C combined ratio of 100.5 included a 14.3 points from",868,"Good evening. I’m pleased to report to you another quarter of solid operating results even as the global P&C industry experienced some of its worst quarter one-cat events ever. Our nearly breakeven P&C combined ratio of 100.5 included a 14.3 points from the Chilean earthquake and storm Xynthia as our estimates from these losses from these two events remains within the preliminary range we published in March.
We did see some offsets against these caps with 6.9 point of positive prior year development, mostly from short sale property lines in both Insurance and ReInsurance. For the fourth consecutive quarter, we grew out book value for ordinary share, this time another 7% to $26.38 and by 8% intangible book value per share to $23.92, and total shareholders’ equity increased from $9.4 billion to $10 billion.
The first quarter caps impact on operating income and the continued increase in our shareholders' equity resulted in annualized operating ROE of 6.9% for the first quarter. Without the impact of the two named cats, our operating ROE would have been 14.2%.
We see these results as an endorsement of our continued discipline in both underwriting and risk management, and I’ve said before, and I’ll say it again, perhaps as much for the benefit of any XL underwriters who are listening in, XL will not write coverage at uneconomic price levels.
So while we grew our P&C top line by 2.3% year over year, much of that growth, as we had anticipated and predicted at the beginning of the year, came from lines we found attractive, including aerospace, cat and DNO as well as several long time customers returning to XL. We welcomed them back.
Meanwhile, we continue to lower our premiums written for multi-year Insurance premiums and from uneconomic businesses such as casualty, factory and Insurance that we exited last year.
It was a quiet quarter for our investment portfolio, which is looking more like the P&C portfolio should, as our optimization program continues. And while we saw the benefit of a $522 million in favorable marks to market this quarter, I should remind you that what goes up goes down and as interest rates can rise or fall, we’ll just have to see what happens next.
We do know that our excellent liquidity and well-matched asset liability profile will let us ride out any interest rate volatility.
On a risk management note, in March of 2009, we instructed our portfolio managers, and here I guess I’m more in line with current news, I instructed our managers back in March of 2009 to stop purchasing sovereign debt from Greece and Ireland and severely restricted exposures to the debt of Portugal, Italy and Spain.
So our cumulative exposure to sovereign debt from these five countries is down to approximately $34 million or less than 1/10 of 1% of our entire investment portfolio, including no exposure to Greece.
Likewise, we made significant progress on another risk management initiative. Last week, as you well know, our ordinary shareholders approved several proposals, most notably our change of parent domicile from the Cayman Islands to Ireland.
There are several more conditions to satisfy before this move will be complete, but shareholder approval was a significant move in the right direction, and we thank our shareholders for supporting the recommendations of management and the Board.
Also in current news, as you noticed in our release yesterday, we are very pleased to announce that Irene Esteves has agreed to join XL as our Chief Financial Officer. She is a deeply experienced business leader and we’re delighted to have her on our team. Irene joins us on May 17.
You can also look forward to the release of our global loss triangles this week. Now I’ll finish my remarks on the first quarter by saying that XL is once again firing on all cylinders in a very difficult market condition.
Our underlying P&C results are solid and showing positive trends. Our risk management efforts are proving out and our organization, we believe, is getting stronger by the day. While the entire P&C faces challenges deploying capital in this kind of pricing environment, we believe we can build on XL’s success by providing our brokers and customers with the coverages they value and the service they demand.
Before I turn it over to Simon, I should comment on the terrible events in the Gulf of Mexico. Like anyone on this call, we deeply mourn the loss of life and we’re all watching with horror the continuing and likely environmental damage.
It’s much too early to know what the insurable losses are on a total basis, and what portion of these losses XL might cover, but we can say this. We believe that our total property damage exposure to the rig itself is approximately $30 million including $5 million in reinstatement premiums and we have in fact, already paid much of this in claims. For what it’s worth, that would equate to a roughly $900 million industry event.
Now as I hand it over to Simon, I would like to thank him publicly for his outstanding service as XL’s interim CFO since the first of the year. Thanks, Simon, and on to you."
406440,102276710,1955544,"XL Capital Ltd., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 04, 2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","XL Group Ltd","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Before I comment on the results of the quarter, I wanted to take a moment to expand on the comment in our press release on our calculation of operating income.We manage foreign exchange volatility from an economic perspec",763,"Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Before I comment on the results of the quarter, I wanted to take a moment to expand on the comment in our press release on our calculation of operating income.
We manage foreign exchange volatility from an economic perspective through the matching of assets and liabilities. However, GAAP provides an asymmetrical treatment for the movement of assets and liabilities with the results of a foreign exchange gain or loss in the income statement really doesn’t represent any underlying economics.
We’ve discussed this with a number of you and what you’ve told us is that you too, really don’t find it a relevant indicator of performance. Accordingly, we’ve decided that we will no longer include foreign exchange gains and losses within our operating income, and we’ve represented prior periods on a consistent basis.
Page 30 of our financial supplements shows the operating income for each of the quarters since the first quarter of 2009 on this new basis. And now to the results themselves.
Operating income for the quarter was $150 million or $0.44 per ordinary share with an annualized operation ROE of 6.9%. This compares to $191 million, $0.57 per ordinary share and 14.9% respectively in the prior year quarter.
Turning to our summary financial results on Slide 4, P&C gross premiums written were up by 2.3% from the prior year quarter, reflecting targeted new business growth including the recapture of certain business lost in 2009, and $15 million more of noncatastrophe related reinstatement premiums than in the prior year quarter.
P&C net premiums written increased by 6.1% reflecting a reduction in the levels of seeded premium in the quarter. I would say that part of this is a timing difference and we expect some $25 million of ReInsurance purchases that would otherwise have been made in the first quarter to occur in later quarters this year.
P&C net premiums were down 4.4% in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009. This reflects the rolling effects of prior period’s lower written premium. The P&C combined ratio for the first quarter of 100.5% shows the effect of first quarter cats of $181 million, which as set out on Slide 5, added 14.3 points to the loss ratio for the quarter.
This was offset in part by favorable prior year development of $87 million, which is line with the $90 million recognized in the prior year quarter. In the current quarter, $72 million of the releases were from short tail lines.
Our underlying combined ratio excluding prior year development and natural catastrophe was 93.1%, 3.8 points better than the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects the restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2009, changes in our business mix and the benefits of the higher non-catastrophe reinstatement premiums I referred to earlier.
Investment income on the P&C portfolio decreased in Q1 compared to the prior year quarter. This was due to lower portfolio yield, driven by the decline in LIBOR, combined with high concentrations of cash and governments as we move towards a portfolio that’s more typical of a P&C insurer.
During the quarter, we put new money to work largely in investment-grade credit, achieving an average rate of 3.2% and as a result, P&C’s duration increased marginally to three years. At March 31, 2010, the P&C portfolio book yield gross of fees, was 3.6%.
As a result of recent developments in certain European government markets, we’ve added additional disclosures to our fixed income supplement. As you can see, within the Eurozone, 94% of our government holdings are in France and Germany.
At $229 million of operating expenses for the quarter, with $39 million or 15% lower year over year. The reduction arises principally from the fact that we incurred some $40 million of restructuring costs in the prior year quarter, with this reduction offset in part by $6 million of higher reported expenses arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
In the first quarter, we recognized a gain to ordinary shareholders of $16.6 million from the further repurchase of Series C preference shares and now the remaining par value outstanding of those shares is only $71.9 million.
The main drivers of our 7% growth in book value per ordinary share were operating earnings and the favorable mark to market of $522 million during the quarter. This arose from tightening credit spreads and from lower interest rates, and as set out on Slide 3, we ended the first quarter with over $12.5 billion in total capital, an increase of over 4% in the quarter.
Now over to David."

Our combined ratio of 101.6% for the quarter was 2.7 points higher than our Q1 2009 results of 98.9%, which had been favorably impacted by limited cat activity. Adjusting for both cat and prior year development, the Insurance segment’s 2010 combined ratio of 96.4% was 2.7 points better than the same period last year.
Gross premiums written in Q1 increased 3.7% or $41 million year over year. We are fully aware of the difficult trading environment, and I can assure you that we are in no way relaxing our underwriting discipline. Our growth was led by selected business wins and increased participation in attractive lines including professional, marine, upper middle market and aviation.
As Mike mentioned, it also included some significant win backs in several lines including professional, which is particularly rewarding. Net premiums earned were down just over 1% or $13 million as we recognized the anticipated earn through of last year’s lower gross premiums written.
On the loss side, Q1 cat losses were partially offset by some favorable prior year development largely in our short tail lines. Our Q1 2010 loss ratio was 72.3% compares to 67.6% last year. However, when adjusted for both cats and prior year development, our underlying loss rate ratio is slightly better year over year at 67.1% versus 67.85. This was driven primarily by a lack of property losses, exiting less attractive businesses and the related shift in business mix.
Acquisition expenses were up slightly, reflecting modestly higher brokerage commissions in some line as well as a change in our business mix to lines such as professional and specialty that have always had higher brokerage commission structures.
This was partially offset by reduced operating expenses as our previously announced expense and organizational initiatives took hold. Total expense ratio for Q1 2010 of 29.3% was two points lower than Q1 2009.
Before I move on to market conditions, let me provide a couple of comments on our Professional book and why our profitability outlook remains in line with expectations. First, we saw lower than expected claims activity during the first quarter in our core professional book as the overall industry SEC class action frequency was lower than for the same period of 2009.
Second, various financial crisis-related matters from the 2007 and 2008 period developed favorably for XL along with the rest of the DNO industry during the quarter. As a result, we remain comfortable with our initial valuation of XL’s financial crisis exposure and the reserves we hold against it.
Regarding the market, despite the challenging macro economic conditions faced by many of our clients we continue to see clear and steady improvements in both retentions and new business submissions throughout our book. Our premium retentions for the first quarter were just over 85% on a segment basis, significantly better than the low 70’s experienced in Q1 2009. We are now back on track for historical retention levels.
What does give us concern is broad market pricing. After 3 quarters of modest increases of plus 1% and plus 2%, we saw some give back as our overall pricing declined 1% for the first quarter, slightly better than the Q1 2009 decline of 1.6%. We saw this reflected across most lines, with the only notable pricing increases recorded in our specialty book.
While we recognize the challenging market, we continue to build on our Insurance foundations of underwriting and claims bank. We successfully recruited two market leaders, [ Zarana Mogg ] and Patrick Tannic to join our team. Zarana will be joining us as Chief Executive of our North America P&C unit and Patrick is already on board as our Bermuda country manager. Welcome.
Operationally we turned the switch on our new centralized global claims management system in the U.S., Canada and Bermuda. We see improved customer service, faster response, and lower cost as only three of the benefits of this upgrade. We intend to expand the system throughout South American, Europe and Asia next year.
XL is approaching 2010 much as we finished 2009. We continue to renew existing books of business where rates are acceptable. We’re selectively writing new business at the right price, and we continue taking necessary actions to lower our expenses, all while remaining disciplined in our underwriting and engage with our brokers and clients.
I’ll finish with some observations we made at RIMS, which was held in Boston last week. XL hosted over 225 client meetings at RIMS and we heard time and again what they were looking for; a lead writer than can provide existing and new products and services supported by solid risk engineering, a clear history of claims performance and a global presence, all supported by a solid capital foundation. It was reassuring to hear that, what they want, we can provide.
And now to Jamie to discuss ReInsurance."

XL RE also enjoyed a positive quarter in difficult market conditions and significant levels of natural catastrophe activity. Our underwriting results for the quarter were good with a combined ratio of 97.8% resulting in an underwriting profit of $8.1 million. This compares with a combined ratio of 77.2% in Q1 of 2009.
Embedded in these results were losses of $81.6 million and $19.9 million from the Chilean earthquake and windstorm Xynthia respectively. The result also included positive prior year reserve releases of $53.8 million.
Adjusting for cat losses and prior year releases, the segment had a combined ratio of 84.8%, a 7 point improvement over the first quarter of 2009. This improvement was driven by 3.5 points on the expense ratio related to our U.S. crop portfolio, acquisition, the cost of adjustments in Bermuda and Europe and non-recurring severance charges from the first quarter of 2009.
The loss ratio also had a 3.5 point improvement driven by the benefit of reinstatement premiums in Europe on nonproperty business and a mix of business impact on property increase proportionately and a decrease in our trade credit business.
Turning to top line gross net premiums written were $790 million and $695 million respectively, basically flat year over year growth and a 3% increase net driven by reduced sessions on our multi-carrier crop portfolio.
Finally, turning tour Life Operations, contribution during the quarter was $49 million. This included a one-time gain of $13.8 million as a result of three treaties being commuted with clients.
I’d like to comment briefly on the Chilean earthquake before turning to market conditions. While it’s still early, and we are relying heavily on model results to establish our net loss estimate, we feel very good about our performance in this event. Our Latin American business unit contributed $66 million of the $82 million total loss to the segment with the remainder emanating from Bermuda and our London retro book.
Based on our estimate market share as published by the Superintendant of Insurance in Chile and assuming an industry loss of $6 billion to $8 billion, which we believe to be the case, our net loss is well below what peer market share analysis would indicate. This is principally due to fairly aggressive use of what I would describe as spot retrocession purchasing in the region.
The distribution of this loss into the industry with perhaps upwards of 80% to 90% into the ReInsurance market, is reflective of some broader issues in emerging markets we believe need to be addressed by the industry. This would include heavy reliance on proportional Insurance, event or assess the limits on these structures at levels that make them virtually meaningless, inadequate underlying rate levels and commission structures that do not allow sufficient margin to fund events of this magnitude.
While the event will obviously provide the market with an opportunity to address underlying rate adequacy, we will also advocate significant structural change in the market, principally a reliance on nonproportional ReInsurance, our preferred product.
As we’ve mentioned in our last few calls, market conditions remain challenging. We’ve kept our top line flat due principally to recaptured business that was lost at year-end 2008 and selected new opportunities, mostly in Europe.
We are broadly concerned about market conditions however. For example, our Japanese cap portfolio just turned over April 1, with a risk adjusted reduction in pricing of 5.5%. This is in a market that clearly needed more rate as we entered the renewal, and as a result, we reduced our position in this very important market yet again.
On the long tail side as David mentioned, there is broad competition across the market although we do see pockets of positive in some areas of the professional lines and U.K. for example. Overall, we’re very pleased with our underwriting performance against this backdrop and we will continue to be vigilant with our underwriting as this phase of the market plays itself out.
With that, I will turn it back to David for Q&A."

First, just to amplify what Mike said, from a premium standpoint in the segment, you’ve got to recall, we certainly do painfully, the first quarter of 2009 was the most challenging time for us and our retentions had actually dropped down to 73%.
This quarter, our retentions are up almost to 86% so keep that in mind as you think about growth quarter to quarter. The other piece is new business. We had planned for a considerable increase over the new business result we achieved last year this quarter. We actually surpassed new business on that basis, but we’re far short of what the planned assumption was primarily because of market conditions.
And I would also say as Mike commented on, that part of our new business success was tied to customers coming home if you will, people that we know very well in terms of profitability. So from a production standpoint, we feel good about the segment results when you flatten out all the one-off anomalies.
Let me quickly also before I turn it over to Jamie, maybe address your observation on the loss ratio, and actually when you do strip out cat activity and prior year development, we saw a slight improvement from first quarter 2010 as compared to first quarter 2009, and actually a fairly stable result quarter to quarter.
And your point was how are we doing that despite rate earn through which would suggest a negative impact. First of all, we actually started to change the pricing trend about a year ago this time, but I would say that earning though now would create a bit of an increase in the loss ratio. But a couple of things to keep in mind, first in the first quarter, we had less noncat property losses, especially in our international book.
That is one positive effect. The other, we have exited less attractive businesses over the past six quarters. Abco, W.

And then the last one I’d say is we’ve continually become better at risk management and underwriting modeling. All those things have added up to stabilize the loss ratio despite pricing pressure."

In the first quarter of 2009, property cat represented 16% of our net earned premium. It’s now 21%. And we did reduce our position in the trade credit business quite substantially, so there’s a big business mix change.
In addition, during quarters three and four of 2009, we took 2.7 and 2.5 loss ratio points from impacts from old structured product contracts. And finally, during this quarter, we enjoyed the benefit of $12 million of reinstatement premium on a nonproperty program in Europe, which contributed quite substantially.
In terms of growth, in ReInsurance we try not to predict things too much because it can be lumpy depending on the amount of renewal activity we have in each quarter. As you know, the first quarter is very heavy, the second quarter is reasonably light and then we move into July 1 very heavy and then virtually none the rest of the year. It’s all going to depend on market conditions."

They’re spending more time closer to the markets. I would only preface any comment with a simple observation that if logic dictated pricing, we wouldn’t talk about declining pricing in many of our segments at all. So we have to be careful before we predict where the market will do even with what logic would tell us what it should do.
On the win backs and sensitivity to ratings, gosh you know, we noticed throughout the crisis if the market had been overwhelming rating sensitive, we would have lost a lot of business. Instead, a lot of business stayed with us right through the challenges.
We like to think that’s because our front line people are so capable and stayed together. But that caused our clients to want to continue to be backed by XL. So where there are those cases where a long time client took kind of a holiday from us, we work hard to welcome them back and we’re very encouraged by that progress.
I don’t think it’s a change in their view in how rating agencies work. I just think it’s an increased comfort in XL and we think that’s terrific. Rating agencies are important to us and we’ll continue to work to improve our standing with the two, that being S&P and Fitch who still have us on a negative outlook.

I think around this table we have people who have been through several complete cycles and we all know that there is theoretical tea leaves and we also know that every cycle we either lived through or have examined on a historical basis, acted in an extremely unpredictable and idiosyncratic way.
The most obvious is when you have some massive change in the capital base of the industry. We saw signs of that happening due to the credit crisis and then as the credit crisis back off, everybody calmed down about capital as a part of the component.
At the same time, you have I think these days, on a relative scale compared to say a decade ago, you have fewer management teams running larger books of business with greater emphasis on bottom line results, and you would think that would start to kick in here as the results run out of the benefit of prior year reserves and run into more difficult conditions.
Those are obviously industry-wide comments. And I just think you could get a turn from any of those things, but the reality is, right now whereas there were some optimistic signs in our pricing as you moved through last year toward the end of the year, it’s kind of reversed itself in a small way at this stage, and we’ll just have to wait and see.
I can’t give you a better answer than that. I think it will be what it will be and we know that our job is to manage through the cycle, and that means we stay disciplined about our underwriting criteria. We don’t let it lag, and we’re very cautious about the other inputs that could affect the book of business that’s in place like inflation and the rest."

I’m pleased to report to you another quarter of solid operating results even as the global P&C industry experienced some of its worst quarter one-cat events ever. Our nearly breakeven P&C combined ratio of 100.5 included a 14.3 points from",868,"Good evening. I’m pleased to report to you another quarter of solid operating results even as the global P&C industry experienced some of its worst quarter one-cat events ever. Our nearly breakeven P&C combined ratio of 100.5 included a 14.3 points from the Chilean earthquake and storm Xynthia as our estimates from these losses from these two events remains within the preliminary range we published in March.
We did see some offsets against these caps with 6.9 point of positive prior year development, mostly from short sale property lines in both Insurance and ReInsurance. For the fourth consecutive quarter, we grew out book value for ordinary share, this time another 7% to $26.38 and by 8% intangible book value per share to $23.92, and total shareholders’ equity increased from $9.4 billion to $10 billion.
The first quarter caps impact on operating income and the continued increase in our shareholders' equity resulted in annualized operating ROE of 6.9% for the first quarter. Without the impact of the two named cats, our operating ROE would have been 14.2%.
We see these results as an endorsement of our continued discipline in both underwriting and risk management, and I’ve said before, and I’ll say it again, perhaps as much for the benefit of any XL underwriters who are listening in, XL will not write coverage at uneconomic price levels.
So while we grew our P&C top line by 2.3% year over year, much of that growth, as we had anticipated and predicted at the beginning of the year, came from lines we found attractive, including aerospace, cat and DNO as well as several long time customers returning to XL. We welcomed them back.
Meanwhile, we continue to lower our premiums written for multi-year Insurance premiums and from uneconomic businesses such as casualty, factory and Insurance that we exited last year.
It was a quiet quarter for our investment portfolio, which is looking more like the P&C portfolio should, as our optimization program continues. And while we saw the benefit of a $522 million in favorable marks to market this quarter, I should remind you that what goes up goes down and as interest rates can rise or fall, we’ll just have to see what happens next.
We do know that our excellent liquidity and well-matched asset liability profile will let us ride out any interest rate volatility.
On a risk management note, in March of 2009, we instructed our portfolio managers, and here I guess I’m more in line with current news, I instructed our managers back in March of 2009 to stop purchasing sovereign debt from Greece and Ireland and severely restricted exposures to the debt of Portugal, Italy and Spain.
So our cumulative exposure to sovereign debt from these five countries is down to approximately $34 million or less than 1/10 of 1% of our entire investment portfolio, including no exposure to Greece.
Likewise, we made significant progress on another risk management initiative. Last week, as you well know, our ordinary shareholders approved several proposals, most notably our change of parent domicile from the Cayman Islands to Ireland.
There are several more conditions to satisfy before this move will be complete, but shareholder approval was a significant move in the right direction, and we thank our shareholders for supporting the recommendations of management and the Board.
Also in current news, as you noticed in our release yesterday, we are very pleased to announce that Irene Esteves has agreed to join XL as our Chief Financial Officer. She is a deeply experienced business leader and we’re delighted to have her on our team. Irene joins us on May 17.
You can also look forward to the release of our global loss triangles this week. Now I’ll finish my remarks on the first quarter by saying that XL is once again firing on all cylinders in a very difficult market condition.
Our underlying P&C results are solid and showing positive trends. Our risk management efforts are proving out and our organization, we believe, is getting stronger by the day. While the entire P&C faces challenges deploying capital in this kind of pricing environment, we believe we can build on XL’s success by providing our brokers and customers with the coverages they value and the service they demand.
Before I turn it over to Simon, I should comment on the terrible events in the Gulf of Mexico. Like anyone on this call, we deeply mourn the loss of life and we’re all watching with horror the continuing and likely environmental damage.
It’s much too early to know what the insurable losses are on a total basis, and what portion of these losses XL might cover, but we can say this. We believe that our total property damage exposure to the rig itself is approximately $30 million including $5 million in reinstatement premiums and we have in fact, already paid much of this in claims. For what it’s worth, that would equate to a roughly $900 million industry event.
Now as I hand it over to Simon, I would like to thank him publicly for his outstanding service as XL’s interim CFO since the first of the year. Thanks, Simon, and on to you."

Before I comment on the results of the quarter, I wanted to take a moment to expand on the comment in our press release on our calculation of operating income.We manage foreign exchange volatility from an economic perspec",763,"Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Before I comment on the results of the quarter, I wanted to take a moment to expand on the comment in our press release on our calculation of operating income.
We manage foreign exchange volatility from an economic perspective through the matching of assets and liabilities. However, GAAP provides an asymmetrical treatment for the movement of assets and liabilities with the results of a foreign exchange gain or loss in the income statement really doesn’t represent any underlying economics.
We’ve discussed this with a number of you and what you’ve told us is that you too, really don’t find it a relevant indicator of performance. Accordingly, we’ve decided that we will no longer include foreign exchange gains and losses within our operating income, and we’ve represented prior periods on a consistent basis.
Page 30 of our financial supplements shows the operating income for each of the quarters since the first quarter of 2009 on this new basis. And now to the results themselves.
Operating income for the quarter was $150 million or $0.44 per ordinary share with an annualized operation ROE of 6.9%. This compares to $191 million, $0.57 per ordinary share and 14.9% respectively in the prior year quarter.
Turning to our summary financial results on Slide 4, P&C gross premiums written were up by 2.3% from the prior year quarter, reflecting targeted new business growth including the recapture of certain business lost in 2009, and $15 million more of noncatastrophe related reinstatement premiums than in the prior year quarter.
P&C net premiums written increased by 6.1% reflecting a reduction in the levels of seeded premium in the quarter. I would say that part of this is a timing difference and we expect some $25 million of ReInsurance purchases that would otherwise have been made in the first quarter to occur in later quarters this year.
P&C net premiums were down 4.4% in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009. This reflects the rolling effects of prior period’s lower written premium. The P&C combined ratio for the first quarter of 100.5% shows the effect of first quarter cats of $181 million, which as set out on Slide 5, added 14.3 points to the loss ratio for the quarter.
This was offset in part by favorable prior year development of $87 million, which is line with the $90 million recognized in the prior year quarter. In the current quarter, $72 million of the releases were from short tail lines.
Our underlying combined ratio excluding prior year development and natural catastrophe was 93.1%, 3.8 points better than the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects the restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2009, changes in our business mix and the benefits of the higher non-catastrophe reinstatement premiums I referred to earlier.
Investment income on the P&C portfolio decreased in Q1 compared to the prior year quarter. This was due to lower portfolio yield, driven by the decline in LIBOR, combined with high concentrations of cash and governments as we move towards a portfolio that’s more typical of a P&C insurer.
During the quarter, we put new money to work largely in investment-grade credit, achieving an average rate of 3.2% and as a result, P&C’s duration increased marginally to three years. At March 31, 2010, the P&C portfolio book yield gross of fees, was 3.6%.
As a result of recent developments in certain European government markets, we’ve added additional disclosures to our fixed income supplement. As you can see, within the Eurozone, 94% of our government holdings are in France and Germany.
At $229 million of operating expenses for the quarter, with $39 million or 15% lower year over year. The reduction arises principally from the fact that we incurred some $40 million of restructuring costs in the prior year quarter, with this reduction offset in part by $6 million of higher reported expenses arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
In the first quarter, we recognized a gain to ordinary shareholders of $16.6 million from the further repurchase of Series C preference shares and now the remaining par value outstanding of those shares is only $71.9 million.
The main drivers of our 7% growth in book value per ordinary share were operating earnings and the favorable mark to market of $522 million during the quarter. This arose from tightening credit spreads and from lower interest rates, and as set out on Slide 3, we ended the first quarter with over $12.5 billion in total capital, an increase of over 4% in the quarter.
Now over to David."

Our combined ratio of 101.6% for the quarter was 2.7 points higher than our Q1 2009 results of 98.9%, which had been favorably impacted by limited cat activity. Adjusting for both cat and prior year development, the Insurance segment’s 2010 combined ratio of 96.4% was 2.7 points better than the same period last year.
Gross premiums written in Q1 increased 3.7% or $41 million year over year. We are fully aware of the difficult trading environment, and I can assure you that we are in no way relaxing our underwriting discipline. Our growth was led by selected business wins and increased participation in attractive lines including professional, marine, upper middle market and aviation.
As Mike mentioned, it also included some significant win backs in several lines including professional, which is particularly rewarding. Net premiums earned were down just over 1% or $13 million as we recognized the anticipated earn through of last year’s lower gross premiums written.
On the loss side, Q1 cat losses were partially offset by some favorable prior year development largely in our short tail lines. Our Q1 2010 loss ratio was 72.3% compares to 67.6% last year. However, when adjusted for both cats and prior year development, our underlying loss rate ratio is slightly better year over year at 67.1% versus 67.85. This was driven primarily by a lack of property losses, exiting less attractive businesses and the related shift in business mix.
Acquisition expenses were up slightly, reflecting modestly higher brokerage commissions in some line as well as a change in our business mix to lines such as professional and specialty that have always had higher brokerage commission structures.
This was partially offset by reduced operating expenses as our previously announced expense and organizational initiatives took hold. Total expense ratio for Q1 2010 of 29.3% was two points lower than Q1 2009.
Before I move on to market conditions, let me provide a couple of comments on our Professional book and why our profitability outlook remains in line with expectations. First, we saw lower than expected claims activity during the first quarter in our core professional book as the overall industry SEC class action frequency was lower than for the same period of 2009.
Second, various financial crisis-related matters from the 2007 and 2008 period developed favorably for XL along with the rest of the DNO industry during the quarter. As a result, we remain comfortable with our initial valuation of XL’s financial crisis exposure and the reserves we hold against it.
Regarding the market, despite the challenging macro economic conditions faced by many of our clients we continue to see clear and steady improvements in both retentions and new business submissions throughout our book. Our premium retentions for the first quarter were just over 85% on a segment basis, significantly better than the low 70’s experienced in Q1 2009. We are now back on track for historical retention levels.
What does give us concern is broad market pricing. After 3 quarters of modest increases of plus 1% and plus 2%, we saw some give back as our overall pricing declined 1% for the first quarter, slightly better than the Q1 2009 decline of 1.6%. We saw this reflected across most lines, with the only notable pricing increases recorded in our specialty book.
While we recognize the challenging market, we continue to build on our Insurance foundations of underwriting and claims bank. We successfully recruited two market leaders, [ Zarana Mogg ] and Patrick Tannic to join our team. Zarana will be joining us as Chief Executive of our North America P&C unit and Patrick is already on board as our Bermuda country manager. Welcome.
Operationally we turned the switch on our new centralized global claims management system in the U.S., Canada and Bermuda. We see improved customer service, faster response, and lower cost as only three of the benefits of this upgrade. We intend to expand the system throughout South American, Europe and Asia next year.
XL is approaching 2010 much as we finished 2009. We continue to renew existing books of business where rates are acceptable. We’re selectively writing new business at the right price, and we continue taking necessary actions to lower our expenses, all while remaining disciplined in our underwriting and engage with our brokers and clients.
I’ll finish with some observations we made at RIMS, which was held in Boston last week. XL hosted over 225 client meetings at RIMS and we heard time and again what they were looking for; a lead writer than can provide existing and new products and services supported by solid risk engineering, a clear history of claims performance and a global presence, all supported by a solid capital foundation. It was reassuring to hear that, what they want, we can provide.
And now to Jamie to discuss ReInsurance."

Our underwriting results for the quarter were good with a combined ratio of 97.8% resulting in an",673,"Thanks, David, and good evening. XL RE also enjoyed a positive quarter in difficult market conditions and significant levels of natural catastrophe activity. Our underwriting results for the quarter were good with a combined ratio of 97.8% resulting in an underwriting profit of $8.1 million. This compares with a combined ratio of 77.2% in Q1 of 2009.
Embedded in these results were losses of $81.6 million and $19.9 million from the Chilean earthquake and windstorm Xynthia respectively. The result also included positive prior year reserve releases of $53.8 million.
Adjusting for cat losses and prior year releases, the segment had a combined ratio of 84.8%, a 7 point improvement over the first quarter of 2009. This improvement was driven by 3.5 points on the expense ratio related to our U.S. crop portfolio, acquisition, the cost of adjustments in Bermuda and Europe and non-recurring severance charges from the first quarter of 2009.
The loss ratio also had a 3.5 point improvement driven by the benefit of reinstatement premiums in Europe on nonproperty business and a mix of business impact on property increase proportionately and a decrease in our trade credit business.
Turning to top line gross net premiums written were $790 million and $695 million respectively, basically flat year over year growth and a 3% increase net driven by reduced sessions on our multi-carrier crop portfolio.
Finally, turning tour Life Operations, contribution during the quarter was $49 million. This included a one-time gain of $13.8 million as a result of three treaties being commuted with clients.
I’d like to comment briefly on the Chilean earthquake before turning to market conditions. While it’s still early, and we are relying heavily on model results to establish our net loss estimate, we feel very good about our performance in this event. Our Latin American business unit contributed $66 million of the $82 million total loss to the segment with the remainder emanating from Bermuda and our London retro book.
Based on our estimate market share as published by the Superintendant of Insurance in Chile and assuming an industry loss of $6 billion to $8 billion, which we believe to be the case, our net loss is well below what peer market share analysis would indicate. This is principally due to fairly aggressive use of what I would describe as spot retrocession purchasing in the region.
The distribution of this loss into the industry with perhaps upwards of 80% to 90% into the ReInsurance market, is reflective of some broader issues in emerging markets we believe need to be addressed by the industry. This would include heavy reliance on proportional Insurance, event or assess the limits on these structures at levels that make them virtually meaningless, inadequate underlying rate levels and commission structures that do not allow sufficient margin to fund events of this magnitude.
While the event will obviously provide the market with an opportunity to address underlying rate adequacy, we will also advocate significant structural change in the market, principally a reliance on nonproportional ReInsurance, our preferred product.
As we’ve mentioned in our last few calls, market conditions remain challenging. We’ve kept our top line flat due principally to recaptured business that was lost at year-end 2008 and selected new opportunities, mostly in Europe.
We are broadly concerned about market conditions however. For example, our Japanese cap portfolio just turned over April 1, with a risk adjusted reduction in pricing of 5.5%. This is in a market that clearly needed more rate as we entered the renewal, and as a result, we reduced our position in this very important market yet again.
On the long tail side as David mentioned, there is broad competition across the market although we do see pockets of positive in some areas of the professional lines and U.K. for example. Overall, we’re very pleased with our underwriting performance against this backdrop and we will continue to be vigilant with our underwriting as this phase of the market plays itself out.
With that, I will turn it back to David for Q&A."

First, just to amplify what Mike said, from a premium standpoint in the segment, you’ve got to recall, we certainly do painfully, the first quarter of 2009 was the most challenging time for us and our retentions had actually dropped down to 73%.
This quarter, our retentions are up almost to 86% so keep that in mind as you think about growth quarter to quarter. The other piece is new business. We had planned for a considerable increase over the new business result we achieved last year this quarter. We actually surpassed new business on that basis, but we’re far short of what the planned assumption was primarily because of market conditions.
And I would also say as Mike commented on, that part of our new business success was tied to customers coming home if you will, people that we know very well in terms of profitability. So from a production standpoint, we feel good about the segment results when you flatten out all the one-off anomalies.
Let me quickly also before I turn it over to Jamie, maybe address your observation on the loss ratio, and actually when you do strip out cat activity and prior year development, we saw a slight improvement from first quarter 2010 as compared to first quarter 2009, and actually a fairly stable result quarter to quarter.
And your point was how are we doing that despite rate earn through which would suggest a negative impact. First of all, we actually started to change the pricing trend about a year ago this time, but I would say that earning though now would create a bit of an increase in the loss ratio. But a couple of things to keep in mind, first in the first quarter, we had less noncat property losses, especially in our international book.
That is one positive effect. The other, we have exited less attractive businesses over the past six quarters. Abco, W. Brown, and some parts of our environmental, U.S. Marine and the remaining remnants of our surety business. We are picking up a bit of it in a related shift if you will in related business.
And then the last one I’d say is we’ve continually become better at risk management and underwriting modeling. All those things have added up to stabilize the loss ratio despite pricing pressure."

In addition, during quarters three and four of 2009, we took 2.7 and 2.5 loss ratio points from impacts from old structured product contracts. And finally, during this quarter, we enjoyed the benefit of $12 million of reinstatement premium on a nonproperty program in Europe, which contributed quite substantially.
In terms of growth, in ReInsurance we try not to predict things too much because it can be lumpy depending on the amount of renewal activity we have in each quarter. As you know, the first quarter is very heavy, the second quarter is reasonably light and then we move into July 1 very heavy and then virtually none the rest of the year.

You’ll recall that when they put us on negative outlook, and I want to pause it. The history gets to be a bit of a blur at this stage. But when they put us on the negative outlook and dropped the rating that would have been in December of ’08.
As you’ll recall, at that time, they put in that they would be open under various conditions to be looking at the rating again, and they gave it kind of a 2-year horizon, and we’ve obviously now I guess five quarters or so into that horizon. So we continue to report what we consider to be our good progress and we continue to hope that this will cause from them a reaction.
By the way, we very quickly looked up the expirations you were looking for, or maturations I should say. The bonds in Spain are actually two separate bonds. One is in 2030 and one is in 28. In Portugal, it’s one bond and it’s 2027."

They’re spending more time closer to the markets. I would only preface any comment with a simple observation that if logic dictated pricing, we wouldn’t talk about declining pricing in many of our segments at all. So we have to be careful before we predict where the market will do even with what logic would tell us what it should do.
On the win backs and sensitivity to ratings, gosh you know, we noticed throughout the crisis if the market had been overwhelming rating sensitive, we would have lost a lot of business. Instead, a lot of business stayed with us right through the challenges.
We like to think that’s because our front line people are so capable and stayed together. But that caused our clients to want to continue to be backed by XL. So where there are those cases where a long time client took kind of a holiday from us, we work hard to welcome them back and we’re very encouraged by that progress.
I don’t think it’s a change in their view in how rating agencies work. I just think it’s an increased comfort in XL and we think that’s terrific. Rating agencies are important to us and we’ll continue to work to improve our standing with the two, that being S&P and Fitch who still have us on a negative outlook.
But in terms of the marine pricing, David."

I think over the last couple of years, and you have to keep in mind, clients are also very aware and interested in what rating agencies do from their own business perspective.

I think around this table we have people who have been through several complete cycles and we all know that there is theoretical tea leaves and we also know that every cycle we either lived through or have examined on a historical basis, acted in an extremely unpredictable and idiosyncratic way.
The most obvious is when you have some massive change in the capital base of the industry. We saw signs of that happening due to the credit crisis and then as the credit crisis back off, everybody calmed down about capital as a part of the component.
At the same time, you have I think these days, on a relative scale compared to say a decade ago, you have fewer management teams running larger books of business with greater emphasis on bottom line results, and you would think that would start to kick in here as the results run out of the benefit of prior year reserves and run into more difficult conditions.
Those are obviously industry-wide comments. And I just think you could get a turn from any of those things, but the reality is, right now whereas there were some optimistic signs in our pricing as you moved through last year toward the end of the year, it’s kind of reversed itself in a small way at this stage, and we’ll just have to wait and see.
I can’t give you a better answer than that. I think it will be what it will be and we know that our job is to manage through the cycle, and that means we stay disciplined about our underwriting criteria. We don’t let it lag, and we’re very cautious about the other inputs that could affect the book of business that’s in place like inflation and the rest."

I’m pleased to report to you another quarter of solid operating results even as the global P&C industry experienced some of its worst quarter one-cat events ever. Our nearly breakeven P&C combined ratio of 100.5 included a 14.3 points from",868,"Good evening. I’m pleased to report to you another quarter of solid operating results even as the global P&C industry experienced some of its worst quarter one-cat events ever. Our nearly breakeven P&C combined ratio of 100.5 included a 14.3 points from the Chilean earthquake and storm Xynthia as our estimates from these losses from these two events remains within the preliminary range we published in March.
We did see some offsets against these caps with 6.9 point of positive prior year development, mostly from short sale property lines in both Insurance and ReInsurance. For the fourth consecutive quarter, we grew out book value for ordinary share, this time another 7% to $26.38 and by 8% intangible book value per share to $23.92, and total shareholders’ equity increased from $9.4 billion to $10 billion.
The first quarter caps impact on operating income and the continued increase in our shareholders' equity resulted in annualized operating ROE of 6.9% for the first quarter. Without the impact of the two named cats, our operating ROE would have been 14.2%.
We see these results as an endorsement of our continued discipline in both underwriting and risk management, and I’ve said before, and I’ll say it again, perhaps as much for the benefit of any XL underwriters who are listening in, XL will not write coverage at uneconomic price levels.
So while we grew our P&C top line by 2.3% year over year, much of that growth, as we had anticipated and predicted at the beginning of the year, came from lines we found attractive, including aerospace, cat and DNO as well as several long time customers returning to XL. We welcomed them back.
Meanwhile, we continue to lower our premiums written for multi-year Insurance premiums and from uneconomic businesses such as casualty, factory and Insurance that we exited last year.
It was a quiet quarter for our investment portfolio, which is looking more like the P&C portfolio should, as our optimization program continues. And while we saw the benefit of a $522 million in favorable marks to market this quarter, I should remind you that what goes up goes down and as interest rates can rise or fall, we’ll just have to see what happens next.
We do know that our excellent liquidity and well-matched asset liability profile will let us ride out any interest rate volatility.
On a risk management note, in March of 2009, we instructed our portfolio managers, and here I guess I’m more in line with current news, I instructed our managers back in March of 2009 to stop purchasing sovereign debt from Greece and Ireland and severely restricted exposures to the debt of Portugal, Italy and Spain.
So our cumulative exposure to sovereign debt from these five countries is down to approximately $34 million or less than 1/10 of 1% of our entire investment portfolio, including no exposure to Greece.
Likewise, we made significant progress on another risk management initiative. Last week, as you well know, our ordinary shareholders approved several proposals, most notably our change of parent domicile from the Cayman Islands to Ireland.
There are several more conditions to satisfy before this move will be complete, but shareholder approval was a significant move in the right direction, and we thank our shareholders for supporting the recommendations of management and the Board.
Also in current news, as you noticed in our release yesterday, we are very pleased to announce that Irene Esteves has agreed to join XL as our Chief Financial Officer. She is a deeply experienced business leader and we’re delighted to have her on our team. Irene joins us on May 17.
You can also look forward to the release of our global loss triangles this week. Now I’ll finish my remarks on the first quarter by saying that XL is once again firing on all cylinders in a very difficult market condition.
Our underlying P&C results are solid and showing positive trends. Our risk management efforts are proving out and our organization, we believe, is getting stronger by the day. While the entire P&C faces challenges deploying capital in this kind of pricing environment, we believe we can build on XL’s success by providing our brokers and customers with the coverages they value and the service they demand.
Before I turn it over to Simon, I should comment on the terrible events in the Gulf of Mexico. Like anyone on this call, we deeply mourn the loss of life and we’re all watching with horror the continuing and likely environmental damage.
It’s much too early to know what the insurable losses are on a total basis, and what portion of these losses XL might cover, but we can say this. We believe that our total property damage exposure to the rig itself is approximately $30 million including $5 million in reinstatement premiums and we have in fact, already paid much of this in claims. For what it’s worth, that would equate to a roughly $900 million industry event.
Now as I hand it over to Simon, I would like to thank him publicly for his outstanding service as XL’s interim CFO since the first of the year. Thanks, Simon, and on to you."
406440,102276710,2008979,"XL Capital Ltd., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 04, 2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","XL Group Ltd","Executives","Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Before I comment on the results of the quarter, I wanted to take a moment to expand on the comment in our press release on our calculation of operating income.We manage foreign exchange volatility from an economic perspec",763,"Thanks, Mike, and good evening. Before I comment on the results of the quarter, I wanted to take a moment to expand on the comment in our press release on our calculation of operating income.
We manage foreign exchange volatility from an economic perspective through the matching of assets and liabilities. However, GAAP provides an asymmetrical treatment for the movement of assets and liabilities with the results of a foreign exchange gain or loss in the income statement really doesn’t represent any underlying economics.
We’ve discussed this with a number of you and what you’ve told us is that you too, really don’t find it a relevant indicator of performance. Accordingly, we’ve decided that we will no longer include foreign exchange gains and losses within our operating income, and we’ve represented prior periods on a consistent basis.
Page 30 of our financial supplements shows the operating income for each of the quarters since the first quarter of 2009 on this new basis. And now to the results themselves.
Operating income for the quarter was $150 million or $0.44 per ordinary share with an annualized operation ROE of 6.9%. This compares to $191 million, $0.57 per ordinary share and 14.9% respectively in the prior year quarter.
Turning to our summary financial results on Slide 4, P&C gross premiums written were up by 2.3% from the prior year quarter, reflecting targeted new business growth including the recapture of certain business lost in 2009, and $15 million more of noncatastrophe related reinstatement premiums than in the prior year quarter.
P&C net premiums written increased by 6.1% reflecting a reduction in the levels of seeded premium in the quarter. I would say that part of this is a timing difference and we expect some $25 million of ReInsurance purchases that would otherwise have been made in the first quarter to occur in later quarters this year.
P&C net premiums were down 4.4% in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009. This reflects the rolling effects of prior period’s lower written premium. The P&C combined ratio for the first quarter of 100.5% shows the effect of first quarter cats of $181 million, which as set out on Slide 5, added 14.3 points to the loss ratio for the quarter.
This was offset in part by favorable prior year development of $87 million, which is line with the $90 million recognized in the prior year quarter. In the current quarter, $72 million of the releases were from short tail lines.
Our underlying combined ratio excluding prior year development and natural catastrophe was 93.1%, 3.8 points better than the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects the restructuring costs in the first quarter of 2009, changes in our business mix and the benefits of the higher non-catastrophe reinstatement premiums I referred to earlier.
Investment income on the P&C portfolio decreased in Q1 compared to the prior year quarter. This was due to lower portfolio yield, driven by the decline in LIBOR, combined with high concentrations of cash and governments as we move towards a portfolio that’s more typical of a P&C insurer.
During the quarter, we put new money to work largely in investment-grade credit, achieving an average rate of 3.2% and as a result, P&C’s duration increased marginally to three years. At March 31, 2010, the P&C portfolio book yield gross of fees, was 3.6%.
As a result of recent developments in certain European government markets, we’ve added additional disclosures to our fixed income supplement. As you can see, within the Eurozone, 94% of our government holdings are in France and Germany.
At $229 million of operating expenses for the quarter, with $39 million or 15% lower year over year. The reduction arises principally from the fact that we incurred some $40 million of restructuring costs in the prior year quarter, with this reduction offset in part by $6 million of higher reported expenses arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
In the first quarter, we recognized a gain to ordinary shareholders of $16.6 million from the further repurchase of Series C preference shares and now the remaining par value outstanding of those shares is only $71.9 million.
The main drivers of our 7% growth in book value per ordinary share were operating earnings and the favorable mark to market of $522 million during the quarter. This arose from tightening credit spreads and from lower interest rates, and as set out on Slide 3, we ended the first quarter with over $12.5 billion in total capital, an increase of over 4% in the quarter.
Now over to David."

Our combined ratio of 101.6% for the quarter was 2.7 points higher than our Q1 2009 results of 98.9%, which had been favorably impacted by limited cat activity. Adjusting for both cat and prior year development, the Insurance segment’s 2010 combined ratio of 96.4% was 2.7 points better than the same period last year.
Gross premiums written in Q1 increased 3.7% or $41 million year over year. We are fully aware of the difficult trading environment, and I can assure you that we are in no way relaxing our underwriting discipline. Our growth was led by selected business wins and increased participation in attractive lines including professional, marine, upper middle market and aviation.
As Mike mentioned, it also included some significant win backs in several lines including professional, which is particularly rewarding. Net premiums earned were down just over 1% or $13 million as we recognized the anticipated earn through of last year’s lower gross premiums written.
On the loss side, Q1 cat losses were partially offset by some favorable prior year development largely in our short tail lines. Our Q1 2010 loss ratio was 72.3% compares to 67.6% last year. However, when adjusted for both cats and prior year development, our underlying loss rate ratio is slightly better year over year at 67.1% versus 67.85. This was driven primarily by a lack of property losses, exiting less attractive businesses and the related shift in business mix.
Acquisition expenses were up slightly, reflecting modestly higher brokerage commissions in some line as well as a change in our business mix to lines such as professional and specialty that have always had higher brokerage commission structures.
This was partially offset by reduced operating expenses as our previously announced expense and organizational initiatives took hold. Total expense ratio for Q1 2010 of 29.3% was two points lower than Q1 2009.
Before I move on to market conditions, let me provide a couple of comments on our Professional book and why our profitability outlook remains in line with expectations. First, we saw lower than expected claims activity during the first quarter in our core professional book as the overall industry SEC class action frequency was lower than for the same period of 2009.
Second, various financial crisis-related matters from the 2007 and 2008 period developed favorably for XL along with the rest of the DNO industry during the quarter. As a result, we remain comfortable with our initial valuation of XL’s financial crisis exposure and the reserves we hold against it.
Regarding the market, despite the challenging macro economic conditions faced by many of our clients we continue to see clear and steady improvements in both retentions and new business submissions throughout our book. Our premium retentions for the first quarter were just over 85% on a segment basis, significantly better than the low 70’s experienced in Q1 2009. We are now back on track for historical retention levels.
What does give us concern is broad market pricing. After 3 quarters of modest increases of plus 1% and plus 2%, we saw some give back as our overall pricing declined 1% for the first quarter, slightly better than the Q1 2009 decline of 1.6%. We saw this reflected across most lines, with the only notable pricing increases recorded in our specialty book.
While we recognize the challenging market, we continue to build on our Insurance foundations of underwriting and claims bank. We successfully recruited two market leaders, [ Zarana Mogg ] and Patrick Tannic to join our team. Zarana will be joining us as Chief Executive of our North America P&C unit and Patrick is already on board as our Bermuda country manager. Welcome.
Operationally we turned the switch on our new centralized global claims management system in the U.S., Canada and Bermuda. We see improved customer service, faster response, and lower cost as only three of the benefits of this upgrade. We intend to expand the system throughout South American, Europe and Asia next year.
XL is approaching 2010 much as we finished 2009. We continue to renew existing books of business where rates are acceptable. We’re selectively writing new business at the right price, and we continue taking necessary actions to lower our expenses, all while remaining disciplined in our underwriting and engage with our brokers and clients.
I’ll finish with some observations we made at RIMS, which was held in Boston last week. XL hosted over 225 client meetings at RIMS and we heard time and again what they were looking for; a lead writer than can provide existing and new products and services supported by solid risk engineering, a clear history of claims performance and a global presence, all supported by a solid capital foundation. It was reassuring to hear that, what they want, we can provide.
And now to Jamie to discuss ReInsurance."

Embedded in these results were losses of $81.6 million and $19.9 million from the Chilean earthquake and windstorm Xynthia respectively. The result also included positive prior year reserve releases of $53.8 million.
Adjusting for cat losses and prior year releases, the segment had a combined ratio of 84.8%, a 7 point improvement over the first quarter of 2009. This improvement was driven by 3.5 points on the expense ratio related to our U.S. crop portfolio, acquisition, the cost of adjustments in Bermuda and Europe and non-recurring severance charges from the first quarter of 2009.
The loss ratio also had a 3.5 point improvement driven by the benefit of reinstatement premiums in Europe on nonproperty business and a mix of business impact on property increase proportionately and a decrease in our trade credit business.
Turning to top line gross net premiums written were $790 million and $695 million respectively, basically flat year over year growth and a 3% increase net driven by reduced sessions on our multi-carrier crop portfolio.
Finally, turning tour Life Operations, contribution during the quarter was $49 million. This included a one-time gain of $13.8 million as a result of three treaties being commuted with clients.
I’d like to comment briefly on the Chilean earthquake before turning to market conditions. While it’s still early, and we are relying heavily on model results to establish our net loss estimate, we feel very good about our performance in this event. Our Latin American business unit contributed $66 million of the $82 million total loss to the segment with the remainder emanating from Bermuda and our London retro book.
Based on our estimate market share as published by the Superintendant of Insurance in Chile and assuming an industry loss of $6 billion to $8 billion, which we believe to be the case, our net loss is well below what peer market share analysis would indicate. This is principally due to fairly aggressive use of what I would describe as spot retrocession purchasing in the region.
The distribution of this loss into the industry with perhaps upwards of 80% to 90% into the ReInsurance market, is reflective of some broader issues in emerging markets we believe need to be addressed by the industry. This would include heavy reliance on proportional Insurance, event or assess the limits on these structures at levels that make them virtually meaningless, inadequate underlying rate levels and commission structures that do not allow sufficient margin to fund events of this magnitude.
While the event will obviously provide the market with an opportunity to address underlying rate adequacy, we will also advocate significant structural change in the market, principally a reliance on nonproportional ReInsurance, our preferred product.
As we’ve mentioned in our last few calls, market conditions remain challenging. We’ve kept our top line flat due principally to recaptured business that was lost at year-end 2008 and selected new opportunities, mostly in Europe.
We are broadly concerned about market conditions however. For example, our Japanese cap portfolio just turned over April 1, with a risk adjusted reduction in pricing of 5.5%. This is in a market that clearly needed more rate as we entered the renewal, and as a result, we reduced our position in this very important market yet again.
On the long tail side as David mentioned, there is broad competition across the market although we do see pockets of positive in some areas of the professional lines and U.K. for example. Overall, we’re very pleased with our underwriting performance against this backdrop and we will continue to be vigilant with our underwriting as this phase of the market plays itself out.
With that, I will turn it back to David for Q&A."

First, just to amplify what Mike said, from a premium standpoint in the segment, you’ve got to recall, we certainly do painfully, the first quarter of 2009 was the most challenging time for us and our retentions had actually dropped down to 73%.
This quarter, our retentions are up almost to 86% so keep that in mind as you think about growth quarter to quarter. The other piece is new business. We had planned for a considerable increase over the new business result we achieved last year this quarter. We actually surpassed new business on that basis, but we’re far short of what the planned assumption was primarily because of market conditions.
And I would also say as Mike commented on, that part of our new business success was tied to customers coming home if you will, people that we know very well in terms of profitability. So from a production standpoint, we feel good about the segment results when you flatten out all the one-off anomalies.
Let me quickly also before I turn it over to Jamie, maybe address your observation on the loss ratio, and actually when you do strip out cat activity and prior year development, we saw a slight improvement from first quarter 2010 as compared to first quarter 2009, and actually a fairly stable result quarter to quarter.
And your point was how are we doing that despite rate earn through which would suggest a negative impact. First of all, we actually started to change the pricing trend about a year ago this time, but I would say that earning though now would create a bit of an increase in the loss ratio. But a couple of things to keep in mind, first in the first quarter, we had less noncat property losses, especially in our international book.
That is one positive effect. The other, we have exited less attractive businesses over the past six quarters. Abco, W. Brown, and some parts of our environmental, U.S. Marine and the remaining remnants of our surety business. We are picking up a bit of it in a related shift if you will in related business.
And then the last one I’d say is we’ve continually become better at risk management and underwriting modeling. All those things have added up to stabilize the loss ratio despite pricing pressure."

In the first quarter of 2009, property cat represented 16% of our net earned premium. It’s now 21%. And we did reduce our position in the trade credit business quite substantially, so there’s a big business mix change.
In addition, during quarters three and four of 2009, we took 2.7 and 2.5 loss ratio points from impacts from old structured product contracts. And finally, during this quarter, we enjoyed the benefit of $12 million of reinstatement premium on a nonproperty program in Europe, which contributed quite substantially.
In terms of growth, in ReInsurance we try not to predict things too much because it can be lumpy depending on the amount of renewal activity we have in each quarter. As you know, the first quarter is very heavy, the second quarter is reasonably light and then we move into July 1 very heavy and then virtually none the rest of the year.

We like to think that’s because our front line people are so capable and stayed together. But that caused our clients to want to continue to be backed by XL.

I think around this table we have people who have been through several complete cycles and we all know that there is theoretical tea leaves and we also know that every cycle we either lived through or have examined on a historical basis, acted in an extremely unpredictable and idiosyncratic way.
The most obvious is when you have some massive change in the capital base of the industry. We saw signs of that happening due to the credit crisis and then as the credit crisis back off, everybody calmed down about capital as a part of the component.
At the same time, you have I think these days, on a relative scale compared to say a decade ago, you have fewer management teams running larger books of business with greater emphasis on bottom line results, and you would think that would start to kick in here as the results run out of the benefit of prior year reserves and run into more difficult conditions.
Those are obviously industry-wide comments. And I just think you could get a turn from any of those things, but the reality is, right now whereas there were some optimistic signs in our pricing as you moved through last year toward the end of the year, it’s kind of reversed itself in a small way at this stage, and we’ll just have to wait and see.
I can’t give you a better answer than that. I think it will be what it will be and we know that our job is to manage through the cycle, and that means we stay disciplined about our underwriting criteria. We don’t let it lag, and we’re very cautious about the other inputs that could affect the book of business that’s in place like inflation and the rest."
