I continue to be pleased with our execution and progress we are making across our businesses.

I continue to be pleased with our execution and progress we are making across our businesses. Just last month, we held an event with analysts and investors where we talked about the successful transformation of LSI and the strong opportunities we have for growth as we move forward.
We appreciate all of the positive feedback we’ve received from analysts, existing holders and potential new shareholders following this event. I will reinforce some of those highlights today and also provide further updates in each of our businesses.
For Q1, revenues were at the high-end of the upwardly revised guidance range that we provided in mid-March. We grew 9% sequentially in our semiconductor business driven by increases in networking standard and custom products, SAN and IP licensing.
We also have revenue significantly above typical seasonality in our storage systems, HCD and SAS businesses reflecting improving end demand. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating margins were 11.7%.
LSI generated a double-digit operating margins in the first quarter of the calendar year, which is typically our weakest seasonal quarter, demonstrating the operating leverage we have created to the transformation of the company. During the quarter, we also repurchased $26 million worth of stock under our $250 million share repurchase authorization.
Before I talk about our businesses, here are the key takeaways that I would like you to get from this call. First, we continue to secure significant design wins with industry leaders across our businesses.
Second, we are positioned to grow faster than the markets we serve and third we are executing for our business and financial milestones and our focus on delivering solid progress, against our business model this year.
At our Analyst Day event last month, we showed the transformation at LS -- that has occurred at LSI over the past several years. This included focusing on fewer and larger end markets going after established and growing applications and narrowing our focus to market-leading customers.
This focus, combined with product leadership has resulted in a design win pipeline that is unprecedented in value and robustness for LSI. Our annual design win values over the past few years in our semi segment have been in the range of 1.5 to 2 times higher than our reported annual revenues in that segment.
Additionally, in our networking business, our strategy is resulting in an improved design win conversion rate, which is percentage of design win value that we expect to reach production and materializing the revenue. All of this gives us great confidence in the future revenue growth.
I’m very pleased that we are successfully executing on design win milestones we outlined. Last year, we had told the investment community that we would expand our customer base and HCD and growing SAS. Last month, we indicated that we had one SoC’s across all five HCD OEMs and that two of the top three server OEMs chose LSI SAS RoC and ServerRAID solutions for the 2011 [Intel RAM] server generation.
We also successfully intercepted the solid state drive market at the right time and continue to win with market leaders in networking, where we announced our first major Axxia network processor win at one of the top two wireless infrastructure players.
We are also solidly positioned in markets that have strong growth projections and low volatility. Overall, we believe our end markets have recovered considerably from the economic downturn and, supply and demand continue to be in balance. While the supply chain has been tight, we have managed to meet customer demand requirements.
In fact for Q1, we believe that LSI’s performance was in line or better than our served markets. Our external storage and HCD businesses performed roughly in line with IDCs estimates of end market performance for the first quarter. We believe that we out grew the market in our server and storage connectivity businesses and in networking standard and custom products for Q1.
Now I want to review with you the business highlights for last quarter in our storage and networking businesses. I’ll begin with storage systems, which includes both external storage systems and server RAID adapters and software.
In our storage systems business, our first quarter revenues was highest ever for the first quarter of the year, building on Q4’s record results, we now have two quarters in a row of record revenue performance.
Going forward, we are expanding our opportunities for continued growth. Healthy storage demand drivers are expected to fuel strong capacity growth and these industry trends are aligned with our core capabilities.
Based on our analysis of IDC’s storage systems tracker, we are the number one provider of entry-level external storage systems to our OEM customers. Entry-level is the fastest levels storage systems segment and in the second half of this year, we expect to ramp a new platform that will help us extend our leadership in this space.
The new platform is based on LSI’s highest performance 6 gig SAS storage processor and will offer up to four times the performance and twice the capacity compared with our current industry-leading platform. It brings mid-range performance, connectivity and functionality to entry price points.
A key expansion opportunity in entry-level systems is in a white box market. IDC estimates that 42% of entry units are supplied by non-Tier 1 OEMs. This is a substantial opportunity for LSI to pursue a $1.6 billion year market that we are not currently serving through our traditional OEM customers.
Through our MegaRAID and 3ware products, we already serve much of this segment and our goal is to expand our presence by adding non-branded entry-level storage systems building blocks to our offerings in this channel. Whitebox system builders will be able to integrate these storage building blocks into their branded product offerings.
We’re also pleased with our competitive position at Oracle. Oracle recently posted a PDF on their website to address their partnership with Hitachi Data Systems. We believe there have been positive developments for LSI, including determination of the HDS relationship. This will give LSI more room to grow and Oracle also mentions support for technology partners associated with the 6780 system and 6000 series, which is all leveraging LSI’s storage system technology.
In our ServeRAID business, we continue to raise the bar relative to our competition by leveraging our leading SAS silicon and adding advanced data management capabilities. During the quarter, we announced four new data management offerings that will be released throughout this year and that addressing key end-user paying points. These were fast pass for boosting SSD I/O performance, safe store for data security, cascade for SSD data sharing and data snapping recovery, which is similar to snapshot and recovery available on external storage systems today.
I’ll now turn to storage semiconductors, which includes SAS, SAN and HDD. In SAS, we have the broadest portfolio solutions and continue to extend our leadership. Since the inception of SAS, LSI has shipped nearly 20 million SAS-based products across our full portfolio, which is over 10 times more than the units shipments of our nearest competitor.
By offering best in class SAS technologies, assured interoperability and single vendor support, LSI is the silicon systems supplier of choice for top OEMs. In fact that S&W, we demonstrated 1 million input outputs per second with our PCIe Based Solid State Storage Solution in a single server, further demonstrating our performance leadership in the space.
Based our broad portfolio and technology leadership, market leading customers continue to choose LSI solutions. Our next generation SAS RoC and RAID software have already been chosen by two of the top three x86 server OEMs for their 2011 [Intel RAM] regeneration servers. These wins position us well to secure [RAM] regeneration wins at other top server OEMs.
We have announced new products to further our growth in SAS. Our PCIe Based Solid Stage Storage Solutions are under evaluation at 10 customers and we have already secured the first design win.
In addition, we sampled the industry’s first series of 6 gig SAS Switches to customers which significantly extend the capabilities of SAS and direct attached storage environment. In external storage, we expect to gain share as SAS replaces fiber channel as the distant host interconnect. Over five customers are using LSI SAS bridge an Expander Solutions in external storage applications including Dell, Oracle, IBM, NetApp, as well as Dot Hill.
Turning to hard disk drives, we are executing on all the milestones we have set and are clearly positioned to grow SoC share as our solutions are increasingly deployed by customers.
Our competitive position is dramatically improved since we accelerated our regional development cadence and hit the market inflection point with the industry’s first 40-nanometer LDPC solutions. The net result is that over the past several years we’ve gone from being an SoC supplier to one customer to expanding our customer base with SoC wins at all five HCD OEMs.
Our HCD team is now focusing on successfully executing on all of these new wins and key development programs. In fact, we’ve already taped out the first SoC for one of our new HCD customers.
Now I would like to review the networking business where LSI is bringing strong differentiation to customers. The wireless segment in particular is a key focus area for LSI, for traffic levels are increasing dramatically driven by smartphones and portable PCs.
Mobile data traffic is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 100% between 2009 and 2014. This traffic management challenge becomes even more complex with increasing levels of video content across the wireless network. To meet this challenge, carriers have to deploy new base station and media gateway architectures that deliver significantly higher capacity and far greater capability at lower system costs and power.
Last quarter at Mobile World Congress, we announced and sampled our end-to-end next-generation wireless architecture and platform with three multicore solutions for wireless applications.
The Axxia Communication Processor which paves the way for single multi-radio access network, StarPro Media and Baseband for DSPs, which provide higher performance for video streaming, enabling higher traffic loads at lower cost and a new Link Communication Processor that allows network traffic to be easily and efficiently migrated from existing networks to next-generation Ethernet and IP networks.
This portfolio of multiprocessor cores is based on a scalable and unified architecture which enables customers to drive common investments resulting in more efficient development efforts. This foundational approach is creating multigenerational design wins for LSI key customers.
All of the five top wireless infrastructure OEMs are currently using LSI products and we expect this new portfolio of products to extend our footprint within these customers. Last quarter, one of the top two wireless infrastructure OEMs shows our recently introduced Axxia processor for their next-generation multi-radio base stations and wireless gateway platforms.
Now, let me hand the call over to Bryon, who will take you through our results and provide guidance.

30956,100533919,58246,"LSI Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","LSI Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Abhi. Let me start by saying we had a very strong Q1 2010. Seasonal buying patterns by enterprises typically cause a sequential decline in our first quarter revenues. However, we delivered first quarter revenues, which were sequentially flat to Q4",1437,"Thanks, Abhi. Let me start by saying we had a very strong Q1 2010. Seasonal buying patterns by enterprises typically cause a sequential decline in our first quarter revenues. However, we delivered first quarter revenues, which were sequentially flat to Q4. First quarter revenues also represented a significant improvement relative to Q1 of 2009 when we were all experiencing the effects of the economic downturn.
On a year-over-year basis, consolidated revenues were up 32%. Consolidated gross margins excluding special items were up 500 basis points. Operating margins, excluding special items went from negative 1.7% to a positive 11.7%. Operating cash flows improved $116 million going from negative $10 million to positive $106 million. Our net cash balance was up 39%, as compared to Q1 2009. In addition, we will be debt free before the end of Q2.
During the downturn, we maintain a consistent focus on product development in support of a strong pipeline of design wins while prudently managing expenses and sustaining a strong cash position.
In addition to significantly beating the original Q1 guidance we provided in January, we met or exceeded the revised guidance we provided in March on revenue, gross margin and EPS.
And now some highlights from the recent quarter. Revenues were $637 million, exceeding the midpoint of our increased guidance by $7 million and sequentially flat from Q4 2009.
Consolidated gross margins excluding special items were 47.7% improving sequentially by 30 basis points. Operating expenses, excluding special items were approximately $229.5 million.
Non-GAAP earnings were $0.14 per share, which is above the high-end of our revised guidance range. We recorded a net tax benefit of $19 million in Q1, which included a favorable $28 million tax item related to the exploration of statute of limitations. If not for this item, we would have reported non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.10 per share, which is above the midpoint of our revised guidance.
Operating cash flows were very strong at $106 million. And finally, total cash and short-term investments increased to slightly over $1 billion and net cash or cash and short-term investments net of total debt increased to $666 million.
And now turning to a more detailed discussion on the quarter beginning with revenues. Semiconductor revenues for Q1 were sequentially up $35 million or 9.2% to $416 million significantly stronger than normal seasonality. In addition, revenues were up 28% as compared to Q1 2009.
Our storage semiconductor revenues, which include hard disk drive silicon, SAS standard components and storage area network ICs, were sequentially up $12 million or 4.4% to $286 million. Storage semiconductors represented 45% of total revenues in the first quarter.
Q1 revenues in our networking business were $114 million, sequentially up $19 million or 21% and represented 18% of total revenues for the quarter. Revenues for the IP business were up in the first quarter at $16 million.
And turning now to our storage systems business, which includes both external storage systems and server RAID adapters and software. Storage systems delivered a record Q1 in terms of revenues at $221 million. On a sequential basis, revenues for the systems business were down $36 million or 14% from Q4 2009, primarily due to seasonality. This represented, however, a 40% improvement in systems revenues, as compared to Q1 2009. The storage systems segment represented 35% of LSI’s total revenues in the first quarter.
Moving next to gross margins, LSI’s consolidated Q1 gross margin, excluding special items was 47.7%, which was sequentially up 30 basis points from Q4 ‘09. Semiconductor gross margins, excluding special items, sequentially increased 10 basis points from the fourth quarter to 52.0%. Storage systems gross margins for the first quarter, excluding special items sequentially declined 80 basis points to 39.8%, primarily due to seasonally lower revenues.
Moving to operating expenses, R&D together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items totaled $229.5 million in Q1. The sequential increase in Q4 is primarily due to the reinstatement of compensation and benefit programs we suspended early in 2009, along with lower relative spending in Q4 due to the vacations and shutdowns we had during the final quarter of 2009.
Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter was 11.7%, or $74.7 million. Interest income and other net of interest expense, excluding special items was a loss of $1.1 million for Q1.
And now, let me turn to the special items we recorded in the first quarter, which netted to $70 million. Special items, primarily non-cash included $40 million in amortization of acquisition related items, $16 million of stock-based compensation expense and $13 million of net restructuring costs and other items. Included in the $13 million of net restructuring costs and other items was a $12 million write-down of equity securities.
Moving next to tax, our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter, based on our profitability and different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discreet items. Such a discreet item occurred in Q1, which related to the expiration of statutes of limitations. This release was included in the net tax benefit of $19 million we recorded in the quarter versus the $8 million tax provision we guided to in January.
As noted earlier, if not for this item, we would have reported non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.10 per share, above the midpoint of our revised guidance.
On a GAAP basis, first quarter net income was $23 million, or $0.03 per share. Net profit excluding special items was $92 million, or $0.14 per share. Keep in mind that both the GAAP and non-GAAP results recorded in Q1 include the above mentioned $19 million tax benefit.
Share count for the period for GAAP purposes was 664 million shares and 690 million for non-GAAP purposes. The reported non-GAAP share count was higher than GAAP due to the exclusion of 26 million shares related to our outstanding convertible debt. When calculating non-GAAP EPS for the period as a result of the non-GAAP profitability level.
And turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. We continue building a solid cash position. First quarter operating cash flows were quite strong, coming in at $106 million. Positive operating cash flow was driven primarily by operating performance coupled with a continuous focus on efficient management of working capital.
Our cash and short-term investments increased ending the March quarter at just over $1 billion. Relative to the $250 million share repurchase program we announced in March, we utilized $26 million to repurchase 4 million shares during the first quarter. LSI’s net cash position at the end of the quarter improved sequentially by approximately $54 million to $666 million.
Finally with respect to Q1 results, depreciation and software amortization was $26 million and capital expenditures were $15 million.
The following is our guidance for Q2 2010. Revenues in the range of $635 to $665 million, at the mid-point this is sequentially up approximately 2%. We expect our storage systems business along with our storage and networking semiconductor businesses to be sequentially up in Q2.
Consolidated gross margin, excluding special items is expected to be between 46.7% and 48.7%. We expect gross margins, excluding special items to be approximately 52% for the semiconductor segment and approximately 38% for the systems segment.
Operating expenses, excluding special items are expected to be in the range of $228 million to $238 million as we continue to invest supporting our strong design win pipeline.
Interest income and other net interest expense is expected to net income of approximately $1 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $50 to $70 million. The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $9 million for Q2. We expect Q2 GAAP net income per share in the range of negative $0.03 to positive $0.06, and EPS excluding special items to be in the range of $0.08 to $0.14.
The share count is expected to be approximately 664 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $26 million and capital expenditures of approximately $15 million. Also we will repay the $350 million of outstanding convertible notes when they mature in May after which LSI will be debt free.
In conclusion, we are emerging from the economic downturn well-positioned and excited about our prospects to drive growth going forward. Our focus for 2010 remains consistent. Deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth to drive continued progress toward our business model. Continue to drive cash generation and maintain a solid balance sheet and drive continued design win momentum for future growth.
And now, let me turn the call back to Abhi.

As we think about the progression to Q2, we see a few minor mix changes as well as some benefits that we had in [period] costs in Q1, which revert back to more normal levers. For example, we had a lower than normal warranty cost in Q1, which drove significant gross margin performance in the quarter. We’ll have more typical levers Q2.
But let me reiterate, the Q2 gross margin guidance we have for systems at that approximately 38% range, we would consider to be very good for that level of revenue and at this point of time of the year and we’d expect to kind of build from that point.

Corporate spending relative to enterprise has still yet to really kick in.

So it’s a bit of a complicated question and it’s not something we’re going to provide a level of granularity on.
Now I want to also comment that are midrange business has done very well also. The last three quarters, especially relative to our combined efforts between LSI and IBM, we have seen solid midrange growth, grow faster than the market. Share gains in this particular space. If I look at our high-end midrange product and in terms of its mix in Q1 of 2010 versus 2009, significantly higher, significant year-over-year units growth. It also tells me that in customers are starting to buy up again. And it’s a pattern that we’ve now seen for several quarters.

We’ve seen great traction there. That’s largely a software oriented sale that comes with very nice margins. So software certainly has been a big push as we continue to scale and grow our overall revenue, that helps in terms of absorption rates and improves gross margins as well. And where we can, we are certainly looking at just evolving the overall business model where we increasingly shipped more of the RAID controller, the fiberglass and silicon software versus necessarily a lot of sheet metal, if you will, right.

I'm continued to be pleased with our execution and the progress we're making across our businesses. Just last month, we held an event with analysts and investors where we talked about successful transformation of LSI and the strong opportunities we have for growth as we move forward. We appreciate all of the positive feedback we received from analysts, existing holders and potential new shareholders following this event. I will reinforce some of those highlights today and also provide further updates in each of our businesses.
For Q1, revenues were at the high end of the upwardly revised guidance range that we provided in mid-March. We grew 9%, sequentially, in our Semiconductor business driven by increases in networking standard and custom products, SAN and IP licensing. We also had revenue significantly above typical seasonality in our Storage Systems, HDD and SAS businesses, reflecting improving end demand. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating margins were 11.7%. LSI generated double-digit operating margins in the first quarter of the calendar year, which is typically our weakest seasonal quarter, demonstrating the operating leverage we have created through the transformation of the company.
During the quarter, we also repurchased $26 million worth of stock under our $250 million share repurchase authorization. 
Before I talk about our businesses, here are the key takeaways that I would like you to get from this call: First, we continue to secure significant design wins with industry leaders across our businesses. Second, we are positioned to grow faster than the markets we serve. And third, we are executing to our business and financial milestones and are focused on delivering solid progress against our business model this year.
At our Analyst Day event last month, we showed the transformation that has occurred at LSI over the past several years. This included focusing on fewer and larger end markets, going after established and growing applications and narrowing our focus to market-leading customers.
This focus, combined with product leadership, has resulted in a design win pipeline that is unprecedented in value and robustness for LSI. Our annual design win values over the past few years in our Semi segment have been in the range of 1.5x to 2x higher than our reported annual revenues in that segment. Additionally, in our Networking business, our strategy is resulting in an improved design win conversion rate, which is the percentage of design win value that we expect to reach production and materialize into revenue. All of this gives us great confidence in the future of revenue growth.
I'm very pleased that we are successfully executing on design win milestones we outlined. Last year, we had told the investment community that we would expand our customer base in HDD and growing SAS. Last month, we indicated that we had one SoC across all five HDD OEMs and that two of the top three server OEMs chose LSI SAS ROC and server RAID solutions for their 2011 Intel Romley server generation. We also successfully intercepted the solid state drive market at the right time and continue to win with market leaders in networking, where we announced our first major Axxia network processor win at one of the top two wireless infrastructure players. We are also solidly positioned in markets that have strong growth projections and low volatility. 
Overall, we believe our end markets have recovered considerably from the economic downturn, and supply and demand continue to be in balance. While the supply chain has been tight, we have managed to meet customer demand requirements. In fact, for Q1, we believe that LSI's performance was in line or better than our served markets. Our external storage and ACD businesses performed roughly in line with IDC's estimates of end market performance for the first quarter. We believe that we outgrew the market in our Server and Storage Connectivity businesses and in networking standard and custom products for Q1. 
Now I want to review with you the business highlights for last quarter in our Storage and Networking businesses. 
I'll begin with storage systems, which includes both external storage systems and server RAID adapters and software. In our Storage Systems business, our first quarter revenues were the highest ever for the first quarter of the year. Building on Q4's record results, we now have two quarters in a row of record-revenue performance. Going forward, we are expanding our opportunities for continued growth. Healthy storage demand drivers are expected to fuel strong capacity growth, and these industry trends are aligned with our core capabilities.
Based on our analysis of IDC's storage systems tracker, we are the number one provider entry-level external storage systems through our OEM customers. Entry-level is the fastest growing Storage Systems segment. And in the second half of this year, we expect to ramp a new platform that will help us extend our leadership in this space. The new platform is based on LSI's highest performance 6-gig SAS storage processor and will offer up to 4x the performance and twice the capacity compared with our current industry-leading platform. It brings mid-range performance, connectivity and functionality to entry price points.
A key expansion opportunity in entry-level systems is in the white box market. IEC estimates that 42% of entry units are supplied by non-Tier 1 OEMs. This is a substantial opportunity for LSI to pursue a $1.6 billion a year market that we are not currently serving to our traditional OEM customers. Through our MegaRAID and 3ware products, we already served much of this segment, and our goal is to expand our presence by adding non-branded entry-level storage systems building blocks to our offerings in this channel. White box system builders will be able to integrate these storage building blocks into their branded product offerings.
We are also pleased with our competitive position at Oracle. Oracle recently posted a PDF on their website to address their partnership with Hitachi Data Systems. We believe there have been positive developments for LSI, including the termination of the HDS relationship. This will give LSI more room to grow, and Oracle also mentions support for technology partners associated with the 6780 system and 6000 series, which is all leveraging LSI storage system technology.
In our Server RAID [ph] (19:40) business, we continue to raise the bar relative to our competition by leveraging our leading SAS silicon in adding advanced data management capabilities. During the quarter, we announced four new data management offerings that will be released throughout this year aimed at addressing key end-user paying points. These were at fast path for boosting SSD I/O performance, safe store for data security, cascade for SSD data tiering and data snap and recovery, which is similar to snapshot and recovery available on external storage systems today.
I'll now turn to storage semiconductors, which includes the SAS, SAN and HDD. In SAS, we have the broadest portfolio solutions and continue to extend our leadership. Since the inception of SAS, LSI has shipped nearly 20 million SAS-based products across our full portfolio, which is over 10x more than the unit shipments of our nearest competitor. By offering best-in-class SAS technologies, assured interoperability and single-vendor support, LSI is the silicon-to-systems supplier of choice for top OEMs. In fact, at SNW, we demonstrated 1 million input-outputs per second with our PCIe-based solid-state storage solution in a single server, further demonstrating our performance leadership in this space.
Based on our broad portfolio and technology leadership, market-leading customers continue to choose LSI solutions. Our next-generation SAS ROCs and RAID software have already been chosen by two of the top three server x86 server OEMs for their 2011 Intel Romley generation servers. These wins positioned us well to secure Romley generation wins at other top server OEMs.
We have announced new products to further our growth in SAS. Our PCIe-based, solid-state storage solutions are under evaluation at 10 customers, and we have already secured the first design win. In addition, we sampled the industry's first series of 6-gig SAS switches to customers, which significantly extend the capabilities of SAS and direct-attached storage environments.
In external storage, we expect to gain share as SAS replaces Fibre Channel as the disk and host interconnect. Over five customers are using LSI's SAS bridge and expander solutions in external storage applications including Dell, Oracle, IBM, NetApp as well as Dot Hill.
Turning to hard disk drives. We are executing on all of the milestones we have set and are clearly position to grow SoC share as our solutions are increasingly deployed by customers. Our competitive position has dramatically improved since we accelerated our regional development cadence and hit the market inflection point with industry's first 40-nanometer LDPC solutions. The net result is that over the past several years, we have gone from being an SoC supplier to one customer to expanding our customer base with SoC wins at all five HDD OEMs.
Our HDD team is now focused on successfully executing on all of these new wins and key development programs. In fact, we've already taped out the first SoC for one of our new HDD customers. Now I would like to review the Networking business where LSI is bring a strong depreciation to customers.
The wireless segment in particular is the key focus area for LSI, where traffic levels are increasing dramatically driven by smartphones and portable PCs. Mobile data traffic is forecasted to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of over 100% between 2009 and 2014. This traffic management challenge becomes even more complex, with increasing levels of video content across the wireless network. To meet this challenge, carriers have to deploy new base station and media gateway architectures that delivers significant higher capacity and far greater capability at lower system costs and power. 
Last quarter, at Mobile World Congress, we announced and sampled our end-to-end next-generation wireless architecture and platform with three multi-core solutions for wireless applications: The Axxia communications processor, which paves the way for single multi-radio access network, StarPro media and based-band processor DSPs, which provide higher performance for video streaming, enabling higher traffic loads at lower costs and a new Link Communication Processor that allows network traffic to be easily and efficiently migrated from existing networks to next-generation Ethernet and IP networks. This portfolio of multi-processor cores is based on a scalable and unified architecture, which enables customers to drive common investments, resulting in more efficient development efforts. This foundational approach is creating multi-generational design wins for LSI key customers. All of the five top wireless infrastructure OEMs are currently using LSI products, and we expect this new portfolio of products to extend our footprint within these customers.
Last quarter, one of the top two wireless infrastructure OEMs shows our recently introduced Axxia processor for their next-generation, multi-radio-based stations and wireless gateway platforms. Now let me hand the call over to Bryon, who will take you through our results and provide guidance."
30956,100533919,58442,"LSI Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","LSI Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Abhi, and let me start by saying, we had a very strong Q1 2010. Seasonal buying patterns by enterprises typically caused a sequential decline in our first quarter revenues. However, we delivered first quarter revenues, which were sequentially flat",1439,"Thanks, Abhi, and let me start by saying, we had a very strong Q1 2010. Seasonal buying patterns by enterprises typically caused a sequential decline in our first quarter revenues. However, we delivered first quarter revenues, which were sequentially flat to Q4. First quarter revenues also represented a significant improvement relative to Q1 of 2009, when we were all experiencing the effects of the economic downturn. 
On a year-over-year basis, consolidated revenues were up 32%, consolidated gross margins excluding special items or up 500 basis points, operating margins excluding special items went from negative 1.7% to a positive 11.7%, operating cash flows improved $116 million, going from negative $10 million to positive $106 million. Our net cash balance was up 39% as compared to Q1 2009. In addition, we will be debt-free before the end of Q2.
During the downturn, we maintained a consistent focus on product development in support of a strong pipeline of design wins, while prudently managing expenses and sustaining a strong cash position. In addition to significantly beating the original Q1 guidance we provided in January, we met or exceeded the revised guidance we provided in March on revenue, gross margin and EPS. 
And now some highlights from the recent quarter. Revenues were $637 million, exceeding the midpoint of our increased guidance by $7 million and sequentially flat from Q4 2009. Consolidated gross margins, excluding special items, were 47.7%, improving sequentially by 30 basis points. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were approximately $229.5 million. Non-GAAP earnings were $0.14 per share, which is above the high end of our revised guidance range. We recorded a net tax benefit of $19 million in Q1, which included a favorable $28 million tax item, related to the expiration of statutes of limitations. If not for this item, we would have recorded non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.10 per share, which is above the midpoint of our revised guidance. Operating cash flows were very strong at $106 million. And finally, total cash and short-term investments increased to slightly over $1 billion and net cash, or cash and short-term investments, net of total debt increased to $666 million.
And now turning to a more detailed discussion of the quarter beginning with revenues. Semiconductor revenues for Q1 were sequentially up $35 million or 9.2% to $416 million, significantly stronger than normal seasonality. In addition, revenues were up 28%, as compared to Q1 2009. Our Storage Semiconductor revenues, which include hard disk drives silicon, SAS standard components and storage area network ICs were sequentially up $12 million or 4.4% to $286 million. Storage Semiconductors represented 45% of total revenues in the first quarter. Q1 revenues in our Networking business were $114 million, sequentially up $19 million or 21% and represented 18% of total revenues for the quarter. Revenues for the IP business were up in the first quarter at $16 million. 
And turning now to our Storage Systems business, which includes both external storage systems and server RAID adapters and software, storage systems delivered a record Q1 in terms of revenues at $221 million. On a sequential basis, revenues for the Systems business were down $36 million or 14% from Q4 2009, primarily due to seasonality. This represented, however, a 40% improvement in Systems revenues as compared to Q1 2009. The Storage Systems segment represented 35% of LSI's total revenues in the first quarter.
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's consolidated Q1 gross margin, excluding special items, was 47.7%, which was sequentially up 30 basis points from Q4 '09. Semiconductor gross margins, excluding special items, sequentially increased 10 basis points from the fourth quarter to 52.0%. Storage Systems gross margins for the first quarter, excluding special items, sequentially declined 80 basis points to 39.8% primarily due to seasonally lower revenues.
Moving to operating expenses. R&D together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, totaled $229.5 million in Q1. The sequential increase in Q4 is primarily due to the reinstatement of compensation and benefit programs we suspended early in 2009, along with lower relative spending in Q4, due to the vacations and shutdowns we had during the final quarter of 2009. Non-GAAP operating income, as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter, was 11.7% or $74.7 million. Interest income and other net of interest expense, excluding special items, was a loss of $1.1 million for Q1. 
And now, let me turn to the special items we recorded in the first quarter, which netted to $70 million. Special items, primarily non-cash, included $40 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $16 million of stock-based compensation expense and $13 million of net restructuring costs and other items. Included in the $13 million of net restructuring costs and other items was a $12 million write-down of equity securities.
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter, based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. Such a discrete item occurred in Q1, which relate  to the expiration of statutes of limitations. This release was excluded in the net tax benefit of $19 million we recorded in the quarter versus the $8 million tax provision we guided to in January. As noted earlier, if not for this item, we would've reported non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.10 per share, above the midpoint of our revised guidance.
On a GAAP basis, first quarter net income was $23 million or $0.03 per share. Net profit, excluding special items, was $92 million or $0.14 per share. Keep in mind that both the GAAP and non-GAAP results recorded in Q1 include the above-mentioned $19 million tax benefit. 
Share count for the period for and GAAP purposes was 664 million shares and 690 million for non-GAAP purposes. The reported non-GAAP share count was higher than GAAP, due to the inclusion of 26 million shares related to our outstanding convertible debt when calculating non-GAAP EPS for the period, as a result of the non-GAAP profitability level.
And turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. We continue building a solid cash position. First quarter operating cash flows were quite strong coming in at $106 million. A positive operating cash flow was driven primarily by operating performance, coupled with our continuous focus on efficient management of working capital. Our cash and short-term investments increased ending the March quarter at just over $1 billion. Relative to the $250 million share repurchase program we announced in March, we utilized $26 million to repurchase 4 million shares during the first quarter.
LSI's net cash position at the end of the quarter improved sequentially by approximately $54 million to $666 million. And finally, with respect to Q1 results, depreciation and software amortization was $26 million, and capital expenditures were $15 million.
The following is our guidance for Q2 2010: Revenues in the range of $635 million to $665 million. At the midpoint, this is sequentially up approximately 2%. We expect our Storage Systems business, along with our Storage and Networking Semiconductor businesses to be sequentially up in Q2. Consolidated gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be 46.7% and 48.7%. We expect gross margins, excluding special items, to be approximately 52% for the Semiconductor segment and approximately 38% for the Systems segment.
Operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the range of $228 million to $238 million as we continue to invest, supporting our strong design win pipeline. Interest income and other and interest expense is expected to net to income of approximately $1 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $50 million to $70 million. The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $9 million for Q2.
We expect Q2 GAAP net income per share in the range of negative $0.03 to positive $0.06 and EPS, excluding special items, to be in the range of $0.08 to $0.14. The share count is expected to be approximately 664 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $26 million and capital expenditures of approximately $15 million. Also we will repay the $350 million of outstanding convertible notes when they mature in May. After which, LSI will be debt-free.
In conclusion, we are merging from the economic downturn well-positioned and excited about our prospects to drive growth going forward. Our focus for 2010 remains consistent: Deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth to drive continued progress towards are business model, continue to drive cash generation and maintain a solid balance sheet and drive continued design win momentum for future growth.

In terms of our Q1 gross margin performance, which is very strong, we're already operating at or above our business model targets. Q1 was strong in what is typically a seasonally low quarter. As we think about the progression to Q2, we see a few minor mix changes, as well as some benefits that we had in period costs in Q1 which revert back to more normal levels. For example, we had a lower-than-normal warranty costs in Q1, which drove significant gross margin performance in the quarter. We'll be having more typical levels in Q2.

If I look at the second half at this juncture, what I would go by is overall, economic indicators are generally positive. Tech demand has certainly been recovering. Corporate spending relative to enterprise has still yet to really kick in. And then from an overall supply-demand standpoint, I'd say the supply line relative to demand has sort of aligned itself nicely. I'm not concerned about inventory. So all those things bode towards growth in the second half, but I'm not going to place a percentage number on that for you at this time."

I'm continued to be pleased with our execution and the progress we're making across our businesses.

I'm continued to be pleased with our execution and the progress we're making across our businesses. Just last month, we held an event with analysts and investors where we talked about successful transformation of LSI and the strong opportunities we have for growth as we move forward. We appreciate all of the positive feedback we received from analysts, existing holders and potential new shareholders following this event. I will reinforce some of those highlights today and also provide further updates in each of our businesses.
For Q1, revenues were at the high end of the upwardly revised guidance range that we provided in mid-March. We grew 9%, sequentially, in our Semiconductor business driven by increases in networking standard and custom products, SAN and IP licensing. We also had revenue significantly above typical seasonality in our Storage Systems, HDD and SAS businesses, reflecting improving end demand. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating margins were 11.7%. LSI generated double-digit operating margins in the first quarter of the calendar year, which is typically our weakest seasonal quarter, demonstrating the operating leverage we have created through the transformation of the company.
During the quarter, we also repurchased $26 million worth of stock under our $250 million share repurchase authorization. 
Before I talk about our businesses, here are the key takeaways that I would like you to get from this call: First, we continue to secure significant design wins with industry leaders across our businesses. Second, we are positioned to grow faster than the markets we serve. And third, we are executing to our business and financial milestones and are focused on delivering solid progress against our business model this year.
At our Analyst Day event last month, we showed the transformation that has occurred at LSI over the past several years. This included focusing on fewer and larger end markets, going after established and growing applications and narrowing our focus to market-leading customers.
This focus, combined with product leadership, has resulted in a design win pipeline that is unprecedented in value and robustness for LSI. Our annual design win values over the past few years in our Semi segment have been in the range of 1.5x to 2x higher than our reported annual revenues in that segment. Additionally, in our Networking business, our strategy is resulting in an improved design win conversion rate, which is the percentage of design win value that we expect to reach production and materialize into revenue. All of this gives us great confidence in the future of revenue growth.
I'm very pleased that we are successfully executing on design win milestones we outlined. Last year, we had told the investment community that we would expand our customer base in HDD and growing SAS. Last month, we indicated that we had won SoCs across all five HDD OEMs and that two of the top three server OEMs chose LSI SAS ROC and ServeRAID solutions for their 2011 Intel Romley server generation. We also successfully intercepted the solid state drive market at the right time and continue to win with market leaders in networking, where we announced our first major Axxia network processor win at one of the top two wireless infrastructure players. We are also solidly positioned in markets that have strong growth projections and low volatility. 
Overall, we believe our end markets have recovered considerably from the economic downturn, and supply and demand continue to be in balance. While the supply chain has been tight, we have managed to meet customer demand requirements. In fact, for Q1, we believe that LSI's performance was in line or better than our served markets. Our External Storage and ACD businesses performed roughly in line with IDC's estimates of end market performance for the first quarter. We believe that we outgrew the market in our Server and Storage Connectivity businesses and in networking standard and custom products for Q1. 
Now I want to review with you the business highlights for last quarter in our Storage and Networking businesses. 
I'll begin with storage systems, which includes both external storage systems and ServeRAID adapters and software. In our Storage Systems business, our first quarter revenues were the highest ever for the first quarter of the year. Building on Q4's record results, we now have two quarters in a row of record-revenue performance. Going forward, we are expanding our opportunities for continued growth. Healthy storage demand drivers are expected to fuel strong capacity growth, and these industry trends are aligned with our core capabilities.
Based on our analysis of IDC's storage systems tracker, we are the number one provider entry-level external storage systems through our OEM customers. Entry-level is the fastest growing Storage Systems segment. And in the second half of this year, we expect to ramp a new platform that will help us extend our leadership in this space. The new platform is based on LSI's highest performance 6-gig SAS storage processor and will offer up to 4x the performance and twice the capacity compared with our current industry-leading platform. It brings mid-range performance, connectivity and functionality to entry price points.
A key expansion opportunity in entry-level systems is in the white box market. IDC estimates that 42% of entry units are supplied by non-Tier 1 OEMs. This is a substantial opportunity for LSI to pursue a $1.6 billion a year market that we are not currently serving to our traditional OEM customers. Through our MegaRAID and 3ware products, we already served much of this segment, and our goal is to expand our presence by adding non-branded entry-level storage system building blocks to our offerings in this channel. White box system builders will be able to integrate these storage building blocks into their branded product offerings.
We are also pleased with our competitive position at Oracle. Oracle recently posted a PDF on their website to address their partnership with Hitachi Data Systems. We believe there have been positive developments for LSI, including the termination of the HDS relationship. This will give LSI more room to grow, and Oracle also mentions support for technology partners associated with the 6780 system and 6000 series, which is all leveraging LSI storage system technology.
In our ServeRAID business, we continue to raise the bar relative to our competition by leveraging our leading SAS silicon in adding advanced data management capabilities. During the quarter, we announced four new data management offerings that will be released throughout this year aimed at addressing key end-user paying points. These were at fast path for boosting SSD I/O performance, safe store for data security, cascade for SSD data tiering and data snap and recovery, which is similar to snapshot and recovery available on external storage systems today.
I'll now turn to storage semiconductors, which includes SAS, SAN and HDD. In SAS, we have the broadest portfolio solutions and continue to extend our leadership. Since the inception of SAS, LSI has shipped nearly 20 million SAS-based products across our full portfolio, which is over 10x more than the unit shipments of our nearest competitor. By offering best-in-class SAS technologies, assured interoperability and single-vendor support, LSI is the silicon-to-systems supplier of choice for top OEMs. In fact, at SNW, we demonstrated 1 million input-outputs per second with our PCIe-based solid-state storage solution in a single server, further demonstrating our performance leadership in this space.
Based on our broad portfolio and technology leadership, market-leading customers continue to choose LSI solutions. Our next-generation SAS ROCs and RAID software have already been chosen by two of the top three x86 server OEMs for their 2011 Intel Romley generation of servers. These wins position us well to secure Romley generation wins at other top server OEMs.
We have announced new products to further our growth in SAS. Our PCIe-based, solid-state storage solutions are under evaluation at 10 customers, and we have already secured the first design win. In addition, we sampled the industry's first series of 6-gig SAS switches to customers, which significantly extend the capabilities of SAS in direct-attached storage environments.
In external storage, we expect to gain share as SAS replaces Fibre Channel as the disk and host interconnect. Over five customers are using LSI's SAS bridge and expander solutions in external storage applications including Dell, Oracle, IBM, NetApp as well as Dot Hill.
Turning to hard disk drives. We are executing on all of the milestones we have set and are clearly positioned to grow SoC share as our solutions are increasingly deployed by customers. Our competitive position has dramatically improved since we accelerated our regional development cadence and hit the market inflection point with the industry's first 40-nanometer LDPC solutions. The net result is that over the past several years, we have gone from being an SoC supplier to one customer to expanding our customer base with SoC wins at all five HDD OEMs.
Our HDD team is now focused on successfully executing on all of these new wins and key development programs. In fact, we've already taped out the first SoC for one of our new HDD customers. Now I would like to review the Networking business where LSI is bringing a strong differentiation to customers.
The wireless segment in particular is the key focus area for LSI, where traffic levels are increasing dramatically driven by smartphones and portable PCs. Mobile data traffic is forecasted to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of over 100% between 2009 and 2014. This traffic management challenge becomes even more complex, with increasing levels of video content across the wireless network. To meet this challenge, carriers have to deploy new base station and media gateway architectures that delivers significant higher capacity and far greater capability at lower system costs and power. 
Last quarter, at Mobile World Congress, we announced and sampled our end-to-end next-generation wireless architecture and platform with three multi-core solutions for wireless applications: The Axxia communications processor, which paves the way for single multi-radio access network, StarPro media and based-band processor DSPs, which provide higher performance for video streaming, enabling higher traffic loads at lower costs and a new Link Communication Processor that allows network traffic to be easily and efficiently migrated from existing networks to next-generation Ethernet and IP networks. This portfolio of multi-processor cores is based on a scalable and unified architecture, which enables customers to drive common investments, resulting in more efficient development efforts. This foundational approach is creating multi-generational design wins for LSI key customers. All of the five top wireless infrastructure OEMs are currently using LSI products, and we expect this new portfolio of products to extend our footprint within these customers.
Last quarter, one of the top two wireless infrastructure OEMs shows our recently introduced Axxia processor for their next-generation, multi-radio-based stations and wireless gateway platforms. Now let me hand the call over to Bryon, who will take you through our results and provide guidance."
30956,100533919,60983,"LSI Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","LSI Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Abhi, and let me start by saying, we had a very strong Q1 2010. Seasonal buying patterns by enterprises typically caused a sequential decline in our first quarter revenues. However, we delivered first quarter revenues, which were sequentially flat",1439,"Thanks, Abhi, and let me start by saying, we had a very strong Q1 2010. Seasonal buying patterns by enterprises typically caused a sequential decline in our first quarter revenues. However, we delivered first quarter revenues, which were sequentially flat to Q4. First quarter revenues also represented a significant improvement relative to Q1 of 2009, when we were all experiencing the effects of the economic downturn. 
On a year-over-year basis, consolidated revenues were up 32%, consolidated gross margins excluding special items or up 500 basis points, operating margins excluding special items went from negative 1.7% to a positive 11.7%, operating cash flows improved $116 million, going from negative $10 million to positive $106 million. Our net cash balance was up 39% as compared to Q1 2009. In addition, we will be debt-free before the end of Q2.
During the downturn, we maintained a consistent focus on product development in support of a strong pipeline of design wins, while prudently managing expenses and sustaining a strong cash position. In addition to significantly beating the original Q1 guidance we provided in January, we met or exceeded the revised guidance we provided in March on revenue, gross margin and EPS. 
And now some highlights from the recent quarter. Revenues were $637 million, exceeding the midpoint of our increased guidance by $7 million and sequentially flat from Q4 2009. Consolidated gross margins, excluding special items, were 47.7%, improving sequentially by 30 basis points. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were approximately $229.5 million. Non-GAAP earnings were $0.14 per share, which is above the high end of our revised guidance range. We recorded a net tax benefit of $19 million in Q1, which included a favorable $28 million tax item, related to the expiration of statutes of limitations. If not for this item, we would have recorded non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.10 per share, which is above the midpoint of our revised guidance. Operating cash flows were very strong at $106 million. And finally, total cash and short-term investments increased to slightly over $1 billion and net cash, or cash and short-term investments, net of total debt increased to $666 million.
And now turning to a more detailed discussion of the quarter beginning with revenues. Semiconductor revenues for Q1 were sequentially up $35 million or 9.2% to $416 million, significantly stronger than normal seasonality. In addition, revenues were up 28%, as compared to Q1 2009. Our Storage Semiconductor revenues, which include hard disk drives silicon, SAS standard components and storage area network ICs were sequentially up $12 million or 4.4% to $286 million. Storage Semiconductors represented 45% of total revenues in the first quarter. Q1 revenues in our Networking business were $114 million, sequentially up $19 million or 21% and represented 18% of total revenues for the quarter. Revenues for the IP business were up in the first quarter at $16 million. 
And turning now to our Storage Systems business, which includes both external storage systems and server RAID adapters and software, storage systems delivered a record Q1 in terms of revenues at $221 million. On a sequential basis, revenues for the Systems business were down $36 million or 14% from Q4 2009, primarily due to seasonality. This represented, however, a 40% improvement in Systems revenues as compared to Q1 2009. The Storage Systems segment represented 35% of LSI's total revenues in the first quarter.
Moving next to gross margins. LSI's consolidated Q1 gross margin, excluding special items, was 47.7%, which was sequentially up 30 basis points from Q4 '09. Semiconductor gross margins, excluding special items, sequentially increased 10 basis points from the fourth quarter to 52.0%. Storage Systems gross margins for the first quarter, excluding special items, sequentially declined 80 basis points to 39.8% primarily due to seasonally lower revenues.
Moving to operating expenses. R&D together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items, totaled $229.5 million in Q1. The sequential increase in Q4 is primarily due to the reinstatement of compensation and benefit programs we suspended early in 2009, along with lower relative spending in Q4, due to the vacations and shutdowns we had during the final quarter of 2009. Non-GAAP operating income, as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter, was 11.7% or $74.7 million. Interest income and other net of interest expense, excluding special items, was a loss of $1.1 million for Q1. 
And now, let me turn to the special items we recorded in the first quarter, which netted to $70 million. Special items, primarily non-cash, included $40 million in amortization of acquisition-related items, $16 million of stock-based compensation expense and $13 million of net restructuring costs and other items. Included in the $13 million of net restructuring costs and other items was a $12 million write-down of equity securities.
Moving next to tax. Our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter, based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and certain discrete items. Such a discrete item occurred in Q1, which relate  to the expiration of statutes of limitations. This release was excluded in the net tax benefit of $19 million we recorded in the quarter versus the $8 million tax provision we guided to in January. As noted earlier, if not for this item, we would've reported non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.10 per share, above the midpoint of our revised guidance.
On a GAAP basis, first quarter net income was $23 million or $0.03 per share. Net profit, excluding special items, was $92 million or $0.14 per share. Keep in mind that both the GAAP and non-GAAP results recorded in Q1 include the above-mentioned $19 million tax benefit. 
Share count for the period for and GAAP purposes was 664 million shares and 690 million for non-GAAP purposes. The reported non-GAAP share count was higher than GAAP, due to the inclusion of 26 million shares related to our outstanding convertible debt when calculating non-GAAP EPS for the period, as a result of the non-GAAP profitability level.
And turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows. We continue building a solid cash position. First quarter operating cash flows were quite strong coming in at $106 million. A positive operating cash flow was driven primarily by operating performance, coupled with our continuous focus on efficient management of working capital. Our cash and short-term investments increased ending the March quarter at just over $1 billion. Relative to the $250 million share repurchase program we announced in March, we utilized $26 million to repurchase 4 million shares during the first quarter.
LSI's net cash position at the end of the quarter improved sequentially by approximately $54 million to $666 million. And finally, with respect to Q1 results, depreciation and software amortization was $26 million, and capital expenditures were $15 million.
The following is our guidance for Q2 2010: Revenues in the range of $635 million to $665 million. At the midpoint, this is sequentially up approximately 2%. We expect our Storage Systems business, along with our Storage and Networking Semiconductor businesses to be sequentially up in Q2. Consolidated gross margin, excluding special items, is expected to be 46.7% and 48.7%. We expect gross margins, excluding special items, to be approximately 52% for the Semiconductor segment and approximately 38% for the Systems segment.
Operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the range of $228 million to $238 million as we continue to invest, supporting our strong design win pipeline. Interest income and other and interest expense is expected to net to income of approximately $1 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately $50 million to $70 million. The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $9 million for Q2.
We expect Q2 GAAP net income per share in the range of negative $0.03 to positive $0.06 and EPS, excluding special items, to be in the range of $0.08 to $0.14. The share count is expected to be approximately 664 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $26 million and capital expenditures of approximately $15 million. Also we will repay the $350 million of outstanding convertible notes when they mature in May. After which, LSI will be debt-free.
In conclusion, we are merging from the economic downturn well-positioned and excited about our prospects to drive growth going forward. Our focus for 2010 remains consistent: Deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth to drive continued progress towards are business model, continue to drive cash generation and maintain a solid balance sheet and drive continued design win momentum for future growth. And now let me turn the call back to Abhi."

The last three quarters, especially relative to our combined efforts between LSI and IBM, we've seen solid Midrange growth, growth faster in the market, share gains in this particular space. If I look at our high-end Midrange product and in terms of its mix in Q1 of 2010 versus 2009, significantly higher, significant year-over-year units growth. It also tells me that end customers are starting to buy up again. And it's a pattern that we've now seen for several quarters."

I am pleased with how our team executed in Q3 delivering non-GAAP EPS above the midpoint of our guidance range even in a challenging demand environment where revenues were impacted. As a management team, we continued to execute",1540,"Good afternoon and welcome. I am pleased with how our team executed in Q3 delivering non-GAAP EPS above the midpoint of our guidance range even in a challenging demand environment where revenues were impacted. As a management team, we continued to execute on the factors we can control to improve our operating margins.
On a non-GAAP basis, we delivered gross margins above the high end of the guidance and above business model and demonstrated continued operating expense control. As a result, we expanded operating margins to 13% and delivered EPS of $0.13 per share. We also had solid operating cash flows of 82 million and were active in buying back stock during the quarter.
Overall, LSI revenues came in at $629 million, which was towards the low end of our guidance range. Softness was driven largely by declines in shipments of hard disk drive SoCs precipitated by well publicized challenges in the hard disk drive end market and associated inventory burn, as well as the anticipated inventory adjustments at our customers in our fibre channel SAN and SAS business. We saw our storage systems business grow quarter-over-quarter and our networking investment areas posted solid sequential growth.
Now I want to review additional business highlights for Q3 including details on new product cycles. I’ll begin with Storage Systems, which includes both external storage systems and server RAID adapters and software.
Our external storage systems business continued to grow in Q3 as IT shops added capacity to meet their digital content growth. We have been expanding our business through a multi-pronged approach encompassing new platform introductions, growth in existing OEM partnerships, and diversification of our customer base and channels.
We’ve seen strong adoption of our recently introduced entry level 2600 storage platform achieving the fastest volume ramp for a new storage platform in our history. The 2600 is now being shipped by seven of our top OEM customers with several more scheduled to launch before the end of this year.
Our midrange segment also saw growth at multiple OEMs. Existing customers such as IBM, Teradata, Dell and SGI all contributed to our sequential growth and are expected to deliver overall growth in Q4 as well.
At IBM, we have solidified roadmap commitments to extend LSI solutions into 2011 and beyond. In the entry segment, IBM launched the DS3500 series, and in the midrange segment, we are releasing new software extensions and new family members to the DS5000 series.
As you may be aware, IBM recently extended its midrange offering with the announcement of the Storwize V7000. This is a complementary offering that is positioned above the DS5000, which is sourced from LSI.
IBM has always maintained a broad portfolio of storage products to address a wide range of customer needs and customers have chosen LSI solutions in the midrange because of our field-proven reliability, exceptional price performance, and broad availability.
We’ve been driving customer expansion through the development of new OEMs that add application and channel value on top of our systems. This category includes companies such as BlueArc, Quantum, ZTE, Cray, IBM’s cloud and analytics offerings and a number of other OEMs. This category delivered growth this quarter and is expected to grow for the full year.
In an effort to further diversify and grow our business, in Q3 we began shipping a family of unbranded configurable storage system building blocks into the white box distribution channel, which represents a large TAM expansion opportunity.
The reception has been exceptional as we look to ramp our business into this new customer base that has reach into small, medium, government as well as large internet data centers.
I’ll now shift to our server RAID adapter and software business serving the direct-attached storage market, in which we grew over 30% year-over-year. This growth exceeded server unit growth due to OEM share gains at IBM and our expanded presence in the channel through the combination of our MegaRAID and 3ware product families.
DAS technology has clearly had a resurgence driven by data center architectures, larger virtualized server environments, as well as the advent of Flash tiering.
I’ll now turn to storage semiconductors which includes SAS, SAN and HDD. In SAS, we have the broadest portfolio of solutions and continue to extend our leadership position into the Intel Romley generation of servers launching in 2011.
IBM has chosen our next generation SAS ROC and RAID software for their high volume xSeries server product line. Dell and Cisco have already chosen LSI ROC devices and RAID software for their Romley generation servers, and we have made significant progress at another leading server OEM for future SAS products. LSI solutions continue to be chosen over the competition including integrated chipset solutions that are being offered in the SAS space.
To further extend our SAS leadership and add to top line growth, we are also bringing two new products to market, which expand our portfolio beyond silicon and RAID adapters. Our SAS switch and solid state storage adapters have both been launched with wins in Tier 1 OEMs.
Turning to hard disk drives, we are solidly position to grow SoC share as our solutions become increasingly deployed by customers. In the third quarter, we began ramping SoCs in the Seagate Savvio and Constellation enterprise drives.
We expect to expand our footprint to additional enterprise drives at Seagate as we go forward. We are also shipping SoCs into Hitachi’s ULTRASTAR enterprise offering.
Last quarter, we sampled four different 40-nanometer LDPC base solutions to multiple customers across the industry, and have begun ramping with one customer.
In addition to custom solutions, we now have introduced and sampled a fully LSI developed 40-nanometer standard product SoC for notebook and desktop platforms. This SoC integrates LSI’s hard disk controller, LDPC read channel, serial PHY, and firmware.
Finally, we have already started on our 28-nanometer platform to ensure we have a robust roadmap of products available for our customers into the future, which is a proof point of our technology leadership.
Now, I’d like to review the networking business, where we continue to experience strong momentum driven by our major product lines, which are network processors, DSPs, and custom products.
In Q3, our revenues in networking investment areas grew 13% sequentially and 69% year-over-year, a direct result of prior design wins materializing into revenue.
In wireless infrastructure, we are growing through market share gains and benefiting from the global expansion of 3G and 4G networks. We are currently designed into or shipping custom products for wireless base stations at Nokia Siemens, Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei and ZTE.
Network processors also exhibited strong growth year-over-year led by sales into Ericsson’s flagship, RBS base station line. We expect to continue to grow share in network processors as we go forward.
In enterprise networking, we’re growing in Ethernet connectivity, data center and voice and video gateway applications. We are in production with the leading PC and server chipset company for custom gigabit Ethernet devices and have shipped over 10 million units year-to-date. This establishes a beachhead and we expect to expand Ethernet solutions for client and server applications.
For Ethernet connectivity in the data center, we are supplying a custom 10 gigabit Ethernet solution for server applications to Emulex in the product line that was formerly server engines.
DSPs which enable high density voice and high definition video are shipping in Cisco’s new ISR routers. Lastly, LSI have sampled custom silicon for next generation data center switches which will go into production in the second half of 2011.
Before I turn it over to Bryon for financials, I want to stress two key points on LSI’s investment proposition. First, as we look beyond the current year and into 2011 we have a number of new product cycles that can contribute to revenues even if we remain in a challenging economic environment.
In hard disk drives, we have begun ramping enterprise SoCs at Seagate and we’ll expand to additional enterprise platforms as we move through 2011.
In the second half of next year, we also expect to gain share in client platforms at Seagate. In SAS, we expect IBM, Dell and Cisco to ramp Romley generation servers with LSI solutions and expect to see ramps in our new solid state storage adapters.
In networking, we expect greater contribution from base station and enterprise custom products, network processors, and DSPs as we ramp new applications serving the wireless enterprise segments. In systems, we expect to continue to gain share in entry level platforms, while expanding our customer base in the midrange.
Second, this management team is committed to making continued progress towards business model target of 17% non-GAAP operating margins, while also enabling sustained top line growth into the future.
While we can’t control end demand or the ordering patterns of customers, we will continue to drive initiatives aimed at expanding gross margins and controlling operating expenses to drive increased operating leverage.
The long-term fundamentals of our business are solid, our large and growing multi-year design win pipeline continues to move into and towards production, and we continue to deepen our engagements with market leading customers to establish growth drivers for the future.
Now, I’ll turn the call over to Bryon, who will take you through our results and provide guidance.

Semiconductor revenues for Q3 were $390 million, sequentially down 6% from Q2, and up 5% on a year-over-year basis. Our storage semiconductor revenues were sequentially down $30 million or 11% to $242 million.
This decline was primarily driven by weakness in the HDD end market and associated inventory burn of SoCs at our customers, as well as the anticipated inventory adjustments at our fibre channel SAN and SAS customers. Storage semiconductors represented 38% of total revenues in the third quarter.
Q3 revenues in our networking business were $119 million, sequentially down $3 million or 2%, and represented 19% of total revenues for the quarter. Growth in our networking investment areas was offset by declines in legacy products. Revenues for the IP business were up in the third quarter at $29 million.
Turning now to our storage systems business which includes both external storage systems and server RAID adapters and software. Storage systems revenues were sequentially up 7% to $239 million. This represented a 16% improvement in systems revenues as compared to Q3 2009. The storage system segment represented 38% of LSI’s total revenues in the third quarter.
Moving next to gross margins; LSI’s consolidated Q3 gross margin excluding special items was 49.3%, sequentially up 90 basis points from Q2 and approximately 180 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. A key contributor to the non-GAAP gross margin improvement was semiconductor product mix, which included sequentially higher IP revenues.
Semiconductor gross margins, excluding special items sequentially increased approximately 120 basis points from the second quarter to 55.3%. Storage systems’ gross margins for the third quarter, excluding special items sequentially improved 180 basis points to 39.5%.
Moving to operating expenses; R&D together with SG&A expenses excluding special items were sequentially down $4 million to $228 million in Q3, consistent with the midpoint of our guidance.
Non-GAAP operating margin sequentially improved by approximately 90 basis points to 13.1% or $82 million. This was a 400 basis point improvement on a year-over-year basis, further demonstrating the continued progress towards our business model targets.
Interest income and other net of interest expense, excluding special items was a gain of approximately $5 million for Q3.
Now, let me turn to the special items we recorded in the third quarter, which netted to $56 million. Special items, primarily non-cash, included $40 million in amortization of acquisition related items and $17 million of stock-based compensation expense.
Moving next to tax, for Q3, we reported a provision of $8.1 million for both GAAP and non-GAAP, which was consistent with the guidance we provided in July. As a reminder, our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and discreet items.
On a GAAP basis, third quarter net income was $23 million, sequentially improving from $0.01 to $0.04 per share. Net income, excluding special items was $79 million, sequentially improving from $0.11 to $0.13 per share. Share count for the period was 634 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes.
Turning now to cash flows and the balance sheet; operating cash flows in the third quarter were $82 million and were $256 million year-to-date. We exited Q3 with cash and short-term investments balance of $601 million.
During the quarter, we utilized approximately $137 million of cash for share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have repurchased a total of 46 million shares and utilized $218 million under the current share repurchase authorization.
Finally, with respect to Q3 results, depreciation and software amortization was $27 million and capital expenditures were $11 million.
The following is our guidance for Q4, 2010; revenues in the range of $635 million to $665 million. At the midpoint, this is sequentially up 3%. We expect both our networking and storage semiconductor businesses to be flat to slightly down relative to Q3, while we expect our storage systems business to be sequentially up.
Consolidated gross margin excluding special items is expected to be between 47% and 49%. We expect gross margins excluding special items to be approximately 54% for the semiconductor segment and approximately 40% for the systems segment.
Operating expenses excluding special items are expected to be in the range of $223 million to $233 million, which is sequentially flat at midpoint. Interest income and other and interest expense is expected to net to income of approximately $3 million.
Special items are expected to net to approximately $50 million to $70 million. The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $10 million for Q4.
We expect Q4 GAAP net income per share in the range of negative $0.01 to positive $0.08, and EPS excluding special items to be in the range of $0.10 to $0.16 per share. The share count is expected to be approximately 620 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes. In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $27 million, and capital expenditures of approximately $15 million.
Before we go to your questions, I just want to underscore our commitment to drive to business model performance. While the end demand environment has a certain degree of uncertainty, we have a number of new product cycles that will contribute to our top line performance as we go forward.
In addition, we are running above our business model goals on gross margin and expect to maintain tight control on operating expenses to improve our earnings growth.
I would now like to turn the call back to Sujal.

Relative to the fibre channel, silicon inventory that was at our fibre channel adapter customers, we believe the majority of that has been addressed. There may be a little bit that gets cleaned up in the fourth quarter, but the majority has been addressed. Relative to hard disk drives, again that appears to be fairly balanced relative to supply/demand based on a TAM assumption base that has units being flattish from Q3 to Q4.

Hard disk drive TAM is expected to be flat quarter-to-quarter in terms of units. You can factor in a little bit of ASP erosion in there, so that sort of addresses that. From a networking standpoint, if you look at a lot of our peers that are heavily exposed in networking, most of those guys were negative, actually quite a bit negative into the low to mid, even high single-digits.

What’s driving that is a lot of the design wins that we’ve been winning over the last two to three years that are materializing and moving into production. Our network processors are fairly heavily used across a number of the players in the base station category. We also have a number of custom silicon implementations that perform various functions in both base stations as well as RNCs.
So, whether it’s a custom product or standard product, we have some piece of silicon that’s going into I think most of the wireless infrastructure providers, right, and there is five of them that pretty much dominate the entire marketplace. So, that’s been a big part of what’s driving networking and we’re now starting to come into revenue that’s being materialized from design wins that we won several years ago in the enterprise space, whether it’s the custom 5 Ethernet products or whether it’s the 10-gig product that we discussed.

If I look at overall SAS technology base, which is inclusive of SAS controllers, SAS ROC, SAS expanders, as we go through that Romley generation of servers as well as external storage systems that are employing SAS, we absolutely expect to gain share. If I just focus and zero in on SAS ROCs and SAS controllers relative to servers, and within the servers, our expectation is that inflection point will also allow us to gain share from where we’re at that. But we feel we’ve been very confident, I think over the last two, three calls of our competitive position on our next generation of SAS ROCs and controllers as well as the competitive lead that we have.

So, you take that $200 million out of that base in 2008, the business has done well.
Relative to networking and networking legacy and sort of go forward, networking legacy at that point in time in 2008 was $260 million for the full year. It’s roughly $140, $150 million this year, so there is another $100 million. I think that’s one of the biggest challenges that we’ve had as a transforming company is how do you really pull out and show the growth that has been occurring given one or two of these elements that have masked that underlying growth. There is an abundance of proof points that these design wins are materializing and delivering revenue and hence supporting underlying growth.
The networking go forward area which I alluded to growing well in excess of 50% year-over-year for the full year, 70% almost for quarter-over-quarter is just one of a number of examples, right, and as we start to further emerge out of this deep investment cycle and start to see some of the bigger design wins materialize, that will help us drive 2011 growth and certainly 2012 growth.

Clearly, it’s anyone’s guess as to what end markets do, but everyone is sort of triangulating to a flat TAM in the fourth quarter.
As to Q1 and Q1 seasonality, Q1 typical seasonality for LSI is down 8% to 10%. However, that’s off of a typical fourth quarter seasonal budget flush that can drive our revenues 8% to 10% up, and we’re muted in terms of that seasonality in the fourth quarter. So, it’s possible that there could be a muted sort of decline in the first quarter and maybe we’re closer to mid single-digits versus high single-digits in terms of a decline.

In Q2, our revenues were 639 million representing a slight increase from Q1. Also in Q2 and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were at the high end of the guidance range above Q1 levels and above our business model g",1994,"Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome. In Q2, our revenues were 639 million representing a slight increase from Q1. Also in Q2 and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were at the high end of the guidance range above Q1 levels and above our business model goals.
Operating expenses came in below the midpoint of guidance, and we generated operating income expansion. We also have solid cash flows eliminated our debt, and we're active in buying back stock during the quarter. I'm pleased with how our team executed in Q2 delivering non-GAAP EPS at the midpoint of the guidance range even with revenues at the low end of the rand.
Now, I would like to put our near-term revenues in perspective. Our Q2, in Q2 we had solid year-over-year growth across all our businesses and grew faster than the majority of the end markets we participated. Our server-related businesses, which includes SAN, SAS and server blade solutions in aggregate, grew 40% year-over-year well ahead of server unit growth rates for the same period.
Our total networking business grew 23% year-over-year exceeding respective end market growth with investment areas in networking growing in excess of 50% year-over-year. And our systems business grew 13% year-over-year, also exceeding end market growth.
There are three dynamics of our influence in our sequential revenues in Q2 and Q3. First, we outperform some of our markets in our Q1, and are seeing in inventory adjustment from several customers in Q2 and Q3 as a result. Second, in the HDD business we saw a softening in demand late in Q2.
While the softening seems to have stabilized, we have seen a reduction in industry TAM and build plans particularly in desktop which commonly drives a higher portion of LSI's SoC revenues. This soften reach to more modest growth expectations in Q3, lastly we expect to see sequential declines in our non-investment areas in networking this quarter.
To drill down further our semiconductor revenues were up 9% sequentially in Q1 which was considerably higher growth than most of our peers and proxies for the end markets we participate in.
In retrospect, our out performance in Q1 was partly driven by our SAN and SAS customers building inventory ahead of technology transitions. This led to unit shipment reductions in SAS and SAN in Q2 and continued weakness in SAN shipments in Q3 to bring supply in line with end demand for those customers.
While our hard disk drive revenues are primarily from the desktop segment today, our recent SoC wins will expand our OEM base to customers more exposed to the faster growing notebook segment.
We believe these wins are our major step towards achieving our long-term goal of greater than 40% share of the ACD SoC market in the future.
Our Q2 results and Q3 guidance are simply reflections of these dynamics and not any loss of share in any of our businesses. In fact based on our year-over-year performance we have gained share in most of the markets we share.
As we look forward into Q4 based on our current industry projections for the HCD server and storage systems markets combined with near term inventory adjustments we expect to realize high single digit percentage revenue growth in Q4 of this year from Q3 levels.
Going forward the management team is committed to making continued progress towards our business model target of 17% non-GAAP operating margins. While we can't control end demand or the ordering patterns of our customers, we will take action on things we can control to improve operating leverage.
Earlier in the year we said that we would grow non-GAAP expenses at approximately 1 to 2% per quarter. Our goal now is to maintain expense levels below $230 million per quarter in both Q3 and Q4 of this year representing a reduction from Q2 levels.
We continue to expect full year non-GAAP gross margins to above our operating model target of 47% and our targeting non-GAAP operating income expansion for this year.
The long-term fundamentals of our businesses are solid, our design momentum is robust and we continue to deepen our engagements with market leading customers. During the quarter, we secured meaningfully design wins with customers like Dell and Cisco.
We remain confident and in our ability to grow our businesses at a rate exceeding the growth rate in the markets we serve. In addition, we recently completed a litigation settlement and cross-licensing deal with Samsung which we believe increases the certainty and visibility into our near term IP revenues.
Now, I want to review with you the business highlights for the last quarter. I will begin with storage systems which includes both external storage systems and server RAID adapters and software.
Our overall external storage systems business grew slightly ahead of the market from a year-over-year standpoint. We continue to expand our business to a new platform introductions OEM partnerships and design wins.
In this business we are uniquely positioned to respond to often shifting OEMs, partners, internal investments and storage with a range of solutions from turnkey storage systems to high value software controllers and high density drive enclosures. This approach has enabled our systems business to expand its customer base with consistent growth while navigating the constantly changing storage systems landscape, evolving roadmap and investment strategies of our OEMs.
Continuing our successful partnership with IBM, in Q2 we solidified road map commitments to extend LSI solutions into 2011 and beyond. In the entry segment, IBM just launched the DS3500 series to a solid end customer reception. In the midrange segment we are on track to release later this year and early next year several new software extensions and new family members to the popular DS5000 midrange storage family.
Additionally in our mid-range business we saw growth in our 4900 storage system platform, new OEM wins and high performance computing, expanding sales in our 60 drive high-density enclosure as well as solid sequential improvements in our sales to Oracle.
Based on our analysis of IDC's storage systems tracker for the first quarter of 2010 we remain the number one provider of entry-level external storage system shipments through our OEM customers. Entry level remains the fastest growing storage system segment and IBM, Dell and SGI are all now ramping our new volume and performance entry platforms that enable midrange performance at highly competitive price points. Teradata and Cray are also ramping the new platform as part of their integrated solutions for data warehousing and high performance computing.
As we mentioned in the last quarter, a key expansion opportunity for us in entry-level systems is in the white box market segment which is a $1.6 billion a year segment that we are not currently serving. In the second quarter we introduced the CTS2600 as a configurable storage building blocks which not only add to our growth prospects but also enable us to further diversify the business.
Now shifting to our server rated after business, we experienced significant year-over-year growth, well ahead of end market growth rates. Our share gains came from fully ramping across IBM's xSeries servers while firmly maintain our RAID solutions in nine of the top ten server OEMs.
We also gained share in the white box reseller channel through the combination of our MegaRAID and 3ware product families. Last month we announced that Gartner ranked LSI first overall in worldwide host bus RAID controller units for the third year in a row.
I'll now turn to storage semiconductors which include SAS, SAN and HDD. In SAS we have the broadest portfolio of solutions and continue to extend our leadership. Last quarter we mentioned that our next generation SAS Rocks and RAID software have already been chosen by two of the top three x86 server OEMs for their 2011 Intel Romley Generation Servers.
These wins position us well to secure Romley Generation wins at the other to server OEMs. We believe that we have established a significant lead over the competition. In fact a recent press release by one of our competitors confirms that LSI is nearly seven months ahead with our solutions. Based upon the claims and our competitor's press release, LSI will remain the clear performance leader for server solutions.
Regarding the PCIe flash solution we announced earlier this year, we have over 50 samples in evaluation and validation and more than 20 customers. Testing and feedback has been very positive regarding the product's performance and efficiency in comparison to other PCIe flash solutions in the market. We will be ramping production throughout the second half of 2010.
Turning to hard disk drives we are solidly positioned to grow SoC share as our solutions are increasingly deployed by customers. We recently announced the production shipments of the industry's first low-density parity check or LDPC solution.
With Seagate we have enabled the industry's first hard disk drives with LDPC SoCs in 65 nanometer technology. The long-standing relationship between Seagate and LSI has delivered innovative, best in class solutions over many technology generations.
As a further proof point of successful execution in the HDD arena, we have now shipped first silicon for four unique 40 nanometer LDPC SoCs to three different HCD customers. We are pleased that we're executing to our engineering milestones with all the programs we have in development. The HCD industry will be moving towards 40 nanometer and LDPC, and LSI is in a leadership position with this technology.
It is worthwhile to point out that many of our large notebook, many of the large notebook OEMs in the HCD space are currently sole sourced with our competitors. As the industry move towards the dual source model, we expect that our notebook penetrate increases from current levels fueling our growth.
Now I'd like review the networking business where we continue to expand our position with the industry's leading OEMs and the service providers, and enterprise networking infrastructure segments. Our investment areas and networking grew over 50% year-over-year in the second quarter illustrating our continued traction with market leading customers in the product areas that will drive future growth.
The wireless infrastructure segment is in particular focus for LSI where we are in production with all of the top five OEMs and continue to benefit from the demand for 3G and 4G wireless networks. Adding to our progress, the new AXIA communication processor began sampling in Q1, and we announced that one of the top two wireless infrastructure OEMs chose AXIA for their next generation wireless platforms.
In Q2, we secured multiple new AXIA design wins including a win with a leading wireless infrastructure structure OEM for 3G and 4G applications. Our unique ability to blend custom and standard solutions allowed us to secure a design win with ZTE on their base stations.
In addition, our new generation of multi-core media processors was selected for one of the industry's highest volume wireless media gateway platforms. Overall, customer traction and engagement with our enterprise networking products is extremely strong. We have conveyed our design win momentum at Cisco with our DSP products, which have now entered production on multiple platforms.
We continue to expand our design win momentum at Cisco in other areas such as data center switching, routing and security applications that leverage both our custom silicon and unique multi-core product portfolio. We also continue to make meaningful progress with custom solutions in the Ethernet connectivity space.
Our previously announced custom gigabit Ethernet 5 designs have been shipping in volume in client applications at the key customer. In addition, we now have intercepted the 10-Gig E data center transition by ramping a 10-Gigabit Ethernet laying on the motherboard and server blade solution with an emerging leader in this segment that has solid traction with a number of tier-one server OEMs.
We've also won a Next-Generation NG based T custom design for server applications with the same customer. Now I'll turn the call over to Bryon who will take you through our results and provide guidance."

Let me start by summarizing some key bullets highlighting our progress in delivering solid financial results and driving actions design to further expand shareholder value. On a year-over-year basis, revenues improved 23%, and we are well poised to benefit from design wins ramping in the near future.
Non-GAAP gross margins expanded by 630 basis points. We continued to focus on a variety of initiatives to expand margins, which have contributed substantially to this improvement. In addition, we have delivered above business model performance for non-GAAP gross margin for three consecutive quarters.
Non-GAAP operating margin expanded from 2.5% in Q2 of 2009 to 12.1% in this most recent quarter. We have now delivered three consecutive quarters of double-digit non-GAAP operating margin. Shifting to operating expenses, we continue being diligent on spending delivering a non-GAAP operating expenses below the midpoint of our guidance for the second quarter and we expect to maintain this focus as you will see in our guidance.
In terms of cash and the balance sheet, operating cash flows improved by $114 million or nearly tripling in the first half of the year compared to the first of 2009. This performance contributed to a 28% improvement in our net cash balance on a year-over-year basis even after our recent share repurchases.
We have also been active in buying back shares using $81 million to repurchase 14 million shares in the first half of 2010. At our current stock price we continue to view share buybacks as a good use of cash and a way to return value to shareholders.
In addition, during the quarter LSI repaid it's only remaining debt obligation and we are now debt free. Now some highlights from the recent quarter, revenues were $639 million within our guidance range and relatively flat to Q1, 2010.
Consolidated gross margins excluding special items were 48.4% improving sequentially by 70 basis points. Operating expenses, excluding special items were approximately $232 million. Operating margin, excluding special items sequentially improved by 40 basis points to 12.1%, non-GAAP earnings were $0.11 per share which is at the mid-point of our guidance range.
Operating cash flows were $68 million and finally we close the quarter with $670 million in total cash and short-term investments. Now turning to a more detailed discussion on the quarter beginning with revenues, semiconductor revenues for Q2 were $417 million sequentially flat to Q1.
Our storage semiconductor revenues which include hard disk drive silicon, SAS standard components and storage area network ICs were sequentially down $14 million or 5% to $272 million. As noted earlier in the call this decline was primarily driven by inventory builds and customer buying patterns in Q1.
Storage semiconductors presented 43% of total revenues in the second quarter. Q2 revenues in our networking business were $122 million sequentially up $7 million or 6% and represented 19% of total revenues for the quarter.
Revenues for the IP business were up in the second quarter at $23 million. Turning now to our storage systems, business which includes both external storage systems and server RAID adaptors and software.
Storage systems delivered another strong quarter in terms of revenues which were sequentially up 1% to $223 million. In addition, this represented a 26% improvement in systems revenues as compared to Q2, 2009.
The storage systems segment represented 35% of LSI's total revenues in the second quarter. Moving next to gross margins, LSI consolidated Q2 gross margin excluding special items was 48.4% and sequentially up 70 basis points from Q1.
This result included a favorable impact resulting from the termination in the quarter of a supply arrangement which improves consolidated non-GAAP gross margins by approximately 90 basis points.
Semiconductor gross margins excluding special items sequentially increased 200 basis points from the first quarter to 54.0%. Approximately 140 basis points of this improvement was due to the supply arrangement I just noted as it related to our semiconductor business. Storage systems gross margins for the second quarter excluding special items sequentially declined 210 basis points to 37.7%, primarily due to higher period costs and mix.
Moving to operating expenses, R&D together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items totaled $232 million in Q2, approximately $1 million below the midpoint of our guidance, non-GAAP operating margin sequentially improved by 40 basis points to 12.1% or $77 million. Interest income and other net of interest expense, excluding special items was a gain of $3 million for Q2.
Now let me turn to the special items we recorded in the second quarter which netted to $64 million. Special items, primarily non-cash included $40 million in amortization of acquisition related items, $18 million of stock based compensation expense and $5 million of net restructuring costs and other items.
Moving next to tax, for Q2 we recorded a provision of $9 million for both GAAP and non-GAAP which was consistent with the guidance we provided in April. As a reminder our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and discreet items.
On a GAAP basis, second quarter net income was $7 million or $0.01 per share. Net profit excluding special items was $71 million or $0.11 per share. Share count for the period was 662 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows, operating cash flows in the second quarter were $68 million, and were $173 million for the first half of the year. The positive operating cash flow was driven primarily by operating performance, coupled with our continued focus on efficient management of working capital.
During the quarter we repaid the remaining $350 million of outstanding convertible notes and ended the period debt free with a cash and short-term investments balance of $670 million. Our cash position and balance sheet remains strong and we are well positioned to support the business going forward. Finally with respect to Q2 results, depreciation and software amortization was $26 million and capital expenditures were $13 million.
The following is our guidance for Q3 2010; Revenues in the range of 625 to $655 million. At the mid point, this is sequentially flat to Q2. This is primarily driven by a couple of key areas in our semiconductor businesses.
First are the accelerated customer buying patterns and resulting inventory builds we experienced in the first half of the year, primarily in our SAN and SAS businesses which will get worked down in Q3. Second, our expectations for the HDD business are fairly consistent with the trends in that market with our business being currently influenced by a heavier exposure to desktop HDDs.
Given this, we expect storage semiconductors to be sequentially flat to slightly down in Q3. We expect networking semiconductors to be sequentially down, primarily due to declines in legacy product sales. We expect our storage systems business to be sequentially noted.
As Abhi noted, based on current industry projections for the HCD, server and storage systems market combined with near-term inventory adjustments, we expect to realize high single-digit percentage revenue growth in Q4 of this year from our Q3 levels.
Consolidated gross margin excluding special items is expected to be between 46.5 and 48.5% in the third quarter. We expect gross margins excluding special items to be approximately 52% for the semiconductor segment, and approximately 39% for the systems segment.
Operating expenses including special items are expected to be in the range of $223 million to $233 million. At a midpoint of 228 million, this would represent a 1.6% sequential decline in our operating expenses. This reflects our continued efforts to invest while being efficient which contributes towards the progress on business model and operating income expansion.
As noted earlier, our goal for Q4 is to keep non-GAAP operating expenses below 230 million. Interest income and other, and interest expense is expected to net to income of approximately $3 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately 50 to $70 million. The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $8 million for Q3.
We expect Q3 GAAP net income per share in the range of negative $0.03 to positive $0.06 and EPS excluding special items to be in the range of $0.08 to $0.14 per share. The share count is expected to be approximately 655 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP shares.
In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $26 million and capital expenditures of approximately $15 million. Let me close by saying, we're well positioned with our customers and the markets we serve. And our focus for 2010 remains consistent.
Continued progress towards business model drive cash generation and maintain a solid balance sheet, and drive continued design win momentum for future growth. And now let me turn the call back to Abhi."

So that sort of self-correction or correction started in the midst of the quarter and I think started before sort of inventory concerns were created. It is how I would characterize it, right on the margin. That's I think how that played out relative to our SAN and SAS, our Q1 was pretty strong in terms of performance. We were up 9% quarter-to-quarter and we're typically down 8 to 12%, and the majority of that our performance there was certainly some underlying strong seasonal sort of growth, but a lot of that our performance was buildup of inventory around the 4-Gig, 8-Gig, transition and fiber channel and then another comp on it was the 6-Gig SAS relative to a customer.
And we started seeing that start to correct itself in the second quarter as well as we moved into the later month of the second quarter. And we are seeing some of that continue to bleed off in the third quarter."

Keep in mind five years ago, we were generating $250 million a year actually close to 250 to $300 million a year in enterprise hard disk controller business. When the hard disk controller was discrete and not an SoC, and we lost that business because we didn't have a re-channel capability and at that point in time, the strategy of the company was not necessarily on being a number one or two player in our disk drive space. Since then we've come tremendous ways relative to rebuilding that entire business, rebuilding it to a point where we're incredibly competitive.
We are leading the market from the technology transition standpoint. We won the first round of 65-nanometer sort of SoCs going head-to-head. Those were just now starting to ramp as they are typically two and a half to three year development cycles. We were ahead by 69 months on the 40-nanometer LDPC sort of transition as well. That not only lead to wins at Seagate and Hitachi, but allowed us to penetrate the other three hard disk drive OEMs that we have not penetrated. Our share levels were at about 20 to 22% from an SoC standpoint. We absolutely expect us to grow next year, and continue growing year after that with certainly long-term objective of 40%. It's down to just two players in the SoC space, and we've got better or equal technology. I would argue better technology and that's going to do it well for the market that wants a dual supplier strategy, so it's straightforward."

I mean when sitting in my seat you think about the cash requirements for the company, you got certain working capital requirements. You also want to think about what state of the economic environment is really like, and so yes we have much more modest requirements cash-to-date and we have historically when we were a fabs company. We had much for manufacturing related spend relative to the sort of cash position that we have is noted in our performance for this year and for the as you go in back last year. Very strong operating cash flows, the first half of this year, we generated a 173 million of positive operating cash flows and that gives much more flexibility in terms of deployment of that cash even as time when we have not also retired all of our debt.
Relative to Q2, we have repay the $350 million of all the remaining convertible notes and on top of that bought back shares, we spent about $55 million in the quarter to buy back shares which we continue to believe to be a good use of cash and given the strong position that we have in terms of cash flow generation I think we have the ability to continue to do things like that going forward.
Its first time I think also and as long as I can remember where the company has had no debt and we still have $670 million of cash which actually grew; we had net cash I should say built during the quarter."

You can't paint every single company with the same brush relative to our end markets and the proxies there are server units, external storage systems, TAM, HDD. But keep in mind right now we have a heavier exposure to desktop HDDs although that's going to change overtime as in the SoCs ramp and then wireless sort of infrastructure. We're growing at for significantly above markets across most of those categories and that's because of the design wins over the last several year have been kicking in, and that will only continue to improve and help us accelerate our growth.
Most of the legacy sort of head wins, that we led to content with the last three years are behind us, and our balance sheet is as strong as ever been with completely rebuilt and strong product lines.

Operating expenses came in below the midpoint of guidance, and we generated operating income expansion. We also have solid cash flows eliminated our debt, and we're active in buying back stock during the quarter. I'm pleased with how our team executed in Q2 delivering non-GAAP EPS at the midpoint of the guidance range even with revenues at the low end of the rand.
Now, I would like to put our near-term revenues in perspective. Our Q2, in Q2 we had solid year-over-year growth across all our businesses and grew faster than the majority of the end markets we participated. Our server-related businesses, which includes SAN, SAS and server blade solutions in aggregate, grew 40% year-over-year well ahead of server unit growth rates for the same period.
Our total networking business grew 23% year-over-year exceeding respective end market growth with investment areas in networking growing in excess of 50% year-over-year. And our systems business grew 13% year-over-year, also exceeding end market growth.
There are three dynamics of our influence in our sequential revenues in Q2 and Q3. First, we outperform some of our markets in our Q1, and are seeing in inventory adjustment from several customers in Q2 and Q3 as a result. Second, in the HDD business we saw a softening in demand late in Q2.
While the softening seems to have stabilized, we have seen a reduction in industry TAM and build plans particularly in desktop which commonly drives a higher portion of LSI's SoC revenues. This soften reach to more modest growth expectations in Q3, lastly we expect to see sequential declines in our non-investment areas in networking this quarter.
To drill down further our semiconductor revenues were up 9% sequentially in Q1 which was considerably higher growth than most of our peers and proxies for the end markets we participate in.
In retrospect, our out performance in Q1 was partly driven by our SAN and SAS customers building inventory ahead of technology transitions. This led to unit shipment reductions in SAS and SAN in Q2 and continued weakness in SAN shipments in Q3 to bring supply in line with end demand for those customers.
While our hard disk drive revenues are primarily from the desktop segment today, our recent SoC wins will expand our OEM base to customers more exposed to the faster growing notebook segment.
We believe these wins are our major step towards achieving our long-term goal of greater than 40% share of the ACD SoC market in the future.
Our Q2 results and Q3 guidance are simply reflections of these dynamics and not any loss of share in any of our businesses. In fact based on our year-over-year performance we have gained share in most of the markets we share.
As we look forward into Q4 based on our current industry projections for the HCD server and storage systems markets combined with near term inventory adjustments we expect to realize high single digit percentage revenue growth in Q4 of this year from Q3 levels.
Going forward the management team is committed to making continued progress towards our business model target of 17% non-GAAP operating margins. While we can't control end demand or the ordering patterns of our customers, we will take action on things we can control to improve operating leverage.
Earlier in the year we said that we would grow non-GAAP expenses at approximately 1 to 2% per quarter. Our goal now is to maintain expense levels below $230 million per quarter in both Q3 and Q4 of this year representing a reduction from Q2 levels.
We continue to expect full year non-GAAP gross margins to above our operating model target of 47% and our targeting non-GAAP operating income expansion for this year.
The long-term fundamentals of our businesses are solid, our design momentum is robust and we continue to deepen our engagements with market leading customers. During the quarter, we secured meaningfully design wins with customers like Dell and Cisco.
We remain confident and in our ability to grow our businesses at a rate exceeding the growth rate in the markets we serve. In addition, we recently completed a litigation settlement and cross-licensing deal with Samsung which we believe increases the certainty and visibility into our near term IP revenues.
Now, I want to review with you the business highlights for the last quarter. I will begin with storage systems which includes both external storage systems and server RAID adapters and software.
Our overall external storage systems business grew slightly ahead of the market from a year-over-year standpoint. We continue to expand our business to a new platform introductions OEM partnerships and design wins.
In this business we are uniquely positioned to respond to often shifting OEMs, partners, internal investments and storage with a range of solutions from turnkey storage systems to high value software controllers and high density drive enclosures. This approach has enabled our systems business to expand its customer base with consistent growth while navigating the constantly changing storage systems landscape, evolving roadmap and investment strategies of our OEMs.
Continuing our successful partnership with IBM, in Q2 we solidified road map commitments to extend LSI solutions into 2011 and beyond. In the entry segment, IBM just launched the DS3500 series to a solid end customer reception. In the midrange segment we are on track to release later this year and early next year several new software extensions and new family members to the popular DS5000 midrange storage family.
Additionally in our mid-range business we saw growth in our 4900 storage system platform, new OEM wins and high performance computing, expanding sales in our 60 drive high-density enclosure as well as solid sequential improvements in our sales to Oracle.
Based on our analysis of IDC's storage systems tracker for the first quarter of 2010 we remain the number one provider of entry-level external storage system shipments through our OEM customers. Entry level remains the fastest growing storage system segment and IBM, Dell and SGI are all now ramping our new volume and performance entry platforms that enable midrange performance at highly competitive price points. Teradata and Cray are also ramping the new platform as part of their integrated solutions for data warehousing and high performance computing.
As we mentioned in the last quarter, a key expansion opportunity for us in entry-level systems is in the white box market segment which is a $1.6 billion a year segment that we are not currently serving. In the second quarter we introduced the CTS2600 as a configurable storage building blocks which not only add to our growth prospects but also enable us to further diversify the business.
Now shifting to our server rated after business, we experienced significant year-over-year growth, well ahead of end market growth rates. Our share gains came from fully ramping across IBM's xSeries servers while firmly maintain our RAID solutions in nine of the top ten server OEMs.
We also gained share in the white box reseller channel through the combination of our MegaRAID and 3ware product families. Last month we announced that Gartner ranked LSI first overall in worldwide host bus RAID controller units for the third year in a row.
I'll now turn to storage semiconductors which include SAS, SAN and HDD. In SAS we have the broadest portfolio of solutions and continue to extend our leadership. Last quarter we mentioned that our next generation SAS Rocks and RAID software have already been chosen by two of the top three x86 server OEMs for their 2011 Intel Romley Generation Servers.
These wins position us well to secure Romley Generation wins at the other to server OEMs. We believe that we have established a significant lead over the competition. In fact a recent press release by one of our competitors confirms that LSI is nearly seven months ahead with our solutions. Based upon the claims and our competitor's press release, LSI will remain the clear performance leader for server solutions.
Regarding the PCIe flash solution we announced earlier this year, we have over 50 samples in evaluation and validation and more than 20 customers. Testing and feedback has been very positive regarding the product's performance and efficiency in comparison to other PCIe flash solutions in the market. We will be ramping production throughout the second half of 2010.
Turning to hard disk drives we are solidly positioned to grow SoC share as our solutions are increasingly deployed by customers. We recently announced the production shipments of the industry's first low-density parity check or LDPC solution.
With Seagate we have enabled the industry's first hard disk drives with LDPC SoCs in 65 nanometer technology. The long-standing relationship between Seagate and LSI has delivered innovative, best in class solutions over many technology generations.
As a further proof point of successful execution in the HDD arena, we have now shipped first silicon for four unique 40 nanometer LDPC SoCs to three different HCD customers. We are pleased that we're executing to our engineering milestones with all the programs we have in development. The HCD industry will be moving towards 40 nanometer and LDPC, and LSI is in a leadership position with this technology.
It is worthwhile to point out that many of our large notebook, many of the large notebook OEMs in the HCD space are currently sole sourced with our competitors. As the industry move towards the dual source model, we expect that our notebook penetrate increases from current levels fueling our growth.
Now I'd like review the networking business where we continue to expand our position with the industry's leading OEMs and the service providers, and enterprise networking infrastructure segments. Our investment areas and networking grew over 50% year-over-year in the second quarter illustrating our continued traction with market leading customers in the product areas that will drive future growth.
The wireless infrastructure segment is in particular focus for LSI where we are in production with all of the top five OEMs and continue to benefit from the demand for 3G and 4G wireless networks. Adding to our progress, the new AXIA communication processor began sampling in Q1, and we announced that one of the top two wireless infrastructure OEMs chose AXIA for their next generation wireless platforms.
In Q2, we secured multiple new AXIA design wins including a win with a leading wireless infrastructure structure OEM for 3G and 4G applications. Our unique ability to blend custom and standard solutions allowed us to secure a design win with ZTE on their base stations.
In addition, our new generation of multi-core media processors was selected for one of the industry's highest volume wireless media gateway platforms. Overall, customer traction and engagement with our enterprise networking products is extremely strong. We have conveyed our design win momentum at Cisco with our DSP products, which have now entered production on multiple platforms.
We continue to expand our design win momentum at Cisco in other areas such as data center switching, routing and security applications that leverage both our custom silicon and unique multi-core product portfolio. We also continue to make meaningful progress with custom solutions in the Ethernet connectivity space.
Our previously announced custom gigabit Ethernet 5 designs have been shipping in volume in client applications at the key customer. In addition, we now have intercepted the 10-Gig E data center transition by ramping a 10-Gigabit Ethernet laying on the motherboard and server blade solution with an emerging leader in this segment that has solid traction with a number of tier-one server OEMs.
We've also won a Next-Generation NG based T custom design for server applications with the same customer. Now I'll turn the call over to Bryon who will take you through our results and provide guidance."

Let me start by summarizing some key bullets highlighting our progress in delivering solid financial results and driving actions design to further expand shareholder value. On a year-over-year basis, revenues improved 23%, and we are well poised to benefit from design wins ramping in the near future.
Non-GAAP gross margins expanded by 630 basis points. We continued to focus on a variety of initiatives to expand margins, which have contributed substantially to this improvement. In addition, we have delivered above business model performance for non-GAAP gross margin for three consecutive quarters.
Non-GAAP operating margin expanded from 2.5% in Q2 of 2009 to 12.1% in this most recent quarter. We have now delivered three consecutive quarters of double-digit non-GAAP operating margin. Shifting to operating expenses, we continue being diligent on spending delivering a non-GAAP operating expenses below the midpoint of our guidance for the second quarter and we expect to maintain this focus as you will see in our guidance.
In terms of cash and the balance sheet, operating cash flows improved by $114 million or nearly tripling in the first half of the year compared to the first of 2009. This performance contributed to a 28% improvement in our net cash balance on a year-over-year basis even after our recent share repurchases.
We have also been active in buying back shares using $81 million to repurchase 14 million shares in the first half of 2010. At our current stock price we continue to view share buybacks as a good use of cash and a way to return value to shareholders.
In addition, during the quarter LSI repaid it's only remaining debt obligation and we are now debt free. Now some highlights from the recent quarter, revenues were $639 million within our guidance range and relatively flat to Q1, 2010.
Consolidated gross margins excluding special items were 48.4% improving sequentially by 70 basis points. Operating expenses, excluding special items were approximately $232 million. Operating margin, excluding special items sequentially improved by 40 basis points to 12.1%, non-GAAP earnings were $0.11 per share which is at the mid-point of our guidance range.
Operating cash flows were $68 million and finally we close the quarter with $670 million in total cash and short-term investments. Now turning to a more detailed discussion on the quarter beginning with revenues, semiconductor revenues for Q2 were $417 million sequentially flat to Q1.
Our storage semiconductor revenues which include hard disk drive silicon, SAS standard components and storage area network ICs were sequentially down $14 million or 5% to $272 million. As noted earlier in the call this decline was primarily driven by inventory builds and customer buying patterns in Q1.
Storage semiconductors presented 43% of total revenues in the second quarter. Q2 revenues in our networking business were $122 million sequentially up $7 million or 6% and represented 19% of total revenues for the quarter.
Revenues for the IP business were up in the second quarter at $23 million. Turning now to our storage systems, business which includes both external storage systems and server RAID adaptors and software.
Storage systems delivered another strong quarter in terms of revenues which were sequentially up 1% to $223 million. In addition, this represented a 26% improvement in systems revenues as compared to Q2, 2009.
The storage systems segment represented 35% of LSI's total revenues in the second quarter. Moving next to gross margins, LSI consolidated Q2 gross margin excluding special items was 48.4% and sequentially up 70 basis points from Q1.
This result included a favorable impact resulting from the termination in the quarter of a supply arrangement which improves consolidated non-GAAP gross margins by approximately 90 basis points.
Semiconductor gross margins excluding special items sequentially increased 200 basis points from the first quarter to 54.0%. Approximately 140 basis points of this improvement was due to the supply arrangement I just noted as it related to our semiconductor business. Storage systems gross margins for the second quarter excluding special items sequentially declined 210 basis points to 37.7%, primarily due to higher period costs and mix.
Moving to operating expenses, R&D together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items totaled $232 million in Q2, approximately $1 million below the midpoint of our guidance, non-GAAP operating margin sequentially improved by 40 basis points to 12.1% or $77 million. Interest income and other net of interest expense, excluding special items was a gain of $3 million for Q2.
Now let me turn to the special items we recorded in the second quarter which netted to $64 million. Special items, primarily non-cash included $40 million in amortization of acquisition related items, $18 million of stock based compensation expense and $5 million of net restructuring costs and other items.
Moving next to tax, for Q2 we recorded a provision of $9 million for both GAAP and non-GAAP which was consistent with the guidance we provided in April. As a reminder our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and discreet items.
On a GAAP basis, second quarter net income was $7 million or $0.01 per share. Net profit excluding special items was $71 million or $0.11 per share. Share count for the period was 662 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows, operating cash flows in the second quarter were $68 million, and were $173 million for the first half of the year. The positive operating cash flow was driven primarily by operating performance, coupled with our continued focus on efficient management of working capital.
During the quarter we repaid the remaining $350 million of outstanding convertible notes and ended the period debt free with a cash and short-term investments balance of $670 million. Our cash position and balance sheet remains strong and we are well positioned to support the business going forward. Finally with respect to Q2 results, depreciation and software amortization was $26 million and capital expenditures were $13 million.
The following is our guidance for Q3 2010; Revenues in the range of 625 to $655 million. At the mid point, this is sequentially flat to Q2. This is primarily driven by a couple of key areas in our semiconductor businesses.
First are the accelerated customer buying patterns and resulting inventory builds we experienced in the first half of the year, primarily in our SAN and SAS businesses which will get worked down in Q3. Second, our expectations for the HDD business are fairly consistent with the trends in that market with our business being currently influenced by a heavier exposure to desktop HDDs.
Given this, we expect storage semiconductors to be sequentially flat to slightly down in Q3. We expect networking semiconductors to be sequentially down, primarily due to declines in legacy product sales. We expect our storage systems business to be sequentially noted.
As Abhi noted, based on current industry projections for the HCD, server and storage systems market combined with near-term inventory adjustments, we expect to realize high single-digit percentage revenue growth in Q4 of this year from our Q3 levels.
Consolidated gross margin excluding special items is expected to be between 46.5 and 48.5% in the third quarter. We expect gross margins excluding special items to be approximately 52% for the semiconductor segment, and approximately 39% for the systems segment.
Operating expenses including special items are expected to be in the range of $223 million to $233 million. At a midpoint of 228 million, this would represent a 1.6% sequential decline in our operating expenses. This reflects our continued efforts to invest while being efficient which contributes towards the progress on business model and operating income expansion.
As noted earlier, our goal for Q4 is to keep non-GAAP operating expenses below 230 million. Interest income and other, and interest expense is expected to net to income of approximately $3 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately 50 to $70 million. The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $8 million for Q3.
We expect Q3 GAAP net income per share in the range of negative $0.03 to positive $0.06 and EPS excluding special items to be in the range of $0.08 to $0.14 per share. The share count is expected to be approximately 655 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP shares.
In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $26 million and capital expenditures of approximately $15 million. Let me close by saying, we're well positioned with our customers and the markets we serve. And our focus for 2010 remains consistent.
Continued progress towards business model drive cash generation and maintain a solid balance sheet, and drive continued design win momentum for future growth. And now let me turn the call back to Abhi."

But we did see as we said a deceleration let's say of orders in the HDD space starting in the latter part of Q2 as HDD customers recognized that the overall HDD TAM was going to be different for the rest of the year than originally projected, right. So that sort of self-correction or correction started in the midst of the quarter and I think started before sort of inventory concerns were created. It is how I would characterize it, right on the margin. That's I think how that played out relative to our SAN and SAS, our Q1 was pretty strong in terms of performance. We were up 9% quarter-to-quarter and we're typically down 8 to 12%, and the majority of that our performance there was certainly some underlying strong seasonal sort of growth, but a lot of that our performance was buildup of inventory around the 4-Gig, 8-Gig, transition and fiber channel and then another comp on it was the 6-Gig SAS relative to a customer.
And we started seeing that start to correct itself in the second quarter as well as we moved into the later month of the second quarter. And we are seeing some of that continue to bleed off in the third quarter."

Keep in mind five years ago, we were generating $250 million a year actually close to 250 to $300 million a year in enterprise hard disk controller business. When the hard disk controller was discrete and not an SoC, and we lost that business because we didn't have a re-channel capability and at that point in time, the strategy of the company was not necessarily on being a number one or two player in our disk drive space. Since then we've come tremendous ways relative to rebuilding that entire business, rebuilding it to a point where we're incredibly competitive.
We are leading the market from the technology transition standpoint. We won the first round of 65-nanometer sort of SoCs going head-to-head. Those were just now starting to ramp as they are typically two and a half to three year development cycles. We were ahead by 69 months on the 40-nanometer LDPC sort of transition as well. That not only lead to wins at Seagate and Hitachi, but allowed us to penetrate the other three hard disk drive OEMs that we have not penetrated. Our share levels were at about 20 to 22% from an SoC standpoint. We absolutely expect us to grow next year, and continue growing year after that with certainly long-term objective of 40%. It's down to just two players in the SoC space, and we've got better or equal technology. I would argue better technology and that's going to do it well for the market that wants a dual supplier strategy, so it's straightforward."

We had much for manufacturing related spend relative to the sort of cash position that we have is noted in our performance for this year and for the as you go in back last year. Very strong operating cash flows, the first half of this year, we generated a 173 million of positive operating cash flows and that gives much more flexibility in terms of deployment of that cash even as time when we have not also retired all of our debt.
Relative to Q2, we have repay the $350 million of all the remaining convertible notes and on top of that bought back shares, we spent about $55 million in the quarter to buy back shares which we continue to believe to be a good use of cash and given the strong position that we have in terms of cash flow generation I think we have the ability to continue to do things like that going forward.

You can't paint every single company with the same brush relative to our end markets and the proxies there are server units, external storage systems, TAM, HDD. But keep in mind right now we have a heavier exposure to desktop HDDs although that's going to change overtime as in the SoCs ramp and then wireless sort of infrastructure. We're growing at for significantly above markets across most of those categories and that's because of the design wins over the last several year have been kicking in, and that will only continue to improve and help us accelerate our growth.
Most of the legacy sort of head wins, that we led to content with the last three years are behind us, and our balance sheet is as strong as ever been with completely rebuilt and strong product lines.

In Q2, our revenues were 639 million representing a slight increase from Q1. Also in Q2 and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were at the high end of the guidance range above Q1 levels and above our business model g",1994,"Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome. In Q2, our revenues were 639 million representing a slight increase from Q1. Also in Q2 and on a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were at the high end of the guidance range above Q1 levels and above our business model goals.
Operating expenses came in below the midpoint of guidance, and we generated operating income expansion. We also have solid cash flows eliminated our debt, and we're active in buying back stock during the quarter. I'm pleased with how our team executed in Q2 delivering non-GAAP EPS at the midpoint of the guidance range even with revenues at the low end of the rand.
Now, I would like to put our near-term revenues in perspective. Our Q2, in Q2 we had solid year-over-year growth across all our businesses and grew faster than the majority of the end markets we participated. Our server-related businesses, which includes SAN, SAS and server blade solutions in aggregate, grew 40% year-over-year well ahead of server unit growth rates for the same period.
Our total networking business grew 23% year-over-year exceeding respective end market growth with investment areas in networking growing in excess of 50% year-over-year. And our systems business grew 13% year-over-year, also exceeding end market growth.
There are three dynamics of our influence in our sequential revenues in Q2 and Q3. First, we outperform some of our markets in our Q1, and are seeing in inventory adjustment from several customers in Q2 and Q3 as a result. Second, in the HDD business we saw a softening in demand late in Q2.
While the softening seems to have stabilized, we have seen a reduction in industry TAM and build plans particularly in desktop which commonly drives a higher portion of LSI's SoC revenues. This soften reach to more modest growth expectations in Q3, lastly we expect to see sequential declines in our non-investment areas in networking this quarter.
To drill down further our semiconductor revenues were up 9% sequentially in Q1 which was considerably higher growth than most of our peers and proxies for the end markets we participate in.
In retrospect, our out performance in Q1 was partly driven by our SAN and SAS customers building inventory ahead of technology transitions. This led to unit shipment reductions in SAS and SAN in Q2 and continued weakness in SAN shipments in Q3 to bring supply in line with end demand for those customers.
While our hard disk drive revenues are primarily from the desktop segment today, our recent SoC wins will expand our OEM base to customers more exposed to the faster growing notebook segment.
We believe these wins are our major step towards achieving our long-term goal of greater than 40% share of the ACD SoC market in the future.
Our Q2 results and Q3 guidance are simply reflections of these dynamics and not any loss of share in any of our businesses. In fact based on our year-over-year performance we have gained share in most of the markets we share.
As we look forward into Q4 based on our current industry projections for the HCD server and storage systems markets combined with near term inventory adjustments we expect to realize high single digit percentage revenue growth in Q4 of this year from Q3 levels.
Going forward the management team is committed to making continued progress towards our business model target of 17% non-GAAP operating margins. While we can't control end demand or the ordering patterns of our customers, we will take action on things we can control to improve operating leverage.
Earlier in the year we said that we would grow non-GAAP expenses at approximately 1 to 2% per quarter. Our goal now is to maintain expense levels below $230 million per quarter in both Q3 and Q4 of this year representing a reduction from Q2 levels.
We continue to expect full year non-GAAP gross margins to above our operating model target of 47% and our targeting non-GAAP operating income expansion for this year.
The long-term fundamentals of our businesses are solid, our design momentum is robust and we continue to deepen our engagements with market leading customers. During the quarter, we secured meaningfully design wins with customers like Dell and Cisco.
We remain confident and in our ability to grow our businesses at a rate exceeding the growth rate in the markets we serve. In addition, we recently completed a litigation settlement and cross-licensing deal with Samsung which we believe increases the certainty and visibility into our near term IP revenues.
Now, I want to review with you the business highlights for the last quarter. I will begin with storage systems which includes both external storage systems and server RAID adapters and software.
Our overall external storage systems business grew slightly ahead of the market from a year-over-year standpoint. We continue to expand our business to a new platform introductions OEM partnerships and design wins.
In this business we are uniquely positioned to respond to often shifting OEMs, partners, internal investments and storage with a range of solutions from turnkey storage systems to high value software controllers and high density drive enclosures. This approach has enabled our systems business to expand its customer base with consistent growth while navigating the constantly changing storage systems landscape, evolving roadmap and investment strategies of our OEMs.
Continuing our successful partnership with IBM, in Q2 we solidified road map commitments to extend LSI solutions into 2011 and beyond. In the entry segment, IBM just launched the DS3500 series to a solid end customer reception. In the midrange segment we are on track to release later this year and early next year several new software extensions and new family members to the popular DS5000 midrange storage family.
Additionally in our mid-range business we saw growth in our 4900 storage system platform, new OEM wins and high performance computing, expanding sales in our 60 drive high-density enclosure as well as solid sequential improvements in our sales to Oracle.
Based on our analysis of IDC's storage systems tracker for the first quarter of 2010 we remain the number one provider of entry-level external storage system shipments through our OEM customers. Entry level remains the fastest growing storage system segment and IBM, Dell and SGI are all now ramping our new volume and performance entry platforms that enable midrange performance at highly competitive price points. Teradata and Cray are also ramping the new platform as part of their integrated solutions for data warehousing and high performance computing.
As we mentioned in the last quarter, a key expansion opportunity for us in entry-level systems is in the white box market segment which is a $1.6 billion a year segment that we are not currently serving. In the second quarter we introduced the CTS2600 as a configurable storage building blocks which not only add to our growth prospects but also enable us to further diversify the business.
Now shifting to our server rated after business, we experienced significant year-over-year growth, well ahead of end market growth rates. Our share gains came from fully ramping across IBM's xSeries servers while firmly maintain our RAID solutions in nine of the top ten server OEMs.
We also gained share in the white box reseller channel through the combination of our MegaRAID and 3ware product families. Last month we announced that Gartner ranked LSI first overall in worldwide host bus RAID controller units for the third year in a row.
I'll now turn to storage semiconductors which include SAS, SAN and HDD. In SAS we have the broadest portfolio of solutions and continue to extend our leadership. Last quarter we mentioned that our next generation SAS Rocks and RAID software have already been chosen by two of the top three x86 server OEMs for their 2011 Intel Romley Generation Servers.
These wins position us well to secure Romley Generation wins at the other to server OEMs. We believe that we have established a significant lead over the competition. In fact a recent press release by one of our competitors confirms that LSI is nearly seven months ahead with our solutions. Based upon the claims and our competitor's press release, LSI will remain the clear performance leader for server solutions.
Regarding the PCIe flash solution we announced earlier this year, we have over 50 samples in evaluation and validation and more than 20 customers. Testing and feedback has been very positive regarding the product's performance and efficiency in comparison to other PCIe flash solutions in the market. We will be ramping production throughout the second half of 2010.
Turning to hard disk drives we are solidly positioned to grow SoC share as our solutions are increasingly deployed by customers. We recently announced the production shipments of the industry's first low-density parity check or LDPC solution.
With Seagate we have enabled the industry's first hard disk drives with LDPC SoCs in 65 nanometer technology. The long-standing relationship between Seagate and LSI has delivered innovative, best in class solutions over many technology generations.
As a further proof point of successful execution in the HDD arena, we have now shipped first silicon for four unique 40 nanometer LDPC SoCs to three different HCD customers. We are pleased that we're executing to our engineering milestones with all the programs we have in development. The HCD industry will be moving towards 40 nanometer and LDPC, and LSI is in a leadership position with this technology.
It is worthwhile to point out that many of our large notebook, many of the large notebook OEMs in the HCD space are currently sole sourced with our competitors. As the industry move towards the dual source model, we expect that our notebook penetrate increases from current levels fueling our growth.
Now I'd like review the networking business where we continue to expand our position with the industry's leading OEMs and the service providers, and enterprise networking infrastructure segments. Our investment areas and networking grew over 50% year-over-year in the second quarter illustrating our continued traction with market leading customers in the product areas that will drive future growth.
The wireless infrastructure segment is in particular focus for LSI where we are in production with all of the top five OEMs and continue to benefit from the demand for 3G and 4G wireless networks. Adding to our progress, the new AXIA communication processor began sampling in Q1, and we announced that one of the top two wireless infrastructure OEMs chose AXIA for their next generation wireless platforms.
In Q2, we secured multiple new AXIA design wins including a win with a leading wireless infrastructure structure OEM for 3G and 4G applications. Our unique ability to blend custom and standard solutions allowed us to secure a design win with ZTE on their base stations.
In addition, our new generation of multi-core media processors was selected for one of the industry's highest volume wireless media gateway platforms. Overall, customer traction and engagement with our enterprise networking products is extremely strong. We have conveyed our design win momentum at Cisco with our DSP products, which have now entered production on multiple platforms.
We continue to expand our design win momentum at Cisco in other areas such as data center switching, routing and security applications that leverage both our custom silicon and unique multi-core product portfolio. We also continue to make meaningful progress with custom solutions in the Ethernet connectivity space.
Our previously announced custom gigabit Ethernet 5 designs have been shipping in volume in client applications at the key customer. In addition, we now have intercepted the 10-Gig E data center transition by ramping a 10-Gigabit Ethernet laying on the motherboard and server blade solution with an emerging leader in this segment that has solid traction with a number of tier-one server OEMs.
We've also won a Next-Generation NG based T custom design for server applications with the same customer. Now I'll turn the call over to Bryon who will take you through our results and provide guidance."

Let me start by summarizing some key bullets highlighting our progress in delivering solid financial results and driving actions design to further expand shareholder value. On a year-over-year basis, revenues improved 23%, and we are well poised to benefit from design wins ramping in the near future.
Non-GAAP gross margins expanded by 630 basis points. We continued to focus on a variety of initiatives to expand margins, which have contributed substantially to this improvement. In addition, we have delivered above business model performance for non-GAAP gross margin for three consecutive quarters.
Non-GAAP operating margin expanded from 2.5% in Q2 of 2009 to 12.1% in this most recent quarter. We have now delivered three consecutive quarters of double-digit non-GAAP operating margin. Shifting to operating expenses, we continue being diligent on spending delivering a non-GAAP operating expenses below the midpoint of our guidance for the second quarter and we expect to maintain this focus as you will see in our guidance.
In terms of cash and the balance sheet, operating cash flows improved by $114 million or nearly tripling in the first half of the year compared to the first of 2009. This performance contributed to a 28% improvement in our net cash balance on a year-over-year basis even after our recent share repurchases.
We have also been active in buying back shares using $81 million to repurchase 14 million shares in the first half of 2010. At our current stock price we continue to view share buybacks as a good use of cash and a way to return value to shareholders.
In addition, during the quarter LSI repaid it's only remaining debt obligation and we are now debt free. Now some highlights from the recent quarter, revenues were $639 million within our guidance range and relatively flat to Q1, 2010.
Consolidated gross margins excluding special items were 48.4% improving sequentially by 70 basis points. Operating expenses, excluding special items were approximately $232 million. Operating margin, excluding special items sequentially improved by 40 basis points to 12.1%, non-GAAP earnings were $0.11 per share which is at the mid-point of our guidance range.
Operating cash flows were $68 million and finally we close the quarter with $670 million in total cash and short-term investments. Now turning to a more detailed discussion on the quarter beginning with revenues, semiconductor revenues for Q2 were $417 million sequentially flat to Q1.
Our storage semiconductor revenues which include hard disk drive silicon, SAS standard components and storage area network ICs were sequentially down $14 million or 5% to $272 million. As noted earlier in the call this decline was primarily driven by inventory builds and customer buying patterns in Q1.
Storage semiconductors presented 43% of total revenues in the second quarter. Q2 revenues in our networking business were $122 million sequentially up $7 million or 6% and represented 19% of total revenues for the quarter.
Revenues for the IP business were up in the second quarter at $23 million. Turning now to our storage systems, business which includes both external storage systems and server RAID adaptors and software.
Storage systems delivered another strong quarter in terms of revenues which were sequentially up 1% to $223 million. In addition, this represented a 26% improvement in systems revenues as compared to Q2, 2009.
The storage systems segment represented 35% of LSI's total revenues in the second quarter. Moving next to gross margins, LSI consolidated Q2 gross margin excluding special items was 48.4% and sequentially up 70 basis points from Q1.
This result included a favorable impact resulting from the termination in the quarter of a supply arrangement which improves consolidated non-GAAP gross margins by approximately 90 basis points.
Semiconductor gross margins excluding special items sequentially increased 200 basis points from the first quarter to 54.0%. Approximately 140 basis points of this improvement was due to the supply arrangement I just noted as it related to our semiconductor business. Storage systems gross margins for the second quarter excluding special items sequentially declined 210 basis points to 37.7%, primarily due to higher period costs and mix.
Moving to operating expenses, R&D together with SG&A expenses, excluding special items totaled $232 million in Q2, approximately $1 million below the midpoint of our guidance, non-GAAP operating margin sequentially improved by 40 basis points to 12.1% or $77 million. Interest income and other net of interest expense, excluding special items was a gain of $3 million for Q2.
Now let me turn to the special items we recorded in the second quarter which netted to $64 million. Special items, primarily non-cash included $40 million in amortization of acquisition related items, $18 million of stock based compensation expense and $5 million of net restructuring costs and other items.
Moving next to tax, for Q2 we recorded a provision of $9 million for both GAAP and non-GAAP which was consistent with the guidance we provided in April. As a reminder our tax provision on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and discreet items.
On a GAAP basis, second quarter net income was $7 million or $0.01 per share. Net profit excluding special items was $71 million or $0.11 per share. Share count for the period was 662 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP purposes.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows, operating cash flows in the second quarter were $68 million, and were $173 million for the first half of the year. The positive operating cash flow was driven primarily by operating performance, coupled with our continued focus on efficient management of working capital.
During the quarter we repaid the remaining $350 million of outstanding convertible notes and ended the period debt free with a cash and short-term investments balance of $670 million. Our cash position and balance sheet remains strong and we are well positioned to support the business going forward. Finally with respect to Q2 results, depreciation and software amortization was $26 million and capital expenditures were $13 million.
The following is our guidance for Q3 2010; Revenues in the range of 625 to $655 million. At the mid point, this is sequentially flat to Q2. This is primarily driven by a couple of key areas in our semiconductor businesses.
First are the accelerated customer buying patterns and resulting inventory builds we experienced in the first half of the year, primarily in our SAN and SAS businesses which will get worked down in Q3. Second, our expectations for the HDD business are fairly consistent with the trends in that market with our business being currently influenced by a heavier exposure to desktop HDDs.
Given this, we expect storage semiconductors to be sequentially flat to slightly down in Q3. We expect networking semiconductors to be sequentially down, primarily due to declines in legacy product sales. We expect our storage systems business to be sequentially noted.
As Abhi noted, based on current industry projections for the HCD, server and storage systems market combined with near-term inventory adjustments, we expect to realize high single-digit percentage revenue growth in Q4 of this year from our Q3 levels.
Consolidated gross margin excluding special items is expected to be between 46.5 and 48.5% in the third quarter. We expect gross margins excluding special items to be approximately 52% for the semiconductor segment, and approximately 39% for the systems segment.
Operating expenses including special items are expected to be in the range of $223 million to $233 million. At a midpoint of 228 million, this would represent a 1.6% sequential decline in our operating expenses. This reflects our continued efforts to invest while being efficient which contributes towards the progress on business model and operating income expansion.
As noted earlier, our goal for Q4 is to keep non-GAAP operating expenses below 230 million. Interest income and other, and interest expense is expected to net to income of approximately $3 million. Special items are expected to net to approximately 50 to $70 million. The GAAP and non-GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately $8 million for Q3.
We expect Q3 GAAP net income per share in the range of negative $0.03 to positive $0.06 and EPS excluding special items to be in the range of $0.08 to $0.14 per share. The share count is expected to be approximately 655 million shares for both GAAP and non-GAAP shares.
In addition, we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately $26 million and capital expenditures of approximately $15 million. Let me close by saying, we're well positioned with our customers and the markets we serve. And our focus for 2010 remains consistent.
Continued progress towards business model drive cash generation and maintain a solid balance sheet, and drive continued design win momentum for future growth. And now let me turn the call back to Abhi."

The North America continues to do very well relative to storage systems as well as servers; North America has been really a large part of the driver this year relative to those categories, Asia as well.
We as of several weeks ago had not started to see any material softening relative to storage systems in Europe and certainly have not up until this call and have not seen that but we are going into the summer season in Europe so we will probably see some typical behavior there as we have historically seen and I think that's all I can probably offer relative to end market color from a geographic standpoint and certainly I haven't not seen any material slowing relative to Asia in the segments that we participate which are largely enterprise oriented and to your second question Kaushik was around linearity?"

But we did see as we said a deceleration let's say of orders in the HDD space starting in the latter part of Q2 as HDD customers recognized that the overall HDD TAM was going to be different for the rest of the year than originally projected, right. So that sort of self-correction or correction started in the midst of the quarter and I think started before sort of inventory concerns were created. It is how I would characterize it, right on the margin. That's I think how that played out relative to our SAN and SAS, our Q1 was pretty strong in terms of performance. We were up 9% quarter-to-quarter and we're typically down 8 to 12%, and the majority of that our performance there was certainly some underlying strong seasonal sort of growth, but a lot of that our performance was buildup of inventory around the 4-Gig, 8-Gig, transition and fiber channel and then another comp on it was the 6-Gig SAS relative to a customer.
And we started seeing that start to correct itself in the second quarter as well as we moved into the later month of the second quarter. And we are seeing some of that continue to bleed off in the third quarter."

Keep in mind five years ago, we were generating $250 million a year actually close to 250 to $300 million a year in enterprise hard disk controller business. When the hard disk controller was discrete and not an SoC, and we lost that business because we didn't have a re-channel capability and at that point in time, the strategy of the company was not necessarily on being a number one or two player in our disk drive space. Since then we've come tremendous ways relative to rebuilding that entire business, rebuilding it to a point where we're incredibly competitive.
We are leading the market from the technology transition standpoint. We won the first round of 65-nanometer sort of SoCs going head-to-head. Those were just now starting to ramp as they are typically two and a half to three year development cycles. We were ahead by 69 months on the 40-nanometer LDPC sort of transition as well. That not only lead to wins at Seagate and Hitachi, but allowed us to penetrate the other three hard disk drive OEMs that we have not penetrated. Our share levels were at about 20 to 22% from an SoC standpoint. We absolutely expect us to grow next year, and continue growing year after that with certainly long-term objective of 40%. It's down to just two players in the SoC space, and we've got better or equal technology. I would argue better technology and that's going to do it well for the market that wants a dual supplier strategy, so it's straightforward."

I mean when sitting in my seat you think about the cash requirements for the company, you got certain working capital requirements.

We had much for manufacturing related spend relative to the sort of cash position that we have is noted in our performance for this year and for the as you go in back last year. Very strong operating cash flows, the first half of this year, we generated a 173 million of positive operating cash flows and that gives much more flexibility in terms of deployment of that cash even as time when we have not also retired all of our debt.
Relative to Q2, we have repay the $350 million of all the remaining convertible notes and on top of that bought back shares, we spent about $55 million in the quarter to buy back shares which we continue to believe to be a good use of cash and given the strong position that we have in terms of cash flow generation I think we have the ability to continue to do things like that going forward.

Abhi, at the end of '09 beginning of '10 you were pretty confident that the future for the company looked the best since you joined it, and that was kind of based on significant design win momentum, momentum that was unprecedented over the last two years. And you were going to begin to see that in the second half of 2010, and in given the legacy drops, the networking are much less than what you anticipated yet we're not seeing any meaningful growth at least in your Q3 guidance.
In particular there, and then you also highlighted that you would expect some of the enterprise SoC ramps to begin with Seagate and Hitachi. And I haven't heard a lot of about that. So, I guess I was just wondering how you would characterize your outlook of the company now because of the comments before, we are kind of shaped around not been impacted as much by the macro as if yes you are."

I think the company is in solid shape relative to growth. I mean don't let our Q3 guidance confused the situation, focus on the overall year-to-date sort of growth relative to the same period or even year-to-year forecast and in particular focus on the end markets that we participate in.
You can't paint every single company with the same brush relative to our end markets and the proxies there are server units, external storage systems, TAM, HDD. But keep in mind right now we have a heavier exposure to desktop HDDs although that's going to change overtime as in the SoCs ramp and then wireless sort of infrastructure. We're growing at for significantly above markets across most of those categories and that's because of the design wins over the last several year have been kicking in, and that will only continue to improve and help us accelerate our growth.
Most of the legacy sort of head wins, that we led to content with the last three years are behind us, and our balance sheet is as strong as ever been with completely rebuilt and strong product lines. If I look at the first half of 2010 in terms of operating margin performance, it's the best first half we've had in the last probably nine years as well, and so I think we're doing certainly well and I would encourage people to look beyond the Q3 [ protivation ] which is really around inventory adjustments around two or three customers, and focus on our performance relative to end markets, and that's what I do, and that's why I continue to have very high confidence in terms of where the company is at or is headed."
