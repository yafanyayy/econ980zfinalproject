Thanks for joining me in our First Quarter Fiscal 2010 Conference Call. Today, we are reporting 6% growth in revenues, solid gains in our gross and operating margins and a 13% increase in earnings per diluted share from continuing operations. Net orders for the company would've grown 1% excluding the reversal of a $62 million Proton Therapy order, including this reversal net orders fell 10%. Net orders increased in both our Oncology Systems and X-ray Products businesses on the strength of their international markets. Despite the Proton reversal, our total company backlog grew 4%. Given these results, we have elected to raise our guidance for the fiscal year. But before getting to guidance, I'll focus on market and operational activity during the quarter and let Elisha give you some color on the numbers.Oncology Systems' first quarter net orders grew by 2% to $437 million, which was nice to see after a decline in the fourth quarter. Net orders rose 19% in international markets with double-digit gains in Asia and Europe, while orders fell 13% in North America with declines for both hospitals and freestanding clinics. We start by focusing on the international markets, which accounted for more than 55% of the Oncology orders during the period. Both Asia and Europe had strong growth helped somewhat by a weaker dollar. Asia's growth was led by the trio of Japan, China and India. In Japan, we benefited from a government stimulus package to enhance cancer treatment capabilities. In China and India, demand was strong for high-performance machines, and we saw a greater interest in our units for more affordable care as well. The star in Europe was Germany, where orders more than tripled with activity in private as well as public centers. In all of these markets, we're seeing healthcare systems expanding their radiotherapy and radiosurgery infrastructure to better serve their growing cancer patient populations. In North America, we are seeing early signs of renewed interest among freestanding clinics. However, hospitals are still constrained by tightened annual capital spending budgets established last year in response to the recession and concerns about healthcare reform. As hospital balance sheets improve, we hope to see a higher capital spending budgets and a resumption of more normal purchasing patterns. In all of the markets, the interest in our products and technology remains very high. Continued demand for our RapidArc product also contributed to Oncology's growth. And as of the end of the quarter, we had installed more than 340 systems. RapidArc is far and away to clear market standard for fast image-guided IMRT. In the quarter, we saw a richer mix of orders for high-energy Trilogy and Novalis Tx machines capable of delivering stereotactic radiosurgery and traditional radiotherapy centers. We expect that radiosurgery is on its way to becoming a standard offering in radiation oncology facilities. We also received our second order, this one from India, for our new cost competitive UNIQUE accelerator for image-guided RapidArc treatments, and we are obtaining clearances to sell this machine in more international markets. Customer interest is strong and we expect this to be a very successful product. BrachyTherapy product orders increased with the help of new, much faster treatment planning software, which uses an out rhythm that we are now incorporating into our Eclipse software for planning radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments. Despite very tough comps from the year-ago quarter, our Service business expanded nicely and it now represents a $500-million business annually. We are focused on achieving a higher contract capture rate among our install base with accelerators. And as a new data point, per UR [ph] install base now stands at more than 5,800 units with another 500 non-varying units within our service arena. These installations are split evenly between the North American and international markets.Let me take a moment to address our position relative to competitors. Looking backward over the fiscal year, we believe that both Elekta and Varian gained share at the expense of other competitors. At the end of the day, though, this isn't about beating competitors, it's about beating cancer with better and better products to deliver fast and affordable life-saving treatments, that's our focus.Turning to our X-Ray Products businesses, we passed a major milestone during the quarter as orders for our digital imaging detectors exceeded two borders for the first time and helped to grow X-ray's total net orders for the quarter by 9% to $99 million. This product mix shift was a prime contributor to improve margins for this business during the quarter.Moving to digital image detectors has resulted in the continued expansion of the X-ray business and has helped the insulators from a harsh market environment that is hurting imaging equipment manufacturers, particularly in North America. We talked in the past about being uniquely equipped to offer customers special packages, paring tubes and detectors, that are optimized for digital X-ray imaging. We landed another significant deal like this during the quarter, a $7 million order from an equipment manufacturer in China. It was among more than $15 million in detector orders from several new customers in Asia and Europe that contributed to the gains made by this business during the quarter. From a geographic perspective, the X-ray Products order gross stand exclusively from international markets, especially Asia. As I indicated a moment ago, North America has been tough for everybody, including us. Orders in this region were down particularly from Mammography Tubes and detectors for dental and veterinary imaging systems. Our focus now is on segments and customers that are doing well in this market, and we believe we can continue to benefit from equipment manufacturers' ongoing rollout, a film with X-ray imaging systems which speed the imaging process and lower the cost per procedure. In our Other business category, including our SIP, Security and Inspection Products business, our Particle Therapy business and our Ginzton Technology Center, combined net orders for the quarter declined $73 million to a negative $40 million, primarily because of the reversal of a $62 million proton order for Skandionkliniken in Sweden. We also had a $10 million decline in orders for our SIP business which had an unusually strong first quarter in the last year. As most of you know, from our earlier 8-K filings during the quarter, Skandionkliniken canceled its proton order, following a successful core challenge to its public tender process. We are prepared to respond to a new public tender with hopes of being selected again for this project. We have great confidence in the suitability of our Particle Therapy and pencil beam scanning technology for this and other proton center projects around the world. As an example, we reached a major milestone with this technology in December when we successfully commissioned the second treatment gantry at the RPTC [Rinecker Proton Therapy Center] proton center in Munich. More than 80 patients have been treated at the clinic to date and more patients are currently undergoing treatment. The clinical implementation of a second gantry is enabling RPTC to double its treatment capacity. We are excited about the growth prospects for this business and we are in active discussions with several groups who are planning to open Proton Therapy centers in various sites around the world. We're continuing to gain for two or more proton orders per year. The slightest flow for this quarter, our SIP business, continues to have a healthy pipeline and good opportunities for growth. Our biggest challenge in this business is dealing with its lumpiness, as governments around the world move to deploy this technology and fit some starts. It is clear, however, that there is a concerted and ongoing effort to improve security of ports and borders, and we're confident that our technology will play a key role in this endeavor.We are concentrating on providing security customers with superior value in terms of smaller, lighter components and systems that deliver higher image quality, as well as faster imaging and analysis for automatic detection. For example, the materials discrimination technology that we developed is now included in about 80% of the products we sell, for cargo and for the security. We expect that this development work will enable Varian to deploy security products in a broader array of fixed and mobile systems, as well as applications including screening air cargo.Now I'll turn it over to Elisha for a review of the numbers, and then I'll come back to you with our outlook for the second quarter and for the full fiscal 2010."

As usual, I will walk you through the income statement, as well as cover a few balance sheet items. First quarter revenues of $541 million increased 6%. Oncology Systems posted an increase of 8%, X-ray Products posted a gain of 6% and revenues from businesses under the Other category decreased by $5 million or 20%. In constant currency, total company revenues increased 3% from the year-ago quarter as a result of a weaker dollar. The first quarter gross margin for the company rose 1.5 points to 44.6%. Strong gains in Oncology Systems and X-Ray Products gross margins were partially offset by sharp declines among businesses and the Other category. Oncology Systems gross margin increased nearly three points to 46.5%, due primarily to cost control initiatives that improved margins across our product lines and a higher mix of software and service revenue. X-Ray Products gross margin rose one point to 41.2%, due to the higher mix of digital detectors. First quarter SG&A expenses were $84 million or 15% of revenue, a one point improvement from the year-ago quarter as a result of tight cost controls. First quarter R&D expenses were $38 million or 7% of revenue, nearly even with the year-ago quarter as a percentage of revenue.Moving down the income statement, first quarter operating earnings rose 21% to $119 million or 22% of revenue, up about 2.5 points. Depreciation and amortization totaled $12 million for the quarter. Net interest expense for the quarter was $300,000. The effective tax rate was 33.7% for the quarter, up more than three points from the year-ago quarter when we benefited from discrete items including a reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. For fiscal year 2010, we continue to estimate the tax rate will be 31% to 32%. Fully diluted shares outstanding were approximately $125 million at the end of the quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 13% to $0.63. Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $625 million, that's a $37 million and stockholders equity of $1.4 billion. DSO or days sales outstanding for the quarter was 84 days, up one day from the year-ago quarter and up three days from the prior fourth quarter. First quarter cash flow from operations was $131 million, with most of it coming from net earnings and strong AR [Accounts Receivable] collections. Primary uses of cash were $55 million to repurchase $1.3 million shares of stock under our repurchase program and $8 million for capital expenditures.Now, I'll turn it back over to Tim for the outlook."

To summarize our thoughts on the quarter and the rest of the year, we're cautiously optimistic. We're seeing strength in the international markets, and we hope to see renewed purchasing activity in North America as new budgets are put in place. Our strategic plans are sound and we're executing well. We remain confident that we can achieve long-term growth in all of our businesses. Thank you, and we're now ready for your questions."

People were operating on budgets that have been established in the previous year. So we expected that we would have some difficulty there. We are seeing renewed signs of interest in the freestanding clinics, and we're hopeful that, that will turn into more and more business for us as the year goes on. In hospitals, they're still operating off a budget they set last year. We need to see those budgets gradually weighted in the new budgets. They're going to do that as they look at their balance sheets, and their balance sheets are looking a lot better now than they were looking when they made these budgets a year ago. So I'm hoping that as I look at those balance sheets and as they get pressure from clinicians and their operations to upgrade their equipment and to adopt more modern equipment to replace aging equipment that they will start to budget more. We didn't see that in the first quarter, we didn't expect to see it in the first quarter, but we're hoping that we will see it more and more as the year goes on. And to remind you, we still have an aging base. That aging got a lot worse during the year because there wasn't as much buying, and so I think the pressure to replace that aging equipment may be as high now as it will ever be. And I'll also add that there was concern during the year about what healthcare reform would be, and I think those concerns are probably not as great now as they might have been for hospitals. And although that situation is probably not over and certainly could come up again, I think that hospitals prepared in 2009 for whatever might be coming in 2010 and that preparation is now built in to their budgets. And I think that, as I say, the balance sheets are stronger, and I think their behavior will be more normal next year than what we saw in 2009."

Again, we had significant currency help in the first quarter. We averaged about 1.48% on the euro and in the first quarter, today, we're sitting at about 1.40%.

So by introducing new products and new technologies and having a number of superior offerings, overall, I think we've been able to do okay. And that's why you see the gross margins to be as strong as they are. I think that our strategy for prevailing in these kinds of situations has been working out for us.

And we compete -- there's a hybrid part and then there is a special machine part. In other words, we're people who want to have a machine that can only do radiosurgery, and that's a much smaller portion of the market. The hybrid piece is much, much larger and that's the piece where we compete. And I think we're doing very well there, as I recall, we had a very large number of Trilogy and Novalis business this quarter so we're doing well. We know, we ultimately believe that every radiation therapy department is kind of want to have the ability to do radiosurgery, and are going to want to buy the technology that it takes to do that. And it may not be more than one machine, but we think that everybody's going to want to be able to ultimately do this as a part of what they do. That being said, there is a market for people who make machines that are specific only to radiosurgery. Our machines obviously can do radiosurgery very fast and very successfully for people who want to have that. And so our machine can be used as a special machine, but by its very nature, it's a machine that can do both special and general radiation therapy which gives it an advantage in a lot of those situations. In terms of the overall market size, I'm not sure that I've sized it recently, but obviously, I think if you had all the players together, it's probably $500 million piece of the market. But the difficulty is that when you just look at the hybrid market since those machines are being bought for general radiation therapy as well as specific, I'm not sure how you would separate those two markets from each other and it's probably inappropriate to do so.

I have to say, the goal of the New York Times is to remind us that outcomes depend upon safety, and that we should all be scrupolous about safety and that's the message we clearly support.

We think -- I will tell you that we put safety first, you can't get good outcomes without having good safety. We put safety first and we always have, and we offer extensive training in our Varian facility. In Las Vegas, we go out and do seminars in the world on to use our products right and we bring in  world-class experts to do that. And so we're going to always continue to put patient safety first. In terms of what added regulation we might see, it's hard to say, I think that all of us are interested at the society, the ASTRO, the ACR, the ACRO, ASRT and the AMPO are all very interested in seeing safety be a high priority for them. And I expect that the first thing we're going to see is that those organizations work with their membership and work with manufacturers to ask what can be done. I think, they were already heavily regulated. Anybody who thinks that the FDA isn't incredibly scrupulous has never been visited by the FDA because they are tough and they are very scrupulous in terms of their behavior. So hopefully, the lesson learned in all of this is that all of us will work together, and the societies and industry to create a better climate for patient safety."

So far, our customers are calling me and telling me they still like our offering and they still think it's a superior offering which is good to hear.I will also say that we're a moving target. We're going to introduce new versions of RapidArc and those new versions of RapidArc offer new features. So we're not sitting still, we're not resting on our laurels, we're going to come out with new stuff that I think moves the bar ever higher. So we have an edge there, that edge has helped us in gross margin. I think that edge has helped us be competitive and we'll continue to move forward and stay as far ahead in this race as we can."

Thanks for joining me in our First Quarter Fiscal 2010 Conference Call. Today, we are reporting 6% growth in revenues, solid gains in our gross and operating margins and a 13% increase in earnings per diluted share from continuing operations. Net orders for the company would've grown 1% excluding the reversal of a $62 million Proton Therapy order, including this reversal net orders fell 10%. Net orders increased in both our Oncology Systems and X-ray Products businesses on the strength of their international markets. Despite the Proton reversal, our total company backlog grew 4%. Given these results, we have elected to raise our guidance for the fiscal year. But before getting to guidance, I'll focus on market and operational activity during the quarter and let Elisha give you some color on the numbers.Oncology Systems' first quarter net orders grew by 2% to $437 million, which was nice to see after a decline in the fourth quarter. Net orders rose 19% in international markets with double-digit gains in Asia and Europe, while orders fell 13% in North America with declines for both hospitals and freestanding clinics. We start by focusing on the international markets, which accounted for more than 55% of the Oncology orders during the period. Both Asia and Europe had strong growth helped somewhat by a weaker dollar. Asia's growth was led by the trio of Japan, China and India. In Japan, we benefited from a government stimulus package to enhance cancer treatment capabilities. In China and India, demand was strong for high-performance machines, and we saw a greater interest in our units for more affordable care as well. The star in Europe was Germany, where orders more than tripled with activity in private as well as public centers. In all of these markets, we're seeing healthcare systems expanding their radiotherapy and radiosurgery infrastructure to better serve their growing cancer patient populations. In North America, we are seeing early signs of renewed interest among freestanding clinics. However, hospitals are still constrained by tightened annual capital spending budgets established last year in response to the recession and concerns about healthcare reform. As hospital balance sheets improve, we hope to see a higher capital spending budgets and a resumption of more normal purchasing patterns. In all of the markets, the interest in our products and technology remains very high. Continued demand for our RapidArc product also contributed to Oncology's growth. And as of the end of the quarter, we had installed more than 340 systems. RapidArc is far and away to clear market standard for fast image-guided IMRT. In the quarter, we saw a richer mix of orders for high-energy Trilogy and Novalis Tx machines capable of delivering stereotactic radiosurgery and traditional radiotherapy centers. We expect that radiosurgery is on its way to becoming a standard offering in radiation oncology facilities. We also received our second order, this one from India, for our new cost competitive UNIQUE accelerator for image-guided RapidArc treatments, and we are obtaining clearances to sell this machine in more international markets. Customer interest is strong and we expect this to be a very successful product. BrachyTherapy product orders increased with the help of new, much faster treatment planning software, which uses an out rhythm that we are now incorporating into our Eclipse software for planning radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments. Despite very tough comps from the year-ago quarter, our Service business expanded nicely and it now represents a $500-million business annually. We are focused on achieving a higher contract capture rate among our install base with accelerators. And as a new data point, per UR [ph] install base now stands at more than 5,800 units with another 500 non-varying units within our service arena. These installations are split evenly between the North American and international markets.Let me take a moment to address our position relative to competitors. Looking backward over the fiscal year, we believe that both Elekta and Varian gained share at the expense of other competitors. At the end of the day, though, this isn't about beating competitors, it's about beating cancer with better and better products to deliver fast and affordable life-saving treatments, that's our focus.Turning to our X-Ray Products businesses, we passed a major milestone during the quarter as orders for our digital imaging detectors exceeded two borders for the first time and helped to grow X-ray's total net orders for the quarter by 9% to $99 million. This product mix shift was a prime contributor to improve margins for this business during the quarter.Moving to digital image detectors has resulted in the continued expansion of the X-ray business and has helped the insulators from a harsh market environment that is hurting imaging equipment manufacturers, particularly in North America. We talked in the past about being uniquely equipped to offer customers special packages, paring tubes and detectors, that are optimized for digital X-ray imaging. We landed another significant deal like this during the quarter, a $7 million order from an equipment manufacturer in China. It was among more than $15 million in detector orders from several new customers in Asia and Europe that contributed to the gains made by this business during the quarter. From a geographic perspective, the X-ray Products order gross stand exclusively from international markets, especially Asia. As I indicated a moment ago, North America has been tough for everybody, including us. Orders in this region were down particularly from Mammography Tubes and detectors for dental and veterinary imaging systems. Our focus now is on segments and customers that are doing well in this market, and we believe we can continue to benefit from equipment manufacturers' ongoing rollout, a film with X-ray imaging systems which speed the imaging process and lower the cost per procedure. In our Other business category, including our SIP, Security and Inspection Products business, our Particle Therapy business and our Ginzton Technology Center, combined net orders for the quarter declined $73 million to a negative $40 million, primarily because of the reversal of a $62 million proton order for Skandionkliniken in Sweden. We also had a $10 million decline in orders for our SIP business which had an unusually strong first quarter in the last year. As most of you know, from our earlier 8-K filings during the quarter, Skandionkliniken canceled its proton order, following a successful core challenge to its public tender process. We are prepared to respond to a new public tender with hopes of being selected again for this project. We have great confidence in the suitability of our Particle Therapy and pencil beam scanning technology for this and other proton center projects around the world. As an example, we reached a major milestone with this technology in December when we successfully commissioned the second treatment gantry at the RPTC [Rinecker Proton Therapy Center] proton center in Munich. More than 80 patients have been treated at the clinic to date and more patients are currently undergoing treatment. The clinical implementation of a second gantry is enabling RPTC to double its treatment capacity. We are excited about the growth prospects for this business and we are in active discussions with several groups who are planning to open Proton Therapy centers in various sites around the world. We're continuing to gain for two or more proton orders per year. The slightest flow for this quarter, our SIP business, continues to have a healthy pipeline and good opportunities for growth. Our biggest challenge in this business is dealing with its lumpiness, as governments around the world move to deploy this technology and fit some starts. It is clear, however, that there is a concerted and ongoing effort to improve security of ports and borders, and we're confident that our technology will play a key role in this endeavor.We are concentrating on providing security customers with superior value in terms of smaller, lighter components and systems that deliver higher image quality, as well as faster imaging and analysis for automatic detection. For example, the materials discrimination technology that we developed is now included in about 80% of the products we sell, for cargo and for the security. We expect that this development work will enable Varian to deploy security products in a broader array of fixed and mobile systems, as well as applications including screening air cargo.Now I'll turn it over to Elisha for a review of the numbers, and then I'll come back to you with our outlook for the second quarter and for the full fiscal 2010."

As usual, I will walk you through the income statement, as well as cover a few balance sheet items. First quarter revenues of $541 million increased 6%. Oncology Systems posted an increase of 8%, X-ray Products posted a gain of 6% and revenues from businesses under the Other category decreased by $5 million or 20%. In constant currency, total company revenues increased 3% from the year-ago quarter as a result of a weaker dollar. The first quarter gross margin for the company rose 1.5 points to 44.6%. Strong gains in Oncology Systems and X-Ray Products gross margins were partially offset by sharp declines among businesses and the Other category. Oncology Systems gross margin increased nearly three points to 46.5%, due primarily to cost control initiatives that improved margins across our product lines and a higher mix of software and service revenue. X-Ray Products gross margin rose one point to 41.2%, due to the higher mix of digital detectors. First quarter SG&A expenses were $84 million or 15% of revenue, a one point improvement from the year-ago quarter as a result of tight cost controls. First quarter R&D expenses were $38 million or 7% of revenue, nearly even with the year-ago quarter as a percentage of revenue.Moving down the income statement, first quarter operating earnings rose 21% to $119 million or 22% of revenue, up about 2.5 points. Depreciation and amortization totaled $12 million for the quarter. Net interest expense for the quarter was $300,000. The effective tax rate was 33.7% for the quarter, up more than three points from the year-ago quarter when we benefited from discrete items including a reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. For fiscal year 2010, we continue to estimate the tax rate will be 31% to 32%. Fully diluted shares outstanding were approximately $125 million at the end of the quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 13% to $0.63. Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $625 million, that's a $37 million and stockholders equity of $1.4 billion. DSO or days sales outstanding for the quarter was 84 days, up one day from the year-ago quarter and up three days from the prior fourth quarter. First quarter cash flow from operations was $131 million, with most of it coming from net earnings and strong AR [Accounts Receivable] collections. Primary uses of cash were $55 million to repurchase $1.3 million shares of stock under our repurchase program and $8 million for capital expenditures.Now, I'll turn it back over to Tim for the outlook."

People were operating on budgets that have been established in the previous year. So we expected that we would have some difficulty there. We are seeing renewed signs of interest in the freestanding clinics, and we're hopeful that, that will turn into more and more business for us as the year goes on. In hospitals, they're still operating off a budget they set last year. We need to see those budgets gradually weighted in the new budgets. They're going to do that as they look at their balance sheets, and their balance sheets are looking a lot better now than they were looking when they made these budgets a year ago. So I'm hoping that as I look at those balance sheets and as they get pressure from clinicians and their operations to upgrade their equipment and to adopt more modern equipment to replace aging equipment that they will start to budget more. We didn't see that in the first quarter, we didn't expect to see it in the first quarter, but we're hoping that we will see it more and more as the year goes on. And to remind you, we still have an aging base. That aging got a lot worse during the year because there wasn't as much buying, and so I think the pressure to replace that aging equipment may be as high now as it will ever be. And I'll also add that there was concern during the year about what healthcare reform would be, and I think those concerns are probably not as great now as they might have been for hospitals. And although that situation is probably not over and certainly could come up again, I think that hospitals prepared in 2009 for whatever might be coming in 2010 and that preparation is now built in to their budgets. And I think that, as I say, the balance sheets are stronger, and I think their behavior will be more normal next year than what we saw in 2009."

I mean, if you were to strip out the proton order in Q4 backlog, it's up 7% quarter-over-quarter, which is very much in line with the revenue guidance for the year. Orders that we currently are getting have less impact on fiscal year '10 and more impact on fiscal year '11. So as we start to accelerate throughout fiscal year '10, as Tim talked about, that would be reflected in next year's guidance more than this year, just given the fact that the average time in backlog is 12 to 18 months. Again, we had significant currency help in the first quarter. We averaged about 1.48% on the euro and in the first quarter, today, we're sitting at about 1.40%. So, obviously, we tempered our expectations on the dollar a little bit and reflect it in the guidance as well."

And I think we're doing very well there, as I recall, we had a very large number of Trilogy and Novalis business this quarter so we're doing well. We know, we ultimately believe that every radiation therapy department is kind of want to have the ability to do radiosurgery, and are going to want to buy the technology that it takes to do that. And it may not be more than one machine, but we think that everybody's going to want to be able to ultimately do this as a part of what they do. That being said, there is a market for people who make machines that are specific only to radiosurgery. Our machines obviously can do radiosurgery very fast and very successfully for people who want to have that. And so our machine can be used as a special machine, but by its very nature, it's a machine that can do both special and general radiation therapy which gives it an advantage in a lot of those situations. In terms of the overall market size, I'm not sure that I've sized it recently, but obviously, I think if you had all the players together, it's probably $500 million piece of the market. But the difficulty is that when you just look at the hybrid market since those machines are being bought for general radiation therapy as well as specific, I'm not sure how you would separate those two markets from each other and it's probably inappropriate to do so.

I have to say, the goal of the New York Times is to remind us that outcomes depend upon safety, and that we should all be scrupolous about safety and that's the message we clearly support.

In terms of what added regulation we might see, it's hard to say, I think that all of us are interested at the society, the ASTRO, the ACR, the ACRO, ASRT and the AMPO are all very interested in seeing safety be a high priority for them. And I expect that the first thing we're going to see is that those organizations work with their membership and work with manufacturers to ask what can be done. I think, they were already heavily regulated. Anybody who thinks that the FDA isn't incredibly scrupulous has never been visited by the FDA because they are tough and they are very scrupulous in terms of their behavior. So hopefully, the lesson learned in all of this is that all of us will work together, and the societies and industry to create a better climate for patient safety."

So I know it's very unpopular to be proud of federal agencies, but I think you should be proud of the FDA in terms of the way they behaved in the Medical Device business, certainly in the area of radiation therapy. So from my perspective I think they treated us fairly."

A lot was happened since we talked about first quarter results, and I am pleased to say that we had a very good second quarter. To quickly summarize results, we reported 6% growth in revenues and 11% gain in operating earnings,",1315,"Good afternoon and welcome. A lot was happened since we talked about first quarter results, and I am pleased to say that we had a very good second quarter. To quickly summarize results, we reported 6% growth in revenues and 11% gain in operating earnings, and a 14% increase in earnings per share from continuing operations. I am especially pleased to report that net orders for the company grew 13% on the strength of the international business. Our quarter ending backlog grew 6%. 
I’ll now focus on operational highlights. Oncology system of the second quarter net orders grew by 10% to $476 million, with a 34% increase in international markets, and the 12% decline in North America. International markets accounted for 58% of oncology orders during the quarter, and these markets have now comprised the majority of oncology orders for four consecutive quarters.
Net orders arose by about 70% in Asia, driven primarily by Japan, where we benefited from a government stimulus package. Net orders arose by 15% in Europe and order activity in Australia drove very strong growth than the rest of the world. 
North American orders declined as a result of smaller hospital capital equipment budgets that were established in response to uncertainty related to healthcare reform and recession. For the domestic market to recover, we will need to see more hospitals move into new more normal budget cycles. Our outlook for the North American Market remains cautious. We hope to have a more optimistic view about this market in coming quarters. 
Oncology solid net orders growth was also driven by our service business, as well as demand for our new accelerators. We saw increased demand for unique or new accelerator for fast affordable image guided treatments in international clinics and encouraging early interest in our new True Beam platform for advanced image guided radiotherapy and radiosurgery.
Many of you participated in our official unveiling of the True Beam in New York two weeks ago. It was a highly successful event, and I am pleased to report that customer interest in this new platform is tremendous. During the quarter we booked revenue on two True Beam systems and recorded more than 15 orders for these systems, including some backlog conversions.
We believe True Beam will be a real game changer in the fight against cancer, and we expect it to stimulate stronger demand for our surgical products, as well as fast replacement of older systems in our installed base, which now stands at more than 5,900 Varian machines.
We believe that this is quite simply the most advanced radiotherapy, radiosurgery system in the world. Designed from the ground up, it offers an un-precedent combination of speed, precision, imaging capability, versatility and ease of use. It is a clinical tool that leading centers can use to develop new protocols, which expand the application and effectiveness of non-invasive radiotherapy and radiosurgery in the fight against cancer and other medical conditions.
To sight just a few of the more significant features, True Beam offers up to a 2,400 monitor unit per minute dose rate, that can more than double treatment speed, and up to five fold reduction in the number of steps needed for imaging positioning and treating patients. Higher quality 3-D cone beam CT images that can be generated in under a minute, with 25% less X-ray dose to the patients. The ability to induce the patient in real time with every breath during the treatment.
The world’s fast first gated RapidArc capability, where clinicians can compensate for respiratory motion, even while the guarantee is rotating around the patient, 7 millimeter precision through completely inaugurated imaging and delivery components, up to 5 x-ray energy levels and up to eight electron energy levels from more tailored dose delivery, automatic accuracy checks every 10 milliseconds and a new simplified user interface with additional safety enhancements. 
Reduce capabilities, as we believe True Beam has the potential to make a big difference in lung and liver treatments when speed and better motion management technologies required to improve precision.
As an example, this platform can delivery an 18 gray gated RapidArc lung treatment that’s nine times higher than a conventional RapidArc treatment in just seven minutes, nothing that we know off comes close to this capability. The True Beam automation we made it possible to deliver conventional five filed non-RapidArc IMRT treatment for the prostate or head and neck in a little over two minutes.
With RapidArc, True Beam can deliver a prostate IMRT treatment in a little over a minute. As Dow Wilson says, this thing is Ferrari fast. Sufficed to say, we are all very excited to see what new treatments are going to be developed with this platform. Over the next several years we expect that this system could grow to between 30% and 50% of our new machine orders. 
Initial customers for this platform will include early adopters and clinical pioneers in University, Hospitals, as well as international centers that need higher throughput. They will include centers that want the versatility to offer patients both radiotherapy and radiosurgery. For all of these customers True Beam offers the value of speed, that can enable them to generate higher throughput, lower cost per patient, improve patient comfort and reduce staff overtime, and shorten the patient waiting list.
It also offers marketing value and health centers attract patients and recruit top clinicians and staff. Preparing this platform tops a broad line of clinical products for radiotherapy and radiosurgery, starting with Unique and going up to Clinac IX, to Trilogy, to Novalis Tx and finally to True Beam, and True Beam STX. 
I am also pleased to say that the True Beam product development lead to a significant enhancement to our Clinac IX and Trilogy accelerators, which can now be upgraded, for example with RapidArc and other advanced motion management capabilities. This was also announced two weeks ago during the True Beam event. 
Oncology has significantly refreshed its product line since 2004, with the introduction of Clinac IX, Trilogy, Novalis Tx, Unique and now True Beam. We have added RapidArc, the onboard imager and the new HT 120 and LCB shaper for high-resolution radiosurgery, and we are continually enhancing our software for true complaining and information management. With this line up, oncology has given itself an excellent set of platforms for growth.
Turning to our X-ray products business, net orders for the second quarter were a record $1.5 million, up a remarkable 52%, versus the 17% decline that we saw in the year ago quarter, with solid gains in both tubes and in flat image detectors. We believe we are seeing signs of recovery in the global imaging industry. 
Net orders for X-ray tubes increased by about 30%, as imaging equipment manufactures around the globe began returning to more normal ordering patterns. Net orders for our panel products rose by about 80%. We are enjoying very strong demand for our new line of radiographic panels and renewed interest in our dynamic panels. Our customers are commercializing new digital imaging systems and converting existing CR at home based imaging installation to digital radiography. 
In our other business category, including our SIP, Security and Inspection Products business, our particle therapy business and our Gimson Technology Center, combined net orders for the quarter declined $9 million or 42% to $12 million. 
In our particle therapy business we have resubmitted a bid in response to a revised public tender to a Skandion Kliniken in Sweden, with our photon therapy systems, and we continue to pursue other photon center projects that are in various stages of development. SIP net orders declined as the business experienced some timing delays in large orders.
Now I’ll turn it over to Elisha for a review of the numbers, and then come back to you with our outlook for the third quarter and the full fiscal year of 2010. Elisha.

As usual I will walk you through the income statement, as well as cover a few balance sheet items. 
Second quarter revenues of $586 million increased 6%. Oncology systems posted an increase of 4%, X-ray products posted a gain of 19%, and revenues from businesses under the other category decreased by $4 million or 19%. As a result of the weaker dollar, on a constant currency basis revenues grew 3% and net orders increased 10%. 
The second quarter gross margin for the company was even with the year ago quarter at 43.4%, as the gain in oncology systems was offset by decline in our other businesses. Oncology’s gross margin increased one point, to 45.2%, due primarily to higher mix of software and service revenue, and improved quality cost. X-ray products gross margin fell two points to 38.5%, due primarily to product mix in both our tube and panel business, and start up costs for our new radiographic panel. 
Second quarter SG&A expenses were $80 million or 14% of revenues, a one point improvement from the year ago quarter as a result of ongoing cost controls. Second quarter R&D expenses were $39 million or 7% of revenue, equal to the year ago quarter. 
Moving down the income statement, second quarter operating earnings rose 11%, to $136 million or 23% of revenues, up one point from the year ago quarter; and for the first half, operating earnings were up 15%. Depreciation and amortization totaled $12 million for the quarter. 
Net interest expense for the quarter was $300,000. The effective tax rate was 32.6% for the quarter, down about two points from the year ago quarter due largely to a shift in the geographic mix of our earnings. For the first half, the tax rate was 33%, roughly equal to the year ago period. 
For fiscal year 2010, we continue to estimate that the tax rate will be 31% to 32%. However, due to a timing of discrete tax items, we estimate that our third quarter tax rate will be around 35%. Fully diluted shares outstanding were approximately $124 million at the end of the quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 14% to $0.73. 
Turning now to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $655 million, debt of $30 million, and stockholders equity of $1.4 billion. DSO or day sales outstanding for the quarter was an unusually low 76 days, an improvement of 11 days from the year ago quarter due to strong collection. 
Second quarter cash flow from operations was $94 million, with almost all of it coming from net earnings. Primary uses of cash were $72 million to repurchase 1.5 million shares of stock under our repurchase program, and $12 million for capital expenditure. 
Now, I’m going to turn it back over to Tim for the outlook.

This happens periodically where a country will start ordering a lot more equipment as it tries to beef up its programs, and then those programs end, and then other countries tend to join in. 
In the long run, we need more North American growth. We need North America to come back, because we can’t expect Japan to keep this up forever, although I would certainly love it if they did. I think we can do better in China. I think we did fine in China. We certainly grew in China, but I think we can grow share in China, and we are not really doing that. So I think that we have an opportunity in China to do even better. 
I think we are very strong in most countries. Certainly extremely strong in Australia, which has continued to be a surprisingly good location for many quarters over the last few years, and we had very strong in Belgium, Spain, and India as well. So this is not a one trick pony. We are seeing a lot of strong performance in a lot of locations. 
I think True Beam is going to help us. Also Korea, we saw some good growth. So I think True Beam will help us going forward. We are going to have to get approval to sell True Beam in all the locations where people are going to want it, and so that will cause strong potential growth, especially I think in next year as we get those approvals. 
So we have lots of growth potential internationally, but I still want the US market to show some strength. The US market has resisted showing strength, and I’m hoping as those budgets that people set last year graduate this year and we see the new budgets come up for next year, that they are going to show some additional strength. 
We’ve had tremendous amount of interest from people. We’ve had lots and lots of customer visits, and of course lately since the announcement of True Beam and little bit before that, people have come though to try and understand where we are taking our products, and whenever we show them True Beam they get very, very excited and all of that, whether they are a North American customer or whether they are an international customer, and all of that leads to believe that we are on the right track.

So sometimes it’s a little opaque for us to see what their end markets are like, but clearly they are showing some strength, and that’s emboldening them to give us larger orders.
For oncology, we tend to be slow going in to recessions because capital budgets tend to stick around longer, and so we were slow to go in, and we’ll be slow to come out as it takes a while for people to do that. We now know -- I guess we’ll no longer call it healthcare reform, we’ll call it insurance reform. We know now what insurance reform looks like, and so we are continuing to look at unemployment rates. 
I think hospitals are doing that. They are calculating how they should manage through this, but I would say that we are seeing lots and lots of customers who are showing lots of interest, and I think pressure is building up in the North American market for people to turn the situation around; at least that’s what we are looking for.

I think they are cutting their prices in an effort to depend share, and I think that products like True Beam actually increased the pressure on them, and Unique the same way. It increases pressure on competitors, and I’ve indicated this. 
Our response in the phase of the recession or in the phase of price-cutting is to try to innovate. We innovate and product more options and more technology to try and hold and solve our customers problems. If we can introduce innovations that are clinically valuable, then that helps us defend against just a general trend on the part of people to try to gain share by cutting their prices in the midst of this. 
True Beam is an example. If we can solve the problems of providing techniques that might improve cancer care, that are fast, that are very versatile and that are very easy used. If we can think hard about what our customers are trying to do to grow their business and provide them with tools that help them grow their business, it can make a difference. 
If you look at us over the last couple of years, we’ve introduced unique, Unique; we just did an upgrade, a refresh on the Clinac IX and then on the Trilogy; we introduced the True Mean, we’ve introduced the HD120, we’ve interdicted RapidArc and now gated RapidArc, we’ve interdicted onboard inventory, we’ve made multiple series of improvement to it, including now a better image quality and even lower dose and faster imaging than ever before and numerous software enhancements in our aria and eclipse product lines. 
So all these things I think are making a difference, and it’s why I think our numbers are looking good in many ways compared to other peoples numbers.

There seemed to be two points to this meeting, one was to compare early stage treatment for prostates with active surveillance or watchful waiting, and I think that the general consciences was, there was not data there to support one over the other, and so they would like to see more date than that. 
The mid knowledge is that there is a good evidence that higher dose rates improve prostate treatment, so that’s good, but they want to see more clinical trails conducted and we agree with that absolutely. There needs to be more trials that gather this kind of evidence. 
I think the second element to this is that there are people who are pushing for special reimbursement for [steriotatic] body radiation therapy for the prostate. I think the decision to this group; once that the evidence was not yet there, I think people are trying to get that evidence, but it was not yet, and so I think it makes it unlikely that there will be new courts added. 
I think that TMS has indicated that there would not be a national coverage decision, and that means that reimbursement should be normal going on, but I do believe that the radiation therapy community as a whole and especially the research community needs to hear the message, but comparative effectiveness research is going to be the way things are done in the further, and that there needs to be more and more data, and this was short over the valve for radiation therapy and there is going to be one for every other device, and every other form of surgery, and every other drug. People are going to look at CER more and more, and this was the case for us.

Obviously, I’m not speaking with the FDA directly, I’m usually working through our organizations like AdvaMed and MIDA and people like that. So what I’m hearing is that the FDA feels like its under pressure to increase the scrutiny, and they are trying to figure out how to do that without being unreasonable in the kinds of delays that they inject into the process. 
The hazard here is that if they go too far, they could require evidence for things where the whole purpose of creating the new feature is to go get the evidence, and so if they require evidence before evidence is available, they could inject multiyear delays into the introductions of new technologies into the market place, and that would be bad. 
But I will just tell you, the prices that people are paying right now are based upon the reimbursements that they get, so if the FDA delays approval of new products such that in order to use those new technologies, customers are going to have to do it under IRB and they are going to have to get patients to sign. I think patients will be willing to sign to use new techniques if they feel like those new techniques give them a better chance of survival or lower toxicity than they currently have. 
So, I believe there is plenty of potential to harm the American healthcare system, and so we are doing everything we can to encourage the FDA to produce changes that won’t slow the course of innovation. But at the same time I understand that the FDA is under tremendous pressure from newspaper reporters and politicians to take a harder line and with innovation, its all part of concern over healthcare costs in the United States. 
I personally think its the wrong way to solve the problem of healthcare costs, but certainly that’s something we will see. So, we are going to continue to work with AdvaMed. We have a very strong organization in Washington D.C. that can talk to the FDA and we can work through these organizations to try and influence change. I think we are going to see before the end of May, the first ideas from the FDA on what they are going to do, and I’ll know more then.

If not, it is true that we saw the first nasty signs of trouble a year ago, and that gives us a comp to work from but now we are still looking at capital budgets that were set last year. So I think things can improve in the US and I think that True Beam will help, and I think that some capital budgets are going to graduate, but for the rest of the year, I’m not expecting miracles in the North American market and I think our sales team has got heavy lifting to do as I indicated. 
So, I’m very proud of all of our sales teams, but clearly I think that our international sales team has stepped up to the bar in a very difficult time in the US, and come through with some very strong business. We did what we told you we would do. When North America got into trouble, we turned our attention and we invested heavily in our international sales business, and we are continuing to do that. 
In the long run, there are six billion people outside the US and 300 million people inside the US, and if they live longer outside the US, the vast majority of our business is going to start to come from outside the US, and that’s what we have to expect. So over the long run, this seems reasonable to me that we are going to continue to see most of our growth in dollar terms. Those are heavily underserved market. The US market is reasonably well served, so whenever there is a recession, you are going to see people here, see that as a time to not move forward. 
That being said, there is a very large number of people in the US who have old machines and who want to compete for patients, and who want to argue to patients that they are giving the very latest technologically. If you look at adds for hospitals, you will see them a lot of times now, they’ll have a picture of an attractive physician and right next to the physician there would be some sort of fancy machine or other, and we want our fancy machine to be standing right next to them in those pictures. So they brag about what we do. That’s good for us when they do that. So, I think technology is important in the ways hospitals behave. 
So, there’s lots of reasons for optimism in the North American market, but I wouldn’t just say that because quarter three a year ago, there was a cliff that quarter three this year is going to be great, because I think there’s still a lot of work to do in the North American market.

I have to say quarter two was stronger for this business than I really would have expected, and based upon the general market conditions and so. I think I’m optimistic. I do believe there will still be some bumpiness. I don’t think the world has come back to normal here, but quarter two is a nice point to have on the graph. 
We are seeing strong demand for RAD panels. We are seeing newer customers. We are seeing a lot of renewed interest in dynamic panels and tubes. We are seeing some signs of recovery in North America, so all of those things are good news, but nonetheless our customers make their decisions on orders, kind of a little bit in the last minute for many of those customers, and so I’m not making a prediction, but I’m saying certainly all the winds seem favorable, but that being said, I’ve been shocked before, so we’ll have to wait and see.

So the trick is when you introduce something, for most institutions that just starts their process of going through their administration and asking for the money in order to put these things together, but nonetheless because we are seeing strong interest, I think that’s good. 
True Beam itself, I expect there will be some small amount of backlog. Certain customers will decide that they want to change, but I think most of that business, the vast majority of that business is going to be new business going forward, and of course we can’t take a trilogy and turn it into a True Beam, that’s not a modification we will ever be able to sell.

I am please to report a strong third quarter which built on the performance of our first half. North American orders grew strongly after a year of decline and the overall international market including Europe continue to perform well. Net orders for the company grew 14% driven by a double-digit order growth in our oncology systems and x-ray product businesses.
Our quarter ending backlog grew 7%, revenues rose 13% and operating earnings rose by 28% with the help of a healthy gain in our gross margin. Even with an expected substantial increase in our quarter-over-quarter tax rate, earnings per diluted share increased by 9%. New products played a major role in the success of this quarter and I will focus now on some of our operational highlights.
Oncology systems third quarter net orders grew by 10% to $507 million with a 12% increase in North America and a 9% increase in international markets. International markets are countered for 52% of oncology orders during this quarter. Our cautiously optimistic view of the North American market was born out this quarter with order growths driven by hospitals. It is gratifying to see a large number of smaller orders demonstrating broad-based spending activity.
While one quarter does not make a trend, we feel better about the North American market than we have for many quarters. In Europe, net orders increased 11% even with a stronger U.S. dollar versus the Euro as customers across the region continue to invest in new clinical capabilities and services. Growth in this region was led by the Netherland, Switzerland, Spain, Italy and the Middle East.
And as you may have noticed from our early press release, India also contributed to this growth and our European region with one center placing an order for TrueBeam and five Unique. Far East orders grew by 9% mainly driven by good gains in China, Korea and Thailand while orders in the rest of the world declined by 6% primarily due to Latin America. 
New products played a major part in our growth. Our TrueBeam platform for advanced image-guided radiotherapy and radiosurgery was a major contributor to order growth this quarter. More than 60 TrueBeam units have ordered since its introduction in April with the bulk of the orders coming from the U.S. We also booked multiple orders in Europe and our first order in the Far East.

A significant number of the TrueBeam orders were upgrades from other machines already in backlog, but more than half were new orders. After years of development, it is very gratifying to see the strong interest and demand for this new platform, which we continue to believe will reach 30% to 50% of our new machine orders over time. 
We exhibited TrueBeam at the American Association of Physics and Medicine Meeting in Philadelphia last week and customer reaction continues to be extremely positive.</TAG>
This response reinforces our commitment to providing clinics with versatile radiotherapy and radiosurgery tools that both advanced the quality of care and lowered the cost of treatment. 
As you know, installations have been completed at several sites around the world and TrueBeam is already treating patients. For example, at the University of Alabama and Birmingham, doctors took just seven minutes to deliver a complex image-guided IMRT treatment for a sinus cancer patient to shrink his tumor and reduce the extent of surgery needed to treat his condition.

With conventional platforms, this treatment would have taken 40% longer. Doctors there are expecting to complete treatment even more quickly as they gain experience with the platform and use more of its features; they plan to commence long radiosurgery within a matter of weeks.

We hope over time that TrueBeam could also be a gain changer for liver patients as well. During the quarter, we also saw growing interest among international clinics in Unique, our new accelerator for fast, affordable image-guided RapidArc treatments and we continue to believe that this will be a major contributor to oncology’s international growth.

Oncology service business increased 18% in the quarter. As systems become more sophisticated and use more accessories for IMRT, IDRT and surgery, customers are increasingly calling on us to ensure clinical uptime, maintain their investment and keep their software capabilities current.

Service now represents almost a third of oncology business and we see an opportunity to increase it further through geographic expansion as our installed base grows in international territories. To give you some basic facts about it, the oncology service unit employs more than 1700 people around the world; we have the highest density of clinically trained resources for education and clinical support for radiation oncology.</TAG>
Our primary education center at Las Vegas is the largest in the industry and we have two additional centers in Beijing and Zug, Switzerland. 
We are holding a grand opening for another center in Mumbai in August. Our service parts and technicians are within hours of every Varian machine in the world, thanks to an extensive network of strategically placed depots and service centers, this is key to ensuring system performance and giving customers the confidence they need to buy Varian technology. Service is a tremendous asset for our oncology business as a growth driver and as a competitive advantage.

Let me turn now to our x-ray products business, which had one of the best quarters in its history. This business achieved record operating earnings with the help of high shipment volumes, product mix and improved factory efficiencies, a stark contrast to a very challenging year ago. Revenues were up 52% and orders were up 26%, both driven by more than a 50% gain in our flat panel business.
We are enjoying very strong demand for our new line of radiographic panels. We believe our customers are gaining market share and therefore stepping up production of new and retrofitted radiographic imaging systems using our panels. 
We were also pleased to see strong growths for the panel business among dental, veterinary and industrial imaging equipment manufactures. X-rays performance together with positive reports from diagnostic imaging manufactures reinforces our belief that the global imaging industry may be recovering.
In our other business category including our SIP, Security and Inspection Products business, our particle therapy business and our Ginzton Technology Center combined net orders for the quarter were $20 million, an increase of $11 million over a weak year-ago quarter. 
SIP net orders increased due to demand from international border security market. In the U.S., the business continued to experience lackluster demand caused primarily by ongoing delays and did award challenges among competitors or a large government project.
We believe that our SIP business will continue to face challenging conditions in the short term. The news was mixed for our particle therapy business in this quarter. On the positive side, Varian has been named as the equipment supplier for a new proton center to be built and operated in San Diego; once our customer completes his financing for this project, we will book the order. On the other side, the [Candy] and proton therapy center project in Sweden was awarded to a competitor and another competitor are now contesting this award.
So now I’ll turn it over to Elisha for review of the numbers and then I will come back to you with our outlook for the full fiscal year 2010. </TAG>

As usual I will walk you through the income statement, as well as cover a few balance sheet items. While Tim has already covered net order, I want to briefly talk about the constant currency growth rate. Net orders for the total companies were up 14% in U.S. dollars and up 15% in constant currency. Similarly Oncology net orders were one point higher in constant currency bringing its growth rate to 11%.</TAG>
In Europe, Oncology net orders were up 15% in constant currency and 11% on a reported basis as a result of the weaker Euro. However, on a global basis the impact from currency this quarter was fairly minor as a weaker Euro was largely offset by strong on Japanese, Australian, Canadian and Swiz currencies. 
The company’s third quarter revenue of $578 million increased 13% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Oncology systems posted an increase of 6%; x-ray products posted a gain of 52%, and revenues from businesses under the other category increased by $5 million or 37%.</TAG>
Third quarter gross margin for the company increased by 160 basis points to 44%, bringing the year to date gain to about one point, oncology systems third quarter gross margin declined slightly to 45.1%, due primarily to geographic mix ship for lower margin international deliveries. Year-to-date Oncology systems gross margin was up by more than a point to 45.6%, due largely to service volumes and product mix.</TAG>
X-ray products third quarter gross margin growth more than three point to $40.3%, due primarily to higher total revenues coupled with a higher mix of panel revenue and improved quality costs. Year-to-date, x-ray has increased its margin by about half a point to 40%, again due largely to a higher panel mix.</TAG>
Third quarter SG&A expenses were $85 million or 15% of revenues, and R&D expenses with $39 million or 7% of revenue. On a combined basis, operating expenses at the percentage of revenues improved by about one point for the quarter and for the year to date.</TAG>
Moving down the income statement, third quarter operating earnings rose 28%, to $131 million or 22.6% of revenues, up two and half point from the year ago quarter. Year to date operating earnings were up 19% and operating margin was up two points. Depreciation and amortization totaled $12 million for the quarter. Net interest expense for the quarter was $900,000 up from the year ago quarter due to lower rates on our cash balances.</TAG>
The effective tax rate was 29% for the quarter, up from the 17% rate in the year ago quarter, but still lower than we expected due largely to the timing of certain tax items. Year to date, the tax rate was 32%, up about four points from the same period last year. And for the full fiscal year2010, we continue to estimate that the tax rate will be 31% to 32%, bringing the fourth quarter tax rate to about 31%.
Fully diluted shares outstanding were $124.5 million for the quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 9% to $0.74. During the quarter the company recorded a $6.4 million charge related to a discontinued research instruments business.</TAG>
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $588 million, debt of $23 million and stockholders equity of $1.4 billion. (DSO) days outstanding for the quarter was 80 days, an improvement of three days from the year ago quarter. Third quarter cash flow from operations was $68 million bringing the year to date cash flow from operation to just under $300 million.
Primary uses of cash were $116 million to repurchase 2.3 million shares of stock under our repurchase program and $31 million for capital expenditures, which included the final payment for a building on our campus. 
Now, I will turn it back over to Tim for the outlook.

Well, just broadly, we are feeling better than we have for many quarters and I sort of made a few remarks about TrueBeam and RapidArc helping that, so we saw lots of small orders and that of course makes us feel good. 
The funnel is looking healthy. Hospitals are growing a lot, I mean that’s where we saw the strength, but freestandings grew up sequentially, but when you compare to year-over-year they have not recovered, but sequentially they did show strength. So I would have to say sequentially all the segments of this market showed strength, but we have yet to see freestanding come back to where it would. 
But as I said the funnel is healthier. We’ve looked at diagnostic radiology companies and they are showing better results in the North American market and as I’ve indicated in past meetings, that’s a good harbinger for us. Usually we experience a nine-month to a year delay from diagnostic radiology companies. So this is a little maybe faster than we have seen in the past and we are seeing a lot of activity in the marketplace, but having said that, one quarter is not a trend and I would like to see another quarter or two of this kind. 
Well, I would like to see this continue for the rest of my life, but before I make any long-term predictions, I want to see at least another quarter to get a good feeling for it and I have to remember that a lot of the orders that we got a year ago where we were experiencing the problems in North America, those will now turn into shipments and so revenues are still going to be challenging for us, for I think a quarter or two, until we get past this. So this is very nice to see and I am hoping we see a lot more of these turn into early shipments. 
In the past, you get these substantial delays between the time we get an order and the time we get a shipment and I’m hoping that if there is any kind of pent-up demand maybe it will turn into earlier shipments, but we will have to see and that’s one of the reasons why I’m sort of -- I know that a lot of people would like to see me give guidance, but I really want to see another quarter and I want to see those delivery dates before I talk too much about 2011.

So, we are kind of surprised that they haven’t actually strengthened more than they have.

I don’t think that you should necessarily assume that because certain countries are having a problem that all countries in Europe will behave in this way, but I do believe that the growth in European economies would have been better if they hadn’t have these sturdy programs, but I am not expecting these places to fall off the edge of the world.
Also, we’ve done a lot in terms of speeding up our machines. These machines are faster and easier for customers to use, so that they can get more patients in a day. So for a lot of reasons I think we’ve lowered the cost for patient on new machines, and a lot of these nations you have to remember have been less eager to replace old machines, than people in the US have been. I think the replacement rate for all the machines in US faster and I think that there are a lot of machines in Europe that are old and if we can get those machines out and replace with these new faster machines, I think it will make a big difference, plus the disruption is not as great as it use to be. 
We’ve now can shown that we can. The premium installation, that we’ve installed these machines in two weeks, and that is I think a record for us and I think it makes it easier for customers to switch from an older generation machine to a new generation machine. Because they are no longer going down for two months while that happens.

Now not the leaders the leaders they are not followers, they act immediately, but the early adaptors, but what I am saying is a number of countries act after two years. The reason for that just simply is their budgeting cycles contend to me multi year in character. So they have budgeted for a certain machine and even if we introduced a new machine they can’t necessarily switch over. 
So I would expect that if we’ve introduced TrueBeam here in 2010 that we’ll start seeing a wave of TrueBeams in Europe 2012-ish. Asia as you know, it various widely country by country, but I would expect in Japan, TrueBeam after we get approval, and where we can start actually taking orders in Japan, I think that you’ll see that strengthen in 2000. Maybe if the winds blow with us and we get our approval at a reasonable time, you may start to see that in 2011 otherwise it will be 2012. 
I think we’re okay in Korea and I am not sure about Thailand and of course we have to get approval in China as well. So China will probably be mostly a 2012 impact, but the mix will be more towards TrueBeams in Europe, than it will be in China and most of Asia. In most of Asia I think that mix will change more towards 2013.

In the United States there is for example, for prostate there is a continued argument between those people who want to have radical prostatectomies and those are will have radiation therapy. But the fact is radiation therapy is the least invasive, least toxic way to cure cancer that there is of all of ones that are available and its extremely affected. So I think we are going to continue see that happened. 
In terms of patients, what was seeing is and these tell us that they are able to do things with RapidArc, that they wouldn’t be able to do for those patients any other way. I am not sure how that affected patient decisions, because all that clinicians are reporting to us is, that it enabled them to do something they weren’t able to do, that they were able to give that patient a better treatment. 
In some cases the patient was able to be treated with the radiation and they wouldn’t have otherwise been able to be treated with radiation.
So those are all good signs, but I don’t have anything other than anecdotes to really flush that out for you.

We are not giving you a take rate on this call for RapidArc, but all I can tell you is it’s just that the acceptance of RapidArc is enormous. 
We get constant and continuing and ongoing feedback from physicians that they love it and that they are embracing it and some of our customers of course that didn’t use our treatment planning system have had to wait for other people’s treatment planning systems to do it and I still think we have a huge lead there in terms of the performance of the cliffs, and RapidArc planning versus volume metric modulated Arc therapy planning for some competitive systems. 
So I think our system works really well and those people who adopted it on the treatment planning side and on the clinic side are doing extremely well. But as I said, RapidArc will be standard on the TrueBeam and so I expect that as TrueBeam grows it will just increase the acceptance of that. 
In terms of the impact on trilogy and Novalis, we will have a Novalis version of the TrueBeam product and so I don’t think we have hurt that, and I think that the trilogy, I would expect that some people who wanted the trilogy will now -- you could say that hurts the trilogy, it doesn’t hurt us if they go from a trilogy to a TrueBeam, but in terms of the absolute numbers of trilogy, I would expect that number to go down and the numbers of TrueBeams to go up.

It’s called IMR, which is the ability to take images while the patient is on the table and see whether or not we are staying on target and the way that we plan. So I think for both liver and for lung, that capability would be useful and we’ll start to see more and more applications for that. 
I also believe it will be useful for prostate. Whether or not it will be clinically valuable remains to be seen I think it will prove to be clinically valuable for us. In prostate we will have to wait to see what the studies have to say, because we are already pretty good at positioning the prostate, and the results for radiation therapy for the prostate are really very good. So it’s quite hard to believe that we’ll see a huge improvement there in terms of survival. 
In terms of toxicity however I am kind of interested, because one of the things that our customers would like to do is be able to conformably avoid the rectum. Recto toxicity is one of the things that physicians would like to avoid and I think that a number of clinicians that we talked to are interested in seeing if they can use the capability of TrueBeam to attack that problem, so I think that would be interesting. 
Then we will have to see, the TrueBeam is so fast that for hypo-fractionated treatment that enables you to treat those relatively quickly. The papers really that we would like to see for hypo fractionated prostate haven’t happened yet, and when those papers start to come out we’ll know whether or not there will be a large shift there. 
If there is, that’s good, because I was talking to somebody just yesterday, who was talking about a relative who chose to have a radical prostatectomy rather than radiation therapy, because they lived an hour away from a major city and they didn’t want to have to go in for 30 or 40 times to be treated, so they chose surgery instead even though surgeries will keep them from driving and will have numerous other side effects that were nastier, but that was the decision that they made. 
So if we can discover that hypo fractionated radiation therapy for the prostate treatment is five days, six days, ten days, something like that turns out to work really well, then we may see a lot of those patients, especially early stage patients chose radiation therapy, because the other toxicities are just so low compared to surgery.

What we have recommended is that over time we need to make the process of quality assurance just before a patient is treated to be more complete. That is, we propose some sort of time out that occurs. 
Time out is a term that’s used by surgeons. What it means is that everybody sits down with the patient and just before the surgery begins, and we would do the same thing for radiation and look and make sure that everything is consistent with what they thought and the question is what software tools, can we in hardware capabilities can we put on the machine that will make that process easier for them to do. 
So, we are in discussion with APM and other organizations to see how that might be done. Radiation therapy is I think if you look at the medical field overall you will see that our customers have done a very good job, but nonetheless incidents continue to happen, and none of us are ever going to happy until that incident read as zero, and to do that, I think we have to recognize that radiation therapy planning and treating is a very complicated process and that by putting more QA at certain points in the process, especially just before patients are treated with a new plan, I think we can make a lot of progress towards improving safety. 
So, that’s what we focused on, we talked to the FDA about it and they are very receptive to this idea and they are encouraging us to proceed with it and we have talked to users about it and they are encouraging. I think that as our customers are not monolithic there is obviously going to be lot of opinions about this and some of them are going to want more from us and others feel that we have already done enough, but we will never be satisfied as long as there is even a single injury reported to us.

On the revenue side, it’s really just a function of the orders decline in the year ago period. Again it’s still 6 to 7 for the full year, but it’s going to be in the low single digits in Q4 once you pencil out the guidance there. 
We saw a recovery in the year ago fourth quarter, x-ray started to grow; oncology had a strong quarter as well. So, a little bit of it has to do with the comparable, the dollar and the Euro exchange rate plays into that, but it’s really just looking at customer requested delivery dates and I think more of a reflection of orders decline in a year ago period. 
So it’s going to take us a quarter or two to work through that, because as you know the average timing backlog is about 12 to 15 months or so.

So, I am wondering the higher revenues are not turning in terms of guidance, they are not looking like they are turning into better operating margins for the fourth quarter than it’s been in any quarter this fiscal year and why that might be.

I think if you were to look back over last year we went from 19% to 22%, 24% ROS in Q4. So we’ve got a tremendous improvement in Q4, so it just makes the comparable pretty tough as we compare it to the year ago fourth quarter. 
So, again it should pencil out to right around 23%. For the full year it’s getting close to a one and half point improvement. So, I would just encourage you to focus on the year and not to draw too many conclusions from a single quarter.

People, who want to do both traditional radiation therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery, are interested in TrueBeam, and a number of customers who want a market advanced clinical capabilities, see the TrueBeam has something that they can have that will help them competitively, and we are also talking to surgeons who want to offer a lot of more non-invasive options for the patients.

The answer to that Michael and by the way welcome, is different for different areas of the world. I will begin by starting outside the US and pointing out that outside the US the world is still grossly underserved in terms of the number of machines",632,"Yeah. The answer to that Michael and by the way welcome, is different for different areas of the world. I will begin by starting outside the US and pointing out that outside the US the world is still grossly underserved in terms of the number of machines that are required to treat cancer patients today, let alone where we are going. 
I think I’ve used these numbers before, but in the United States there’s about 13 machines for a million people, in Europe its about 4 to 7 machines per million people and in China its less than half a machine per million people. So China literally needs thousands of machines to be where they need to be and furthermore if we turn out to be effective against more and more types of lung cancer which is of course what we are trying to do and getting them treated with radiation rather than surgery, I think that radiation will be very important for world health outside the US.
So I don’t see any other things that we are doing in terms of throughput hurting us internationally. Instead it will encourage people to look at radiation therapy as a cost effective way of treating these patients. The actual cost per patient internationally is quite low. 
In the US there are multiple things, some winds are blowing north and some are blowing south. In the north, generally yes there are a lot more machines in the US, but a lot of those machine are old, are 10 years old, they have very low throughput, they don’t have a lot of the modern features that we like to see, and of course, we are constantly adding new features that enable patients not just to be treated more quickly, but to make sure that they are treated in exactly accordance with the physicians intent. So I think there is a lot of reasons for people in the US to want to replace those older units. 
Also, we have done some math that shows, as we see an increase because of the aging of bloomers over the next few years, we might expect this number of machines per million people to raise to 14 or 15 in the US. 
Now working against that is hyper fractionation and the fact that we can treat people, but what you have to remember a lot about a lot of radiation therapy departments right now is that they run long days. They don’t run eight-hour days, they run ten-hour days or twelve-hour days. 
People are having to come in at night in some cases to be treated. If we can just get those machines down to where most people can be treated during the day and minimize the overtime for staff, that’s a real cost savings for staff. So don’t think of it in terms of the machine was in use for eight hours and now its going to be use for four. It’s more like these machines were in use for ten hours and now they are going to be in use for eight and so, all of these technologies will I think help there. 
Also I think that there will be pressure on cost, on hospitals and hospitals are going to be motivated to try and treat people for less cost per patient. So I think that’s very important in terms of people being willing to upgrade these to new technologies.
So although the number of machines in the United States is higher than it is anywhere else, and hyper fractionation would encourage you to believe that a certain per certain, not majority, but probably may be 10% of patient could benefit from hyper fractionation, those affects will happen, but I think the other effects will out weigh it.

Oncology, the economic cycle mostly effected North America, it didn’t affect us internationally really at all, which is one of the reasons why I said we are feeling better this quarter than we have in the past, because as North America comes back we are not seeing the effects in Europe that other people are predicting, at least not so far. 
X-ray was definitely hurt, because diagnostic radiology was hurt and also people I think reduced their inventories. So as orders were hurt for diagnostic radiology and as people reduced their inventory requirements that we have kind of a doubled whammy for that business. 
Now as diagnostic radiology comes back, I think we are seeing Bob get more business, which is why you saw this revenue up 52%, orders up to a 26% number. That panel sales themselves are up 80% and tube sales were up 30, so this business is really firing and that would give me a lot of optimism for the behavior of the diagnostic business. 
Security and inspection I think is going to have a tougher time, especially in the US. I think this is the kind of place where economies are going to pull back. Its on infrastructure development, and weirdly I know this seems counter intuitive, but people are pulling back on security. You would think this is a very dangerous world and they should spend on security. 
So I think the largest negative wind we are experiencing in this company is going to be in the security business. I am hoping to get past that within the few quarters. I certainly think it’s making it more trying for this business, and then also we often joke with Lester Boeh who runs this business, that he is the Vice-President of business that gets protests. Because every order that we see lately, all of these large orders have huge amounts of protests and so I think it’s been tough for them. 
So x-ray I think we are seeing a return, I think oncology we are starting to see a return. We’ll see how that goes in the next quarter, but we are starting to see a return. I think security is going to have a harder time, and I think probably protons, this was a head wind in terms of getting financing for proton centers. I think it slowed down the process from what it was in previous years, but it is injected a delay and I think we are starting to see these projects now start to come to a fruition, so that’s good. But in security we have had no incidents. 
Basically our borders have been pretty safe and there has been nothing in the headlines that has pushed this issue, and if there are more issues in the headline then maybe we’ll be seeing this thing turn around.

Today we are reporting our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 with strong growth in orders for our Oncology Systems and X-Ray Products businesses that have set the stage for solid revenue and earnings growth in fiscal 2011.
Total net orders rose 12% for the quarter to $777 million, and increased 10% for the year to $2.6 billion. Our year ending backlog grew 10% to a record $2.2 billion. Revenues reflecting economic challenges and slower order activities in 2009 rose 2% for the quarter to $652 million, and 6% for the year to $2.4 billion.
Our operating earnings including a $2 million restructuring in our securities and inspection business, declined by 1% for the quarter, but rose 13% for the year. Earnings per diluted share increased 12% for the quarter to $0.87 and 12% for the year to $2.96.
Cash flow from operations for the quarter was a record $168 million, and we ended the quarter with $520 million in cash and cash equivalents, even after spending $255 million on stock repurchases. We’ve successfully navigated within a tough economic environment, and we’re optimistic about our prospects for continued growth.
Oncology Systems’ fourth quarter net orders totaled $657 million, up 15% with 24% growth in North America and 7% growth in international markets. Both the Far East and Europe contributed to the growth.
Oncology’s net orders for the fiscal year reached a big milestone rising 10% to cross the $2 billion mark for the first time with 16% growth in international markets and 4% growth in North America. Oncology has now had three consecutive quarters of double-digit order growth including two quarters of double-digit order growth in North America.
When we talked at this time last year, the North American market was mired in uncertainty created by economic recession, tighter financing, healthcare reform debates and reimbursement worries. Most of these issues are behind us, and our sales funnel in this region looks far healthier than what we saw last year.
The international market continued to function well, and we remain particularly excited about our prospects in emerging markets. In China, the signs are particularly encouraging. Our order performance in the quarter was equivalent to all of fiscal year 2008.
A survey of the China’s Radiotherapy Department shows that they plan to more than double the nation’s install base to some 1,200 million accelerators by 2015, and Varian is well-positioned to supply many of these machines.
We also had a good quarter in Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. We also enjoyed strong performance across most of Europe, India, and the Middle East. In India the quarter was highlighted by an order for three TrueBeams and a UNIQUE from a leading private healthcare group.
In the Middle East, we would like to do even more, however U.S. trade policy makes it virtually impossible for us to do business in embargoed countries such as Iran, where our competitors are likely to get a substantial amount of uncontested business next year.
In Brazil, we believe we won 80% of the business that we competed for in 2010, and we have the vast majority of the install base of an estimated 240 machines. The Brazilian government is committed to expanding its cancer care, and it has charged the private healthcare sector to invest in a further 100 linear accelerators over the next 3 to 5 years.
Varian’s strength in delivering higher throughput, lower cost per treatment, better reliability and superior service infrastructure, put us in an excellent position to win a lot more business there. One of the reasons for our order success was our recent introduction of several important new products.
Our TrueBeam system for radiotherapy and radiosurgery did extremely well during the quarter and we now have taken more than 125 orders for this product, since it was introduced in the second quarter of this year. The vast majority of the orders were for new machines rather than backlog conversions. Most orders came from North America but a growing number came from leading centers in Europe, including the first three TrueBeam orders in England.
This is easily the most successful linac introduction in our history. We believe TrueBeam is creating demand for new installations and machine replacements. It also opened the door to place new and replacement units in clinics that have historically been strongholds for our competitors.
With the help of TrueBeam, total machine orders reached record highs for the quarter and the year. We now have more than 30 TrueBeam installations complete or in progress. As I hope you have seen from recent press releases, this machine is now being used to deliver both radiotherapy and radiosurgery with an unmatched combination of speed, precision, and automation.
Doctors in the U.S. and Europe have already treated hundreds of patients using TrueBeam to perform stereotactic radiosurgery on tumors in the lung, pancreas, and brain. It is being used to treat prostate, breast, and pelvic cases with radiotherapy, and in some cases with shorter hyper fractionated treatment schedules.
Clinicians are already using TrueBeam to develop new and better ways of treating these cancers and we are very excited about its potential to change the game in our fight to control this disease and to help us achieve our goal to save 100,000 more lives each year.
Of course, Oncology Systems has more than TrueBeam. Other products including our UNIQUE accelerator for affordable image guided RapidArc IMRT in international markets contributed to our oncology orders in the quarter and the year.
RapidArc orders also hit an all time high for the quarter and the year with well over 1,200 orders and nearly 600 installations, since the product was introduced in 2008, RapidArc is now firmly accepted as a standard clinical tool for fast, efficient, and precise radiotherapy and radiosurgery.
Our newly introduced next generation Gated RapidArc function sets us up nicely for continued growth of this product line. Our global oncology service business also continued to expand with record orders for the quarter and the year. This is now an approximately $570 million annual business that represents nearly 30% of total oncology orders and revenues.
Turning to X-Ray Products, net orders grew 15% to $112 million for the quarter, and grew 24% to $419 million for the year. This was a record quarter and year for X-Ray Products and net orders, sales and operating earnings. I am pleased to note that this is now a more than $400 million annual business for Varian, and I’m more excited than ever about its future.
As usual, flat panel detectors for filmless X-ray imaging were the fastest growing portion of this business and are on the verge of overtaking X-ray tubes as the largest part of our X-Ray Products business.
Our newly introduced Rad panels for digital radiography accounted for more than half of the expansion in our panel business. These panels have been designed into new radiographic systems by our OEM customers. These customers are also retrofitting older film-based systems and computer radiographic systems for lower cost, higher throughput digital radiography in medical and veterinary diagnostics.
A recovery in our traditional strong market for dynamic panels used for dental CT also added to the growth in our panel business during the quarter. Order growth in our tube business was solid for the quarter and the year with a nice pickup in demand for our industrial tubes, which are used for nondestructive tests and baggage screening systems.
From a geographic perspective, Asia and Europe together were responsible for the lion share of the growth for X-Ray Products. North America was also positive reflecting the possibility of some turnaround for the imaging industry in this territory.
Before I leave the X-ray Products, I want to call your attention to gross margin improvements in this business, which hit an all-time high for the full fiscal year. This business benefited from overall higher volumes together with product mix shifts toward more panel shipments.
We continue to plan for the introduction of a new breed of X-Ray tubes that is optimized for use with flat panels and filmless imaging systems. These tubes will be included in our exhibit at RSNA at the end of November.
Switching now to our other category, we continue to deal with protest from competitors to public tender awards in our SIP Security and Inspection Products business and our particle therapy business.
This category generated combined net orders of $8 million for the quarter and negative orders for the year after accounting for a $62 million cancellation stemming from the competitive challenge to a Swedish proton order that was booked in the year ago fourth quarter and then cancelled in the first quarter of 2010. Litigation in that matter is continuing.
Excluding the proton order in the year ago period, net orders for the other category were down $19 million from the year ago quarter and down $27 million for the year principally because of a similar tender protest issue in our SIP business.
Our SIP business has been selected several times to provide products for a big border screening tender in the U.S., but we chose not to book this order because of repeated challenges to this tender award. This has had a negative impact on business in the U.S., meanwhile international deployment of security products particularly in the Middle East and Europe is continuing.
Nevertheless, lower than expected volumes in SIP caused us to downside this business and take a $2 million restructuring charge in the quarter. Our commitment to these emerging businesses remains strong and we have reason to believe that things will improve in the longer term if we execute properly.
First, in our security business we continue to make technical advances in the direction of smaller, faster, more automated screening systems, and Varian and its partners are winning the largest share of tender awards worldwide. We still believe that this could grow to a sizeable market, but that it will take longer than we had hoped it would. In the meantime, SIP is contributing to the profitability of our business.
Second, in our Particle Therapy business, Varian has been named as the preferred provider for centers in San Diego, Maryland, The Netherlands and Italy, and we are in serious discussion with several other groups that are planning proton therapy centers. We will not book an order for any of these projects until contracts and financing are completed.
The biggest challenge for some of these projects at the moment is the ability to get financing, and with the strength of our balance sheet we are exploring ways that we can help in selected situations. Here again, we are continuing to improve the clinical viability of this technology and we believe it has potential to save the lives of many, many cancer patients, particularly young patients.
Before I turn it over to Elisha, I want to let you know that from here on out we will report orders by business segments rather than for the total company. This will avoid confusing comparisons that can be created by large lumpy proton orders masking the true ongoing performance in our core businesses.
Reporting orders by segment will give you a clearer and more meaningful picture of what is occurring in our other category without diminishing visibility into our Oncology Systems and X-Ray Products businesses.
So now, here is Elisha.

For",804,"Great. Thanks, Tim, and hello everyone. While Tim has already covered net orders, I want to briefly talk about the constant currency growth rates for the quarter.
Net orders for the total company were 12% in U.S. dollars and 13% in constant currency. For Oncology, net orders grew by 15% in dollars or 17% in constant currency.
Given the significant quarter-over-quarter strengthening of the dollar against the euro, Oncology’s European net orders growth rate was in the mid-teens, double the growth rate in dollars. On a global basis, the impact from currency this quarter was moderate as a weaker euro was somewhat offset by a stronger yen.
The company’s reported fourth quarter revenues of $652 million increased 2% in dollars or 3% in constant currency. Not surprisingly Oncology Systems posted a 3% decline in revenues, reflecting the orders decline in the year ago period.
X-ray Products posted a gain of 16% driven largely by flat panels and revenues from businesses under the other categories increased by 47% or $11 million.
The company’s reported fiscal year revenues of $2.4 billion increased 6% in dollars or 5% in constant currency. Oncology Systems annual revenues increased 4%; X-Ray products grew 22%; and the other category rose 8%.
The fourth quarter gross margin for the company fell two points to 42.4%. Oncology Systems fourth quarter gross margins declined nearly 3 points to 43.2% due primarily to products and territorial mix shift, startup cost associated with commercial shipments of our new TrueBeam platform, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
X-Ray Products’ gross margin rose more than 2 points to 41.1% reflecting a higher proportion of panel revenues and record total volume. For the fiscal year, total company gross margin rose slightly to 43.5%.
Fourth quarter SG&A expenses were $87 million or 13% of revenue, an improvement of almost 2 points from the year ago quarter. For the year SG&A was $335 million or 14% of revenues, a 1 point improvement from the prior year.
Fourth quarter R&D expenses were $41 million or 6% of revenues, up slightly as a percentage of revenues from the year ago quarter and for the year R&D expenses were $157 million even with the prior year at 7% of revenue.
Moving down the income statement, fourth quarter operating earnings including the $2 million restructuring charge were $149 million or 22.8% of revenues, down 70 basis points from the year ago quarter. For the full year operating earnings rose by 13% to $534 million or 22.7% of revenues up by more than a point from the previous year.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $13 million for the quarter and $48 million for the year. Net interest income was $200,000 for the quarter and net interest expense was $1.3 million for the fiscal year. The effective tax rate was 29% for the quarter and 31% for the year. For the first quarter of 2011, the estimated tax rate should be about 31% and we estimate the annual fiscal year ‘11 tax rate will again be 31% to 32%.
Fully diluted shares outstanding were about 121 million for the quarter, down significantly from the year ago period due largely to the accelerated stock repurchase of 3.9 million shares in the quarter.
For the year fully diluted shares outstanding were 124 million. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter rose 12% to $0.87 and for the fiscal year also increased 12% to $2.96.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $520 million, debt of $43 million and stockholders’ equity of $1.3 billion. I am particularly pleased that we ended the quarter with only $20 million of outstanding debt under our revolving line of credit after drawing down nearly $180 million at the end of August to finance the accelerated share repurchase program.
DSO for the quarter was 82 days, up one day from the year ago quarter. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was a record $168 million, significantly higher than net earnings as we benefited from working capital improvement. Primary uses of cash in the quarter were $255 million for stock repurchases and $18 million for capital expenditures.
Annual cash flow from operations also totaled a record $461 million significantly higher than net earnings for the period and 50% higher than what we achieved in 2009. Primary uses of cash during the year were $498 million for share repurchases and $68 million for CapEx.
During the quarter, we repurchased 4.8 million shares and including 3.9 million under an accelerated repurchase program. For the year, we repurchased 9.8 million shares and at the end of the quarter, we had 4.5 million shares remaining under our repurchase authorization that extends through the end of fiscal year 2011.
Now, I’ll turn it back over to Tim for the outlook.

Well, strengthened order activity for our Oncology Systems business in the second half of this fiscal year, as well as ongoing momentum in our X-Ray Products business have set the stage for better growth in the company’s revenues and earnings in 2011.
For fiscal year 2011, we believe that revenues and operating earnings could increase by 10% to 11% over fiscal 2010 totals, and that net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations could rise around 14% to a range of $3.34 to $3.39.
For the first quarter of fiscal year 2011, total company revenues could increase by about 8% over the prior year and net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations could also rise around 15% to a range of $0.71 to $0.74.
To summarize our thoughts for the year, we have addressed economic challenges including some setbacks in our emerging businesses. We managed to grow our net orders, revenues and backlog, while effectively instituting cost controls that enabled the company to leverage greater growth in our annual operating earnings.
Our commitment to increase R&D has paid off with the introduction of TrueBeam, Gated RapidArc, UNIQUE and Rad Panels and we have many more innovations, products and services to come.
At this point, our outlook for economic and for continued growth is increasingly optimistic. We have high hopes for our shorter Q&A session so that we can cheer our Giants out here in the Bay Area on the victory tonight. One of the reasons I have a gravelly voice is because of extensive cheering last night, and so, Go Giants and we’re now ready for your questions.

One of those reasons is of course that the economic recession in the United States is lifting a little bit for hospitals and some of that capital purchasing that they didn’t make in 2008 and 2009 and 2010, they are starting to come back with.
And the second reason we think is that TrueBeam came along at just the right moment. I’ve said in past conference call that it’s very important in recessionary periods to go on innovating, because innovation will drive activity on the part of your customer base even when economic conditions are unfavorable. And I think we landing TrueBeam six months ago was just the right thing to do and the number of orders that we booked during the period I think is evidence of this and it was very strong in North America.

So as you know the average time in backlog being 12 months to 15 months, this is just purely a reflection of working that through. The good news is backlog is now up 10% as of the end of the year, and so again, touches up nicely as we move into fiscal year ‘11.

So really, four factors drove gross margin in the quarter. They had about an equal impact. We had product mix lower acceptance revenue in the quarter. We had a 5 point shift to international deliveries which impacted. We had currency effects also, and then finally, the installation and warranty on TrueBeam. That should all correct in fiscal year ‘11 with an increase in gross margins.

There are 6 billion people outside the U.S. and the international market is going to be hugely important to us. Just to give you a feeling for this there was about 515 million people in the world over age 65 today.
In the U.S. if you look at the number of machines in the United States divided by the number of people over age 65 it returns out to be about 128 machines per million people over age 65. For the world its 19, for China its 11. If today, the shortfall today to get to one-fourth of the U.S. standard for age where people over 65 will be 6500 more machines and there is only about 10,000 in the world today.
If were to get to half the U.S. standard over the course of the next ten years the world would need 20,000 more machines and there is only 10,000 in the world today. I think internationally it’s going to be extremely important to us going forward and designing machines through that market and helping to develop that market and encouraging that market to grow is one of the most important things this company can do.

For example, one of the previous questioners remarked that there looks like there might be a growth spurt in the U.K., which is one of the countries that’s having one of the biggest cutbacks. So there is unfortunately kind of contradictory indications about where this would be going. Logically, you’d expect some restraint here. But actually we are not sure.
I would have to say, for the European Union, Turkey, the U.K., and probably India, those are probably going to be more affected by these cutbacks than other places, and for Asia I expect China, places like that, I think we’ll continue to see substantial growth.

As we’ve said all along when the margins were going up or when they’re down, one quarter does not make a trend, I would bring you back to the year where oncology was roughly flat, with an increase of 12 basis points, that’s even given a really big shift to international.

We’re seeing tremendous growth in flat panels and so we’re spending to develop new kinds of flat panels. We just see everyone else and somebody asked me aren’t we done, isn’t innovation in radiation oncology done and I can tell you profoundly no. We see a huge opportunity for innovation in oncology and those innovations will affect all ends of the market. So obviously there are innovations that will reflect on the high end of the market, it gives us a lot of advantage there in terms of clinical outcomes.
When you look at this big international market potential that I have talked about the truth is the international market wants some solutions that have been sort of created with them in mind in terms of throughput and cost per patient and special features and technologies and things that will really make the international markets happier. So we don’t want to just take the U.S. market and thrust it on international markets and expect that the majority of people will want that. So we’re going to spend a lot of money making products that sing and dance the way our Asian customers would like them to sing and dance and we’re going to continue to create products that we think bring a great deal of fascination to our customers.
I’ll also say a stereotactic radiation is going to be very important in our future. Hypofraction products that do a really good job at hypo fractionated radiation therapy they are going to be important. We announced some technology related to MR guidance this last quarter. I just think we just have a tremendous opportunity for innovation going forward.

The people who are using TrueBeam are using it for all of the indications. We’re seeing a lot more stereotactic body radiation therapy being studied by our customers because of the Gated RapidArc capability and the high speed or the high dose delivery, and so I think we’re just seeing a lot more interest in lung. We’ve also had people come in and talk to us. Obviously, you would expect brain, but lung, we’ve seen additional interest and of course that’s one of the places that we’re aiming at is to produce a product that we will be much better at the lung. Also, some interest in pancreas. Pancreatic cancer is not a cancer with a high survival rate, but it may be that there is a significant subset of patients who have pancreatic cancer that could be positively affected.
Also, I would say liver I think we’re seeing some people be interested in that. And then non-cancerous diseases, I think there is a huge potential opportunity for diseases outside of cancer. So, there are so many targets of opportunity here. It’s sometimes difficult to know exactly where to start, so that’s one of the reasons for that heavy R&D spend that we’re making going forward is we trying to take advantage of as many of these opportunities as we can.
But across the board, I don’t see any indication where I haven’t seen TrueBeam being used that’s traditional for us, but I think where we are targeting soft tissue that’s in motion during the treatment, TrueBeam brings a lot of special tools to that capabilities. I think 90% of our users have reported that TrueBeam is in use for stereotactic applications.

TrueBeam is going to continue to have a big impact, and probably an even bigger impact going forward.
As I indicated early we have a number of new products down the line that I think will stimulate the North American market. So, there are so many factors affecting the North American market that it’s hard to predict what just one of them will do. My optimism is pretty good for the U.S. market for 2011.

Thanks for joining me in our First Quarter Fiscal 2010 Conference Call. Today, we are reporting 6% growth in revenues, solid gains in our gross and operating margins and a 13% increase in earnings per diluted share from continuing operations. 
Net orders for the company would've grown 1% excluding the reversal of a $62 million Proton Therapy order, including this reversal net orders fell 10%. Net orders increased in both our Oncology Systems and X-ray Products businesses on the strength of their international markets. Despite the Proton reversal, our total company backlog grew 4%. Given these results, we have elected to raise our guidance for the fiscal year. But before getting to guidance, I'll focus on market and operational activity during the quarter and let Elisha give you some color on the numbers.
Oncology Systems' first quarter net orders grew by 2% to $437 million, which was nice to see after a decline in the fourth quarter. Net orders rose 19% in international markets with double-digit gains in Asia and Europe, while orders fell 13% in North America with declines for both hospitals and freestanding clinics. We start by focusing on the international markets, which accounted for more than 55% of the Oncology orders during the period.
Both Asia and Europe had strong growth helped somewhat by a weaker dollar. Asia's growth was led by the trio of Japan, China and India. In Japan, we benefited from a government stimulus package to enhance cancer treatment capabilities. In China and India, demand was strong for high-performance machines, and we saw a greater interest in our units for more affordable care as well.
The star in Europe was Germany, where orders more than tripled with activity in private as well as public centers. In all of these markets, we're seeing healthcare systems expanding their radiotherapy and radiosurgery infrastructure to better serve their growing cancer patient populations.
In North America, we are seeing early signs of renewed interest among freestanding clinics. However, hospitals are still constrained by tightened annual capital spending budgets established last year in response to the recession and concerns about healthcare reform.
As hospital balance sheets improve, we hope to see a higher capital spending budgets and a resumption of more normal purchasing patterns. In all of the markets, the interest in our products and technology remains very high. Continued demand for our RapidArc product also contributed to Oncology's growth. And as of the end of the quarter, we had installed more than 340 systems. RapidArc is far and away to clear market standard for fast image-guided IMRT.
In the quarter, we saw a richer mix of orders for high-energy Trilogy and Novalis Tx machines capable of delivering stereotactic radiosurgery and traditional radiotherapy centers. We expect that radiosurgery is on its way to becoming a standard offering in radiation oncology facilities. We also received our second order, this one from India, for our new cost competitive UNIQUE accelerator for image-guided RapidArc treatments, and we are obtaining clearances to sell this machine in more international markets. Customer interest is strong and we expect this to be a very successful product.
BrachyTherapy product orders increased with the help of new, much faster treatment planning software, which uses an out rhythm that we are now incorporating into our Eclipse software for planning radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments. Despite very tough comps from the year-ago quarter, our Service business expanded nicely and it now represents a $500-million business annually. We are focused on achieving a higher contract capture rate among our install base with accelerators. And as a new data point, per UR [ph] install base now stands at more than 5,800 units with another 500 non-varying units within our service arena. These installations are split evenly between the North American and international markets.
Let me take a moment to address our position relative to competitors. Looking backward over the fiscal year, we believe that both Elekta and Varian gained share at the expense of other competitors. At the end of the day, though, this isn't about beating competitors, it's about beating cancer with better and better products to deliver fast and affordable life-saving treatments, that's our focus.
Turning to our X-Ray Products businesses, we passed a major milestone during the quarter as orders for our digital imaging detectors exceeded two borders for the first time and helped to grow X-ray's total net orders for the quarter by 9% to $99 million. This product mix shift was a prime contributor to improve margins for this business during the quarter.
Moving to digital image detectors has resulted in the continued expansion of the X-ray business and has helped the insulators from a harsh market environment that is hurting imaging equipment manufacturers, particularly in North America. We talked in the past about being uniquely equipped to offer customers special packages, paring tubes and detectors, that are optimized for digital X-ray imaging.
We landed another significant deal like this during the quarter, a $7 million order from an equipment manufacturer in China. It was among more than $15 million in detector orders from several new customers in Asia and Europe that contributed to the gains made by this business during the quarter.
From a geographic perspective, the X-ray Products order gross stand exclusively from international markets, especially Asia. As I indicated a moment ago, North America has been tough for everybody, including us. Orders in this region were down particularly from Mammography Tubes and detectors for dental and veterinary imaging systems. Our focus now is on segments and customers that are doing well in this market, and we believe we can continue to benefit from equipment manufacturers' ongoing rollout, a film with X-ray imaging systems which speed the imaging process and lower the cost per procedure.
In our Other business category, including our SIP, Security and Inspection Products business, our Particle Therapy business and our Ginzton Technology Center, combined net orders for the quarter declined $73 million to a negative $40 million, primarily because of the reversal of a $62 million proton order for Skandionkliniken in Sweden. We also had a $10 million decline in orders for our SIP business which had an unusually strong first quarter in the last year.
As most of you know, from our earlier 8-K filings during the quarter, Skandionkliniken canceled its proton order, following a successful core challenge to its public tender process. We are prepared to respond to a new public tender with hopes of being selected again for this project. We have great confidence in the suitability of our Particle Therapy and pencil beam scanning technology for this and other proton center projects around the world.
As an example, we reached a major milestone with this technology in December when we successfully commissioned the second treatment gantry at the RPTC [Rinecker Proton Therapy Center] proton center in Munich. More than 80 patients have been treated at the clinic to date and more patients are currently undergoing treatment. The clinical implementation of a second gantry is enabling RPTC to double its treatment capacity.
We are excited about the growth prospects for this business and we are in active discussions with several groups who are planning to open Proton Therapy centers in various sites around the world. We're continuing to gain for two or more proton orders per year.
The slightest flow for this quarter, our SIP business, continues to have a healthy pipeline and good opportunities for growth. Our biggest challenge in this business is dealing with its lumpiness, as governments around the world move to deploy this technology and fit some starts. It is clear, however, that there is a concerted and ongoing effort to improve security of ports and borders, and we're confident that our technology will play a key role in this endeavor.
We are concentrating on providing security customers with superior value in terms of smaller, lighter components and systems that deliver higher image quality, as well as faster imaging and analysis for automatic detection. For example, the materials discrimination technology that we developed is now included in about 80% of the products we sell, for cargo and for the security. We expect that this development work will enable Varian to deploy security products in a broader array of fixed and mobile systems, as well as applications including screening air cargo.
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha for a review of the numbers, and then I'll come back to you with our outlook for the second quarter and for the full fiscal 2010."

As usual, I will walk you through the income statement, as well as cover a few balance sheet items. First quarter revenues of $541 million increased 6%. Oncology Systems posted an increase of 8%, X-ray Products posted a gain of 6% and revenues from businesses under the Other category decreased by $5 million or 20%. In constant currency, total company revenues increased 3% from the year-ago quarter as a result of a weaker dollar.
The first quarter gross margin for the company rose 1.5 points to 44.6%. Strong gains in Oncology Systems and X-Ray Products gross margins were partially offset by sharp declines among businesses and the Other category. Oncology Systems gross margin increased nearly three points to 46.5%, due primarily to cost control initiatives that improved margins across our product lines and a higher mix of software and service revenue. X-Ray Products gross margin rose 1 point to 41.2%, due to the higher mix of digital detectors.
First quarter SG&A expenses were $84 million or 15% of revenue, a 1 point improvement from the year-ago quarter as a result of tight cost controls. First quarter R&D expenses were $38 million or 7% of revenue, nearly even with the year-ago quarter as a percentage of revenue.
Moving down the income statement, first quarter operating earnings rose 21% to $119 million or 22% of revenue, up about 2.5 points. Depreciation and amortization totaled $12 million for the quarter. Net interest expense for the quarter was $300,000. The effective tax rate was 33.7% for the quarter, up more than three points from the year-ago quarter when we benefited from discrete items including a reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. For fiscal year 2010, we continue to estimate the tax rate will be 31% to 32%. Fully diluted shares outstanding were approximately 125 million at the end of the quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 13% to $0.63.
Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $625 million, that's a $37 million and stockholders' equity of $1.4 billion. DSO or days sales outstanding for the quarter was 84 days, up one day from the year-ago quarter and up three days from the prior fourth quarter. First quarter cash flow from operations was $131 million, with most of it coming from net earnings and strong AR [ Accounts Receivable ] collections. Primary uses of cash were $55 million to repurchase $1.3 million shares of stock under our repurchase program and $8 million for capital expenditures.
Now, I'll turn it back over to Tim for the outlook."

People were operating on budgets that have been established in the previous year. So we expected that we would have some difficulty there. We are seeing renewed signs of interest in the freestanding clinics, and we're hopeful that, that will turn into more and more business for us as the year goes on.
In hospitals, they're still operating off a budget they set last year. We need to see those budgets gradually weighted in the new budgets. They're going to do that as they look at their balance sheets, and their balance sheets are looking a lot better now than they were looking when they made these budgets a year ago. So I'm hoping that as I look at those balance sheets and as they get pressure from clinicians and their operations to upgrade their equipment and to adopt more modern equipment to replace aging equipment that they will start to budget more. We didn't see that in the first quarter, we didn't expect to see it in the first quarter, but we're hoping that we will see it more and more as the year goes on.
And to remind you, we still have an aging base. That aging got a lot worse during the year because there wasn't as much buying, and so I think the pressure to replace that aging equipment may be as high now as it will ever be. And I'll also add that there was concern during the year about what healthcare reform would be, and I think those concerns are probably not as great now as they might have been for hospitals. And although that situation is probably not over and certainly could come up again, I think that hospitals prepared in 2009 for whatever might be coming in 2010 and that preparation is now built in to their budgets. And I think that, as I say, the balance sheets are stronger, and I think their behavior will be more normal next year than what we saw in 2009."

I mean, if you were to strip out the proton order in Q4 backlog, it's up 7% quarter-over-quarter, which is very much in line with the revenue guidance for the year. Orders that we currently are getting have less impact on fiscal year '10 and more impact on fiscal year '11. So as we start to accelerate throughout fiscal year '10, as Tim talked about, that would be reflected in next year's guidance more than this year, just given the fact that the average time in backlog is 12 to 18 months.
Again, we had significant currency help in the first quarter. We averaged about 1.48% on the euro and in the first quarter, today, we're sitting at about 1.40%. So, obviously, we tempered our expectations on the dollar a little bit and reflect it in the guidance as well."

So by introducing new products and new technologies and having a number of superior offerings, overall, I think we've been able to do okay. And that's why you see the gross margins to be as strong as they are. I think that our strategy for prevailing in these kinds of situations has been working out for us.

In other words, we're people who want to have a machine that can only do radiosurgery, and that's a much smaller portion of the market. The hybrid piece is much, much larger and that's the piece where we compete. And I think we're doing very well there, as I recall, we had a very large number of Trilogy and Novalis business this quarter so we're doing well.
We know, we ultimately believe that every radiation therapy department is kind of want to have the ability to do radiosurgery, and are going to want to buy the technology that it takes to do that. And it may not be more than one machine, but we think that everybody's going to want to be able to ultimately do this as a part of what they do.
That being said, there is a market for people who make machines that are specific only to radiosurgery. Our machines obviously can do radiosurgery very fast and very successfully for people who want to have that. And so our machine can be used as a special machine, but by its very nature, it's a machine that can do both special and general radiation therapy which gives it an advantage in a lot of those situations.
In terms of the overall market size, I'm not sure that I've sized it recently, but obviously, I think if you had all the players together, it's probably $500 million piece of the market. But the difficulty is that when you just look at the hybrid market since those machines are being bought for general radiation therapy as well as specific, I'm not sure how you would separate those two markets from each other and it's probably inappropriate to do so.

We think -- I will tell you that we put safety first, you can't get good outcomes without having good safety. We put safety first and we always have, and we offer extensive training in our Varian facility. In Las Vegas, we go out and do seminars in the world on to use our products right and we bring in world-class experts to do that. And so we're going to always continue to put patient safety first.
In terms of what added regulation we might see, it's hard to say, I think that all of us are interested at the society, the ASTRO, the ACR, the ACRO, ASRT and the AMPO are all very interested in seeing safety be a high priority for them. And I expect that the first thing we're going to see is that those organizations work with their membership and work with manufacturers to ask what can be done.
I think, they were already heavily regulated. Anybody who thinks that the FDA isn't incredibly scrupulous has never been visited by the FDA because they are tough and they are very scrupulous in terms of their behavior.

Thanks for joining me in our First Quarter Fiscal 2010 Conference Call. Today, we are reporting 6% growth in revenues, solid gains in our gross and operating margins and a 13% increase in earnings per diluted share from continuing operations. 
Net orders for the company would've grown 1% excluding the reversal of a $62 million Proton Therapy order, including this reversal net orders fell 10%. Net orders increased in both our Oncology Systems and X-ray Products businesses on the strength of their international markets. Despite the Proton reversal, our total company backlog grew 4%. Given these results, we have elected to raise our guidance for the fiscal year. But before getting to guidance, I'll focus on market and operational activity during the quarter and let Elisha give you some color on the numbers.
Oncology Systems' first quarter net orders grew by 2% to $437 million, which was nice to see after a decline in the fourth quarter. Net orders rose 19% in international markets with double-digit gains in Asia and Europe, while orders fell 13% in North America with declines for both hospitals and freestanding clinics. We start by focusing on the international markets, which accounted for more than 55% of the Oncology orders during the period.
Both Asia and Europe had strong growth helped somewhat by a weaker dollar. Asia's growth was led by the trio of Japan, China and India. In Japan, we benefited from a government stimulus package to enhance cancer treatment capabilities. In China and India, demand was strong for high-performance machines, and we saw a greater interest in our units for more affordable care as well.
The star in Europe was Germany, where orders more than tripled with activity in private as well as public centers. In all of these markets, we're seeing healthcare systems expanding their radiotherapy and radiosurgery infrastructure to better serve their growing cancer patient populations.
In North America, we are seeing early signs of renewed interest among freestanding clinics. However, hospitals are still constrained by tightened annual capital spending budgets established last year in response to the recession and concerns about healthcare reform.
As hospital balance sheets improve, we hope to see a higher capital spending budgets and a resumption of more normal purchasing patterns. In all of the markets, the interest in our products and technology remains very high. Continued demand for our RapidArc product also contributed to Oncology's growth. And as of the end of the quarter, we had installed more than 340 systems. RapidArc is far and away to clear market standard for fast image-guided IMRT.
In the quarter, we saw a richer mix of orders for high-energy Trilogy and Novalis Tx machines capable of delivering stereotactic radiosurgery and traditional radiotherapy centers. We expect that radiosurgery is on its way to becoming a standard offering in radiation oncology facilities. We also received our second order, this one from India, for our new cost competitive UNIQUE accelerator for image-guided RapidArc treatments, and we are obtaining clearances to sell this machine in more international markets. Customer interest is strong and we expect this to be a very successful product.
BrachyTherapy product orders increased with the help of new, much faster treatment planning software, which uses an out rhythm that we are now incorporating into our Eclipse software for planning radiotherapy and radiosurgery treatments. Despite very tough comps from the year-ago quarter, our Service business expanded nicely and it now represents a $500-million business annually. We are focused on achieving a higher contract capture rate among our install base with accelerators. And as a new data point, per UR [ph] install base now stands at more than 5,800 units with another 500 non-varying units within our service arena. These installations are split evenly between the North American and international markets.
Let me take a moment to address our position relative to competitors. Looking backward over the fiscal year, we believe that both Elekta and Varian gained share at the expense of other competitors. At the end of the day, though, this isn't about beating competitors, it's about beating cancer with better and better products to deliver fast and affordable life-saving treatments, that's our focus.
Turning to our X-Ray Products businesses, we passed a major milestone during the quarter as orders for our digital imaging detectors exceeded two borders for the first time and helped to grow X-ray's total net orders for the quarter by 9% to $99 million. This product mix shift was a prime contributor to improve margins for this business during the quarter.
Moving to digital image detectors has resulted in the continued expansion of the X-ray business and has helped the insulators from a harsh market environment that is hurting imaging equipment manufacturers, particularly in North America. We talked in the past about being uniquely equipped to offer customers special packages, paring tubes and detectors, that are optimized for digital X-ray imaging.
We landed another significant deal like this during the quarter, a $7 million order from an equipment manufacturer in China. It was among more than $15 million in detector orders from several new customers in Asia and Europe that contributed to the gains made by this business during the quarter.
From a geographic perspective, the X-ray Products order gross stand exclusively from international markets, especially Asia. As I indicated a moment ago, North America has been tough for everybody, including us. Orders in this region were down particularly from Mammography Tubes and detectors for dental and veterinary imaging systems. Our focus now is on segments and customers that are doing well in this market, and we believe we can continue to benefit from equipment manufacturers' ongoing rollout, a film with X-ray imaging systems which speed the imaging process and lower the cost per procedure.
In our Other business category, including our SIP, Security and Inspection Products business, our Particle Therapy business and our Ginzton Technology Center, combined net orders for the quarter declined $73 million to a negative $40 million, primarily because of the reversal of a $62 million proton order for Skandionkliniken in Sweden. We also had a $10 million decline in orders for our SIP business which had an unusually strong first quarter in the last year.
As most of you know, from our earlier 8-K filings during the quarter, Skandionkliniken canceled its proton order, following a successful core challenge to its public tender process. We are prepared to respond to a new public tender with hopes of being selected again for this project. We have great confidence in the suitability of our Particle Therapy and pencil beam scanning technology for this and other proton center projects around the world.
As an example, we reached a major milestone with this technology in December when we successfully commissioned the second treatment gantry at the RPTC [Rinecker Proton Therapy Center] proton center in Munich. More than 80 patients have been treated at the clinic to date and more patients are currently undergoing treatment. The clinical implementation of a second gantry is enabling RPTC to double its treatment capacity.
We are excited about the growth prospects for this business and we are in active discussions with several groups who are planning to open Proton Therapy centers in various sites around the world. We're continuing to gain for two or more proton orders per year.
The slightest flow for this quarter, our SIP business, continues to have a healthy pipeline and good opportunities for growth. Our biggest challenge in this business is dealing with its lumpiness, as governments around the world move to deploy this technology and fit some starts. It is clear, however, that there is a concerted and ongoing effort to improve security of ports and borders, and we're confident that our technology will play a key role in this endeavor.
We are concentrating on providing security customers with superior value in terms of smaller, lighter components and systems that deliver higher image quality, as well as faster imaging and analysis for automatic detection. For example, the materials discrimination technology that we developed is now included in about 80% of the products we sell, for cargo and for the security. We expect that this development work will enable Varian to deploy security products in a broader array of fixed and mobile systems, as well as applications including screening air cargo.
Now I'll turn it over to Elisha for a review of the numbers, and then I'll come back to you with our outlook for the second quarter and for the full fiscal 2010."

As usual, I will walk you through the income statement, as well as cover a few balance sheet items. First quarter revenues of $541 million increased 6%. Oncology Systems posted an increase of 8%, X-ray Products posted a gain of 6% and revenues from businesses under the Other category decreased by $5 million or 20%. In constant currency, total company revenues increased 3% from the year-ago quarter as a result of a weaker dollar.
The first quarter gross margin for the company rose 1.5 points to 44.6%. Strong gains in Oncology Systems and X-Ray Products gross margins were partially offset by sharp declines among businesses and the Other category. Oncology Systems gross margin increased nearly three points to 46.5%, due primarily to cost control initiatives that improved margins across our product lines and a higher mix of software and service revenue. X-Ray Products gross margin rose 1 point to 41.2%, due to the higher mix of digital detectors.
First quarter SG&A expenses were $84 million or 15% of revenue, a 1 point improvement from the year-ago quarter as a result of tight cost controls. First quarter R&D expenses were $38 million or 7% of revenue, nearly even with the year-ago quarter as a percentage of revenue.
Moving down the income statement, first quarter operating earnings rose 21% to $119 million or 22% of revenue, up about 2.5 points. Depreciation and amortization totaled $12 million for the quarter. Net interest expense for the quarter was $300,000. The effective tax rate was 33.7% for the quarter, up more than three points from the year-ago quarter when we benefited from discrete items including a reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. For fiscal year 2010, we continue to estimate the tax rate will be 31% to 32%. Fully diluted shares outstanding were approximately 125 million at the end of the quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations rose 13% to $0.63.
Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $625 million, that's a $37 million and stockholders' equity of $1.4 billion. DSO or days sales outstanding for the quarter was 84 days, up one day from the year-ago quarter and up three days from the prior fourth quarter. First quarter cash flow from operations was $131 million, with most of it coming from net earnings and strong AR [ Accounts Receivable ] collections. Primary uses of cash were $55 million to repurchase $1.3 million shares of stock under our repurchase program and $8 million for capital expenditures.
Now, I'll turn it back over to Tim for the outlook."

People were operating on budgets that have been established in the previous year. So we expected that we would have some difficulty there. We are seeing renewed signs of interest in the freestanding clinics, and we're hopeful that, that will turn into more and more business for us as the year goes on.
In hospitals, they're still operating off a budget they set last year. We need to see those budgets gradually weighted in the new budgets. They're going to do that as they look at their balance sheets, and their balance sheets are looking a lot better now than they were looking when they made these budgets a year ago. So I'm hoping that as I look at those balance sheets and as they get pressure from clinicians and their operations to upgrade their equipment and to adopt more modern equipment to replace aging equipment that they will start to budget more. We didn't see that in the first quarter, we didn't expect to see it in the first quarter, but we're hoping that we will see it more and more as the year goes on.
And to remind you, we still have an aging base. That aging got a lot worse during the year because there wasn't as much buying, and so I think the pressure to replace that aging equipment may be as high now as it will ever be. And I'll also add that there was concern during the year about what healthcare reform would be, and I think those concerns are probably not as great now as they might have been for hospitals. And although that situation is probably not over and certainly could come up again, I think that hospitals prepared in 2009 for whatever might be coming in 2010 and that preparation is now built in to their budgets. And I think that, as I say, the balance sheets are stronger, and I think their behavior will be more normal next year than what we saw in 2009."

So we saw some behavior change in the first quarter, but there wasn't enough time in the first quarter for them to react. But, as I say, the conversations that we had were a lot warmer and fuzzier.

Again, we had significant currency help in the first quarter. We averaged about 1.48% on the euro and in the first quarter, today, we're sitting at about 1.40%. So, obviously, we tempered our expectations on the dollar a little bit and reflect it in the guidance as well."

We know, we ultimately believe that every radiation therapy department is kind of want to have the ability to do radiosurgery, and are going to want to buy the technology that it takes to do that. And it may not be more than one machine, but we think that everybody's going to want to be able to ultimately do this as a part of what they do.
That being said, there is a market for people who make machines that are specific only to radiosurgery. Our machines obviously can do radiosurgery very fast and very successfully for people who want to have that. And so our machine can be used as a special machine, but by its very nature, it's a machine that can do both special and general radiation therapy which gives it an advantage in a lot of those situations.

We think -- I will tell you that we put safety first, you can't get good outcomes without having good safety. We put safety first and we always have, and we offer extensive training in our Varian facility. In Las Vegas, we go out and do seminars in the world on to use our products right and we bring in world-class experts to do that. And so we're going to always continue to put patient safety first.
In terms of what added regulation we might see, it's hard to say, I think that all of us are interested at the society, the ASTRO, the ACR, the ACRO, ASRT and the AMPO are all very interested in seeing safety be a high priority for them. And I expect that the first thing we're going to see is that those organizations work with their membership and work with manufacturers to ask what can be done.
I think, they were already heavily regulated. Anybody who thinks that the FDA isn't incredibly scrupulous has never been visited by the FDA because they are tough and they are very scrupulous in terms of their behavior. So hopefully, the lesson learned in all of this is that all of us will work together, and the societies and industry to create a better climate for patient safety."

We brought our product to market, it was ready to go. We've done a lot of work to get ready. Our competitors are starting to come out with their offerings and we'll get a better look at them over time to make the comparison. So far, our customers are calling me and telling me they still like our offering and they still think it's a superior offering which is good to hear.
I will also say that we're a moving target. We're going to introduce new versions of RapidArc and those new versions of RapidArc offer new features. So we're not sitting still, we're not resting on our laurels, we're going to come out with new stuff that I think moves the bar ever higher. So we have an edge there, that edge has helped us in gross margin. I think that edge has helped us be competitive and we'll continue to move forward and stay as far ahead in this race as we can."
