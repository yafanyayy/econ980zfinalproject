32854,83354148,49626,"Pepsico, Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2010",2010-02-11,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. This morning I want to briefly recap our financial and operating performance in 2009 and how we have positioned ourselves for a strong 2010. Then I'll give you an update on the bottling transactions which we now h",2155,"Thanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. This morning I want to briefly recap our financial and operating performance in 2009 and how we have positioned ourselves for a strong 2010. Then I'll give you an update on the bottling transactions which we now hope to close by the end of February. And then give you a glimpse of some of the topics we will cover at our analyst meeting next month.Starting with a look at 2009. I must say that I'm very pleased with our team's performance. We delivered balanced top- and bottom-line growth in our operating divisions and our EPS growth was right in line with our guidance. We grew net revenue by 5%. We grew division operating profit by 6%. And we increased our gross margins and operating margins in spite of significant commodity inflation.In fact, operating margins increased in all of our segments. We increased our management operating cash flow excluding certain items by 16%. And we did this while consciously investing in areas that are critical to sustaining our growth, capacity infrastructure, innovation and people in key emerging markets, expenditures for R&D, expanding our global SAP footprint, increased marketplace spending despite significant media deflation and meeting our sustainability commitments.Our teams were able to deliver these impressive results by frankly doing what PepsiCo has always been known for: Great products, great operations and consistent execution in the marketplace. They provide a differentiated and innovative value. They leverage the benefits of our strong and flexible go-to-market system and they maintain financial discipline while investing for future growth. And they did all of this in the context of year [ph] in which there were huge macroeconomic challenges across much of the globe. Consumers in North America, Western Europe and Eastern Europe was particularly hit by rapidly increasing unemployment rates. We did a terrific job of adapting to the macros in these markets, which enabled us to sustain consumer momentum and maintain market share. Importantly, we continue to have high growth in the many markets in Asia, the Middle East and parts of Latin America where the macros are more favorable.Net-net, I'm very proud of how our team has navigated the year. Subsequent Americas Foods records another exceptional year with net revenue, up 7% and operating profit, up 8%. Frito-Lay's performance was particularly noteworthy. It increased volume, gained share and delivered another seven-percentage-point increase in operating profit despite having to take up prices as a result of higher commodity costs. Our business in Latin America delivered similarly impressive results with double-digit gains in net revenue and operating profit on top of similar gains the previous year. And we gained or held share in virtually every market across the region.In a very difficult macroeconomic environment, our European business outperformed peer companies and delivered double-digit gains in net revenue and operating profit growth and high single-digit operating profit growth excluding acquisitions. We did this through outstanding productivity improvement, tight cost controls and sustaining consumer engagement by creating relevant price points which allowed us to maintain or grow share in most of the markets in which we operate.In Asia, Middle East and Africa, we had a tremendous year with strong volume growth, particularly in India, and double-digit net revenue and operating profit growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. And we made additional investments in our business, particularly in Q4, in order to better take advantage of the huge growth opportunity in key emerging markets.In PepsiCo Americas Beverages, I am very pleased to report that we have continue to gain traction against the restaging of our business. And the combination of progress is made against key initiatives, significant productivity gains and a disciplined approach to pursuing only profitable volume enabled PAB to post a 10% increase in operating profit in the fourth quarter.These results demonstrate that the underlying trends in our businesses are healthy. As I noted earlier, we also made investments to boost capabilities and infrastructure that will further strengthen our competitive advantage in 2010 and beyond, which brings me to perhaps the most significant action we took in 2009 to enhance our position in the marketplace. The pending acquisition of our anchor bottlers. We believe this move will truly change the rules of the game for the LRB category in North America. The merger consolidates more than 80% of the North American beverage make-sell deliver system into one business unit. We will use our new integrated structure to increase fee to market flexibility and execution and efficiency across the entire value chain. This combination will enable us to bring a wide variety of new products to market faster including emerging brands suggested in the early stages of development. And we will service our retail customers even more efficiently and effectively, taking PepsiCo's Power of One to the next level, a major competitive advantage.We hope to close the transactions by the end of February. Integration plans are ready to go. Leadership is in place and our teams are excited. The financing is in place and the shareholders vote on February 17. We look forward to giving you an in-depth view our plans for new PepsiCo Americas Beverages at our investor meetings in March.So now let me turn to 2010 and beyond. In terms of GDP growth around the world, it looks like 2010 is going to be a bit better than 2009 with economists projecting growth in most developed market and with continued strong growth in key markets in Asia and the Middle East. At the same time, most estimates are showing very little relief in the high unemployment rate that many developed countries are experiencing. Certainly, the unemployment numbers as we enter 2010 are still very high and we'll therefore likely to still see a conscious consumer in many developed markets.You know one of the barometers of sustainable consumer growth is C-store traffic. And unfortunately, the recent data indicates that C-store trips continue to be down 8% to 10%. And as one economist said, we may be seeing a statistical recovery but a human recession. So given this economic uncertainty, we decided to take a very pragmatic and prudent approach to our planning for 2010, maintaining the right value equation for consumers in these markets while simultaneously placing increased emphasis on product differentiation and relevant innovation.Where the macros are favorable, we will continue to expand our businesses ahead of category growth. So given this economic outlook for 2010, our planning assumption is that our base PepsiCo constant currency core EPS will grow about 8% to 9%. Assuming the bottling transactions close at the end of February, the constant currency core EPS growth for this new, nearly $60 billion company is expected to be 11% to 13%. Now as we indicated last year, we will be taking advantage of the financial benefits of this merger not only to step change on North American Beverage business and augment our positions in Eastern Europe but also to make strategic investments that will sustain our momentum well into the future. Richard will work you through the financial details, but you should expect that we'll be reinvesting about $0.08 a share. We will talk at length about these investments in our March investor conference. But the key investment categories are: Accelerated infrastructure investments in key emerging countries; expansion of our good-for-you platforms and the development of breakthrough product; stepping up our investment and renovating our core product; launching of new innovations in our North American Beverage business; and innovative, sustainability initiatives. You should be assured that all of our investments are subject to a thorough stage gate review process to ensure that each investment will yield an appropriate sustainable return. And all of these activity in 2010 is within the context of six key strategies that will define the trajectory of our company for the next three to  five years. The first is expanding our global leadership in macro snacks. We are the global leader in macro snacks with the number one savory category market share position in virtually every key market in the world. We have an advantage position across the entire value chain. And we plan to leverage every one of our structural advantages to capitalize on the huge growth opportunities that are still available to us around the world. First, we'll continue to grow our current businesses in developed market into a far greater extent in developing markets where per-caps are still low and where we have significant room for innovative new platforms. Second, we will extend our reach into new markets both organically as we've done over the past couple of years in Pakistan and Vietnam or through targeted acquisitions, as we did recently in the Balkans. And then we will continue to expand into adjacent categories.  Third and more importantly, we will continue to make our core snacks healthier through innovations in heart-healthy oil, sodium reduction and the addition of whole grain nuts and seeds. So that's our strategy to expand our global leadership in macro snacks.The second key strategy to ensure sustainable profitable growth in global beverages. In North America, the game-changing bottler transaction plus the actions we are taking to refresh our brands across the entire beverage category will enable us to accelerate top line growth and also improve our profitability. Internationally, it continues to be significant areas of growth, particularly in developing markets and in emerging categories. We have carefully earmarked investments to take full advantage of those opportunities, looking to ensure that we're funding long-term growth that is both profitable and sustainable.The third strategy is to unleash the power of Power of One. This has been a promise that we will now race to an entirely new level. We are in a unique position with retailers across the globe because we can leverage two extraordinary consumer categories: Snacks and beverages. They are both high-velocity categories. Both generate retail traffic. Both are very profitable. But most importantly, both deliver exceptional cash flow for retailers. So we will increasingly leverage this portfolio through unique integrated offerings to create value for consumers and deliver greater topline growth for retailers.Equally importantly, we will also accelerate Power of One supply chain and back-office synergies in many markets to improve profitability and enhance customer service. And we will also extend the scale of our company to partner with other companies around the globe, as we have done recently with Anheuser-Busch in the United States for indirect procurement.The fourth leg of our strategy is to rapidly expand our good-for-you portfolio. PepsiCo currently has roughly a $10 billion core of good-for-you products which are anchored by Tropicana, Lebedyansky, Sandora and other juice brands, Aquafina, Quaker for grains, G Gatorade for athletes. And the new dairy joint venture we've with entered in to with Almarai. And along with that, we have several other local good-for-you products and brands. We will augment the organic growth of these platforms to an increasing stream of science-based innovations. Some of these new products and platforms will come from targeted acquisitions and from JVs, with the larger number will be generated through the R&D that we've been ramping up over the past couple of years and which we will continue to expand. There are huge opportunities in meeting consumer needs in nutritious beverages and snacks.Most importantly, with Tropicana and Quaker, we own two of the top-five good-for-you food and beverage brands in the world, the other three being brands owned by European companies. And with Gatorade, we own the number two brand for athletes behind Nike, With this unbelievable brand platform, our stepped-up R&D capabilities and a $10 billion core good-for-you revenue base, I feel we have a great platform to expand Nutrition business from and I feel very good about our prospects here.The fifth leg of the strategy is to continue to deliver on our environmental sustainability goals and commitments. Our businesses around the world are implementing innovative approaches to be significant and more efficient in the use of land, energy, water and packaging. And we're actively working with the communities in which we operate to be responsive to their resources.And the sixth and the last is leg is the development of leadership to sustain our growth. We have an extraordinary talents base across our global organization, in manufacturing and sales and distribution, our marketing growth, our staff functions and with all our general managers. Many of you have been out to our markets and have seen this first hand. As we expand our businesses, we're placing heightened focus on developing the leadership talent, capabilities and experience necessary to grow our businesses well into the future. And when appropriate, we will augment and refresh our talent base with selective external hiring. You will hear much more about these strategies next month and get the opportunity to spend more time with the leaders from around the world who will bring all of this life.  So with that, let me turn the call over to Richard."
32854,83354148,49626,"Pepsico, Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2010",2010-02-11,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Indra. In 2009, our portfolio delivered line-of-business profitability that was very close to historical trends in constant currency. Despite undertaking a significant refresh of our North American Beverage business and despite operating in the mo",3309,"Thanks, Indra. In 2009, our portfolio delivered line-of-business profitability that was very close to historical trends in constant currency. Despite undertaking a significant refresh of our North American Beverage business and despite operating in the most challenging macroeconomic environment in decades. We continue to see strong performance across more [ph] called Worldwide Snacks businesses as well as in our International Beverage businesses. And our North American Beverage business improved sequentially through the year culminating in a return to operating profit growth in the fourth quarter. As Indra mentioned, for the full year 2009, net revenue grew 5%, division operating profit and EPS each grew 6% and management operating cash flow which grew by 16% excluding certain items was well ahead of our target. It's important to note that we achieved these results without our typical below-the-line leverage including share buyback from bottler share sales which cost us about 300 basis points of EPS growth for the year.Now let me turn to each operating division. PepsiCo Americas Foods delivered strong results in 2009, generating 7% net revenue growth and 8% operating profit growth for the year. And despite facing significant commodity inflation, a pressured consumer and challenging macros in these markets, PAF held or grew operating margin in every one of its businesses.Frito-Lay North America was the fastest growing CPG company in measured channels during 2009. And it also expanded its dollar share lead in the savory category. For the full year, Frito delivered 6% increase in net revenue and a 7% increase in operating profit, making it the fourth consecutive year of 7% operating profit growth.As expected, in Q4, Fritos revenue and operating profit growth rates were adversely impacted by the overlap of the very significant pricing actions the business took in the fourth quarter of 2008, which was why net revenue grew 2% and operating profit grew 4%. The business did an excellent job managing product mix and cost, which allowed them to expand margins in the quarter. And FLNA continued to deliver value and product innovation to pressured consumers in differentiated ways. For example, in the quarter, Frito increased its focus on the store perimeter with its $2 value line. In recognizing that cash-strapped consumers are more price sensitive at the end of the month, it increased its promotional pricing at the end of the month on popular products like Fritos and Cheetos. From a product innovation perspective, in the fourth quarter Frito completed the conversion of its Tostitos line to whole grains and it also strengthened its portfolios of Hispanic products with the successful introduction of Rancho Ritos and Tostitos Salsa Verde. Key product offerings were strong for the year. Lays posted volume and value share gains driven by strong in-store execution and by the popular Lays local campaign.  Other products that performed well included Stacy's Pita Chips which gained value and volume share and dips in multipack products.Looking at 2010, Frito will have a lot of exciting innovation and product moves. Building on the strength of its core portfolio, we will launch a line of Lays regional flavors and we'll also introduce Lays Kettle with natural flavors. And as a part of its effort to continue to lead the industry in healthy and affordable snacking, Frito will add more whole grains to its Tostitos line and more fiber to its sun chips line. And we'll be placing increased emphasis on reduced sodium products.Let me turn to Frito's algorithm for 2010. There is no doubt that Frito will benefit from input cost deflation this year. And this means we expect profit growth in 2010 will be higher than in 2009. To be very clear though, Frito will use some of the deflation benefit to reinvest back into the business, in infrastructure and in product and packaging innovation. For example, they will expand routes and increased rack penetration. They will also increase the whole grains and fiber in their products. And on Earth Day, we'll introduce the first fully compostable chip bag of its kind. These innovative bags which is proprietary technology are designed to fully decompose in about 14 weeks.At Latin America Foods, the teams delivered strong results in 2009 with net revenue up 10% and operating profit up 13% despite challenging macroeconomic conditions in many parts of the regions, including a 7% GDP contraction in Mexico. In the quarter, net revenue was also up 10% although operating profit was up just 3% as the business overlapped insurance settlements related to fire damage at a plant in Brazil. Excluding this settlement, operating profit growth in the quarter was in line with the full year trend demonstrating that the LAF businesses continue to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth. In Mexico in the quarter, our teams continued to navigate the challenging macros with tight cost control, productivity improvements and selective pricing to offset local commodity inflation.  Sabritas held its strong value share position and Gamesa grew value share, posting its higher share level since 2007.  And in South America, in the quarter, we posted double-digit gains in net revenue and operating profit. Brazil and Chile were particular bright spots in the quarter with double-digit increases in volume.Turning to PepsiCo American Beverages, 2009 net revenue declined 6% in the face of a challenging category in North America. And also reflecting our conscious decision to focus on profitable volume. However , PAB's performance improved steadily through the year culminating in the 10% increase in operating profit in the fourth quarter. The division's return to operating profit growth was driven by strong productivity and improving top line trends in NAB, as well as continued strong operating profit performance in Latin America. We continue to refresh our North America business and results to date indicate we are taking the right steps to position the business to grow its leadership position in North America.Key accomplishments in 2009 include gross margin expansion at NAB, resulting from successful cost management initiatives and very successful product innovation based on stevia, our all-natural zero-calorie sweetener. Trop50, which was the most successful new entrant in the chilled-juice category has reached nearly $100 million in sales. And SoBe Life Water increased volume more than 50%, driven by success of the terrific lineup of zero-calorie SoBe offerings. We're also very pleased with the traction we've achieved on Pepsi Refresh and on the transformation of G, which has seen improved brand equity scores with its core athletic users which is exactly where we want to be. And we're optimistic about our innovation in marketing calendar for 2010. To highlight just a few things. For brand Pepsi, we launched the Refresh Everything campaign which encourages individuals, businesses and nonprofits to do good in their communities by offering a series of grants from $5,000 up to $250,000. In the first 72 hours, the website received over a thousand proposals, evidence of how relevant this campaign is to consumers. If you haven't visited the website yet, please do, either to submit an idea or to vote: www.refresheverything.com.For Gatorade, we're introducing the G series, a full line of products supported by the latest science to provide fuel, fluids and nutrients before, during and after activity. And we're in the process of removing high fructose corn syrup from Gatorade and G2. These actions aligned with products more closely with the need of its target athletic consumer and we're excited about how we're positioning G in 2010 for future growth.And this year, Tropicana will launch Tropicana Juicy Rewards, a program similar to the successful Britricks [ph] program that Walkers has run in the U.K. Tropicana will work with local and national partners to deliver value in the form of over 20,000 discounted activities and services across the United States, including free admission to theme parks, free annual passes to national and state parks and discounts on Adidas products.  2010 will be a truly a historic year for our North American Beverage business and we are off to a good start. We look forward to sharing more details with you about the system integration at our investor meeting in March.Turning to PepsiCo International, the PI teams again delivered solid results. Our Europe business faced a challenging environment in 2009 particularly in Eastern Europe. But the teams delivered a 10% increase in net revenue and a 13% increase in operating profit and high single-digit operating profit growth excluding the impact of acquisitions. For the quarter, net revenue grew 4% and operating profit was up 7% as we started to lap the Lebedyansky acquisition which closed in the fourth quarter of 2008. To ensure market place competitiveness, the Europe team delivered differentiated value and drove broad-based productivity and cost control initiatives. These actions resulted in half a point of gross margin expansion for the year despite the top line impact of a weak consumer environment.In Europe, snacks, the 1% volume decline for the year entirely reflected the wage [ph] outs we took to offset modest commodity inflation.  A strength in the region has been Walkers in the U.K. It's consistent performance across the year was based on compelling promotional programs and relevant consumer engagement. Our Russia Snacks business also performed well, growing volume and value share in the quarter and also for the year.  In 2010, Europe Snacks will continue to restage its portfolio to respond to consumer needs for healer choices and more indulgent snacks including Lays sensations premium chip and Lay's gourmet chips with healthier oil, natural ingredients and reduced sodium.In Europe, Beverage business volume grew 3.5% for the year as CSD volume grew double digits in both the U.K. and Germany. In the quarter, we gained share across Western Europe including U.K., Spain and Germany. And we also gained significant share in Turkey.  In Russia, Lebedyansky gained volume and value share in juice for the quarter and for the year while expending margin despite ForEx and headwinds. In addition, incremental investments in sales infrastructure and value in the second half of the year help to drive share gains in Russia in colored [ph], teas and energy drinks in the fourth quarter.Plans for the PBG Pepsi America integration process are on track in Europe and you'll hear more from Zein Abdalla about our powerful European Food and Beverage business at the CAGNY conference next week.Turning now to EMEA, the business continues to perform very well. For the full year, net revenue grew 12% and operating profit grew 23%. The teams drove these results to an impressive innovation agenda coupled with value initiatives in key markets, while continuing with significant investments behind distribution and cold infrastructure in both China and India. Note that Q4 has historically been the smallest profit quarter for the division, about 10% or less of its total annual profit. And so the decline in profits this Q4 was entirely attributable to the planned step up and investment in developing markets.AMEA beverages volume grew 8% in the year, building on strong momentum in India. In both China and India, we gained almost two points of value share juice on the success of our locally relevant Tropicana, Pulp Sacs beverage in China and the Nimbooz lemon drink in India. We saw strong growth in most of our other markets across AMEA for the year, particularly in our non-carbonated offerings. And we gained volume and value share across the Middle East. We slightly lowered beverage volume of 5% in Q4, reflects the timing of Chinese New Year and a price increase in Saudi Arabia, the first we have taken 30 years. India posted another quarter of strong performance with beverage volume growth of 21%.Turning to Snacks, volume at AMEA grew 9% in 2009 with strong double-digit growth in many countries including India, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Taiwan and Pakistan. Our Quaker Oats brand continues to do particularly well in India and China as consumers respond to our heart-healthy messaging and price pack innovation. Snacks volume grew 13% in the quarter including four points of growth from acquisition, namely from our new dairy joint venture with Almarai in Jordan. In 2010, we will accelerate our strategic investments to expand our cold infrastructure, enhance our go-to-market system and support our innovations with increased advertising and marketing. Also critical to our longer-term success in the region, we gained agreement from the Chinese government to open 10 new plants across China.Now let me turn to an update of where we stand with the bottling acquisitions and guidance for 2010. As you know, the SEC has completed its review of the proxy materials that we have secured the required cash of more than $4 billion in bonds that we issued early in January. The shareholder votes on the transaction take place on February 17, and we hope to close by the end of February. With respect to the status of regulatory approvals, we continue to work with the FTC.Based on that closing date, we are targeting 11% to 13% core constant currency EPS growth, off of our fiscal 2009 core EPS of $3.71.As Indra indicated, this guidance reflects roughly eight to nine points of from base PepsiCo, that is including the impact of the bottler acquisition and certain strategic investments in our business. Note, we are talking with you today about base PepsiCo, because the bottler acquisitions have not close. Once they do close, we'll look out only about the new PepsiCo, which will include the impact of the acquisitions and strategic investments.Turning back to the algorithm. The incremental growth of our base PepsiCo reflects a combination of several elements; the financial leverage and accounting upside in this transaction itself which amount to about $0.15 a share, synergies for 10 months of about $125 million to $150 million or about $0.06 a share, partially offset by strategic investments of about $0.08 a share. Indra talked about the nature of these strategic investments and indicated that we would be discussing them in detail in our March investor meeting.I would like to spend a few minutes here, however, on the financial accretion and synergy. Most of you carefully reviewed our S-4 filing and in particular the pro forma financial, which showed that the transaction was about $0.22 accretive through three quarters of 2009. It is critical to understand however that these are reported numbers and some include the very significant tax benefits that PBG reported in 2009, which brought its tax rate down to less than 6%.In addition, the pro formas did not include the incremental interest cost related to the one-time $900 million payment we will be making to Dr. Pepper for distribution rights of their brands. Adjusting for these two items brings the leverage and accounting impact of the transaction in line with our $0.15 estimate for 2010.Moving on to synergies, as a result of our recent integration planning efforts, we are now estimating that we'll get $125 million to $150 million in synergies in 2010, and we expect this number will rise to about $400 million once fully implemented by 2012. That's about $100 million higher than our earlier estimates, and it is based on recent intensive growth that we have been doing jointly across PepsiCo, PAS and PBG. Some of the incremental synergies are additional cost-savings but the majority represent profits from top-line growth. Some of which will require incremental capital expenditures as well.For competitive reasons, I won't go into more detail on these but Eric Foss and Massimo d'Amore will be providing our comprehensive look at the plans for our newly integrated Beverage business during the investor meeting next month. But I do want to make clear however is that the year-over-year increases in synergies, from now through 2012, should enable PepsiCo to sustain higher growth levels over this period.Our EPS guidance for 2010 assumes a voluntary $600 million pension plan contribution as well as the resumption of share repurchases with a combination of about $5 billion. Repurchases will therefore be significantly above normal, reflecting catch up from 2009 when we were precluded from repurchasing shares because of the bottler transaction. However, please note that the leverage from these higher repurchase levels would be about  the same 1.5% to 2% that we would get from our normal level of share repurchases. That reflects a relatively high year-end 2009 diluted share count, which is due to last year's lack of share repurchases combined with option exercises during the year. Also note that the pension contribution has about the same accretive impact as the repurchases.We expect our full year 2010 core tax rate on stand-alone basis to be the same as 2009. The weighted average tax rate including the bottlers will be about 27% to 28%.Now let me touch  on the potential impact on the reported U.S. dollar results of ForEx and the devaluation in Venezuela. It's difficult in the current environment to forecast exchange rates. Just when we thought that there would be some greater level of predictability, we saw in early February significant appreciation in the U.S. dollar because of the events in Europe. We expect ForEx outside Venezuela will be a benefit whether it will be a 1%, or 2% or 3% tailwind is difficult to estimate. In Venezuela, there are two things going on. First, Venezuela will be accounted for into hyperinflationary accounting in 2010 and a functional currency of our Venezuelan entities will be changed from the bolivar to the U.S. dollar. In addition in mid-January, the Venezuelan government devalued the bolivar while resetting the official exchange rate from 2.1 bolivars per dollar to 4.3 for most transactions. We expect that the majority of our transactions will be conducted remeasured at the 4.3 exchange rate. We are still assessing all the impacts of these changes, but we expect that ForEx-related impacts from our core reported numbers will be about $0.10 to $0.12 a share. In addition, we expect to record a non-core one-time charge of about $125 million to net income in the first quarter of 2010, relating to the revaluation of our net monetary assets at the new exchange rate.Before I open it up to Q&A, I would like to touch on the shape of 2010 from a financial standpoint. Within our overall 11% to 13% core constant currency guidance, we expect that the first half of the year will be mid to high single-digit growth and the second half will be mid-teams growth. The lower both in the first half primarily reflects lapping of first half 2009 events that was above and below the line rather than any fundamental business issues.As I mentioned earlier, FLNA will be lapping last year's strong first quarter, primarily related to the significant pricing we took early last year. Latin America Foods and Beverages will be lapping the strong operating profit growth we generated in the first half of 2009, and some of our investments will take place in Q1 before we get the benefit of the transaction upsides.In addition, below the line, we will be seeing the impact of several factors: The lapping of last year's relatively low first-half tax rate, which were nearly 200 basis points lower in the first half than in the second; the incremental interest cost from the bond yield we did in January in anticipation of the closing of the bottler transactions; and no share leverage even excluding the deal for the first half of the year because of the relatively high starting share count, and because we will not begin repurchasing shares until the deal is closed.Net net, we are expecting a very good topline and bottom-line performance across our business in 2010. We will begin to unlock the synergies as well as the strategic benefits from our proposed bottler acquisition. And we will be making targeted investments in key markets and categories to sustain our growth in future years.With that, let me turn over the call to the operator for Q&A, and then Indra will close with some final remarks.

So on the one hand, you could see, looking at the numbers, there's room for uplift. But it's not just based on our performance, it's also based on the environment. So every quarter, we'll have a conversation with you. We'll see how this thing evolves. In terms of Power of One, in the past, you talk about Power of One strictly in terms of bundled offerings in the store. But I think there's so much more we can do to align merchandising efforts across beverages and snacks. Think about how to improve the service to customers by aligning our supply chain is even more closely with improve to speed, flexibility with which we respond to consumer requests. And the thing that's most exciting is that we can build up more health and wellness offering in a bundled way to the consumers. So we have a whole team that's working on this.

And so every time you grow, you have to get permission from the Chinese government. When we went into China, we had fewer plants that were approved for us versus from small competitor. So light off the bat, our positions are different. But now with all of these new plants that are being approved as Saad mentioned, four just approved and 10 additional to the 14 plants that are going in, we can now start expanding our footprint in China extremely rapidly. In addition, non-carbonated beverages, whether it's the Tropicana pulpy sac, whether it's the Chinese traditional medicine drinks we've launched, they're off to a good start. And I think the time has come now for us to significantly accelerate our investments in China and grow this business much more rapidly than we have been in the past. Because in a way, our hands are tied based on the permissions we had for the various townships that we wanted to put plants in. So we're looking at the period between 2010 and 2015 as the period of tremendous investment in China beverages. And the market's still growing in leaps and bounds. But what we have to be careful about is not doing anything irrational to get volume in one quarter or one period. We want to make sure we manage this business for sustainable growth and profitability over the next five years. That's what we're doing in beverages. In snacks, the market is wide open. The unbelievable thing in China is that it's a snacking culture. And they snack on many, many interesting items. And they like to rest on brands because they are market quality. So the whole game in China in snacks is, how do we bring our global brand portfolio, mark of safety and quality, take the fragmented Chinese snack market, provide it to the Chinese consumer in a convenient packaged way under our brands? And already, we're off to a good start with Lays and the Quaker brands. And they're going to add a lot more products under those umbrellas to grow the Snacks business. To us, that's a market that's wide open. It plays to our advantage because we know how to the sustainable agriculture. We've done great things with farmers in China. And we know how to develop these categories. That is our core strength. So as I said, 2010 forward is the big growth area for China, and we are very excited about China. I spent a couple of weeks in China this summer. It's optimized to the kinds of opportunities there. And this part of transaction gives us the breathing room to grow our brand truly step up our investments there. So the game's just beginning."

We feel comfortable. But I'm looking at the C-store traffic trend, and I think it would be much more prudent for us, especially given that we have a good U.S. business, to plan a little bit more conservatively for 2010. Accordingly, I say, let's make sure that we don't expect too much on the base not given our business, given the economic conditions and the C-store traffic in particular. And based on that, we said, the base is probably 8% to 9% to be prudent. And that's the base Pepsico. And that does not involve the accelerated investment in China. It includes the base level of investments in China and India and all of these markets, which are pretty spectacular to start with. What all that we are saying is, since we now have permission to invest in 10 more plants because we are going to open up new geographies, let's also accelerate our market base investment like coolers and whatever equipment and advertising that we can put into these markets. So what we're saying is, it's the base is 8% to 9%. And now let's take the room for acquisition and look at all of our programs across the world and see what we can accelerate prudently. Because you've got to have the organizational bandwidth to put these investments in. Let's make sure we put these investments in. Now regarding our long-term algorithm. Richard mentioned that from a bottom-line basis, between 2010 and 2012, we can sustain pretty attractive levels of bottom-line growth. Clearly, that bottom-line growth doesn't come without good top-line growth. So at this point, again talking in constant currency, we see at least for the next three years or so, again, we're going to be a $60 billion company. So we have to sustain the growth level of that company. We feel good about our revenue growth and the bottom-line growth.

And the reason we have this positive leverage in the bottom line versus the top line is because we made a conscious decision not to rent volume. So the investments in North American Beverages, as we talked about, specifically, we believe there's some breakthroughs possible in North American Beverages. If those breakthroughs do come to fruition, we will invest behind it. And for competitive reasons, can't give you much more information than that. But North American Beverages investment is only going to happen if there's a breakthrough. Otherwise, investments are going to happen in many other parts of the country: The good-for-you pieces, accelerated investment in emerging markets. We are going to target each of these investments, so we get long-term growth from these investments. I mean, that's the beauty of a strategic investment as opposed to addressing any short-term operations fix."

First of all, I just want to say a big thanks to all of you for participating in our Investor Meeting last month in person or by website. And I hope that you walked away with a better appreciation for the breadth",1189,"Thanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. First of all, I just want to say a big thanks to all of you for participating in our Investor Meeting last month in person or by website. And I hope that you walked away with a better appreciation for the breadth and depth of our global portfolio, as well as increased confidence in our ability to deliver near-term results, while investing to drive sustained top quarter performance. 
Since we just spent those two days reviewing our plans in detail, this morning I’m going to keep my remarks really brief. I have three key messages for you this morning. First, we remain confident in our ability to deliver 11% to 13% growth in EPS this year, while investing behind strategic platforms for the long-term. 
Second, we are making great progress behind each of the seven initiatives we discussed with you at our Investor Meeting. 
And third, reports of solid Q1 performance in the quarter. Net revenue grew 11%, division operating profit was up 10% driven by improved cost and continued productivity, managing operating cash flow, excluding certain items, was up 40% to $794 million and we continue to make incremental strategic investments in areas critical to sustained growth. 
More importantly, the momentum going into Q2 has picked up across the board. Let me give you some operating highlights. 
In our $27 billion global macrosnacks business, we gained share in key markets by growing our core and our adjacencies business. In Q1, we continue to make progress in shifting the mix of our portfolio from Fun For You to Better For You with the launch of great-tasting products like all natural regional flavors of Lay’s Potato Chips and Whole Grain Tostitos in the United States. And we achieved all of this while investing to broaden our portfolio and expanding margins in key areas of the business. 
A prime example of this is at Frito-Lay North America where the team delivered great results in spite of overlapping double-digit growth in net revenue and core operating profit. 
In our Global Beverage business, although reported volume was down 0.5 point in the quarter, if you include March in our international numbers, volume was up in the low single digits. 
I'd like to highlight just two markets. In North American Beverages, volume trends are improving across the board including Gatorade. We have been very careful to pursue shares judiciously, and we tended to favor value share in most cases and we are not pursuing unbranded volume. Our core numbers reflect a healthy relationship between volume, revenue and profits. 
In China beverages, we continue to step up our investments behind coolers and brand building. In the quarter, we gained share of these as we lead the industry with a 14% increase in volume. Looking forward as we look at our beverage portfolio, we are seeing improved trends around the world. 
And since today is Earth Day, I want to share with you that today PepsiCo is announcing a revolutionary program to accelerate recycling by launching what we call The Dream Machine. It is both a machine and a program which in partnership with Waste Management will allow us to expand recycling, reduce our carbon footprint and provide us with a low-cost source of PET resin. 
Also the first-ever 100% compostable chip bag, which was launched by SunChips brand earlier this month reaches full distribution in the United States and Canada today. This bag is a terrific innovation because it will completely degrade in weeks, adding nothing to landfill. We have stated that delivering on our environmental sustainability commitments is one of our top imperatives, and I'm pleased to report that we're taking tangible scalable actions to deliver on those commitments. 
Those are just a few examples of the progress we're making against our long-term imperatives. I'm particularly proud that our organization has the operating agility to deliver both current results and long-term imperatives especially in an environment where the macros are so challenging. 
From an economic standpoint, we continue to see an environment that is similar to the one that we've described to you in the past. Solid economic growth east of the Middle East and challenging economic west of the Middle East. 
Regarding the West. The good news is that we're starting to see some signs of overall improvements in many of the economies. GDP declines have moderated, and there is growth in a number of markets. Further, consumer sentiments are certainly on the rise in many countries. Nonetheless, the average consumer remains challenged across these economies, as unemployment is still stubbornly high and consumer confidence remains at moderate to low levels. 
For PepsiCo, this means we will need to continue to run our businesses with tight cost control. And we will need to deliver good value to encourage strapped consumers to open their pocketbooks. Our improved GDP is a terrific signal for the future, but until we start to see unemployment numbers decrease, we will stick to our game plan of maintaining the right value equation to consumers, while managing costs and driving productivity to fuel investments across our businesses. 
A brief note on our financial performance in the quarter. I know that it is challenging to correctly model the impact of the bottling acquisitions in Q1, Q2 and the balance of the year. In fact, I don't think anyone got it completely right especially on timing, which drove a wide range in your dividend and operating profit estimates as well as below the line items like net interest and equity income. I know that it was also challenging to try to split out North America from Europe, and you have acquisition accounting related adjustments to sort through. 
The net of all this is that many aspects of our Q1 results did not come together the way some of you expected. Notwithstanding all of this, we did deliver a solid quarter well in line with our own expectations and we are in a firm trajectory to hit our 11% to 13% core constant currency EPS growth target for the year. 
It is still a first half, second half story though as we overlap strong performance in the first two quarters, and start to realize the benefits from synergies and improved performance in the second half. So I encourage you to listen very carefully to Hugh when he takes you through the operating results and our full year outlook in more detail. We will give you enough information so that you can go back and take a harder look at modeling division performance as well as below the line items. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Hugh Johnston, our Chief Financial Officer who's going to review our results in greater detail. This is Hugh’s debut on the earnings call as a CFO and for those of you who haven't yet had the opportunity to meet Hugh, he's just an extraordinary individual, a 23-year veteran of our business with broad experience in finance, M&A, strategy and general management. He's a fun guy, and I think you're going to enjoy working with him.  Hugh, over to you."

Let me turn right to the operating performance by division as well as some of the items that impact our year-over-year comparisons. PepsiCo Americas Foods continued to deliver solid consistent results, while lapping",3016,"Thanks, Indra. Good morning, everyone. Let me turn right to the operating performance by division as well as some of the items that impact our year-over-year comparisons. PepsiCo Americas Foods continued to deliver solid consistent results, while lapping double-digit gains last year. At Frito-Lay North America, volume and net revenue were both up 1% in line with our expectations while operating profit grew 9%. 
As you may know, FLNA is overlapping its strongest quarter of revenue growth in Q1 driven by pricing it took last year to offset commodity inflation. 
In spite of this, FLNA was able to get solid leverage in their P&L and expand operating margins through both lower commodity costs and tight cost controls. 
As you learned at our investor meeting, Frito has started the year with a strong innovation line-up focused on expanding healthy, affordable snacking options, such as our All Natural and Lightly Salted lines. 
Additionally, given the economic pressures that many consumers are still feeling, FLNA continues to leverage price pack architecture to deliver value. Strong growth in Lay’s, variety packs and the $2 value line contributed to salty volume share gains for FLNA. Underscoring the power of the Power of One, the joint promotion of Doritos Burn products and Pepsi Max Cease Fire drove incremental sales in the quarter, and helped both companies navigate some of the softness that we are seeing in the C-store channel. 
Looking at the balance of the year, remember that FLNA will continue to have tough top line comps through the third quarter, as they overlap pricing from last year, as well as the impact of their 20% More Free initiative launched in the second quarter of last year. 
As we move through the year, FLNA will leverage the benefit from input cost deflation to step up market place investments, such as A&M and additional routes. But even after these volume-driving investments, we expect to see robust bottom line performance through the year, though as expected, volume growth will be at the low end of Frito-Lay’s historical range. 
At Quaker Foods North America, net revenue was down 3% and operating profit was down 14%. Top line softness was driven by hot cereal where we have opportunities to improve value and innovation. The decline in profitability was driven almost entirely by the overlap of an insurance settlement last year. QFNA has stepped up innovation and value initiatives, which we believe will drive stronger performance in the second half of this year. 
In Latin American Foods, volume was up 1%, net revenue was up 8% and operating profit declined 5% as the division overlapped close to 30% growth in operating profit last year. LAF also faced the headwinds of higher input costs and challenging macros. 
In the second half of the year, we expect significantly improved performance in LAF as the region benefits from investments and infrastructure, selective pricing to cover inflation and local costs and product innovation. 
Now on to PepsiCo Americas Beverages. As you would expect, our Q1 results for PAB was significantly impacted by our acquisitions of PBG and PAS. The good news is that we moved very quickly to integrate the PBG and PAS bottling operations with PepsiCo's Concentrate business. Eric, Massimo and their teams are now operating these combined businesses as one system and they are fundamentally measured on one volume, one revenue and one profit rule. 
Now for those of you who are still trying to model the businesses separately, you're likely to encounter some challenges. We aren't managing the business this way and we won’t be measuring or disclosing our performance this way either. We now have one vertically integrated value chain, just like our snacks business. That means we're now making decisions which benefit the total system without concern as to how the costs and benefits are shared between the brand and bottling operations. This was really the foundational premise for these acquisitions. 
Now that these decisions are made on an integrated basis, it's virtually impossible to accurately estimate what programs would or wouldn't have happened and what portion of each program would've been funded by the Legacy PepsiCo business or by the Bottlers or even with the funding mechanism would've been. So there really is no clean way to do a with and without acquisition impact for revenue and operating profit. 
So with that, now let me turn to the results of PAB. Volume decreased 4% largely driven by declines in the CSD category as a whole as well as double-digit declines in Aquafina as we continue to deemphasize unprofitable case pack water. Additionally, it's worth noting that we did not have the benefit of a positive Easter holiday overlap in our Q1 performance. 
The new distribution agreement with Dr. Pepper Snapple Group positively contributed about two percentage points to the volume performance. Net revenue grew 32% and operating profit increased 28%. PAB benefited from the impact of the acquisitions, improving top line trends in North America, as well as solid operating performance in Latin America. 
The business also focused on profitable volume balanced with selective share growth in certain categories. As Massimo discussed in detail at the Investor Meeting, North American Beverages is largely focused on growing value share across its portfolio by driving innovation focused on the four key LRB consumer needs space: Enjoyment, Hydration, Nourishment and Transformation. 
I'll now share some Q1 highlights from each. In the Enjoyment category, which includes CSD's and Ready to Drink Teas, the North American Beverages business maintained volume share leadership in measured channels. And in a category where both volume and value share are important due to the large installed manufacturing base, we held year-over-year volume share and outperformed our largest competitor. Our overall performance was driven by the successful Pepsi Refresh program, Pepsi and Mountain Dew Throwback LPOs and our Super Bowl consumer value promotion. 
In Hydration where we also have share leadership excluding the unflavored water category, Gatorade’s sequential trends continued to improve led by double-digit growth of G2. We feel especially good about our improving performance, particularly in light of very aggressive pricing by competition. [Inaudible] are also up across the Gatorade portfolio, especially among key cohort groups of teams and competitive athletes, where consumption of G. is up double digits. 
In the second quarter, Gatorade started its national launch of the G Series, which provides functional benefits to athletes before, during and after their sports activities. Further, for performance athletes, our rollout of G Series Pro across GNC and Dick's Sporting Goods is on track and expected to be highly incremental and accretive to our brand building efforts. 
In Enhanced water, SoBe Life Water continued its strong performance, and was among the top five fastest-growing LRB brands in measured channels in the quarter. 
Turning to Nourishment, which includes juice and juice drinks, our Tropicana performance trends improve aided by the launch of our national Juicy Rewards program and Trop50, which launched new flavors in the first quarter. 
Trop50 was also in the top 20 of the fastest-growing LRB brands in measured channels in the quarter. The Tropicana brand continues to hold a significant lead over its key competitors on all brand health measures. 
And finally, in Transformation, which includes ready to drink coffee and energy drinks, we launched Amp Energy Juice, a 100% juice that fills a new day part and occasion for us, the morning wake-up drink. 
While we're pleased with progress that we're making in each of these need states, there is no doubt that the overall category dynamics are still very challenging. We have been able to achieve our desired pricing, but we are being very surgical about delivering value to the consumer where it is appropriate. In doing so, we're working hard to find an optimal balance between volume and pricing. As Eric mentioned at the Analyst Meeting, we focused on balancing improved margins, while delivering greater consumer value in the marketplace. 
Looking forward, we have seen some strengthening in our North American Beverage business in recent weeks. In particular, trends in both the Enjoyment and Hydration segments have improved. Obviously, it's always difficult to forecast a sustained recovery from a trough. However, it is encouraging to see this uptick, and our teams will be working hard to turn it into a new trend. 
Before moving off of PAB, let me just touch on the bottler integration. We took swift actions to unlock synergies, and we are on track to hit our target of $125 million to $150 million this year. Since we closed the transaction with only four weeks left in the quarter, our actual synergy capture was small, but we ramped up very quickly in Q2, and we are already seeing the benefits in corporate overhead, back-office, operations and supply chain. We remain confident in our ability to capture $400 million in synergies by 2012. And we now expect the one-time cost to achieve these synergies to be about $650 million. This increase relates to our decision in the first quarter to consolidate and rationalize some manufacturing assets. Of the $650 million, roughly $225 million is non-cash. 
Let me now turn to Europe and AMEA. Note that starting this quarter, we will no longer report combined results for PepsiCo International. This is because Europe and AMEA are under separate leadership structures. 
In Europe, top line performance was mixed as the macros in Eastern Europe continued to be challenging, while we're seeing some strengthening in Western Europe. In the quarter, net revenue declined 3%, however, the division exercised financial discipline and strong net revenue management, which helped to drive a 4% increase in operating profit. 
In Europe Snacks, the weak consumer trends in the east impacted top line resulting in a 4% decline of volume. The decline of volume also reflects the fact that we're lapping the very successful Walkers’ Do Us a Flavor campaign. Europe is extending this promotion across key markets and also running creative consumer engagement and promotional programs linked to soccer personalities in the second quarter. 
A few examples include the Walkers Flavor Cup in the U.K., in which 15 flavors are competing for consumer votes and the latest football event in Spain and Portugal. 
In our Europe Beverage business, volume was down 4% due to the severe weather in Western Europe and also macro softness in Eastern Europe. However, we grew CSD value share in important markets such as Russia, U.K., Turkey and Germany. And we saw improved top line trends across the board in February. 
We've also gotten off to an encouraging start in the second quarter. Our snacks and beverage businesses saw a turnaround in March with each returning to growth in both Eastern and Western Europe. Most notably, our UK Snacks business and Beverage businesses drove significant growth, and Turkey Beverages continue to grow well north of 40%. 
Since our International businesses closed their first quarter at the end of February, we won't see the benefits of the bottling acquisition internationally until the second quarter. However, we have already begun to see the power of the Power of One as a result of our Snacks and Beverage business operating models coming closer together. 
For example, in the Ukraine, we transferred the management of our CSD business over to Sandora, which allows us to leverage joint go-to-market strategies and improve efficiencies in our supply chain. And in Russia, we're doing extensive testing to determine the optimal go-to-market solutions. 
Turning now to AMEA. Our team started the year strong across the sector. All key markets delivered strong top line growth in Snacks and Beverages, which helped to drive an 18% increase in net revenue and a 12% increase in operating profit. The growth on operating profit was impacted by the strategic investments we are making at our China beverage business. 
In the quarter, we rolled out a series of new innovative products, including the regional expansion of Tropicana Pulp Sacs and blueberry-flavored Guo Bin Fen juice blend in China and H2O in Egypt. 
In Snacks, we launched a new flavor of our extruded snack, Kurkure, in India; Doritos Collisions in Egypt and the new deli flavors of our Red Rock Deli kettle chips in Australia. In snacks, volume increased 13% driven by double-digit growth in China and India.  China benefited from strong marketplace execution and the timing of the Chinese New Year while India leveraged a powerful marketing calendar at the start of the year. 
AMEA beverages showed strong volume momentum in the quarter across key markets, such as India and China, as well as in Vietnam and the Philippines. As you heard at the investor meeting, we have stepped up our investments in China as we prepare to almost double our manufacturing capacity in the country. These investments are already driving improved performance. 
In the quarter, our volume growth in China in CSDs accelerated and we gained share. We saw very strong top and bottom line growth in AMEA in the first quarter. 
Over the balance of the year, we continue to expect strong top line results, but there will be a slowdown in operating profit growth as we expand our strategic investment program. 
Taking a step back, we are feeling good about our trajectory going into the second quarter. Our businesses are focused on driving profitable growth, while making investments that expand our presence in key categories and markets. 
Before I turn to guidance, let me take you through some of the items that impact our year-to-year comparisons. All of these items, as well as other non-core items, are discussed in our earnings release and will be detailed in our 10-Q, which we plan to file tomorrow. In the quarter, our core results excluded a number of items. Let me mention five of them. 
First, merger and integration charges of $321 million or $0.16 a share. Roughly $220 million relates to cost to achieve synergies such as asset rationalization and the streamlining of supply chains. And the balance or about $100 million relates to deal costs such as financing costs and adviser fees. 
Second is an adjustment to the fair value of inventory of $281 million or $0.15 a share. This adjustment relates mostly to the impact to our cost of sales of the step up to fair value of inventory and inventory hedges acquired from the bottlers. This step up, which occurred on the acquisition date, temporarily increases our cost of sales until this inventory sells through, which we expect to be largely complete in the second quarter. 
The third is a one-time charge of $145 million or $0.06 of share for SAP software. This relates to the change in scope of one release of our ongoing migration to SAP software. This change was driven in part by a recent review of our North American system strategy. As Richard mentioned at the Investor Meeting, we are still very committed to the implementation of SAP across our global operations over the next few years. 
As discussed on our fourth quarter call, the fourth item is a one-time charge of $120 million or $0.07 a share for the revaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela as a result of the devaluation that occurred in January. 
And lastly, we made a one-time contribution to the PepsiCo Foundation of $100 million or $0.04 a share. This is our first contribution in a couple of years and it should cover the Foundation for at least the next several years. 
Turning to other items. In the quarter, we repurchased $940 million in common stock or about 14 million shares. However it's important to note that $205 million of that cost was actually paid in the second quarter because we executed the repurchases in the final days of the first quarter. 
Our reported tax rate in the quarter was a benefit of 2% mostly driven by the impact of the bottling transactions, which includes a reversal of deferred taxes attributed to previously held equity interest in the bottlers. The resolution of certain tax matters contributed about a one percentage point to the decline in the reported tax rate versus Q1 of last year. The benefit of 2% is a 27 percentage point change versus Q1 of last year. 
Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, our core tax rate was 23% for the first quarter. 
Now let me turn to our guidance for the full year. We are still targeting 11% to 13% quarter core constant currency EPS growth off of our fiscal 2009 core EPS of $3.71. We expect roughly 6% growth in core constant currency EPS in the first half of the year which includes a charge of about $40 million after-tax related to the healthcare legislation that was signed into law at the beginning of our second quarter. 
In the second half of the year, we expect our core constant currency EPS growth rate to be in the midteens. Based on current spot rates, foreign exchange translation would be about a one point headwind for us on a full year core constant currency EPS growth. 
It's important for me to note that when we file our full-year pro formas for 2009 on Form 8-Ka later today, you will see a few pennies more of upside related to the transactions than we had last estimated translating to about $0.17 a share, or $0.02 more of accounting and financing upsides in 2010. We plan to invest this additional $0.02 in our business this year. 
Turning to our full-year reported tax rate, we expect the rate to be between 23% and 24%, which includes a benefit of about four percentage points from the items affecting comparability that I mentioned earlier. 
For the year, we expect management operating cash flow, excluding certain items and net of capital expenditures to be approximately $5.6 billion. Net CapEx should total about $3.6 billion, which includes about $200 million in capital investments related to the bottler integration. 
And lastly, we anticipate that in total, we will spend roughly $4.4 billion on share repurchases this year. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Operator?"

And as Eric just said, we're looking very carefully at this mix of volume share and value share so we don't just compete in this business by dropping pricing, especially to push a volume number. 
And then the second thing we've been doing is pruning the portfolio. Where we have product lines that really don't make sense to invest in long-term because the profit outlook is really not optimal, we have been deemphasizing it. And Hugh referred to the case pack water, which we deemphasized in the quarter. In the investor meeting, we talked about some juice drinks, shelf-stable juice drinks, which the value proposition wasn't very attractive and so over the year, we started to deemphasize that until we found a new way to compete in that business in a profitable way. So the numbers were impacted by that. The second is that, remember, our quarter was different than the rest of the industry, in that we didn't have the Easter benefit in our quarter.

And number three, from our standpoint, while the synergy numbers that we put out there are the ones that we absolutely intend to deliver, we’re also not going to stop there by any stretch of imagination.

And then our volume would be in the sort of the low single-digit range, and this is not a year where we’re going to get a lot of price mix. So yes, there will be margin expansion at Frito-Lay during the course of the year. That's going to come through two areas. One is there is deflation in the business and two is the practices on productivity there continue to step up. 
We are making investments back into the business so that we can keep the volume growing, and while we grew volume 1% in the quarter, it sort of – I’d look at it in two different ways. One is sort of the core salty business is growing at its historical rate in large-format stores, and where our value has been impacted has been in the small format stores, c-stores and food service. So once that starts to turn, I think we’ll see Frito-Lay back to sort of its 2% to 3% growth rate that we've historically achieved. 
In our adjacencies side of the business that I talked about at the investor conference, this Stacy’s business, the Sabra business, the Quaker Snacks business that we execute through Frito-Lay continue to grow, double digits in some cases in the high single digits in others. 
So I think we've got a nice mix between the core and the adjacencies. The large format business remains strong and once the small format business turns then the total volume growth in the company will be back to where it is. 
We will expand margins at Frito-Lay this year, while investing back in the business. So a good start to Frito-Lay in the first quarter."

So as we refine the estimates, that's where we are right now and wanted to provide you with that update and also give you update on cash versus non-cash. So that's really where we stand."

First of all, I just want to say a big thanks to all of you for participating in our Investor Meeting last month in person or by website.

First of all, I just want to say a big thanks to all of you for participating in our Investor Meeting last month in person or by website. And I hope that you walked away with a better appreciation for the breadth and depth of our global portfolio, as well as increased confidence in our ability to deliver near-term results, while investing to drive sustained top quarter performance. 
Since we just spent those two days reviewing our plans in detail, this morning I’m going to keep my remarks really brief. I have three key messages for you this morning. First, we remain confident in our ability to deliver 11% to 13% growth in EPS this year, while investing behind strategic platforms for the long-term. 
Second, we are making great progress behind each of the seven initiatives we discussed with you at our Investor Meeting. 
And third, reports of solid Q1 performance in the quarter. Net revenue grew 11%, division operating profit was up 10% driven by improved cost and continued productivity, managing operating cash flow, excluding certain items, was up 40% to $794 million and we continue to make incremental strategic investments in areas critical to sustained growth. 
More importantly, the momentum going into Q2 has picked up across the board. Let me give you some operating highlights. 
In our $27 billion global macrosnacks business, we gained share in key markets by growing our core and our adjacencies business. In Q1, we continue to make progress in shifting the mix of our portfolio from Fun For You to Better For You with the launch of great-tasting products like all natural regional flavors of Lay’s Potato Chips and Whole Grain Tostitos in the United States. And we achieved all of this while investing to broaden our portfolio and expanding margins in key areas of the business. 
A prime example of this is at Frito-Lay North America where the team delivered great results in spite of overlapping double-digit growth in net revenue and core operating profit. 
In our Global Beverage business, although reported volume was down 0.5 point in the quarter, if you include March in our international numbers, volume was up in the low single digits. 
I'd like to highlight just two markets. In North American Beverages, volume trends are improving across the board including Gatorade. We have been very careful to pursue shares judiciously, and we tended to favor value share in most cases and we are not pursuing unbranded volume. Our core numbers reflect a healthy relationship between volume, revenue and profits. 
In China beverages, we continue to step up our investments behind coolers and brand building. In the quarter, we gained share of these as we lead the industry with a 14% increase in volume. Looking forward as we look at our beverage portfolio, we are seeing improved trends around the world. 
And since today is Earth Day, I want to share with you that today PepsiCo is announcing a revolutionary program to accelerate recycling by launching what we call The Dream Machine. It is both a machine and a program which in partnership with Waste Management will allow us to expand recycling, reduce our carbon footprint and provide us with a low-cost source of PET resin. 
Also the first-ever 100% compostable chip bag, which was launched by SunChips brand earlier this month reaches full distribution in the United States and Canada today. This bag is a terrific innovation because it will completely degrade in weeks, adding nothing to landfill. We have stated that delivering on our environmental sustainability commitments is one of our top imperatives, and I'm pleased to report that we're taking tangible scalable actions to deliver on those commitments. 
Those are just a few examples of the progress we're making against our long-term imperatives. I'm particularly proud that our organization has the operating agility to deliver both current results and long-term imperatives especially in an environment where the macros are so challenging. 
From an economic standpoint, we continue to see an environment that is similar to the one that we've described to you in the past. Solid economic growth east of the Middle East and challenging economic west of the Middle East. 
Regarding the West. The good news is that we're starting to see some signs of overall improvements in many of the economies. GDP declines have moderated, and there is growth in a number of markets. Further, consumer sentiments are certainly on the rise in many countries. Nonetheless, the average consumer remains challenged across these economies, as unemployment is still stubbornly high and consumer confidence remains at moderate to low levels. 
For PepsiCo, this means we will need to continue to run our businesses with tight cost control. And we will need to deliver good value to encourage strapped consumers to open their pocketbooks. Our improved GDP is a terrific signal for the future, but until we start to see unemployment numbers decrease, we will stick to our game plan of maintaining the right value equation to consumers, while managing costs and driving productivity to fuel investments across our businesses. 
A brief note on our financial performance in the quarter. I know it was challenging to correctly model the impact of the bottling acquisitions in Q1, Q2 and the balance of the year. In fact, I don't think anyone got it completely right especially on timing, which drove a wide range in your revenue and dividend trough, operating profit estimates as well as below the line items like net interest and equity income. I know that it was also challenging to try to split out North America from Europe, and you had acquisition accounting-related adjustments to sort through. 
The net of all this is that many aspects of our Q1 results did not come together the way some of you expected. Notwithstanding all of this, we did deliver a solid quarter well in line with our own expectations and we are on a firm trajectory to hit our 11% to 13% core constant currency EPS growth target for the year. 
It is still a first half, second half story though as we overlap strong performance in the first two quarters and start to realize the benefits from synergies and improved performance in the second half. So I encourage you to listen very carefully to Hugh when he takes you through the operating results and our full year outlook in more detail. We will give you enough information so that you can go back and take a harder look at how you're modeling division performance as well as below the line items. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Hugh Johnston, our Chief Financial Officer, who's going to review our results in greater detail. This is Hugh’s debut on the earnings call as a CFO and for those of you who haven't yet had the opportunity to meet Hugh, he's just an extraordinary individual, a 23-year veteran of our business with broad experience in finance, M&A, strategy and general management. He's a fun guy, and I think you're going to enjoy working with him. Hugh, over to you."
32854,100001923,57201,"Pepsico, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2010",2010-04-22,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Indra. Good morning, everyone. Let me turn right to the operating performance by division as well as some of the items that impact our year-over-year comparisons. PepsiCo Americas Foods continued to deliver solid consistent results, while lapping",3015,"Thanks, Indra. Good morning, everyone. Let me turn right to the operating performance by division as well as some of the items that impact our year-over-year comparisons. PepsiCo Americas Foods continued to deliver solid consistent results, while lapping double-digit gains last year. At Frito-Lay North America, volume and net revenue were both up 1% in line with our expectations while operating profit grew 9%. 
As you may know, FLNA is overlapping its strongest quarter of revenue growth in Q1 driven by pricing it took last year to offset commodity inflation. In spite of this, FLNA was able to get solid leverage in their P&L and expand operating margins through both lower commodity costs and tight cost controls. 
As you learned at our investor meeting, Frito has started the year with a strong innovation line-up focused on expanding healthy, affordable snacking options, such as our all natural and lightly salted lines. 
Additionally, given the economic pressures that many consumers are still feeling, FLNA continues to leverage price pack architecture to deliver value. Strong growth in Lay's, variety packs and the $2 value line contributed to salty volume share gains for FLNA. Underscoring the power of the Power of One, the joint promotion of Doritos Burn products and Pepsi Max Cease Fire drove incremental sales in the quarter and helped both companies navigate some of the softness that we are seeing in the C-store channel. 
Looking at the balance of the year, remember that FLNA will continue to have tough top line comps through the third quarter, as they overlap pricing from last year, as well as the impact of their 20% More Free initiative launched in the second quarter of last year. 
As we move through the year, FLNA will leverage the benefit from input cost deflation to step up marketplace investments, such as A&M and additional routes. But even after these volume-driving investments, we expect to see robust bottom line performance through the year, though as expected, volume growth will be at the low end of Frito-Lay’s historical range. 
At Quaker Foods North America, net revenue was down 3% and operating profit was down 14%. Top line softness was driven by hot cereal where we have opportunities to improve value and innovation. The decline in profitability was driven almost entirely by the overlap of an insurance settlement last year. QFNA has stepped up innovation and value initiatives, which we believe will drive stronger performance in the second half of this year. 
In Latin American Foods, volume was up 1%, net revenue was up 8% and operating profit declined 5% as the division overlapped close to 30% growth in operating profit last year. LAF also faced the headwinds of higher input costs and challenging macros. In the second half of the year, we expect significantly improved performance in LAF as the region benefits from investments in infrastructure, selective pricing to cover inflation in local costs and product innovation. 
Now on to PepsiCo Americas Beverages. As you would expect, our Q1 results for PAB were significantly impacted by our acquisitions of PBG and PAS. The good news is that we moved very quickly to integrate the PBG and PAS bottling operations with PepsiCo's Concentrate business. Eric, Massimo and their teams are now operating these combined businesses as one system and they are fundamentally measured on one volume, one revenue and one profit pool. 
Now for those of you who are still trying to model the businesses separately, you're likely to encounter some challenges. We aren't managing the business this way and we won’t be measuring or disclosing our performance this way either. We now have one vertically integrated value chain, just like our Snacks business. That means we're now making decisions which benefit the total system without concern as to how the costs and benefits are shared between the brand and bottling operations. This was really the foundational premise for these acquisitions. 
Now that these decisions are made on an integrated basis, it's virtually impossible to accurately estimate what programs would or wouldn't have happened and what portion of each program would've been funded by the legacy PepsiCo business or by the Bottlers or even with the funding mechanism would've been. So there really is no clean way to do a with and without acquisition impact for revenue and operating profit. 
So with that, now let me turn to the results of PAB. Volume decreased 4% largely driven by declines in the CSD category as a whole as well as double-digit declines in Aquafina as we continue to de-emphasize unprofitable case pack water. Additionally, it's worth noting that we did not have the benefit of a positive Easter holiday overlap in our Q1 performance. 
The new distribution agreement with Dr. Pepper Snapple Group positively contributed about two percentage points to the volume performance. Net revenue grew 32% and operating profit increased 28%. PAB benefited from the impact of the acquisitions, improving top line trends in North America as well as solid operating performance in Latin America. 
The business also focused on profitable volume balanced with selective share growth in certain categories. As Massimo discussed in detail at the investor meeting, North American Beverages is largely focused on growing value share across its portfolio by driving innovation focused on the four key LRB consumer needs space: Enjoyment, Hydration, Nourishment and Transformation. 
I'll now share some Q1 highlights from each. In the Enjoyment category, which includes CSD's and Ready to Drink Teas, the North American Beverages business maintained volume share leadership in measured channels. And in a category where both volume and value share are important due to the large installed manufacturing base, we held year-over-year volume share and outperformed our largest competitor. Our overall performance was driven by the successful Pepsi Refresh program, Pepsi and Mountain Dew Throwback LPOs and our Super Bowl consumer value promotion. 
In Hydration where we also have share leadership excluding the unflavored water category, Gatorade’s sequential trends continued to improve led by double-digit growth of G2. We feel especially good about our improving performance, particularly in light of very aggressive pricing by competition. [Inaudible] are also up across the Gatorade portfolio, especially among key cohort groups of teams and competitive athletes, where consumption of G. is up double digits. 
In the second quarter, Gatorade started its national launch of the G Series, which provides functional benefits to athletes before, during and after their sports activities. Further, for performance athletes, our rollout of G Series Pro across GNC and Dick's Sporting Goods is on track and expected to be highly incremental and accretive to our brand building efforts. 
In Enhanced water, SoBe Life Water continued its strong performance, and was among the top five fastest-growing LRB brands in measured channels in the quarter. 
Turning to Nourishment, which includes juice and juice drinks, our Tropicana performance trends improve aided by the launch of our national Juicy Rewards program and Trop50, which launched new flavors in the first quarter. 
Trop50 was also in the top 20 of the fastest-growing LRB brands in measured channels in the quarter. The Tropicana brand continues to hold a significant lead over its key competitors on all brand health measures. 
And finally, in Transformation, which includes ready to drink coffee and energy drinks, we launched Amp Energy Juice, a 100% juice that fills a new day part and occasion for us, the morning wake-up drink. 
While we're pleased with progress that we're making in each of these need states, there is no doubt that the overall category dynamics are still very challenging. We have been able to achieve our desired pricing, but we are being very surgical about delivering value to the consumer where it is appropriate. In doing so, we're working hard to find an optimal balance between volume and pricing. As Eric mentioned at the Analyst Meeting, we focused on balancing improved margins, while delivering greater consumer value in the marketplace. 
Looking forward, we have seen some strengthening in our North American Beverage business in recent weeks. In particular, trends in both the Enjoyment and Hydration segments have improved. Obviously, it's always difficult to forecast a sustained recovery from a trough. However, it is encouraging to see this uptick, and our teams will be working hard to turn it into a new trend. 
Before moving off of PAB, let me just touch on the bottler integration. We took swift actions to unlock synergies, and we are on track to hit our target of $125 million to $150 million this year. Since we closed the transaction with only four weeks left in the quarter, our actual synergy capture was small, but we ramped up very quickly in Q2, and we are already seeing the benefits in corporate overhead, back-office, operations and supply chain. We remain confident in our ability to capture $400 million in synergies by 2012. And we now expect the one-time cost to achieve these synergies to be about $650 million. This increase relates to our decision in the first quarter to consolidate and rationalize some manufacturing assets. Of the $650 million, roughly $225 million is non-cash. 
Let me now turn to Europe and AMEA. Note that starting this quarter, we will no longer report combined results for PepsiCo International. This is because Europe and AMEA are under separate leadership structures. 
In Europe, top line performance was mixed as the macros in Eastern Europe continued to be challenging, while we're seeing some strengthening in Western Europe. In the quarter, net revenue declined 3%, however, the division exercised financial discipline and strong net revenue management, which helped to drive a 4% increase in operating profit. 
In Europe Snacks, the weak consumer trends in the east impacted top line resulting in a 4% decline of volume. The decline of volume also reflects the fact that we're lapping the very successful Walkers’ Do Us a Flavor campaign. Europe is extending this promotion across key markets and also running creative consumer engagement and promotional programs linked to soccer personalities in the second quarter. 
A few examples include the Walkers Flavor Cup in the U.K., in which 15 flavors are competing for consumer votes and the latest football event in Spain and Portugal. 
In our Europe Beverage business, volume was down 4% due to the severe weather in Western Europe and also macro softness in Eastern Europe. However, we grew CSD value share in important markets such as Russia, U.K., Turkey and Germany. And we saw improved top line trends across the board in February. 
We've also gotten off to an encouraging start in the second quarter. Our snacks and beverage businesses saw a turnaround in March with each returning to growth in both Eastern and Western Europe. Most notably, our UK Snacks business and Beverage businesses drove significant growth, and Turkey Beverages continue to grow well north of 40%. 
Since our International businesses closed their first quarter at the end of February, we won't see the benefits of the bottling acquisition internationally until the second quarter. However, we have already begun to see the power of the Power of One as a result of our Snacks and Beverage business operating models coming closer together. 
For example, in the Ukraine, we transferred the management of our CSD business over to Sandora, which allows us to leverage joint go-to-market strategies and improve efficiencies in our supply chain. And in Russia, we're doing extensive testing to determine the optimal go-to-market solutions. 
Turning now to AMEA. Our team started the year strong across the sector. All key markets delivered strong top line growth in Snacks and Beverages, which helped to drive an 18% increase in net revenue and a 12% increase in operating profit. The growth on operating profit was impacted by the strategic investments we are making at our China beverage business. 
In the quarter, we rolled out a series of new innovative products, including the regional expansion of Tropicana Pulp Sacs and blueberry-flavored Guo Bin Fen juice blend in China and H2O in Egypt. 
In Snacks, we launched a new flavor of our extruded snack, Kurkure, in India; Doritos Collisions in Egypt and the new deli flavors of our Red Rock Deli kettle chips in Australia. In snacks, volume increased 13% driven by double-digit growth in China and India.  China benefited from strong marketplace execution and the timing of the Chinese New Year while India leveraged a powerful marketing calendar at the start of the year. 
AMEA beverages showed strong volume momentum in the quarter across key markets, such as India and China, as well as in Vietnam and the Philippines. As you heard at the investor meeting, we have stepped up our investments in China as we prepare to almost double our manufacturing capacity in the country. These investments are already driving improved performance. 
In the quarter, our volume growth in China in CSDs accelerated and we gained share. We saw very strong top and bottom line growth in AMEA in the first quarter. 
Over the balance of the year, we continue to expect strong top line results, but there will be a slowdown in operating profit growth as we expand our strategic investment program. 
Taking a step back, we are feeling good about our trajectory going into the second quarter. Our businesses are focused on driving profitable growth, while making investments that expand our presence in key categories and markets. 
Before I turn to guidance, let me take you through some of the items that impact our year-to-year comparisons. All of these items, as well as other non-core items, are discussed in our earnings release and will be detailed in our 10-Q, which we plan to file tomorrow. In the quarter, our core results excluded a number of items. Let me mention five of them. 
First, merger and integration charges of $321 million or $0.16 a share. Roughly $220 million relates to cost to achieve synergies such as asset rationalization and the streamlining of supply chains. And the balance or about $100 million relates to deal costs such as financing costs and adviser fees. 
Second is an adjustment to the fair value of inventory of $281 million or $0.15 a share. This adjustment relates mostly to the impact to our cost of sales of the step up to fair value of inventory and inventory hedges acquired from the bottlers. This step up, which occurred on the acquisition date, temporarily increases our cost of sales until this inventory sells through, which we expect to be largely complete in the second quarter. 
The third is a one-time charge of $145 million or $0.06 of share for SAP software. This relates to the change in scope of one release of our ongoing migration to SAP software. This change was driven in part by a recent review of our North American system strategy. As Richard mentioned at the Investor Meeting, we are still very committed to the implementation of SAP across our global operations over the next few years. 
As discussed on our fourth quarter call, the fourth item is a one-time charge of $120 million or $0.07 a share for the revaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela as a result of the devaluation that occurred in January. 
And lastly, we made a one-time contribution to the PepsiCo Foundation of $100 million or $0.04 a share. This is our first contribution in a couple of years and it should cover the Foundation for at least the next several years. 
Turning to other items. In the quarter, we repurchased $940 million in common stock or about 14 million shares. However it's important to note that $205 million of that cost was actually paid in the second quarter because we executed the repurchases in the final days of the first quarter. 
Our reported tax rate in the quarter was a benefit of 2% mostly driven by the impact of the bottling transactions, which includes a reversal of deferred taxes attributed to previously held equity interest in the bottlers. The resolution of certain tax matters contributed about a one percentage point to the decline in the reported tax rate versus Q1 of last year. The benefit of 2% is a 27 percentage point change versus Q1 of last year. 
Excluding the impact of items affecting comparability, our core tax rate was 23% for the first quarter. 
Now let me turn to our guidance for the full year. We are still targeting 11% to 13% quarter core constant currency EPS growth off of our fiscal 2009 core EPS of $3.71. We expect roughly 6% growth in core constant currency EPS in the first half of the year which includes a charge of about $40 million after-tax related to the healthcare legislation that was signed into law at the beginning of our second quarter. 
In the second half of the year, we expect our core constant currency EPS growth rate to be in the midteens. Based on current spot rates, foreign exchange translation would be about a one point headwind for us on a full year core constant currency EPS growth. 
It's important for me to note that when we file our full-year pro formas for 2009 on Form 8-Ka later today, you will see a few pennies more of upside related to the transactions than we had last estimated translating to about $0.17 a share, or $0.02 more of accounting and financing upsides in 2010. We plan to invest this additional $0.02 in our business this year. 
Turning to our full-year reported tax rate, we expect the rate to be between 23% and 24%, which includes a benefit of about four percentage points from the items affecting comparability that I mentioned earlier. 
For the year, we expect management operating cash flow, excluding certain items and net of capital expenditures to be approximately $5.6 billion. Net CapEx should total about $3.6 billion, which includes about $200 million in capital investments related to the bottler integration. 
And lastly, we anticipate that in total, we will spend roughly $4.4 billion on share repurchases this year. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Operator?"

First of all, on pricing, again if you look at the quarter from a bottling standpoint, period three was the only period included. In period three, our net revenue per case was up about three points so good, strong, balanced pricing as you’ve come to know us for. I'd say on the broad pricing environment, we continue to view a rational pricing environment. Again, as Hugh mentioned and as I mentioned at the analyst meeting, I think given the environment, we are trying to strike the right balance between volume and price and I think you can expect that to continue. As we look to the remainder of the year, we're going to look to see pricing somewhere in that 2% to 3% range. In terms of the volume, more recently we've seen our cold drink and specifically the convenience channel improve sequentially. And so we're actually pretty encouraged by what we saw as the quarter unfolded and that’s continued. Obviously, the good weather in the last month or so has helped us start second quarter."

That it was not going to be a volume at all cost. We're going to not chase pricing down. And as Eric just said, we're looking very carefully at this mix of volume share and value share so we don't just compete in this business by dropping pricing, especially to push a volume number. And then the second thing we've been doing is pruning the portfolio. Where we have product lines that really don't make sense to invest in long-term because the profit outlook is really not optimal, we have been de-emphasizing it. And Hugh referred to the case pack water, which we deemphasized in the quarter. In the investor meeting, we talked about some juice drinks, shelf-stable juice drinks, which the value proposition wasn't very attractive and so over the year, we started to deemphasize that until we found a new way to compete in that business in a profitable way. So the numbers were impacted by that. The second is that, remember, our quarter was different than the rest of the industry, in that we didn't have the Easter benefit in our quarter.

So I wouldn't use the word drag, I'd view it as China investment opportunity. And in terms of AMEA overall, I think there were two issues that impacted the leverage. One is the China Investment.

On the margin side, we’ve said all along that we expect 2010 to be a year where the profit growth in the business is going to be higher than we've done historically. And then our volume would be in the sort of the low single-digit range, and this is not a year where we’re going to get a lot of price mix. So yes, there will be margin expansion at Frito-Lay during the course of the year. That's going to come through two areas. One is there is deflation in the business and two is the practices on productivity there continue to step up.  We are making investments back into the business so that we can keep the volume growing, and while we grew volume 1% in the quarter, it sort of – I’d look at it in two different ways. One is sort of the core salty business is growing at its historical rate in large-format stores, and where our value has been impacted has been in the small format stores, c-stores and food service. So once that starts to turn, I think we’ll see Frito-Lay back to sort of its 2% to 3% growth rate that we've historically achieved. In our adjacencies side of the business that I talked about at the investor conference, this Stacy’s business, the Sabra business, the Quaker Snacks business that we execute through Frito-Lay continue to grow, double digits in some cases in the high single digits in others. So I think we've got a nice mix between the core and the adjacencies. The large format business remains strong and once the small format business turns then the total volume growth in the company will be back to where it is.  We will expand margins at Frito-Lay this year, while investing back in the business. So a good start to Frito-Lay in the first quarter."

I am very pleased to report that the solid performance in the quarter, we more than delivered on our first half profit tug, with EPS growth of 7%. Net revenue for the quarter rose 37% and core division operating",1462,"Thank you, Lynn, and good morning everyone. I am very pleased to report that the solid performance in the quarter, we more than delivered on our first half profit tug, with EPS growth of 7%. Net revenue for the quarter rose 37% and core division operating profit grew 26%.
There are five key highlights in the quarter that show the success of our execution and the opportunities we have going forward. First, we drove broad-based growth across our global snacks and beverage portfolio, especially in emerging markets like India, where strong marketplace execution and investments in infrastructure drove double-digit volume growth in both snacks and beverages.
Second, we largely completed the integration of PBG and PAS in Mexico and Europe, and we are making great progress in North America. In Russia, for example, the integration of PBG and Lebedyansky now makes us the largest multinational food and beverage business in that country, giving us tremendous scale advantages. Globally, this bottling transaction is enabling us to fuel incremental Power of One opportunities, which I will talk more about in a few minutes.
Third, we made incremental investments in strategic initiatives to enhance our competitive position to short term, improve our earnings profile and unlock long-term growth opportunities. As you know, we have committed to spending roughly $0.10 per share this year on these investments. Year-to-date, we have spent about $0.02 a share on projects such as expanding our beverage portfolio in China where we are expanding our footprint through additional routes, coolers and expanded sales capabilities. We have also invested in long-term research and development and innovation to support our NutritionCo initiatives. And we have made investments in our sustainability initiatives like our partnership with waste management.
Fourth, we continue to drive our management operating cash flow, bringing the year-to-date increase to 26% excluding certain items. Fifth, we continue to return value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing the total so far this year to nearly $5 billion. And earlier this year, we announced that we have raised our annual divided by 7%.
Now, we achieved all of these results with strong marketing programs, innovation and productivity improvements. The macroeconomic environment especially in the developed markets, Eastern Europe and some parts of Latin America have not been particularly good, but our teams did a superb job navigating through these rough economic waters. And while global GDP growth is improving in some countries, the overall operating environment remains challenging as persistent high unemployment raise on consumer confidence in spending. Regardless of these dynamics, our significant and expanding thought portfolio, our broad geographic footprint, and our focus on productivity positions us well to deliver on our commitment.
As we move forward into the balance of the year and beyond, we are keenly focused on executing on our key strategic initiatives. First, continuing to transform our beverage portfolio in North America. The investments we made last year are coming to bear fruit, such as the launch of our Gatorade G Series, which is helping to drive growth and improved profitability in Gatorade. In fact, our Gatorade marketing team has been recognized by their peers for excellence in the repositioning of this great brand. The integrated Gatorade Replay campaign, which restages classic games between the nation’s biggest sports rivals earned top honors at the 2010 Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival.
Replay also picked up bronze and silver lines in the categories of digital and media respectively. Our highly leveraged A&M strategy with Gatorade, which utilizes all channels of communication, coupled with product innovation is driving consistent improvements in brands of course. In fact, the perception of Gatorade improved significantly after the G Series launch, underscoring a halo effect on the rest of the Gatorade portfolio.
In the second half of this year, we also plan to launch our first mainstream all natural carbonated soft drink, Sierra Mist Natural made with real sugar. And we just re-launched Pepsi Max as part of an effort to strengthen up position in diet colas and make progress on our global commitment to sugar reduction. I hope you saw the great commercial on television which debuted yesterday.
In macrosnacks, we are delivering differentiated value to increasingly cost-conscious consumers. Our goal, particularly in developed markets, is to grow our customer base by providing relevant innovation that they value while carefully monitoring price points, and this strategy is paying off. In Europe, for example, we will continue to leverage strong commercial activity, with promotions like sandwich in the UK and ‘Do Us A Flavor’ in Turkey which drove excellent consumer engagement and growth in the quarter.
We have a lot of headroom for growth in terms of both portfolio and geographic expansion and also in terms of greater efficiencies, and we will continue to execute on all of this. Third, through NutritionCo, we are expanding and growing our ‘good for you’ products and initiatives. We have made major progress on framing of global strategy and roadmap to build what we believe can be a $30 billion business by 2020, while identifying growth ideas we can put into the market in 2011. You will hear more about this in the coming quarters.
Next, we are sharply focused on delivering our environmental commitment. For example, on the food side of our business, our Sabra joint venture, a market leader in refrigerated dips and spreads opened a new plant in Virginia, which is expected to qualify as one of the only food processing factories in the US to achieve silver certification under the US Green Building Council LEED certification program. And lastly, with integration of the bottlers, we have reinvigorated our Power of One effort, and let me take a deeper dive into this for you now.
In the US, one of the areas we are focused on is, is leveraging our portfolio to drive growth across our businesses within the food service channel. We have expanded our partnerships with distributors to deliver our beverage products to locally-owned restaurants and other food service outlets in select markets where we have company-owned bottling operations. While DSD continues to be our primary route to market, we have a long history of working with distributors in the snacks side of our portfolio, and we view this as an attractive long-term growth opportunity in beverages. In fact, this added flexibility contributed to the growth of our food service business in this quarter.
Another example in food service is Taco Bell’s ground-breaking new $2 meal deal, featuring a choice of a Taco Bell entrée along with a bag of Doritos and a Pepsi Fountain Drink. This has been a great success, driving traffic and helping Taco Bell cement their value position in the quick-serve restaurant marketplace. Also in the US, we launched a number of Power of One activities across both large and small format channels. In grocery, we currently have Pepsi and Frito Power of One programs covering over 200 customers or over 70% of our volume in those channels for the 100 days of summer.
In the second quarter, this initiative helped to drive strong growth in dollar sales, positive dollar share change and increased inventory and displaying accounts that executed the program. Throughout the remainder of this summer, we will also have 20-ounce Frito single serve execution in over 20,000 C&G outlets nationwide. An example of how the power of Power of One is being leveraged within beverages is the Gatorade G2 2 for $2 offer that we are running the C&G channel. As you know, G2 is delivered through our DSD routes, while cold Gatorade is in the warehouse system. In the past, we would not have been able to overcome the differing economic incentives to execute such a program. Now we can and as a result, our 20 ounce business is up 6% in C&G year-to-date, and we have seen significant increases in G2 distribution as a result of this joint promotion.
As we move in the back half of the year, we will expand these Power of One opportunities, bringing unique ideas including targeted multi-cultural bundles, which leverage our strong Mexico snack brand, Sabritas with Pepsi, will accelerate our better for you portfolio combinations like Sierra Mist Naturals and SunChips and we will do more like the traditional promotions around football and Halloween. The progress we are already making in Power of One initiative is an important demonstration of the value and potential of our combined organization, largely enabled by our recent Buffalo transaction. This and the progress we are making on our other strategic initiatives gives me great confidence on our ability in deliver on our short-term goals, while making the right investment decisions to drive sustained growth in the future.
With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?

I have had the opportunity to meet with many of you over the last several months, and it’s been gratifying to hear that you are as confident as we are in PepsiCo’s fundamental long-term strength. We are",2894,"Great. Thanks Indra, and good morning everyone. I have had the opportunity to meet with many of you over the last several months, and it’s been gratifying to hear that you are as confident as we are in PepsiCo’s fundamental long-term strength. We are fortunate to operate in large categories, with products that are enjoyed every day by consumers in both developed and emerging economies. The skill and knowledge of our local management teams allow us to thrive amidst the intense competition that you can all see in these categories, capturing strong share positions through a deep understanding of our consumers. Our uniquely powerful brands, great products, and operating capability continue to drive strong growing cash flows. As CFO, I am proud of the financial and operational processes we have in place to sensibly deploy that cash to fuel our long-term growth.
Indra already referenced the strategic investment program that we are undertaking. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, our investment approach stands across three categories. First, we are accelerating investments in emerging economies to enable new product platforms and to strengthen our selling and distribution infrastructure. Second, we are investing behind each of our strategic initiatives, such as North American beverage platforms, NutritionCo, and sustainability. And third, we are investing to enhance the top and bottom line productivity of our base business through portfolio transformation, go-to-market, and the rollout of SAP. We see lots of opportunities to accelerate topline growth and enhanced margins through this investment approach, while at the same time generating a sustainable growing cash return to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.
As I will review our results, I think you will see that against the challenging macro backdrop, each of our businesses is fully committed to delivering solid results and enhancing its competitiveness in the near term, while investing to build in even stronger base for future growth.
So, with that, let me start with PAF. FLNA posted a 3% decline in volume, a 1% increase in net revenue, and a 7% increase in operating profit. These results were well in line with our expectations, as FLNA began to overlap the 20% more free promotion from last year. We estimate that this promotion added about 3 points of volume growth in Q2 of last year through the beginning of Q4. Despite the decline in volume, units were up low-single digits in the quarter and FLNA drove positive leverage to revenue and then to operating profit. That was driven by improved cost, but also by productivity and excellent management of the middle of the P&L, and we achieved this while investing in infrastructure and innovation to grow both the core portfolio and better for you products.
Highlights in the quarter included value share gains in salty snacks, demonstrating the strength of our brands, driven by improved performance in the convenience-and-gas store and food service channels and the success of innovation such as new Lay's Kettle Cooked Potato Chips, which use natural ingredients and great new regional flavors such as Harvest Ranch in the east, and Crinkle Cut Spice Rubbed barbeque in the west. Q2 also benefitted from our Q1 launch of lightly salted Fritos and Ruffles with 50% less salt as well as high teens volume growth in variety packs, which provide both control and value. Investments in branding and marketing helped to drive volume for our Stacy's Pita Chips brand, up nearly 40% in the quarter. And as Indra mentioned, our Sabra JV recently opened a new plant in Virginia. This facility more than doubles the production capacity for Sabra and is a prime example of progress we are making to expand into adjacent categories in our macro snacks business.
Turning to Quaker, volume was down 2%, net revenue was down 6%, and operating profit was down 14%. There is no doubt we would have liked stronger performance from this iconic health and wellness brand. The fact is we have underinvested in this brand and we are now moving forward with a plan to refocus, strengthen and extend the advantages of the Quaker portfolio by improving quality, aggressive investment and innovation and delivering greater differentiation in the marketplace. Quaker is an important part of our NutritionCo initiative, and we are investing to build layers of advantage in everything from consumer insights to product innovation, to productivity, to enhancements proceed to shelf supply chain management. I should note that this will take some time.
In the interim, QFNA has stepped up near-term innovation and value initiatives, which we believe will drive improved performance through the back half of this year and beyond. For example, in the second half of this year, we are improving the texture of our core instant oatmeal products and reducing salt and sugar. We are also introducing a multi-brand oatmeal for adults and a fun new product for kids called Kids Creations. So, we have a clear plan for Quaker to drive improvement in the short term and as importantly, to strengthen our competitive position and expand our portfolio to regain long-term growth.
In Latin American Foods, volume was up 2%, net revenue was up 6%, and operating profit was down 7%. In the quarter, our teams faced challenging macros in Venezuela as well as increases in commodities like sugar, potatoes, and cocoa. In addition, the division absorbed the cost of a one-time legal settlement. Despite these challenges, the teams navigated extremely well by taking pricing actions, leveraging price architecture and implementing excellent cost control and management of middle of the P&L. In fact, if you exclude Venezuela and the one-time legal settlement, operating profit was up 3%. Investments we spoke about on the Q1 call in value, brand and infrastructure helped to drive growth in volume and revenue as well as improvements in share. For example, at Sabritas, we had a route and racks increasing penetration and the frequency with which we service our customers. We are also realizing the benefits of innovation and value with brands like Pake-Taxo, which has reached 4% of Sabritas’ sales. Gamesa which took pricing to cover higher costs attained its highest value share ever, widening the gap with its closest competitor. Gamesa’s performance also benefited from investments in new routes. In the quarter, the number of accounts serviced increased 26% year-over-year.
Now, turning to PepsiCo Americas Beverages, volume was up 13%, net revenue was up 112%, and operating profit was up 80% as we benefited from the acquisition of our two anchor bottlers. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, volume in North America was down 1%, up 4.5 points sequential improvement versus the first quarter. PAB is keenly focused on unlocking the strategic financial and operational benefits of the bottling acquisitions. As Indra mentioned earlier, the teams have been focused on optimizing the business by driving Power of One opportunities, identifying topline and profit growth opportunities, aligning system economics, streamlining the supply chain and increasing the flexibility of our go-to-market system.
On the operating side, we have largely completed the structure and staffing of PBC, including the elimination of several hundred positions. We have also changed the structure of our food service organization, to better capture growth opportunities and introduce new PepsiCo account teams to major retailers. In terms of driving efficiencies, we have improved our sourcing across the US CSD system to drive savings, including moving 4 million cases to lower cost production facilities, and we have reduced transportation cost by leveraging our combined scale and assets to eliminate about 500,000 transportation miles. We are also making great measurable progress in marketing and innovation, evidenced by improving brand scores, third-party recognition of marketing excellence and improvement in growth trajectories across the portfolio. Some examples include hydration which includes strength in water, we executed the successful launch of the G Series in retail channels as well as G Series Pro in GMC on May 1st and Dick’s Sporting Goods on June 1st, driving positive volume growth in Gatorade for the first time in two years.
Also in hydration, PEP gained 2 points of value share in enhanced water, driven by the continued strong performance of SoBe Lifewater, which is now the Number 2 enhanced water brand in measured channels. In nourishment, which includes juice and juice drinks, we saw a sequential improvement on the strength of Trop50 and juice strength as well as a strong promotional calendar. And in enjoyment, which includes CSDs and ready-to-drink teas, the trajectory of CSDs continue to improve, benefiting from increased awareness generated by the Pepsi Refresh project, Trademark Dew and DEWmocracy and strong promotional activity in unmeasured channels. Teas had a strong quarter with Lipton ready-to-drink tea volume up mid-teens in measured channels, aided by about 70% volume growth in brisk, which was driven by the success of the one leader package.
There is no doubt that category dynamics in North America are still very challenging. We are being surgical about delivering value to the consumer where it’s appropriate, and we are driving the optimal balance between volume and pricing. It’s clear that the steps we are taking to rebuild the beverage portfolio are working and driving positive results. We will continue to execute on these plans while remaining committed to improved margins overtime to deliver greater consumer value in the marketplace.
In Europe, snack volume was up 2%, beverage volume up 10%, net revenue up 43%, and operating profit up 25%. This is the first quarter that our acquisitions of PBG and PAS are reflected in our international results, and the pickup of the bottling operations largely drove these results. The acceleration we spoke about in Q1 did in fact continue in the second quarter, and the teams did an excellent job driving improved sequential performance and broad-based gains across both our snacks and beverage businesses. Despite challenging macro conditions, Europe’s strong performance was driven by a consistent focus on growth, innovative consumer value initiative and a continued track record of driving productivity. In snacks, we saw improved category performance across both Western and Eastern Europe, underpinned by strong commercial programs like our sandwich promotion in the UK, and Turkey’s Do Us A Flavor program for Doritos. Portfolio transformation continues across Europe with the Matu Seeds launch in Iberia, and we continue to expand our local relevance in Russia with the launch of Cruesti Deer Sticks.
Key product initiatives in the second half of this year include the kickoff of our soccer promotional activity in June across the majority of our markets, and we expect our Walkers Flavor Cup to be bigger than the Do Us A Flavor program of Q1 2009. In beverages, we executed a seamless integration of the bottlers and our relative market share remains strong in all strategic markets. Volume grew 4% and on an organic basis, which was nearly a 9-point improvement versus the first quarter. This was driven by stronger performance across both eastern and western markets. Consumer-centric commercial programs drove the specially strong beverage share performance in key markets, specifically Russia, Turkey, Spain, the UK, and Germany. In Western Europe, we continue to drive growth with the new Lipton expansion in France, and in the UK, we completed the introduction of the new Tropicana flavor pack lineup. Also in the UK, we launched a new single-serve package specifically for our no-sugar products, driving single-serve share gains.
In general, while volume momentum clearly improved in Q2, we are prudently operating under the assumption that we will continue to face a challenging environment in this market. We are staying focused on differentiated consumer value with a strong commercial calendar including programs like the soccer in both snacks and beverages. With currencies likely to continue to fluctuate, we believe that the combination of our balanced portfolio across both products and geographies, our ability to localize costs, and our hedging programs position us well for the remainder of the year.
In AMEA, snack volume was up 16%, beverage volume was up 8%, net revenue grew 15%, and operating profit rose 6%. Broad-based gains in the region drove topline momentum and as expected, profit growth decelerated versus the first quarter as we expanded our strategic investments program, a very strong productivity agenda and tight cost controls helped offset the cost pressures. In snacks, volume growth was driven by double-digit growth in key emerging markets such as India, Egypt, China, and Pakistan, as the business benefited from their focus on value, innovation and an expanding footprint. AMEA snack highlights include the highest ever volume months for India in May, driven by their local digital version of the Do Us A Flavor and value initiatives. The launch of Doritos in New Zealand, Quaker Drinkable Oats in the Philippines, Quaker Congee in China, and Lay’s flavor extensions in Saudi, South Africa and China all benefited our snacks business.
In beverages, volume growth was driven by broad gains in India, Pakistan, Egypt, the Philippines, and Thailand. In China, volume was up 2% as very strong growth in NCVs more than offset a sluggish CSD market. The business gained relative share in CSDs in the quarter in China, benefiting from our investments to expand market presence. Successful product launches included Mountain Dew in Malaysia, a new Lipton flavor in H2O in Saudi, a new flavor (inaudible) in China and Pepsi Cheer in Thailand.
Now, let me turn to our outlook for the year. As you think about our performance for the balance of the year, there are several puts and takes that we expect and that you should take into consideration. First FLNA will continue to experience pressure on volume growth as it overlaps the impact of the 20% more free promotion from last year. They will stop overlapping this at the beginning of the fourth quarter. During this timeframe, we will be focused on driving unit growth. In addition to their other initiatives, FLNA is focused on driving growth and we are confident that the business will post strong operating profit growth for the year, as well as growth in volume and in revenue.
Second, we will continue our stepped up levels of investments in R&D and innovation in QFNA as we reposition this brand. Third, while we see improving trends in LAF, we are mindful that several of the economies in the region are under significant pressure and will have to continue to balance cost pressures with providing value in the marketplace. Fourth, in the third quarter, we will overlap a one-time gain in AMEA, which was in our quarter results, associated with the contribution of our snacks business in Japan to form a joint venture with Calbee Foods company, the snacks market leader in Japan. This gain was worth about 30 points of profit growth for AMEA in the third quarter last year.
In the second half of this year, we have accelerated our strategic investments across the entire portfolio and this will also have the most noticeable impact on our profit growth in AMEA. This, in combination with the overlap of the Calbee gain, will drive even more deleverage between top and bottom line in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Our disciplined approach ensures that we are measuring returns and non-investing ahead of people capabilities. We take a very long view of this region and believe these investments will be accretive over the long term.
Fifth, we continue to target $125 million to $150 million in annualized synergies from the bottling acquisitions this year, with $400 million in annualized savings once fully implemented by 2012. And lastly, we still expect our full year reported tax rate to be roughly 23% to 24%, which reflects a benefit of about 4 percentage points for non-core items. This brings me to our full-year core constant currency EPS growth target of 11% to 13%, which is unchanged from last quarter. Based on current spot rates, foreign exchange translation would be about a 1 point headwind for us on a full-year core EPS growth. This translates to core EPS growth of about 10% to 12% for the year.
For the year, we expect management operating cash flow excluding certain items and net of capital expenditures to be approximately $5.6 billion. Net CapEx should total about $3.6 billion, which includes about $200 million in capital investments related to the bottler integration. We anticipate that in total, we will spend roughly $4.4 billion on share repurchases this year, and in the third quarter, we expect to make a second $600 million discretionary contribution to PepsiCo’s pension funds, taking advantage of various attractive financing rates.
Before we go to Q&A, let me leave you with what I think are the key takeaways from our first half performance and a world map for PepsiCo for the balance of the year. First, we delivered on our EPS commitments. Second, our teams navigated well, with the proper balance of near-term execution and investments and where appropriate for long-term growth. They achieved this by staying close to their customers and the evolving needs of consumers, despite a very diverse and in certain areas challenging set of macros. Third, we demonstrated excellent P&L discipline including driving productivity. Fourth, we made real progress on our strategic imperatives, and fifth, we made measurable and observable progress in NAB, consistent with the goals that we shared with you.
With that, I would like to turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator?

Yes, our single-serve flex business did improve sequentially in the quarter versus Q1, and I think it was driven by two factors. One is our C&G business is strengthening and that business, that channel grew around 3% to 4% for us that had been flat to slightly declining in Q4 of 2009 and Q1 of this year. The second is the food service business, and in part, that was driven by the national distribution of Doritos in Taco Bell, but food service more broadly are strengthening for us, notably at Subway and some other customers. So, together single-serve flex performed much better, and the Power of One initiative that we have just kicked off for the C&G channel this summer, I think will all strengthen that. The first time question, Bill, was one where the category continues to grow in line with population growth, around 1% volume growth, and we are growing slightly faster that particularly in dollars. And if you look at Frito-Lay year-to-date, it still remains the fastest growing consumer package goods company in North America and not by a small measure but by almost 2 to 3 points relative to most other consumer package goods companies.
The only businesses that are posting positive growth year-to-date are store brands other than Frito-Lay. So, I still think that Frito-Lay is growing stronger, we have great programs coming in the back half of the year. As we had in the prepared comments where we begin to laugh with 20% more free bags positively in Q4 of this year. We have even greater deflation in the back half of the year. So, I think Frito-Lay was strengthened in the back half.

I think the G Series launch and, you know, having a differentiated offering for GMC and Dick’s Sporting Goods versus mainstream channels is the first time in, I think 10 years that we have had such major innovation coming from Gatorade which is really the category and the first time that sports enthusiasts all over the world, I mean, real participants are having meaningful hydration innovation brought to them. So, we are very optimistic about the innovation pipeline. Remember, we are just about three or four months into the launch and while the early indications are very positive, I think there is lot more upside to the future, because O1 which is the prime product had to go on allocation very quickly, because the demand was so high for that, we just added capacity.
And our protein recovery products which is O3, I think is the best protein recovery product on the marketplace, and we need to give it its own identity and pump it up. So, we are very optimistic about the future of the whole G Series launch, and as we go into 2011, you will see a lot more innovation around G Series differentiated for different groups, you know, people who exercise versus people who are hardcore athletes. You will see lot of interesting innovation coming out of the Gatorade. So, I think the core Gatorade franchise, the brand equity of course are moving up very, very nicely, the advertising is working, and we feel very good about where Gatorade is headed. So, that’s Gatorade.
Let’s turn to convenience stores. Again, you heard what John Compton said about, the C store business is improving, local food service is improving, all these are positive signs. But let’s not forget that we are still in a difficult economic situation. Unemployment rates are still very, very high and lot of the C-store traffic was driven by construction workers and driven by people who are willing to pay the up-charge, when they go to a C-store, they were willing to pay for convenience. Now, what has happened in C stores is that the value proposition in C stores has improved. C stores themselves have changed their pricing equation and people like PepsiCo have provided very compelling Power of One program to bring traffic back into C stores. So, in a way, I think we are one of the people driving traffic into the C stores. Balance of year, you will see a lot more Power of One initiatives that continue, and our goal is to make C stores a compelling destination for people who don’t want to spend a lot of money in a large format store, but have a small amount of money to just spend to get immediate hydration needs fulfilled or the short-term snacking needs fulfilled. So, that’s our strategy going forward. But I will tell you, given the economic environment, given where we are seeing all of the unemployment figures headed, let’s take it a quarter at a time and look and see how this whole C store business evolves. I don’t want to make any prediction for how this is going to evolve balance of the year.

We were very, very sensitized focusing on making sure we had, we strike the right balance between price and volume, and to make sure we continue to have the right consumer value price points. Power of One gives us an opportunity to provide added value beyond clearly price promotion, and I think the reality is, is the environment is pretty rationale, and I think at the same time we need to stay very disciplined about how we think about pricing. So, I think our track record speaks for itself and you can continue to look for us to strike that right balance based on the conditions in the marketplace.

One, what we previously told you, 6% roughly in the first half and mid teens in the second half. Obviously we over-delivered and hit 7% in the first half rather than the 6%, but we haven’t changed to full year. So, the balance of year changes down a bit. In terms of operating deleverage, really the investments are going to hit across the P&L. So, it’s not one particular line item, I wouldn’t necessarily focus on SG&A versus other areas. It’s going to hit in different areas of the P&L. Certainly, we can help you a little bit with modeling that, but the net of it is we said we were going to invest about a dime, we have invested $0.02, which means we will be investing about $0.08 in the balance of the year, and that will hit across the P&L.

I think if you think about volume, I think as you have mentioned, we saw our CSD business perform a little better down low-single digit, non-carb business was very strong and actually our water business was strong led by the enhanced water performance in Lifewater. So, I think all three sub segments performed, but as I go back to the point I made earlier about striking the right balance between volume and price given the environment, if you think about what happened on price year-to-date, the reality is, is that the rate increases that we had planned to take and we did take, you are really seeing that a fairly significant mix shift. And the mix shift in the quarter took place with our mix shift moving into cans, we actually saw some shift within cans particularly the Cube in the quarter and as well as mix into unflavored water. So, I think the important thing to note is again, we are going to strike the right balance. As we look forward, as I mentioned earlier, we plan to be very disciplined and look at the Labor Day timeframe to put some pricing into the marketplace.

I'm very pleased to report that the solid performance in the quarter. We more than delivered on our first-half profit target, with EPS growth of 7%. Net revenue for the quarter rose 37%, and core division opera",1447,"Thank you, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report that the solid performance in the quarter. We more than delivered on our first-half profit target, with EPS growth of 7%. Net revenue for the quarter rose 37%, and core division operating profit grew 26%. There are five key highlights in the quarter that show the success of our execution and the opportunities we have going forward. 
First, we drove broad-based growth across our global Snacks and Beverage portfolio, especially in emerging markets like India, where strong market-based execution and investments in infrastructure drove double-digit volume growth in both Snacks and Beverages. 
Second, we largely completed the integration of PBG and PAS in Mexico and Europe. And we're making great progress in North America. In Russia, for example, the integration of PBG and Lebedyansky now makes us the largest multinational Food and Beverage business in that country, giving us tremendous scale advantages. Globally, this bottling transaction is enabling us to fuel incremental Power of One opportunities, which I will talk more about in a few minutes. 
Third, we made incremental investments in strategic initiatives to enhance our competitive position in the short-term, improve our earnings profile and unlock long-term growth opportunity. As you know, we've committed to spending roughly $0.10 per share this year on these investments. Year-to-date, we have spent about $0.02 a share on projects such as expanding our beverage footprint in China, where we are expanding our footprint for additional routes, coolers and expanded sales capabilities. We've also invested in long-term research and development and innovation to support our NutritionCo initiatives. And we've made investments in our sustainability initiatives like our partnership with Waste Management.  
Fourth, we continue to drive our management offering cash flow, bringing the year-to-date increase to 26% excluding certain items. 
Fifth, we continue to return value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing the total so far this year to nearly $5 billion. And earlier this year, we announced that we raised our annual dividend by 7%. 
Now we have achieved all these results with strong marketing programs, innovation and productivity improvements. The macroeconomic environment, especially in the developed market, Eastern Europe and some parts of Latin America, have not been particularly good, but our teams did a superb job navigating through these rough economic water. And while global GDP growth is improving in some countries, the overall operating environment remains challenging as persistent high unemployment raise on consumer confidence and spending. 
Regardless of these dynamics, our significant and expanding Product portfolio, our broad geographic footprint and our focus on productivity positions us well to deliver on our commitments. As we move forward into the balance of the year and beyond, we are keenly focused on executing on our key strategic initiatives. 
First, continuing to transform our Beverage portfolio in North America. The investments we made last year are starting to bear fruit such as the launch of our Gatorade G Series, which is helping to drive growth and improved profitability in Gatorade. In fact, our Gatorade marketing team has been recognized by their peers for excellence in the repositioning of this great brand. The integrated Gatorade Replay campaign, which restate this classic games between the nation's biggest sports rivals, earned top honors at the 2010 Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. Replay also picked up Bronze and Silver Lions in the categories of digital and media, respectively. 
Our highly leveraged aim and strategy with Gatorade, which utilizes all channels of communication, coupled with product innovation, is driving consistent improvements in brand scores. In fact, the perception of Gatorade improved significantly after the G Series launch, underscoring is halo effect on the rest of the Gatorade portfolio. 
In the second half of this year, we also plan to launch our first mainstream all-natural carbonated soft drink, Sierra Mist Naturals, made with real sugar. And we just relaunched Pepsi Max as part of an effort to strengthen our position in diet colas and make progress on a global commitment to sugar reduction. I hope you saw the great commercial on television, which debuted yesterday. 
In Macro Snacks, we're delivering differentiated value to increasingly cost-conscious consumers. Our goal, particularly in developed market, is to grow our customer base by providing relevant innovation that they value, while carefully monitoring price points. And this strategy is paying off. In Europe, for example, we will continue to leverage strong commercial activity with promotions like sandwich in the U.K. and Do Us A Flavor in Turkey, which drove excellent consumer engagement in growth in the quarter. There were a lot of headroom for growth in terms of both portfolio and geographic expansion, and also in terms of greater efficiencies, and we will continue to execute on all of these. 
Third, through NutritionCo, we are expanding and growing our Good for You products and initiatives. We've made major progress on claiming a billboard strategy and roadmap to build what we believe can be a $30 billion business by 2020 while identifying growth ideas, we can put into the market in 2011. You will hear more about this in the coming quarters. 
Next, we are sharply focused on delivering our environmental commitment. For example, on the Food side of our business, our Sabra joint venture, a market leader in refrigerated dips and spreads, opened a new plant in Virginia, which is expected to qualify as one of the only food-processing factories in the U.S. to achieve silver certification under the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED certification program. And lastly, with the integration of the bottlers, we have reinvigorated our Power of One efforts, and let me take a deeper dive into this for you now. 
In the U.S., one of the areas we're focused on, which is leveraging our portfolio to drive growth across our businesses, is in the FoodService Channel. We've expanded our partnerships with distributors to deliver our beverage products to locally owned restaurants and other FoodService outlets in select markets where we have company-owned bottling operations. While DSD continues to be our primary route-to-market, we have a long history of working with distributors in the Snack side of our portfolio and we view this as an attractive long-term growth opportunity in beverages. In fact, this added flexibility contributed to the growth of our FoodService business in this quarter. Another example in FoodService is Taco Bell's ground-breaking new $2 Meal Deal, featuring a choice of a Taco Bell entree, along with a bag of Doritos and a Pepsi fountain drink. This has been a great success, driving traffic and helping Taco Bell cement their value position in the quick-serve restaurant marketplace. 
Also in the U.S., we launched a number of Power of One activities across both large and small format channels. In grocery, we currently have Pepsi and Frito part of one program, covering over 200 customers all over 70% of our volume in those channels for the 100 Days of Summer. In the second quarter, this initiative helped to drive strong growth in dollar sales, positive dollar share change an increase inventory on display and accounts that executed the program. 
Throughout the remainder of the summer, we'd also have 20-ounce CSD and Frito single-serve execution in over 20,000 C&G outlets nationwide. An example of how the power of Power of One is being leveraged within beverages is that Gatorade G2 2 for $2 offer that we're running in the C&G channel. As you know, G2 is delivered through our DSD routes, while Cool Gatorade is in our warehouse system. In the past, we would have not been able to overcome the differing economic incentives to execute such a program. Now we can, and as a result, our 20-ounce business is up 6% in C&G year-to-date, and we've seen significant increases in G2 distribution as a result of this joint promotion. 
As we move on to the back half of the year, we will expand this Power of One opportunities, bringing unique ideas including targeted multicultural bundles, which leverage our strong Mexico snack brand Sabritas with Pepsi. We'll accelerate our  ""better-for-you"" portfolio combinations like Sierra Mist Naturals and SunChips, and we'll do more like the traditional schematic promotions that are in Football and Halloween. The progress we are already making in Power of One initiative is an important demonstration of the value and potential of our combined organization, largely enabled by a recent bottler transaction. This and the progress we're making on our other strategic initiatives gives me great confidence in our ability to deliver on our short-term goals while making the right investment decisions to drive sustained growth in the future. With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?"
32854,106901382,67863,"Pepsico, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2010",2010-07-20,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Indra, and good morning, everyone. I've had the opportunity to meet with many of you over the last several months and it's been gratifying to hear that you're as confident as we are in PepsiCo's fundamental long-term strength. We're fortuna",2875,"Great. Thanks, Indra, and good morning, everyone. I've had the opportunity to meet with many of you over the last several months and it's been gratifying to hear that you're as confident as we are in PepsiCo's fundamental long-term strength. We're fortunate to operate in large categories with products that are enjoyed everyday by consumers in both developed and emerging economies. The scale and knowledge of our local management teams allow us to thrive amid the intense competition that you can all see in these categories, capturing strong share positions through a deep understanding of our consumers. Our uniquely powerful brands, great products and operating capability continue to drive strong growing cash flows. 
As CFO, I'm proud of the financial and operational processes we have in place to sensibly deploy that cash to fuel our long-term growth. Indra already referenced the strategic investment program that we are undertaking. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, our investment approach stands across three categories. First, we're accelerating investments in emerging economies to enable new product platforms and to strengthen our selling and distribution infrastructure. Second, we're investing behind each of our strategic initiatives such as North American beverage platforms, NutritionCo and sustainability. And third, we're investing to enhance the top and bottom line productivity of our base business through portfolio transformation, go-to-market and the rollout of SAP. We see lots of opportunities to accelerate topline growth and enhanced margins through this investment approach while at the same time generating a sustainable growing cash return to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. 
As I review our results, I think you'll see that against the challenging macro backdrop, each of our businesses is fully committed to delivering solid results and enhancing its competitiveness in the near term, while investing to build an even stronger base for future growth. So with that, let me start with PAF. 
FLNA posted a 3% decline in volume, a 1% increase in net revenue and a 7% increase in operating profit. These results were well in line with our expectations as FLNA began to overlap the 20% More Free promotion from last year. We estimate that this promotion added about three points of volume growth in Q2 of last year through the beginning of Q4. Despite the decline in volume, units were up low-single-digits in the quarter. And FLNA drew a positive leverage to revenue and then to operating profit. That was driven by improved cost but also by productivity and excellent management of the middle of the P&L, and we achieved this while investing in infrastructure and innovation to grow both the core portfolio and ""better-for-you"" products. 
Highlights in the quarter included value share gains in salty snacks, demonstrating the strength of our brand driven by improved performance in the Convenience and Gas store and FoodService Channels and the success of innovations such as new Lay's Kettle Cooked potato chips, which used natural ingredients and great new regional flavors such as Harvest Ranch in the East and Crinkle Cut Spice Rubbed BBQ in the West. Q2 also benefited from our Q1 launch of Lightly Salted Fritos and Ruffles with 50% less salt, as well as high-teens volume growth in variety packs, which provide both portion control and value. 
Investments in branding and marketing helped to drive volume for our Stacy's Pita Chip Brand up nearly 40% in the quarter. And as Indra mentioned, our Sabra JV recently opened a new plant in Virginia. This facility more than doubles the production capacity for Sabra and is a prime example of the progress we're making to expand into adjacent categories in our Macro Snacks business. 
Turning to Quaker. Volume was down 2%, net revenue was down 6% and operating profit was down 14%. There's no doubt we would've liked stronger performance from this iconic health and wellness brand. The fact is, we've under-invested in this brand and we're now moving forward with a plan to refocus, strengthen and extend the advantages of the Quaker portfolio by improving quality, aggressive investment in innovation and delivering greater differentiation in the marketplace. Quaker is an important part of our NutritionCo initiative, and we're investing to build layers of advantage in everything from consumer insights to product innovation, to productivity, to enhancements to exceed the shelf supply chain management. I should note that this will take some time. 
In the interim, QFNA has that stepped up in near-term innovation and value initiatives, which we believe will drive improved performance through the back half of this year and beyond. For example, in the second half of this year, we're improving the texture of our core instant oatmeal products and reducing salt and sugar. We're also introducing a multi-grain oatmeal for adults and a fun new product for kids called Kids Creations. So we have a clear plan for Quaker to drive improvements in the short term and as importantly, to strengthen our competitive position and expand our portfolio to regain long-term growth. 
In Latin American Foods, volume was up 2%, net revenue was up 6%, and operating profit was down 7%. And the quarter, our team's faced challenging macros in Venezuela, as well as increases in commodities like sugar, potatoes and cocoa. In addition, the division absorbed the cost of a one-time legal settlement. Despite these challenges, the teams navigated extremely well by taking pricing actions, leveraging price-backed architecture and implementing excellent cost control and management of middle of the P&L. In fact, if you exclude Venezuela in the one-time legal settlement, operating profit was up 3%. Investments we spoke about on the Q1 call in value, brands and infrastructure helped to drive growth in volume and revenue, as well as improvements in share. For example, at Sabritas, we have added routes and racks, increasing penetration and the frequency with which we service our customers. We're also realizing the benefits of innovation and value with brands like Pocket Patso [ph], which has reached 4% of Sabritas sales. Gamesa, which took pricing to cover higher costs attained its highest value share ever, widening the GAAP with its closest competitor. Gamesa's performance also benefited from investments in new routes. In the quarter, the number of accounts serviced increased 26% year-over-year. 
Now turning to PepsiCo Americas Beverages. Volume was up 13%, net revenue was up 112% and operating profit was up 80% as we benefited from the acquisition of our two anchor bottlers. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, volume in North America was down 1%, a 4.5 point sequential improvement versus the first quarter. 
PAB is keenly focused on unlocking the strategic, financial and operational benefits of the bottling acquisitions. As Indra mentioned earlier, the teams have been focused on optimizing the business by driving Power of One opportunities, identifying top line and profit growth opportunities, aligning system economics, streamlining the supply chain and increasing the flexibility of our go-to-market system. 
On the operating side, we've largely completed the structure and staffing of PBC, including the elimination of several hundred positions. We've also changed the structure of our FoodService organization to better capture growth opportunities and introduce new PepsiCo account teams to major retailers. 
In terms of driving efficiency, we've improved our sourcing across the U.S. DSD system to drive saving including moving 4 million cases to lower-cost production facility, and we've reduced transportation cost by leveraging our combined scale in assets to eliminate about 500,000 transportation models. We're also making great measurable progress in marketing and innovation, evidenced by improving brand scores, third-party recognition of marketing excellence and improvement in growth trajectories across the portfolio. Some example include hydration, which includes sports drinks and water, we executed the successful launch of the G Series in retail channels, as well as G Series Pro and GNC on May 1 and Dick's Sporting Goods on June 1, driving positive volume growth in Gatorade for the first time in two years. 
Also in Hydration, PEP gained two points of value share in enhanced water, driven by the continued strong performance of SoBe Life Water, which is now the number two enhanced water brand in measured channels. In Nourishment, which includes juice and juice drinks, we saw a sequential improvement on the strength of Trop50 and juice drinks, as well as a strong promotional calendar. And in Enjoyment, which excludes CSDs and ready-to-drink teas, the trajectory of CSDs continue to improve, benefiting from increased awareness generated by the Pepsi Refresh project, trademark Do in Democracy [ph] and strong promotional activity in unmeasured channels. Teas had a strong quarter with Lipton ready-to-drink tea volume up mid-teens in measured channels, aided by about 70% volume growth in Brisk, which was driven by the success of the one-liter package. 
There's no doubt that category dynamics in North America are still very challenging. We're being surgical about delivering value to the consumer where it's appropriate, and we are driving the optimal balance between volume and pricing. It's clear that the steps we're taking to rebuild the Beverage portfolio are working and driving positive results. We will continue to execute on these plans while remaining committed to improve margins over time to deliver greater consumer value in the marketplace. 
In Europe, snack volume was up 2%, beverage volume up 10%, net revenue up 43% and operating profit up 25%. This is the first quarter that our acquisitions of PBG and PAS are reflected in our international results, and the pickup of the bottling operations largely drove these results. The acceleration we spoke about in Q1 did, in fact, continue in the second quarter, and the teams did an excellent job driving improved sequential performance and broad-based gains across both our Snacks and Beverage businesses. 
Despite challenging macro conditions, Europe's strong performance was driven by a consistent focus on growth, innovative consumer value initiative and a continued track record of driving productivity. In Snacks, we saw improved category performance across both Western and Eastern Europe, underpinned by strong commercial programs like our sandwich promotion in the U.K. and Turkey's Do Us A Flavor program for Doritos. Portfolio transformation continues across Europe with the Matutano Seeds launch in Iberia, and we continue to expand our local relevance in Russia with the launch of Cruise In [ph] Beer Sticks. 
Key product initiatives in the second half of this year include the kick off of our soccer promotional activity in June across the majority of our markets and we expect our Walkers Flavour Cup to be bigger than the Do Us A Flavor program of Q1 2009. 
In beverages, we executed a seamless integration of the bottlers and our relative market share remains strong in all strategic markets. Volume grew 4% on an organic basis, which was nearly a nine-point improvement versus the first quarter. This was driven by stronger performance across both Eastern and Western markets. Consumer-centric commercial programs drove especially strong beverage share performance in key markets, specifically Russia, Turkey, Spain, U.K. and Germany. 
In Western Europe, we continue to drive growth with the new Lipton expansions in France. And in the U.K., we completed the introduction of a new Tropicana flavor pack lineup. Also in the U.K., we launched a new single-serve package specifically for our no-sugar products driving single surge share gains. 
In general, while volume momentum clearly improved in Q2, we are prudently operating under the assumption that we will continue to face a challenging environment in this market. We are staying focused on differentiated consumer value with a strong commercial calendar, including programs linked to soccer in both Snacks and Beverages. With currencies likely to continue to fluctuate, we believe that the combination of our balanced portfolio across both products and geographies, our ability to localize cost and our hedging programs position us well for the remainder of the year. 
In AMEA, snack volume was up 16%, beverage volume was up 8%, net revenue grew 15% and operating profit rose 6%. Broad-based gains in the region drove topline momentum, and as expected, profit growth decelerated versus the first quarter as we expanded our strategic investments program. A very strong productivity agenda and tight cost controls helped offset the cost pressures. In Snacks, volume growth was driven by double-digit growth in key emerging markets such as India, Egypt, China and Pakistan as the business benefited from their focus on value, innovation and an expanding footprint. 
AMEA's Snack highlights include the highest ever volume month for India in May, driven by their local digital version of the Do Us A Flavor and value initiatives. The launch of Doritos in New Zealand, Quaker drinkable oats in the Philippines, Quaker Congee in China and Lay's flavor extensions in Saudi, South Africa and China, all benefited our Snacks business. 
In beverages, volume growth was driven by broad gains in India, Pakistan, Egypt, the Philippines and Thailand. In China, volume was up 2% as very strong growth in NCBs, more than offset a sluggish CSD market. The business gained relative share in CSDs in the quarter in China, benefiting from our investments to expand market presence. Successful product launches included Mountain Dew in Malaysia, a new Lipton flavor in H2O in Saudi, a new flavor of Guo Bin Fen China and Pepsi Cheer in Thailand. 
Now let me turn to our outlook for the year. As you think about our performance for the balance of year, there are several puts and takes that we expect, and that you should take into consideration. First, FLNA will continue to experience pressure on volume growth as it overlaps the impact of the 20% More Free promotion from last year. They will stop overlapping this at the beginning of the fourth quarter. During this timeframe, we will be focused on driving unit growth. In addition to our other initiatives, FLNA is focused on driving growth, and we are confident that the business will post strong operating profit growth for the year, as well as growth in volume and in revenue. 
Second, we'll continue our stepped up levels of investment in R&D and innovation in QFNA as we reposition this brand. 
Third, while we see improving trends in LAF, we are mindful that several of the economies in the region are under significant pressure and will have to continue to balance cost pressures while providing value in the market place. 
Fourth, in the third quarter, we will overlap a one-time gain in AMEA, which was in our core results associated with the contribution of our Snacks business in Japan to form a joint venture with Calbee Foods Co., the snacks market leader in Japan. This gain was worth about 30 points of profit growth for AMEA in the third quarter last year. In the second half of this year, we've accelerated our strategic investments across the entire portfolio, and this will also have the most noticeable impact on our profit growth in AMEA. This, in combination with the overlap of the Calbee gain, will drive even more deleverage between top and bottom line in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Our disciplined approach ensures that we are measuring returns and not investing ahead of people capabilities. We take a very long view of this region and believe these investments will be accretive over the long-term. 
Fifth, we continue to target $125 million to $150 million in annualized synergies from the bottling acquisitions this year with $400 million in annualized savings once fully implemented by 2012. And lastly, we still expect our full year reported tax rate to be roughly 23% to 24%, which reflects a benefit of about four percentage points from non-core items. This brings me to our full year core constant currency EPS growth target of 11% to 13%, which is unchanged from last quarter. Based on current spot rates, foreign exchange translation would be about a one-point headwind for us on a full year core EPS growth. This translates to core EPS growth of about 10% to 12% for the year. 
For the year, we expect management operating cash flow, excluding certain items and net of capital expenditures, to be approximately $5.6 billion. Net CapEx should total about $3.6 billion, which includes about $200 million in capital investments related to the bottler integration. We anticipate that in total, we will spend roughly $4.4 billion on share repurchases this year, and in the third quarter, we expect to make a second $600 million discretionary contribution to PepsiCo's pension funds, taking advantage of some very attractive financing rates. 
Before we go to Q&A, let me leave you with what I think are the key takeaways from our first half performance and a roadmap for PepsiCo for the balance of the year. First, we delivered on our EPS commitments. Second, our teams navigated well with the proper balance of near-term execution and investments, and we're appropriate for long-term growth. They achieved this by staying close to their customers and the evolving needs of consumers despite a very diverse and in certain areas, challenging set of macros. Third, we demonstrated excellent P&L discipline, including driving productivity. Fourth, we made real progress on our strategic imperatives. And fifth, we made measurable and observable progress in NAB, consistent with the goals that we shared with you.

Yes, our single-serve flex business did improve sequentially in the Q1, versus Q1, and I think it was driven by two factors. One is our C&G business is strengthening and that business, that channel grew around 3% of 4% for us. That had been flat to slightly declining in Q4 of 2009 and Q1 of this year. The second is the FoodService business. And in part, that was driven by the national distribution of Doritos and Taco Bell, but FoodService more broadly was strengthening for us, notably at subway and some other customers. So together, single-served flex performed much better and the Power of One initiative that we've just kicked off for the C&G channel this summer I think all will strengthen that. The purchase dynamics question, Bill, is one where the category continues to grow in line with population growth, around 1% volume growth. And we're growing slightly faster that, particularly in dollars. And if you look at Frito-Lay year-to-date, it still remains the fastest-growing consumer packaged goods company in North America, and not by a small measure but by almost two to three points relative to most other consumer packaged goods company. The only businesses that are posting positive growth year-to-date are store brands other than Frito-Lay. So I still think that Frito-Lay is growing strongly. We have great program incoming in the back half of the year as we head into the prepared comments, we begin to lap the 20% More Free bags positively in Q4 of this year. We have even greater deflation in the back half of the year. So I think Frito-Lay will strengthen in the back half"

I think the G Series launch and having a differentiated offerings with GNC and Dick's Sporting Goods versus mainstream channels is the first time in, I think, 10 years that we've had such major innovation coming from Gatorade, which is really the category. And it's the first time that sports enthusiasts all over the world -- I mean, real participants are having meaningful hydration innovation brought to them. So we're very optimistic about the innovation pipeline. Remember, we're just about three or four months into the launch, and while the early indications are very positive, I think there's a lot more upside in the future because 01, which is a Prime product, had to go on allocation very quickly because the demand was so high for it, and we were just out of capacity. And our protein recovery products, which was 03, I think is the best protein recovery product in on the marketplace, and we need to give it its own identity and pump it up. So we are very and optimistic about the future of the whole G Series launch. And as we go into 2011, you'll see a lot more innovation around G Series, differentiated for different groups. People who exercised versus people who are hard-core athletes. You see a lot of interesting innovation coming out of Gatorade. So I think the core Gatorade franchise, the brand equity scores are moving up very, very nicely. The advertising is working and we feel very good about where Gatorade is headed. So that's Gatorade. Let's turn to convenience stores. Again, you heard what John Compton said about the C-store business is improving. Local food service is improving. All these are positive signs. But let's not forget that we are still in a difficult economic situation. Unemployment rates are still very, very high and lot of the C-store traffic was driven by construction workers and driven by people who are willing to pay the upcharge when they go to a c store, they were willing to pay for convenience. Now what has happened in c-stores is that the value proposition in c-stores has improved. C-stores themselves have changed their pricing equation, and people like PepsiCo have provided very compelling Power of One programs to bring traffic back into c-stores, so in a way, I think we are one of the people driving traffic into the c-stores. Balance of year, you'll see a lot more powerful initiatives that continue. And our goal is to make c-stores a compelling destination for people who don't want to spend a lot of money in a large format store, but have a small amount of money to just spend to get immediate hydration needs fulfilled or their short-term snacking needs fulfilled. So that's our strategy going forward, but I'll tell you, given the economic environment, given where we're seeing all of the unemployment figures headed, let's take it a quarter at a time and look and see how this whole C-store business evolves. I don't want to make any prediction for how this is going to evolve, balance of year."

I'll tell you, the European economy is coming back, at least, for our categories, gives us some room for optimism there, but again, let's watch and see how it evolves over the next couple of quarters, but the second quarter, how the European business performed was pretty good. Latin America, I think parts of Latin America have deteriorated since the last quarter, but Brazil is still very, very strong since you have a big business in Brazil especially our Snacks business, we're doing quite well. But again, I'd say it's a mixed picture in Latin America. And in North America, the rays of hope convenience stores' coming back, and Food Service actually is trending positive, so those are positive signs for PepsiCo. But again Ann, I'd say to you that this is one situation where we've got to look at it every quarter, because the economic environment is not showing consistent improvement across all measures. And so let's watch and see what happens as the year progresses. And every quarter, we'll talk to you and as we make our business with all of you, we'll give you more color, but I'd say that east of the Middle East, positive, Europe is more positive, Latin America mix, and North America is wait and see.
Well, let me just close in and say that, as you think about our performance for the balance of this year and beyond, I want you to keep in mind several important advantages that PepsiCo has that we believe will allow us to achieve our objectives in this environment. First, we have unrivaled portfolio of powerhouse snack and beverage brands with large scale reach in developed and emerging markets. Second, we have localized seed to shelf supply chains. We have advantaged go-to-market system, an increasing scale in key markets. Third, we have experienced management teams and understand the local markets. They're able to unlock growth opportunities by managing cost and cash flows. Fourth, we have a disciplined and rigorous strategic investment program that will fuel future growth and productivity, particularly in emerging markets and adjacent categories. Fifth, we have an aligned organization focused on clear initiatives that drive near-term performance, while at the same time enhancing opportunities for long-term growth. Sixth and lastly, we have a portfolio that works. In any quarter, there will likely be puts and takes on individual businesses, but the overall portfolio works. These attributes are what gives us confidence that PepsiCo can deliver differentiated performance in the second half of this year, providing a strong base for 2011 and beyond. So with that, let me just say thank you for joining us today."

32854,106901382,68099,"Pepsico, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2010",2010-07-20,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report that the solid performance in the quarter. We more than delivered on our first-half profit target, with EPS growth of 7%. Net revenue for the quarter rose 37%, and core division opera",1447,"Thank you, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report that the solid performance in the quarter. We more than delivered on our first-half profit target, with EPS growth of 7%. Net revenue for the quarter rose 37%, and core division operating profit grew 26%. There are five key highlights in the quarter that show the success of our execution and the opportunities we have going forward. 
First, we drove broad-based growth across our global Snacks and Beverage portfolio, especially in emerging markets like India, where strong market-based execution and investments in infrastructure drove double-digit volume growth in both Snacks and Beverages. 
Second, we largely completed the integration of PBG and PAS in Mexico and Europe. And we're making great progress in North America. In Russia, for example, the integration of PBG and Lebedyansky now makes us the largest multinational Food and Beverage business in that country, giving us tremendous scale advantages. Globally, this bottling transaction is enabling us to fuel incremental Power of One opportunities, which I will talk more about in a few minutes. 
Third, we made incremental investments in strategic initiatives to enhance our competitive position in the short-term, improve our earnings profile and unlock long-term growth opportunity. As you know, we've committed to spending roughly $0.10 per share this year on these investments. Year-to-date, we have spent about $0.02 a share on projects such as expanding our beverage footprint in China, where we are expanding our footprint for additional routes, coolers and expanded sales capabilities. We've also invested in long-term research and development and innovation to support our NutritionCo initiatives. And we've made investments in our sustainability initiatives like our partnership with Waste Management.  
Fourth, we continue to drive our management offering cash flow, bringing the year-to-date increase to 26% excluding certain items. 
Fifth, we continue to return value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing the total so far this year to nearly $5 billion. And earlier this year, we announced that we raised our annual dividend by 7%. 
Now we have achieved all these results with strong marketing programs, innovation and productivity improvements. The macroeconomic environment, especially in the developed market, Eastern Europe and some parts of Latin America, have not been particularly good, but our teams did a superb job navigating through these rough economic water. And while global GDP growth is improving in some countries, the overall operating environment remains challenging as persistent high unemployment raise on consumer confidence and spending. 
Regardless of these dynamics, our significant and expanding Product portfolio, our broad geographic footprint and our focus on productivity positions us well to deliver on our commitments. As we move forward into the balance of the year and beyond, we are keenly focused on executing on our key strategic initiatives. 
First, continuing to transform our Beverage portfolio in North America. The investments we made last year are starting to bear fruit such as the launch of our Gatorade G Series, which is helping to drive growth and improved profitability in Gatorade. In fact, our Gatorade marketing team has been recognized by their peers for excellence in the repositioning of this great brand. The integrated Gatorade Replay campaign, which restate this classic games between the nation's biggest sports rivals, earned top honors at the 2010 Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. Replay also picked up Bronze and Silver Lions in the categories of digital and media, respectively. 
Our highly leveraged aim and strategy with Gatorade, which utilizes all channels of communication, coupled with product innovation, is driving consistent improvements in brand scores. In fact, the perception of Gatorade improved significantly after the G Series launch, underscoring is halo effect on the rest of the Gatorade portfolio. 
In the second half of this year, we also plan to launch our first mainstream all-natural carbonated soft drink, Sierra Mist Naturals, made with real sugar. And we just relaunched Pepsi Max as part of an effort to strengthen our position in diet colas and make progress on a global commitment to sugar reduction. I hope you saw the great commercial on television, which debuted yesterday. 
In Macro Snacks, we're delivering differentiated value to increasingly cost-conscious consumers. Our goal, particularly in developed market, is to grow our customer base by providing relevant innovation that they value, while carefully monitoring price points. And this strategy is paying off. In Europe, for example, we will continue to leverage strong commercial activity with promotions like sandwich in the U.K. and Do Us A Flavor in Turkey, which drove excellent consumer engagement in growth in the quarter. There were a lot of headroom for growth in terms of both portfolio and geographic expansion, and also in terms of greater efficiencies, and we will continue to execute on all of these. 
Third, through NutritionCo, we are expanding and growing our Good for You products and initiatives. We've made major progress on claiming a billboard strategy and roadmap to build what we believe can be a $30 billion business by 2020 while identifying growth ideas, we can put into the market in 2011. You will hear more about this in the coming quarters. 
Next, we are sharply focused on delivering our environmental commitment. For example, on the Food side of our business, our Sabra joint venture, a market leader in refrigerated dips and spreads, opened a new plant in Virginia, which is expected to qualify as one of the only food-processing factories in the U.S. to achieve silver certification under the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED certification program. And lastly, with the integration of the bottlers, we have reinvigorated our Power of One efforts, and let me take a deeper dive into this for you now. 
In the U.S., one of the areas we're focused on, which is leveraging our portfolio to drive growth across our businesses, is in the FoodService Channel. We've expanded our partnerships with distributors to deliver our beverage products to locally owned restaurants and other FoodService outlets in select markets where we have company-owned bottling operations. While DSD continues to be our primary route-to-market, we have a long history of working with distributors in the Snack side of our portfolio and we view this as an attractive long-term growth opportunity in beverages. In fact, this added flexibility contributed to the growth of our FoodService business in this quarter. Another example in FoodService is Taco Bell's ground-breaking new $2 Meal Deal, featuring a choice of a Taco Bell entree, along with a bag of Doritos and a Pepsi fountain drink. This has been a great success, driving traffic and helping Taco Bell cement their value position in the quick-serve restaurant marketplace. 
Also in the U.S., we launched a number of Power of One activities across both large and small format channels. In grocery, we currently have Pepsi and Frito part of one program, covering over 200 customers all over 70% of our volume in those channels for the 100 Days of Summer. In the second quarter, this initiative helped to drive strong growth in dollar sales, positive dollar share change an increase inventory on display and accounts that executed the program. 
Throughout the remainder of the summer, we'd also have 20-ounce CSD and Frito single-serve execution in over 20,000 C&G outlets nationwide. An example of how the power of Power of One is being leveraged within beverages is that Gatorade G2 2 for $2 offer that we're running in the C&G channel. As you know, G2 is delivered through our DSD routes, while Cool Gatorade is in our warehouse system. In the past, we would have not been able to overcome the differing economic incentives to execute such a program. Now we can, and as a result, our 20-ounce business is up 6% in C&G year-to-date, and we've seen significant increases in G2 distribution as a result of this joint promotion. 
As we move on to the back half of the year, we will expand this Power of One opportunities, bringing unique ideas including targeted multicultural bundles, which leverage our strong Mexico snack brand Sabritas with Pepsi. We'll accelerate our  ""better-for-you"" portfolio combinations like Sierra Mist Naturals and SunChips, and we'll do more like the traditional schematic promotions that are in Football and Halloween. The progress we are already making in Power of One initiative is an important demonstration of the value and potential of our combined organization, largely enabled by a recent bottler transaction. This and the progress we're making on our other strategic initiatives gives me great confidence in our ability to deliver on our short-term goals while making the right investment decisions to drive sustained growth in the future. With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh. Hugh?"
32854,106901382,68099,"Pepsico, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2010",2010-07-20,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Indra, and good morning, everyone. I have had the opportunity to meet with many of you over the last several months, and it's been gratifying to hear that you're as confident as we are in PepsiCo's fundamental long-term strength. We're fort",2873,"Great. Thanks, Indra, and good morning, everyone. I have had the opportunity to meet with many of you over the last several months, and it's been gratifying to hear that you're as confident as we are in PepsiCo's fundamental long-term strength. We're fortunate to operate in large categories with products that are enjoyed everyday by consumers in both developed and emerging economies. The scale and knowledge of our local management teams allow us to thrive amid the intense competition that you can all see in these categories, capturing strong share positions through a deep understanding of our consumers. Our uniquely powerful brands, great products and operating capability continue to drive strong growing cash flows. 
As CFO, I'm proud of the financial and operational processes we have in place to sensibly deploy that cash to fuel our long-term growth. Indra already referenced the strategic investment program that we are undertaking. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, our investment approach stands across three categories. 
First, we're accelerating investments in emerging economies to enable new product platforms and to strengthen our selling and distribution infrastructure. Second, we're investing behind each of our strategic initiatives such as North American beverage platforms, NutritionCo and sustainability. And third, we're investing to enhance the top and bottom line productivity of our base business through portfolio transformation, go-to-market and the rollout of SAP. 
We see lots of opportunities to accelerate top line growth and enhanced margins through this investment approach while at the same time generating a sustainable growing cash return to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. As I review our results, I think you'll see that against the challenging macro backdrop. Each of our businesses is fully committed to delivering solid results and enhancing its competitiveness in the near term, while investing to build an even stronger base for future growth. 
So with that, let me start with PAF. FLNA posted a 3% decline in volume, a 1% increase in net revenue and a 7% increase in operating profit. These results were well in line with our expectations as FLNA began to overlap the ""20% More Free"" promotion from last year. We estimate that this promotion added about three points of volume growth in Q2 of last year through the beginning of Q4. 
Despite the decline in volume, units were up low single digits in the quarter, and FLNA drew a positive leverage to revenue and then to operating profit. That was driven by improved cost but also by productivity and excellent management of the middle of the P&L, and we achieved this while investing in infrastructure and innovation to grow both the core portfolio and ""better-for-you"" products. 
Highlights in the quarter included value share gains in salty snacks, demonstrating the strength of our brand, driven by improved performance in the convenience and gas store and foodservice channels and the success of innovations, such as new Lay's Kettle Cooked potato chips, which used natural ingredients and great new regional flavors, such as Harvest Ranch in the East and Crinkle Cut Spice Rubbed BBQ in the West. Q2 also benefited from our Q1 launch of Lightly Salted Fritos and Ruffles with 50% less salt, as well as high-teens volume growth in variety packs, which provide both portion control and value. Investments in branding and marketing helped to drive volume for our Stacy's Pita Chip brand, up nearly 40% in the quarter. 
And as Indra mentioned, our Sabra JV recently opened a new plant in Virginia. This facility more than doubles the production capacity for Sabra and is a prime example of progress we're making to expand into adjacent categories in our Macro-Snacks business. 
Turning to Quaker. Volume was down 2%, net revenue was down 6% and operating profit was down 14%. There's no doubt, we would have liked stronger performance from this iconic health and wellness brand. The fact is, we've under-invested in this brand, and we're now moving forward with a plan to refocus, strengthen and extend the advantages of the Quaker portfolio by improving quality, aggressive investment in innovation and delivering greater differentiation in the marketplace. Quaker is an important part of our NutritionCo initiative, and we're investing to build layers of advantage in everything from consumer insights to product innovation, to productivity, to enhancements to seed the shelf supply chain management. I should note that this will take some time. 
In the interim, QFNA has stepped up near-term innovation and value initiatives, which we believe will drive improved performance through the back half of this year and beyond. For example, in the second half of this year, we're improving the texture of our core instant oatmeal products and reducing salt and sugar. We're also introducing a multi-grain oatmeal for adults and a fun new product for kids called Kids Creations. So we have a clear plan for Quaker to drive improvements in the short term and as importantly, to strengthen our competitive position and expand our portfolio to regain long-term growth. 
In Latin American Foods, volume was up 2%, net revenue was up 6%, and operating profit was down 7%. And the quarter, our team's faced challenging macros in Venezuela, as well as increases in commodities like sugar, potatoes and cocoa. In addition, the division absorbed the cost of a one-time legal settlement. 
Despite these challenges, the teams navigated extremely well by taking pricing actions, leveraging price-backed architecture and implementing excellent cost control and management of middle of the P&L. In fact, if you exclude Venezuela in the one-time legal settlement, operating profit was up 3%. 
Investments we spoke about on the Q1 call in value, brands and infrastructure helped to drive growth in volume and revenue, as well as improvements in share. For example, at Sabritas, we have added routes and racks, increasing penetration and the frequency with which we service our customers. We're also realizing the benefits of innovation and value with brands like Paketaxo, which has reached 4% of Sabritas sales. Gamesa, which took pricing to cover higher costs attained its highest value share ever, widening the GAAP with its closest competitor. Gamesa's performance also benefited from investments in new routes. In the quarter, the number of accounts serviced increased 26% year-over-year. 
Now turning to PepsiCo Americas Beverages. Volume was up 13%, net revenue was up 112% and operating profit was up 80% as we benefited from the acquisition of our two anchor bottlers. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, volume in North America was down 1%, a 4.5 point sequential improvement versus the first quarter. 
PAB is keenly focused on unlocking the strategic, financial and operational benefits of the bottling acquisitions. As Indra mentioned earlier, the teams have been focused on optimizing the business by driving Power of One opportunities, identifying top line and profit growth opportunities, aligning system economics, streamlining the supply chain and increasing the flexibility of our go-to-market system. 
On the operating side, we've largely completed the structure and staffing of PBC, including the elimination of several hundred positions. We've also changed the structure of our foodService organization to better capture growth opportunities and introduce new PepsiCo account teams to major retailers. In terms of driving efficiency, we've improved our sourcing across the U.S. DSD system to drive saving including moving 4 million cases to lower-cost production facility, and we've reduced transportation cost by leveraging our combined scale in assets to eliminate about 500,000 transportation models. 
We're also making great measurable progress in marketing and innovation, evidenced by improving brand scores, third-party recognition of marketing excellence and improvement in growth trajectories across the portfolio. Some example include hydration, which includes sports drinks and water, we executed the successful launch of the G Series in retail channels, as well as G Series Pro and GNC on May 1 and Dick's Sporting Goods on June 1, driving positive volume growth in Gatorade for the first time in two years. 
Also in Hydration, PEP gained two points of value share in enhanced water, driven by the continued strong performance of SoBe Life Water, which is now the number two enhanced water brand in measured channels. In Nourishment, which includes juice and juice drinks, we saw a sequential improvement on the strength of Trop50 and juice drinks, as well as a strong promotional calendar. 
And in Enjoyment, which excludes CSDs and ready-to-drink teas, the trajectory of CSDs continue to improve, benefiting from increased awareness generated by the Pepsi Refresh project, trademark Dew and DEWmocracy and strong promotional activity in unmeasured channels. Teas had a strong quarter with Lipton ready-to-drink tea volume up midteens in measured channels, aided by about 70% volume growth in Brisk, which was driven by the success of the one-liter package. 
There's no doubt that category dynamics in North America are still very challenging. We're being surgical about delivering value to the consumer where it's appropriate, and we are driving the optimal balance between volume and pricing. It's clear that the steps we are taking to rebuild the Beverage portfolio are working and driving positive results. We will continue to execute on these plans while remaining committed to improve margins over time to deliver greater consumer value in the marketplace. 
In Europe, snack volume was up 2%; beverage volume, up 10%; net revenue, up 43%; and operating profit, up 25%. This is the first quarter that our acquisitions of PBG and PAS are reflected in our international results, and the pickup of the bottling operations largely drove these results. 
The acceleration we spoke about in Q1 did, in fact, continue in the second quarter, and the teams did an excellent job driving improved sequential performance and broad-based gains across both our Snacks and Beverage businesses. Despite challenging macro conditions, Europe's strong performance was driven by a consistent focus on growth, innovative consumer value initiative and a continued track record of driving productivity. 
In Snacks, we saw improved category performance across both Western and Eastern Europe, underpinned by strong commercial programs like our sandwich promotion in the U.K. and Turkey's Do Us A Flavor program for Doritos. Portfolio transformation continues across Europe with the Matutano Seeds launch in Iberia, and we continue to expand our local relevance in Russia with the launch of Cruise In [ph] Beer Sticks. Key product initiatives in the second half of this year include the kick off of our soccer promotional activity in June across the majority of our markets, and we expect our Walkers Flavour Cup to be bigger than the Do Us A Flavour program of Q1 2009. 
In beverages, we executed a seamless integration of the bottlers and our relative market share remains strong in all strategic markets. Volume grew 4% on an organic basis, which was nearly a nine-point improvement versus the first quarter. This was driven by stronger performance across both Eastern and Western markets. Consumer-centric commercial programs drove especially strong beverage share performance in key markets, specifically Russia, Turkey, Spain, U.K. and Germany. 
In Western Europe, we continue to drive growth with the new Lipton expansions in France. And in the U.K., we completed the introduction of a new Tropicana flavor pack lineup. Also in the U.K., we launched a new single-serve package, specifically for our no-sugar products, driving single-serve share gains. 
In general, while volume momentum clearly improved in Q2, we are prudently operating under the assumption that we will continue to face a challenging environment in this market. We are staying focused on differentiated consumer value with a strong commercial calendar, including programs linked to soccer in both Snacks and Beverages. With currencies likely to continue to fluctuate, we believe that the combination of our balanced portfolio across both products and geographies, our ability to localize cost and our hedging programs position us well for the remainder of the year. 
In AMEA, snack volume was up 16%, beverage volume was up 8%, net revenue grew 15% and operating profit rose 6%. Broad-based gains in the region drove top line momentum, and as expected, profit growth decelerated versus the first quarter as we expanded our strategic investments program. A very strong productivity agenda and tight cost controls helped offset the cost pressures. 
In Snacks, volume growth was driven by double-digit growth in key emerging markets, such as India, Egypt, China and Pakistan, as the business benefited from their focus on value, innovation and an expanding footprint. AMEA's Snack highlights include the highest-ever volume month for India in May, driven by their local digital version of the Do Us A Flavour and value initiatives. The launch of Doritos in New Zealand, Quaker drinkable oats in the Philippines, Quaker Congee in China and Lay's flavor extensions in Saudi, South Africa and China, all benefited our Snacks business. 
In beverages, volume growth was driven by broad gains in India, Pakistan, Egypt, the Philippines and Thailand. In China, volume was up 2% as very strong growth in NCBs, more than offset a sluggish CSD market. The business gained relative share in CSDs in the quarter in China, benefiting from our investments to expand market presence. Successful product launches included Mountain Dew in Malaysia, a new Lipton flavor in H2O in Saudi, a new flavor of Guo Bin Fen China and Pepsi Cheer in Thailand. 
Now let me turn to our outlook for the year. As you think about our performance for the balance of year, there are several puts and takes that we expect, and that you should take into consideration. First, FLNA will continue to experience pressure on volume growth as it overlaps the impact of the 20% More Free promotion from last year. They will stop overlapping this at the beginning of the fourth quarter. During this timeframe, we will be focused on driving unit growth. In addition to our other initiatives, FLNA is focused on driving growth, and we are confident that the business will post strong operating profit growth for the year, as well as growth in volume and in revenue. 
Second, we'll continue our stepped up levels of investment in R&D and innovation in QFNA as we reposition this brand. 
Third, while we see improving trends in LAF, we are mindful that several of the economies in the region are under significant pressure and will have to continue to balance cost pressures while providing value in the market place. 
Fourth, in the third quarter, we will overlap a one-time gain in AMEA, which was in our core results associated with the contribution of our Snacks business in Japan to form a joint venture with Calbee Foods Co., the snacks market leader in Japan. This gain was worth about 30 points of profit growth for AMEA in the third quarter last year. In the second half of this year, we've accelerated our strategic investments across the entire portfolio, and this will also have the most noticeable impact on our profit growth in AMEA. This, in combination with the overlap of the Calbee gain, will drive even more deleverage between top and bottom line in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Our disciplined approach ensures that we are measuring returns and not investing ahead of people capabilities. We take a very long view of this region and believe these investments will be accretive over the long-term. 
Fifth, we continue to target $125 million to $150 million in annualized synergies from the bottling acquisitions this year with $400 million in annualized savings once fully implemented by 2012. And lastly, we still expect our full year reported tax rate to be roughly 23% to 24%, which reflects a benefit of about four percentage points from non-core items. This brings me to our full year core constant currency EPS growth target of 11% to 13%, which is unchanged from last quarter. Based on current spot rates, foreign exchange translation would be about a one-point headwind for us on a full year core EPS growth. This translates to core EPS growth of about 10% to 12% for the year. 
For the year, we expect management operating cash flow, excluding certain items and net of capital expenditures, to be approximately $5.6 billion. Net CapEx should total about $3.6 billion, which includes about $200 million in capital investments related to the bottler integration. We anticipate that in total, we will spend roughly $4.4 billion on share repurchases this year, and in the third quarter, we expect to make a second $600 million discretionary contribution to PepsiCo's pension funds, taking advantage of some very attractive financing rates. 
Before we go to Q&A, let me leave you with what I think are the key takeaways from our first half performance and a roadmap for PepsiCo for the balance of the year. First, we delivered on our EPS commitments. Second, our teams navigated well with the proper balance of near-term execution and investments, and we're appropriate for long-term growth. They achieved this by staying close to their customers and the evolving needs of consumers despite a very diverse and in certain areas, challenging set of macros. Third, we demonstrated excellent P&L discipline, including driving productivity. Fourth, we made real progress on our strategic imperatives. And fifth, we made measurable and observable progress in NAB, consistent with the goals that we shared with you.

Yes, our single-serve flex business did improve sequentially in the Q1, versus Q1, and I think it was driven by two factors. One is our C&G business is strengthening and that business, that channel grew around 3% of 4% for us. That had been flat to slightly declining in Q4 of 2009 and Q1 of this year. The second is the FoodService business. And in part, that was driven by the national distribution of Doritos and Taco Bell, but FoodService more broadly was strengthening for us, notably at subway and some other customers. So together, single-served flex performed much better and the Power of One initiative that we've just kicked off for the C&G channel this summer I think all will strengthen that. The purchase dynamics question, Bill, is one where the category continues to grow in line with population growth, around 1% volume growth. And we're growing slightly faster that, particularly in dollars. And if you look at Frito-Lay year-to-date, it still remains the fastest-growing consumer packaged goods company in North America, and not by a small measure but by almost two to three points relative to most other consumer packaged goods company. The only businesses that are posting positive growth year-to-date are store brands other than Frito-Lay. So I still think that Frito-Lay is growing strongly. We have great program incoming in the back half of the year as we head into the prepared comments, we begin to lap the 20% More Free bags positively in Q4 of this year. We have even greater deflation in the back half of the year. So I think Frito-Lay will strengthen in the back half"

I think the G Series launch and having a differentiated offerings with GNC and Dick's Sporting Goods versus mainstream channels is the first time in, I think, 10 years that we've had such major innovation coming from Gatorade, which is really the category. And it's the first time that sports enthusiasts all over the world -- I mean, real participants are having meaningful hydration innovation brought to them. So we're very optimistic about the innovation pipeline. Remember, we're just about three or four months into the launch, and while the early indications are very positive, I think there's a lot more upside in the future because 01, which is a Prime product, had to go on allocation very quickly because the demand was so high for it, and we were just out of capacity. And our protein recovery products, which was 03, I think is the best protein recovery product in on the marketplace, and we need to give it its own identity and pump it up. So we are very and optimistic about the future of the whole G Series launch. And as we go into 2011, you'll see a lot more innovation around G Series, differentiated for different groups. People who exercised versus people who are hard-core athletes. You see a lot of interesting innovation coming out of Gatorade. So I think the core Gatorade franchise, the brand equity scores are moving up very, very nicely. The advertising is working and we feel very good about where Gatorade is headed. So that's Gatorade. Let's turn to convenience stores. Again, you heard what John Compton said about the C-store business is improving. Local food service is improving. All these are positive signs. But let's not forget that we are still in a difficult economic situation. Unemployment rates are still very, very high and lot of the C-store traffic was driven by construction workers and driven by people who are willing to pay the upcharge when they go to a c store, they were willing to pay for convenience. Now what has happened in c-stores is that the value proposition in c-stores has improved. C-stores themselves have changed their pricing equation, and people like PepsiCo have provided very compelling Power of One programs to bring traffic back into c-stores, so in a way, I think we are one of the people driving traffic into the c-stores. Balance of year, you'll see a lot more powerful initiatives that continue. And our goal is to make c-stores a compelling destination for people who don't want to spend a lot of money in a large format store, but have a small amount of money to just spend to get immediate hydration needs fulfilled or their short-term snacking needs fulfilled. So that's our strategy going forward, but I'll tell you, given the economic environment, given where we're seeing all of the unemployment figures headed, let's take it a quarter at a time and look and see how this whole C-store business evolves. I don't want to make any prediction for how this is going to evolve, balance of year."

I'll tell you the north American beverage volume, which was only down one for the quarter on an organic basis is a tremendous sequential improvement versus first quarter of this year. So we feel very good about the trends in the North American Beverage business, in spite of a difficult category and interesting competitive activity. So I think we feel good about the improvement. But more importantly, Christine, we've been very careful in managing our price equation and making sure we don't chase unprofitable volume.

It's going to hit in different areas of the P&L.

And the mix shift in the quarter took place with our mix shift moving in the cans.

I'll tell you, the European economy is coming back, at least, for our categories, gives us some room for optimism there, but again, let's watch and see how it evolves over the next couple of quarters, but the second quarter, how the European business performed was pretty good. Latin America, I think parts of Latin America have deteriorated since the last quarter, but Brazil is still very, very strong since you have a big business in Brazil especially our Snacks business, we're doing quite well. But again, I'd say it's a mixed picture in Latin America. And in North America, the rays of hope convenience stores' coming back, and Food Service actually is trending positive, so those are positive signs for PepsiCo. But again Ann, I'd say to you that this is one situation where we've got to look at it every quarter, because the economic environment is not showing consistent improvement across all measures. And so let's watch and see what happens as the year progresses. And every quarter, we'll talk to you and as we make our business with all of you, we'll give you more color, but I'd say that east of the Middle East, positive, Europe is more positive, Latin America mix, and North America is wait and see.
Well, let me just close in and say that, as you think about our performance for the balance of this year and beyond, I want you to keep in mind several important advantages that PepsiCo has that we believe will allow us to achieve our objectives in this environment. First, we have unrivaled portfolio of powerhouse snack and beverage brands with large scale reach in developed and emerging markets. Second, we have localized seed to shelf supply chains. We have advantaged go-to-market system, an increasing scale in key markets. Third, we have experienced management teams and understand the local markets. They're able to unlock growth opportunities by managing cost and cash flows. Fourth, we have a disciplined and rigorous strategic investment program that will fuel future growth and productivity, particularly in emerging markets and adjacent categories. Fifth, we have an aligned organization focused on clear initiatives that drive near-term performance, while at the same time enhancing opportunities for long-term growth. Sixth and lastly, we have a portfolio that works. In any quarter, there will likely be puts and takes on individual businesses, but the overall portfolio works. These attributes are what gives us confidence that PepsiCo can deliver differentiated performance in the second half of this year, providing a strong base for 2011 and beyond. So with that, let me just say thank you for joining us today."

32854,112172201,79640,"Pepsico, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 07, 2010",2010-10-07,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thanks Lynn, and good morning everyone. I want to highlight three significant takeaways from PepsiCo's performance this quarter.First, in a very challenging macro environment, we delivered great results for Q3 on the top-line, bottom line and cash flow.",2059,"Thanks Lynn, and good morning everyone. I want to highlight three significant takeaways from PepsiCo's performance this quarter.
First, in a very challenging macro environment, we delivered great results for Q3 on the top-line, bottom line and cash flow. Second, while delivering these strong results, we are investing in both innovation in brands and these investments are already yielding returns. And third, consistent with what we shared with you in March, we are making strategic investments to transform PepsiCo in specific ways that we believe will enhance our competitiveness, solidify our growth and expand the value of the company well into the future.
So let me turn to the first key takeaway, our strong results. As we've discussed in recent calls, there's been very little improvement in the consumer and economic environment. Looking at the markets in which we operate, there is no doubt that economic uncertainty and high unemployment levels are keeping a consumer-led recovery at bay in many regions, especially in developed markets like the United States and Western Europe.
We expect these conditions to persist, and are planning accordingly with a keen eye on delivering value to customers with an efficient cost structure to ensure that we remain competitive and grow profitably.
Our ability to accelerate profitable growth this quarter in both developed and developing markets demonstrates our ability to control costs, while levering the significant advantages provided by the scale and breadth of our portfolio.
In the quarter, volume in our global snacks portfolio was up 2%, and volume in our global beverage portfolio was up 11%. That growth fuels a 41% increase in net revenue, and a 29% increase in division operating profit.
Core constant currency EPS grew 15%. Year-to-date, management operating cash flow, excluding certain items was up 29% to $5.3 billion. And this strong cash flow allowed us already to achieve our 2010 target of repurchasing $4.4 billion of stock by the third quarter.
And while developed countries are challenging, we are seeing healthy consumer spending in emerging countries, with strong GDP growth in countries such as China, India and Brazil, as well as those that are improving like Russia and Turkey. In fact, in our emerging markets, snacks volume grew at a high single digit rate, while beverage volumes grew at a mid-teens rate.
Throughout the world though, consumers remain very value-conscious. This is where the advantages that PepsiCo possesses, in granular management of productivity and local execution in the market drove differentiated performance this quarter. For example, at Frito-Lay we've launched a new urban program that targets close to 100,000 underserved retail partners.
This program is dedicated to leveraging the power of our direct-store-door delivery system to bring these retailers more relevant product categories at more attractive (price points). In markets where we have rolled out this program, our top-line has grown at two to three times the average of our base business. And now, through the Power of One, we will leverage this program across both our snacks and beverage businesses.
More broadly, at PepsiAmericas Beverages, we have worked aggressively to capture post-merger SG&A cost synergies, and we're now on track to hit above $150 million in synergies this year. Now, we're focused on operating revenue synergies that will help fuel top-line momentum going forward.
For example, in the third quarter, we announced that early next year we will start distributing Gatorade to small format stores through our DSD systems. As you know, this is a major shift that could not have come without the Bottler acquisitions and this will bring additional go-to-market strength to the many ongoing improvements we're making to the Gatorade brand and product portfolio.
But while we continue to see improving trends across our business in North America, the power of PepsiCo's balanced portfolio may be even more evident in Europe. Our snacks business there continued to perform well with 3% volume growth driven by differentiated value offerings such as the rollout of our successful Do Us a Flavour snack promotion in Holland, Poland and Turkey.
Simultaneously, the European beverage business grew by 10% organically, where our consumer-focused commercial programs drew at least one point of CSD value and volume share in key markets such as the U.K., Russia and Turkey. Our balance is also evident geographically, where on an organic basis we grew a solid 6% in Western Europe and 14% in Eastern Europe.
In summary, all of these results demonstrate the strength and balance of our portfolio in delivering sequential improvement in business performance through a difficult macroeconomic environment. And I'm pleased to say that we gained LRV share versus our closest competitor in both North America and in Europe.
Let me turn now to my second key takeaway. Our positive performance this quarter clearly benefited from focused investments we are making in product innovations and stepped-up brand building in key areas of our portfolio. For example, Frito-Lay's salty snack value share gains were aided by the launch of Lay's all natural regional flavors. These are products that allow us to elevate our core portfolio in the near term, and we are targeting to have about 50% of our portfolio all natural by the end of 2011.
I know that some of you recently visited Frito Lay's culinary center and experienced firsthand some of the wonderful products we're developing, such as the Tostitos Artisan products. Hundred percent of our Tostitos chips are naturally made with whole grain corn. These will enable us to make our snack portfolio more wholesome while retaining the best characteristics of our snack products.
We're also expanding further into adjacencies. For example, we continue to expand our Dip portfolio, leveraging our fantastic Sabra brand and we're broadening our bread-based platforms through Twistos and (inaudible).
At Quaker, after several quarters of increased investment we have brought to market a promising combination of improved quality and value, product innovation and a creative new brand building campaign. This launches off to a good start, driving both market share gains and sequential improvement in volume, revenue and operating profit performance as we continue to turnaround this very important business.
At Pepsi Americas Beverages, in the United States we had a positive swing in LRB volume share versus our closest competitor, driven by the very successful launch of our Gatorade Performance series and strength across our tea portfolio.
Also our relative carbonated soft drink volume share position strengthened sequentially in the quarter versus our closest competitor aided by the re-launch Pepsi Max. we also launched the first natural mainstream CSD Sierra Mist Natural which is made with five simple ingredients and nothing artificial.
This is a large opportunity and allows consumers to have what they love about CSDS while removing some key barriers. We launched this product only a few weeks ago. And advertising has just kicked in across multiple media vehicles.
On October 9, we will hand out over 10 million full can samples at Wal-Mart super centers across America. The largest sampling event either Pepsi or Wal-Mart have ever undertaken.
In addition to the sampling event, we have put a full year's worth of marketing support in the fourth quarter of 2010 with continued heavy support in 2011, which leads me then to the third key takeaway I shared at the start of the call. Even as we're investing to improve near term performance, we're also investing to advance the longer term strategic initiatives we shared with you at our Investor Meeting in March.
Let me touch on two of these initiatives, Power of One and Nutrition Co. as examples of who we're building long term growth potential in shareholder value. Many of you ask us whether the Power of One is anything more than just joint merchandising or can you really change the way you go to market and service your customers in a way that drives accretion for PepsiCo?
Good question and the answers are; yes, and yes. Our focused Power of One teams have a whole range of initiatives underway designed to provide enhanced solutions to our customers, to better optimize our advantage supply chain and also to enhance organizational effectiveness and efficiency. For example, for our customers in the United States, we have streamlined our customers facing resources and shopper insight themes under one organization. And we've held joint planning and growth summits with our largest customers with the focused effort to provide Power of One insights and solutions.
We have dedicated Power on One resources in each region. And we're increasing by tenfold, the number of sales leaders selling Power of One solutions. To enhance organizational effectiveness and efficiency, in the United States, we're harmonizing our regional structures for beverages and snacks which will allow us to better balance size and scale, shed geographic boundaries and align Power of One accountability and performance targets.
On the marketing side, our teams have also driven unprecedented levels of Power of One activation in both the grocery and convenience channel. For over 70% of our grocery business, or about 200 plus customers, we have Power of One ads, growth and inventory on display and increased revenue.
From July through September, we have 20,000 convenience outlets featuring Power of One activation, all of which was incremental to last year. And while the Super Bowl has traditionally been a strong shared merchandising opportunity for us, we are kicking it up a notch next year with the joint advertising of Frito Lay and Pepsi throwback products and also Pepsi Max.
We're just beginning to scratch the surface of the vast opportunities available to us right here in the United States.
So let me now turn to Nutrition Co. I'm very pleased to announce today that we're establishing the global nutrition group within PepsiCo. The creation of this group is consistent with the vision we shared with you in March. And our goal is to take roughly the $10 billion portfolio today and grow it into a $30 billion nutrition business by 2020.
The good news is that we're starting from a strong position with high quality nutritious brands like Quaker, Tropicana, Gatorade, Naked Juice, (inaudible) Soups, Sabra Dips, Pandora and Lebedyansky Juices just to name a few.
Our objective is to position PepsiCo globally as a leader in wholesome and convenience nutrition. We believe we can leverage our great portfolio brands across four target platforms; fruit and vegetables, grains, dairy and functional nutrition to put PepsiCo in a uniquely advantageous position to win in the $500 billion global market for packaged nutrition.
To enable us to move even more aggressively towards our goal, today we announced several organization changes as to accelerate our progress. Dr. Mehmood Khan, our Chief Scientific Officer and Corporate Leader of Research and Development will assume additional responsibility as the CEO of the new global nutrition group reporting directly to me.
Based in Chicago, this group will collaborate with businesses across the globe to ensure rapid growth of our nutrition portfolio. They will be responsible for the following: first, the global product innovation agenda for fruits and vegetables, grains and dairy. Second, functional nutrition, expanding beyond sports nutrition into new functional arenas overtime. Third, nutrition services, providing education and incentives to help consumers change and sustain behaviors related to nutrition.
Jaya Kumar, President of Quaker foods North America and previously Chief Marketing Officer of Frito Lay North America will move into a role as President Global Nutrition platforms reporting to Mehmood. To ensure a smooth transition, Jaya will maintain responsibility for Quaker North America until the successor is named.
With this new group, we will be able to harness the best of PepsiCo by retaining the operating capability for these businesses in the sector, while centralizing very important innovation development of nutrition products based on science.
Mehmood and his team will work closely with all four PepsiCo sectors to integrate these innovations appropriately to each of the regional organizations in these sales and distribution systems. So taking a step back, I would summarize the quarter as follows. We believe we delivered balanced top quartile performance in a very challenging macro environment.
Even more importantly, we achieved this while investing in near term opportunities like innovation in brand building, and a longer term initiative that will transform PepsiCo and expand the value of the company well into the future.
With that, Hugh, let me turn the call over to you.

Even in an economic environment that continues to be challenging, our steadfast commitment to surgical investments is producing results.
That's why we've decided to maintain and where it's warranted step up our investment plans in the second half of this year while targeting 11% to 12% growth in core constant currency EPS for the full year. This step up in investment is incremental to the $0.10 per share in strategic spending that we earmarked at the beginning of the year.
In total, these investments include: first, expanding our beverage footprint in China, which is expected will be the world's largest LRB market by 2015 and the source of more than one of ever three LRB cases in the next five years. This includes investment and routes, coolers, systems and additional capacity.
Second, revitalizing our North American beverage business with increased investments in innovation and brand building, including our partnership with Senomyx as well as increased levels of support for Pepsi Max and Sierra Mist.
Third, laying a firm foundation for our Global Nutrition Group by reinforcing a key pillar for our preeminent health and wellness brand, Quaker.
And finally, adding to our world-class R&D capabilities through building a brand new Fruit and Juice research center in Hamburg German to support our European juice businesses, expanding our salt reduction technology, and research in delivering whole grain nutrition in beverage forms using technology that is proprietary to PepsiCo.
All of these investments are closely scrutinized. Each business case must show a positive return on investment and drive directly or indirectly the long-term value of the company. And our business leaders are held accountable for the capital they request. As I review our operating results, I'll highlight in more detail some of these investments and the returns that they are already generating.
So let me start with PAF. FLNA division operating profit grew 10% on a 1% increase in net revenue. Volume growth, which was 2%, improved sequentially as did our leverage from net revenue to profit, driven by a lower commodity cost, topline performance and Frito-Lay's focus on productivity.
Units were up low single digits, which as we said last quarter is a good proxy for consumer poll of our products as the business overlaps last year's 20% more free promotion. We finished that overlap very early in the fourth quarter. So we do expect that unit growth to translate to pound growth in the fourth quarter.
In the quarter, FLNA gained 70 basis points of gained salty-snack value share and posted the fastest growth among top 20 food and beverage companies in measured channels.
As Indra mentioned, we are having great success with our Lays all-natural local flavors which helped to drive solid revenue growth for the brand. Additionally, we continue to see double-digit volume growth in our Stacy's and Sabra products as we further our expansion into adjacent snack categories.
Our Foodservice business was also a strength, driven by the very successful $2 Meal Deal promotion with Taco Bell. This is another example of how we strive to provide value offerings to our consumers through the power of one with our great customer partners, and we're looking to extend this promotion.
At QFNA, we saw improved sequential performance with volume down just 1%, net revenue down 3.5% and operating profit down 5.5%. As we said last quarter, we've been making investments in innovation and value to restage the Quaker brand as the preeminent health and wellness brand and to return the business to profitable growth.
The majority of our instant oatmeal products have been reformulated with 25% less sugar, all natural flavors, a hardier texture and improved taste. We are giving consumers the product experience that they've always loved with our standard oatmeal, but with the convenience of instant.
We've also launched new innovative offerings targeted to two important consumer groups: Hearty Medleys, a multi-grain oatmeal for boomers made with real fruit and nuts; and Mix-Up Creations, a healthy create-your-own oatmeal for kids. The early read is positive with shipments and distribution exceeding our expectations.
The fourth quarter is a key selling season for oatmeal, and we are supporting our new product launches with in-store sampling, print, digital and social media support. We expect to see continued sequential improvements in both topline and profit performance from Quaker in the fourth quarter as our new product innovation takes hold and our investments in innovation and value begin to pay back. However, we expect it will take several quarters for our restaging program to fully take hold and get us to where we want to be with this powerful brand.
In our Latin American Foods business, volume was up 5%, net revenues were up 12% and operating profit rose 22%. As expected, we're starting to see our investments in new routes, continued focus on value, marketplace execution and innovative promotions to drive improved volume results. Also, effective net price realization drove strong volume to net revenue leverage, and the strict cost control focus drove flow-through from revenue to operating profit.
Throughout the Latin America region, macros remain mixed however. Mexico is showing moderate improvement, although they are still below pre-crisis levels. In South America, there are pockets of real strength, but Venezuela continues to be challenged. Our Latin American team's ability to navigate through shifting economic landscapes has been a long-standing capability for PepsiCo.
For example, Sabritas delivered strong volume growth through continued focus on value, strong marketplace execution and innovative programs that drive consumer engagement. Our Pake-Taxo value brand continues to show strong growth, and year-to-date the sales of this brand alone now exceed the total sales of each of our top different categories.
Gamesa grew volumes across all channels behind the successful execution of a soccer promotion which featured cash prizes. We also benefited from the marketplace investments we made earlier in the year when we added 150 incremental routes which are now fully optimized. Additionally, we gained 1.6 points of value share, a 3.6 point favorable swing versus our nearest competitor. In South America, volume growth accelerated from Q2 with strong performance in Brazil, Argentina and Chile.
Turning now to PAB, volume was up 13%, net revenue was up 118% and operating profit was up 79% as we continue to benefit from the impact of the bottler acquisitions. Acquisitions contributed 14 points to PAB's volume growth.
Despite what remains a difficult consumer and retail environment, excluding the impact of acquisitions, volume in North America was flat, a sequential improvement of 1 point versus the second quarter.
Our belief in the long-term attractiveness and resiliency of the liquid refreshment beverage category has been bolstered as we are starting to see some positive signs of recovery in the category and expected to return to modest growth this year.
We are being judicious though and will continue to concentrate our efforts on specific categories that offer opportunities for profitable growth, while also maintaining pricing discipline. We are focusing our resources, innovation, messaging and execution against these specific opportunities and we're increasing our investments in brand building to support the growth.
We are starting to see the pay off from our efforts, as evidenced by the positive swing in total LRB volume share versus our nearest competitor that we achieved in the quarter.
The integration of our bottling businesses is proceeding in line with our expectations. We're on track to deliver our full year synergy target and continue to look for further opportunities across a number of markets that will drive savings and incremental revenue in the future.
As Indra mentioned, we are moving beyond delivering pure cost synergies to now realizing top-line benefits and truly unlocking the strategic value of the merger. Let me pause here and highlight the significance of being able to distribute Gatorade via DSD and the convenience of up and down the street channels. This is an important unlock for us. With this move, we'll align our go-to-market actions in small format giving us strength in every product category and throughout the cold bulk.
This is a great example of how we're using PepsiCo's broad set of go-to-market systems to better serve our customers with more frequent service, fewer out of stocks and greater flexibility and responsiveness while improving our own economics by adding scale and increasing drop sizes.
In the quarter, we accelerated volume growth in Gatorade through our transformation of the brand which centers on innovation with the new G-series products, the expansion of our retail footprint and a targeted efficacy message aimed at rebuilding the brand's credentials.
While we benefited from favorable weather, we are encouraged by our progress as the growth was across all channels in both ambient and cold formats. Our brand health metrics also continue to improve. And both our prime and recover products continue to do extremely well. While it is still early days, we are very pleased by the marketplace reaction and our recent results.
Another example of the power of an integrated beverage company is in food service where the merger removed historical structural barriers and created new growth opportunities. We're already making great progress by getting new business via commissaries and we are not stopping there.
We're using our Power of One sales teams to sell in the entire PepsiCo portfolio across the largest workplace, healthcare and education accounts. We are already well on our way to doubling our market penetration this year, and have plans to continue the expansion.
Regarding CSDs, clearly the overall category continues to be challenging. In this environment, it is imperative that we drive differentiated innovation, targeted at the current and future profitable segments of the category.
We will do this while we are refining our price pack offerings by channel and occasion and striking the right balance between value, volume and profitability.
For instance, we are actively addressing two of the key barriers to CSD consumption, artificiality in calories through innovation and consumer engagement to rebuild our CSD momentum. Prime examples of this are Sierra Mist Natural and Pepsi Max.
Indra already touched on Sierra Mist. I'll talk a little bit about Pepsi Max. The re-launch of Max is off to a great start and we are investing heavily in our zero-calorie, maximum Pepsi taste communications.
We've already stepped up our brand building support for Max through a multi-year effort to raise the zero calorie awareness among consumers. You'll see more of this during the Power of One super bowl line up in January.
Finally, we announce the collaboration with Senomyx to develop new sweetener systems. The real challenge is to create products that are not only healthier but also taste great. And Senomyx has unique technologies to allow us to improve the nutritional profile of our products without sacrificing taste.
This will complement the work of our current partners and internal R&D teams are undertaking and will help us achieve our health and wellness goals of reducing calories and artificiality in our beverage products including our commitment to reduce added sugar per serving by25% in key brands in key markets over the next decade.
This relationship with Senomyx reflects our increasingly long-term approach through research and development as well as our belief that global food and beverage companies can play an important role in identifying new ingredients that can lead to healthier products.
Turning to Europe, we delivered a very strong quarter with sequential improvements in top line growth across both snacks and beverages. Year-over-year snack volume was up 3%, beverage volume up 17%, net revenue up 55% and division operating profit up 45%.
Europe's results continue to be positively impacted by the inclusion of the Bottling acquisition. The macro environment we faced in the second quarter remains largely unchanged and we expect only modest GDP growth across Europe.
Unemployment remains high and the impact of austerity measures in a number of markets continues to depress consumer confidence. Despite the mixed economic picture however, we're seeing underlying growth return across snacks and beverages in several key markets.
Our snacks business improved significantly in Eastern Europe and matched the strong growth we saw in the second quarter in Western Europe. This performance was underpinned by the success of our incremental investments this year in strong commercial programs.
We built our flavored cup promotion around soccer in the U.K. and expanded our Benenuts nuts products into Poland. We continue to offer consumers differentiated value by leveraging successful concepts such as “Do Us a Flavor” which ran in Holland, Poland and Turkey as well as new programs such as travel promotions in Russia.
Beverage volume grew 17 points, but importantly we delivered 10% growth excluding the acquisition impact. This represents a six point sequential improvement in organic growth over the second quarter.
While there was a sequential improvement in volume growth in Western Europe, the majority of the six point sequential improvement came form Eastern Europe where we've been aggressively adding new routes and colors.
A strong commercial calendar helped us capture share while an unusually hot summer helped to drive category growth. Our consumer focused commercial programs continue to drive strong volume growth. And we delivered dollar share gains in key markets such as Russia, Turkey, Spain and the U.K. As with snacks, most markets focused their activity around soccer and our promotions continued to generate a very positive response from consumers.
We also have kept up the momentum on our differentiated value programs, with our text message programs in Turkey enjoying strong consumer uptake.
While the unusually hot summer in Eastern Europe has helped our beverage volume, it has also affected crop harvest in the region. As a result we absorbed higher than planned input cost for our snack business in the quarter and this will continue into the fourth quarter.
Turning down to AMEA snack volume was up 16%, beverage volume rose 4% and net revenue grew13%.
As expected, Division Operating Profit declined 19% as AMEA overlapped more than 30 points of operating profit growth associated with the contribution of our snacks business in Japan last year to form a joint venture with Kelbey Foods Company, the snacks market leader in Japan.
Profit growth was also impacted by our decision to invest in longer term strategic initiatives in both our snacks and beverage business in this key growth region, especially in China.
AMEA delivered top line growth across both snacks and beverages and we successfully defended our CSB in savory share positions in many markets despite competitive challenges.
Snack volumes continue to grow in the mid-teens, driven by double digit gains in India, China, the Middle East and Indonesia. In India, volume growth was up over 20% behind the continued success of our marketing efforts such as Lay's “Give Us Your Delicious Flavor” promotion, new product innovations like Kurkure which is tailored to local consumer taste and the strong performance of our Quaker brands.
In China, snack volume grew 15% driven by potato chip growth and distribution gains on Quaker. Across the balance of the region our results were supported by new product introduction such as SunBites in Thailand, Nori Seaweed flavor Lay's potato chips in Vietnam and Doritos Tandoori Chicken in Egypt.
In beverages, volume growth was driven by double digit gains in Egypt and in Thailand. China's growth of 9% reflects continued strong growth NTBs and high single digit growth in CSDs as we stepped up our marketplace investments in Routes, Coolers and brand building.
Adding to the NTB growth was the national launch of our Tropicana Pulp Sacs product, which is helping to drive record high brand scores as well as share gains. While the CSD category in China continues to be challenged, we grew our CSD share behind gains in Mirinda and 7UP, and we remain the leader in the (Cola) segment. We are well-positioned to realize the long term potential of the many developing markets in this region.
The investments we have in place are bearing fruit and we still have a long way to go. We will continue to invest in innovation and build scale businesses to expand our footprint across beverages and snacks especially in China and India. And increase our sales and go to market capability.
China is expected overtake U.S. as the world's largest packaged foods market by 2014 and as the second largest food and beverage company in the world, it is imperative that we expand our footprint in this critical market.
Now, let me turn to our outlook for the year. We are on track to deliver EPS results within our original target range. With three quarters of the year now behind us, we are tightening our range to our 11% to 12% growth in core constant currency EPS for 2010.
We expect to deliver on our full year EPS target while also investing in many of the initiatives that we've talked about this morning. As the result of our strong operating productivity, focused investments and working capital discipline this year, we now expect to deliver about $8 billion in cash flow from operating activities with management operating cash flow excluding certain items and net of capital expenditures of about $6.1 billion. That is about $500 million higher than our previous forecast.
Net CapEx should total about $3.3 billion which includes about $200 million in capital investments related to the bottler acquisition. We expect to capture about $150 million in synergies from the bottling acquisitions of this year with $400 million in annual savings once following implemented by 2012.
And lastly, we still expect our full year reported tax rate to be roughly 23% to 24% which reflects a benefit of about four percentage points from non-core items.
Before we get to Q&A, let me leave you with the few of my own observations about the quarter. First, we delivered on our EPS commitments while responsibly balancing growth, investments, profitability and liquidity. Second, we are making clear strides in the revitalization of our North American beverage business in key strategic areas and we are delivering on the benefits of the acquisitions. Third, our scale geographic footprint and broad product portfolio positions us well to capture growth and improve our performance across all the regions in product categories. 
Overall, we feel very good about PepsiCo's performance and also about PepsiCo as an investment. We deliver strong steady cash flow and we convert that cash to shareholder return with a solid dividend yield plus an attractive share repurchase program.
Further, we have both geographic and product portfolio diversity that offers the prospect of growth and durability in operating performance. In some, even while the consumer, financial and economic environment difficult and challenging, we believe that Pep is an equity that is built to perform.
With that I would like to turn the call over to the operator for questions.

And so, we're generally seeing a high level of competitive spending across consumer staples right now. So I think if you look at this there is some concern that the reduction in guidance for additional spending is simply a reaction to higher competitive spending levels what have you, or potentially just simply if you look at the margins heading out to 2011, they are still too high.
So we've talked about this before, but what will see on top-line as we look out into 2011 and beyond that really highlights the fact that this is additional investment? And this is this is being done from a position of strength as opposed to a position of weakness.

We are saying we tightened the guidance. We gave you a range 11% to 13%. All that we're doing now is tightening the guidance.
So we feel very good about where we have been so far in the year. And we feel good about the fourth quarter. And in today's macro economic environment, to deliver 11% to 12% EPS growth for a company of our size and scale I think is fantastic performance. So that's the first point.
Point two, we are managing the company for the long term. And when we see opportunities to make investments which we think will pay off may not be in the next quarter or two but over the long term because many of these require investments in platforms and R&D, we are going to make those investments because we have to make sure that we are looking at innovation 24 months to 36 months out.
Because as we move more and more into the nutrition space, it's no longer mere line extensions but we have to think about products backed by science. And science takes some time to be proved and authenticated, and that's what we are focusing on. But that's just a word by way of preamble.

In terms of tightening the range, first and foremost, we gave you a border range obviously back in the spring of 11% to 13%. We are now tightening it to 11% or 12%. As we have now gotten into Q4 in the latter part of the year we obviously have more line of sight as to where the year is ultimately going to come in.
The second point on that is, we're seeing signs that the investments that we have been making in the business really are creating payback, whether you look at things that are going on within NAB or the things that are happening internationally with China and India and developing markets.
So as we see that positive response, we do view it as an opportunity to invest more, and frankly an opportunity to get good payback over time.
In terms of the specific investments, what we are really doing is investing I think in a couple of places. And a lot of it is additional relative to we've talked about in the past, which is further investments in things like China and Russia in areas like selling coolers, racks, and systems infrastructure.
Second, in brand building, particularly in NAB around things like Max and Sierra Mist. And third, as we talk about this Global Nutrition Group, its making investments in things that will support our future in nutrition, things like Quaker brand-building and innovation and investments around fruits and vegetables, salt reduction and grains technology. 
So these are the types of investment that as Indra said are things that are going to pay back over time, but they are the types of investments that really do drive the long term value of the company.
Regarding your question specifically on 20/11, we are really not prepared to share guidance on 20/11 just yet. We'll do that in the fourth quarter, as has been our previous practice.

We haven't had decent volume growth. So I don't think there is a predictable number we can assign to the weather.
The good news is that even in Gatorade which did exceedingly well this summer, the growth came not just from our core Gatorade but also came from the launch of our new product Prime and Recover. So that says to us that the core franchise is doing well. And if Prime and Recover did well it's because the sports enthusiasts really believed in those products to enhance their performance.
Similarly, lot of the other innovation that we have like Sobe Life Water, I'm not sure they are just weather related. So let's wait and see how the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year evolve. And then we should be able to talk more about the weather and its impact on the business.
Hugh, did you want to add anything?

What business is specifically or regions are not delivering the level of earnings acceleration in the second half that you're expecting back in July? And we've heard a lot about causes and what's going on. But if you were to kind of just put something at the top of the list, would you put something there?
And then secondly, is your view of 2H revenues for the totality of the company the same as where it was in July? Is it above where it was in July? Is it below where it was in July? I am just trying to get a bottom line here.

So in terms of any expectation that we had, frankly, it's exactly in line with what we had been communicating. So no big change from our standpoint, the July reference is, well, puzzling to me.

Hugh talked about spending in China; accelerate spending in China, stepped up levels.
Look, when you spend in China and for in coolers marketplace investment, you are not going to get the profitability impact in the next 12 months or 24 months. It takes a longer time because we are still in a massive of investment mode in China. This is got years and years of growth.
When we step up investment in India, again, you are not getting the returns right to way, but it's a must invest market because the demographics and the fact that per capita levels are so low gives you many years of growth.
So we are making stepped up investments in these countries because either we've got the permission to invest, or we see an opportunity to go in with a new product or a marketplace investment at favorable terms today. So we are looking around the world, and wherever we see the opportunity, we are ramping up the investments.
But just remember, the international market is not like the Unites States where you get a return within the quarter. It does take two, three, four years before the top-line starts ramping up in a meaningful way.

I want to highlight three significant takeaways from PepsiCo's performance this quarter. First, in a very challenging macro environment, we delivered great results for Q3 on the top line, bottom line and cash fl",2050,"Thanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I want to highlight three significant takeaways from PepsiCo's performance this quarter. 
First, in a very challenging macro environment, we delivered great results for Q3 on the top line, bottom line and cash flow. Second, while delivering these strong results, we are investing in both innovation in, brand and these investments are already yielding returns. And third, consistent with what we shared with you in March, we are making strategic investments to transform PepsiCo in specific ways that we believe will enhance our competitiveness, solidify our growth and expand the value of the company well into the future.
So let me turn to the first key takeaway, our strong results. As we've discussed in recent calls, there's been bated improvement in the consumer and economic environment. Looking at the markets in which we operate, there is no doubt that economic uncertainty and high unemployment levels are keeping a consumer-led recovery at bay in many reasons, especially in developed markets like the United States and Western Europe. We expect these conditions to persist and are planning accordingly with a keen eye on delivering value to customers with an efficient cost structure to ensure that we remain competitive and grow profitably. 
Our ability to accelerate profitable growth this quarter in both developed and developing markets demonstrates our ability to control costs, while leveraging the significant advantages provided by the scale and breadth of our portfolio.
In the quarter, volume in our Global Snacks portfolio was up 2%, and volume in our Global Beverage portfolio was up 11%. That growth fueled a 41% increase in net revenue and a 29% increase in division operating profit. Core constant currency EPS grew 15%. 
Year-to-date, management operating cash flow, excluding certain items, was up 29% to $5.3 billion. And this strong cash flow allowed us already to achieve our 2010 target of repurchasing $4.4 billion of stock by the third quarter. And while developed countries are challenging, we are seeing healthy consumer spending in emerging countries, with strong GDP growth in countries such as China, India and Brazil, as well as those that are improving like Russia and Turkey. In fact, in our emerging markets, snack volume grew at a high single-digit rate, while beverage volume grew at the mid-teens rate.
Throughout the world though, consumers remain value conscious. This is where the advantages of PepsiCo possesses and granular management of productivity and local execution in the market drove differentiated performance this quarter. For example, at Frito-Lay, we've launched a new urban program. The target's close to 100,000 underserved retail partners. This program is dedicated to leveraging the power of our direct store delivery system to bring these retailers more relevant product categories at more attractive prices.
In markets where we have rolled out this program, our top line has grown at two to three times the average of our base business. And now to the Power of One, we will leverage this program across both our Snacks and Beverage business.
More broadly, at Pepsi Americas Beverages, we've worked aggressively to capture post-merger SG&A cost synergies and we're now on track to hit above the $150 million in synergies this year. Now we're focused on operating revenue synergies that will help fuel top line momentum going forward. For example, in the third quarter, we announced that early next year, we will start distributing Gatorade to small format store through our DSD systems. As you know, this is a major shift that could not have come without the bottling acquisition, and it will bring additional go-to-market strength to the many ongoing improvements we are making to the Gatorade brand and product portfolio.
But while we continue to see improving trends across our business in North America, the power of PepsiCo's balanced portfolio maybe even more evident in Europe. Our Snacks business there continue to perform well, with 3% volume growth driven by differentiated value offerings, such as the rollout of our successful ""Do Us a Flavor"" snack promotion in Holland, Poland and Turkey.
Simultaneously, the European Beverage business grew by 10% organically, where our consumer-focus commercial programs drove at least one point of CSD [carbonated soft drink] value and volume share in key markets such as the U.K., Russia and Turkey.  Our balance is also evident geographically, where on an organic basis, we grew a solid 6% in Western Europe and 14% in Eastern Europe. 
In sum, all of these results demonstrate the strength and balance of our portfolio in delivering sequential improvement in business performance through a difficult macroeconomic environment. And I'm pleased to say that we gained LRB share versus our closest competitor in both North America and in Europe.
Let me turn now to my second key takeaway. Our positive performance this quarter clearly benefited from focused investments we're making in product innovations and stepped-up brand building in key areas of our portfolio. For example, Frito-Lay's Salty Snack value share gains were aided by the launch of Lay's all-natural regional flavors. These are products that allow us to elevate our core portfolio in the near term, and we are targeting to have about 50% of our portfolio all natural by the end of 2011.
I know that some of you recently visited Frito-Lay's culinary center and experienced first hand some of the wonderful products we're developing, such as the Tostitos Artisan products. 100% of our Tostitos chips are naturally made with whole-grain corn. These will enable us to make our snacks portfolio more wholesome, while retaining the best characteristics of our snack products.
We're also expanding further into adjacencies. For example, we continue to expand our dip portfolio, leveraging our fantastic Sabra brand, and we're broadening our bread-based platforms through Twistos and Stacy's.
At Quaker, after several quarters of increased investments, we have brought to market a promising combination of improved quality and value, product innovation and a creative new brand-building campaign. This launch is off to a good start, driving both market share gains and sequential improvement in volume, revenue and operating profit performance as we continue to turn around this very important business.
At Pepsi Americas Beverages in the United States, we had a positive swing in LRB volume share versus our closest competitor driven by the very successful launch of our Gatorade Performance Series and strength across our tea portfolio. Also, our relative carbonated soft drink volume share position strengthened sequentially in the quarter versus our closest competitor aided by the relaunch of Pepsi MAX. We also launched the first natural mainstream CSD with Sierra Mist Natural, which is made with five simple ingredients and nothing artificial.
This is a large opportunity and allows consumers to what they love about CSD while removing some key barriers. We launched this product only few weeks ago, and advertising has just kicked in across multiple media vehicle.  
On October 9, we will hand out over 10 million full can samples of Wal-Mart Supercenters across America, the largest sampling event either Pepsi or Wal-Mart has ever undertaken. In addition to the sampling event, we have put a full year growth of marketing support in the fourth quarter 2010, with continued heavy support in 2011, which leads me then to the third key takeaway I shared at the start of the call. 
Even as we're investing to improve near-term performance, we're also investing to advance the longer-term strategic initiatives we shared with you at our Investor Meeting in March.
Let me touch on two of these initiatives. Power of One and NutritionCo, as examples of how we're building long-term growth potential and shareholder value. Many of you asked us whether the Power of One is anything more than just joint merchandising or can you really change the way you go to market and service your customers in a way that drives accretion for PepsiCo? Good question. And the answers are yes and yes.
Our focused Power of One team have a whole range of initiatives underway designed to provide enhanced solutions to our customers to better optimize our advantage supply chain and also to enhance organizational effectiveness and efficiency. For example, for our customers in the United States, we have streamlined our customer-facing resources to shopper insights teams under one organization. And we've held joint planning and growth summit with our largest customers with a focused effort to provide Power of One insights and solutions. We have dedicated Power of One resources in each region, and we're increasing by tenfold the number of sales leaders selling Power of One solutions.
To enhance organizational effectiveness and efficiency, in the United States, we are harmonizing our regional structures for beverages and snacks, which will allow us to better balance size and scale, share geographic boundary and align Power of One accountabilities and performance targets. 
On the marketing side, our teams have also driven unprecedented levels of Power of One activation in both the grocery and convenience channel. For over 70% of our Grocery business or about 200-plus customers, we have Power of One ads, growth in inventory on display and increased revenue. From July through September, we had 20,000 convenience outlets featuring Power of One activation, all of which was incremental to last year. 
And while the Super Bowl has traditionally been a strong shared merchandising opportunity for us, we are kicking it up a notch next year with the joint advertising of Frito-Lay and Pepsi Throwback products and also Pepsi MAX. We're just beginning to stress the surface of the vast opportunities available to us right here in the United States. 
So let me now turn to NutritionCo. I'm very pleased to announce today that we're establishing the Global Nutrition Group within PepsiCo. The creation of this group is consistent with the vision we shared with you in March, and our goal is to take roughly the $10 billion portfolio today and grow it into a $30 billion Nutrition business by 2020. 
The good news is that we're starting from a strong position, with high-quality nutritious brands like Quaker, Tropicana, Gatorade, Naked Juice, Alvalle soups, Sabra Dips, Sandora and Lebedyansky juices just to name a few. Our objective is to position PepsiCo globally as a leader in wholesome and convenient nutrition. We believe we can leverage our great portfolio of brands across four target platforms: Fruits & Vegetables, Grains, Dairy and Functional Nutrition to put PepsiCo in a uniquely advantaged position to win in the $500 billion global market for packaged nutrition.
To enable us to move even more aggressively towards our goal, today we announced several organizational changes that will accelerate our progress. Dr. Mehmood Khan, our Chief Scientific Officer and Corporate Leader of Research and Development, will assume additional responsibility as the CEO of the new Global Nutrition Group reporting directly to me. Based in Chicago, this group will collaborate with businesses across the globe to ensure rapid growth of our nutrition portfolio. 
They will be responsible for the following: First, the global product innovation agenda for Fruits & Vegetables, Grains and Dairy; second, functional nutrition, expanding beyond sports nutrition into new functional arenas over time; third, nutrition services, providing education incentives to help consumers change and sustain behaviors related to nutrition.
Jaya Kumar, President of Quaker Foods North America and previously Chief Marketing Officer of Frito-Lay North America, will move into a role as President, Global Nutrition Platforms reporting to Mehmood. To ensure a smooth transition, Jaya will maintain responsibility for Quaker North America under whose successor is named.
With this new group, we will be able to harness the best of PepsiCo by retaining the operating capability for these business in the sectors, while centralizing very important innovation and development of nutrition products based on science.
Mehmood and his team will work closely with all four PepsiCo sectors to integrate these innovations appropriately to each of the regional organizations and these sales and distribution systems.
So taking a step back, I would summarize the quarter as follows. We believe we delivered balanced top quartile performance in a very challenging macro environment. Even more importantly, we achieved this while investing in near-term opportunities like innovation and brand building and the longer-term initiatives that will transform PepsiCo and expand the value of the company well into the future. 
With that, Hugh, let me turn this call over to you."
32854,112172201,79641,"Pepsico, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 07, 2010",2010-10-07,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Great, thanks, Indra, and good morning, everyone. As you review our results, you'll see that our teams did a tremendous job balancing growth and investments while delivering on profitability and cash. Even in an economic environment that continues to be c",3141,"Great, thanks, Indra, and good morning, everyone. As you review our results, you'll see that our teams did a tremendous job balancing growth and investments while delivering on profitability and cash. Even in an economic environment that continues to be challenging, our steadfast commitment to surgical investments is producing results. That's why we've decided to maintain, and where it's warranted, step up our investment plans in the second half of this year, while targeting 11% to 12% growth in core constant currency EPS for the full year.
This step-up in investments is incremental to the $0.10 per share in strategic spending that we earmarked at the beginning of the year. In total, these investments include, first, expanding our beverage footprint in China, which is expected will be the world's largest LRB market by 2015 and the source of more than one of every three LRB cases in the next five years. This includes investment in routes, coolers, systems and additional capacity.
Second, revitalizing our North American Beverage business with increased investments in innovation and brand building, including our partnership with Senomyx, as well as increased levels of support for that Pepsi MAX and Sierra Mist. 
Third, laying a firm foundation for our Global Nutrition Group by reinforcing a key pillar, our pre-eminent health and wellness brand, Quaker. 
And finally, adding to our world-class R&D capabilities through building a brand new fruit and juice research center in Hamburg, Germany to support our European Juice businesses, expanding our salt-reduction technology and research and delivering whole grain nutrition in beverage forms using technology that is proprietary to PepsiCo.
All of these investments are closely scrutinized. Each business case must show a positive return on investment and drive directly or indirectly the long-term value of the company. And our business leaders are held accountable for the capital they request. As I review our operating results, I'll highlight in more detail some of these investments and the returns that they are already generating.
So let me start with PAF. FLNA division operating profit grew 10% on a 1% increase in net revenue. Volume growth, which was down 2%, improved sequentially as did our leverage from net revenue to profit driven by lower commodity costs, top line performance and Frito-Lay's focus on productivity. 
Units were up low single digits, which as we said last quarter, is a good proxy for a consumer pull of our products as the business overlaps last year's 20% More Free promotion. We finished that overlap very early in the fourth quarter, so we do expect that unit growth to translate to pound growth in the fourth quarter.
In the quarter, FLNA gained 70 basis points of salty snack value share and posted the fastest growth among top 20 food and beverage companies in measured channels. As Indra mentioned, we're having great success with our Lay's all-natural local flavors, which helped to drive solid revenue growth for the brand. Additionally, we continue to see double-digit growth volume growth in our Stacy's and Sabra products as we further our expansion into adjacent snack categories.
In our Food Service business was also a strength, driven by the very successful $2 Meal Deal promotion with Taco Bell. This is another example of how we strive to provide value offerings to our consumers through the Power of One with our great customer partners, and we're looking to extend this promotion.
At QFNA [Quaker Foods North America], we saw improved sequential performance with volume down just 1%, net revenue down 3.5% and operating profit down 5.5%. As we've said last quarter, we've been making investments in innovation and value to restage the Quaker brand as the pre-eminent health and wellness brand and to return the business to profitable growth. The majority of our instant oatmeal products has been reformulated with 25% less sugar, all-natural flavors, a hardier texture and improved taste. We're giving consumers the product experience that they've always loved with our standard oatmeal, but with the convenience of instant. 
We've also launched new innovative offerings targeted to two important consumer groups, Hearty Medleys, a multi-grain oatmeal for boomers made with real fruits and nuts and Mix-Up Creations, a healthy create-your-own oatmeal for kids. The early read is positive with shipments in distribution exceeding our expectations. The fourth quarter is a key selling season for oatmeal, and we are supporting our new product launches with in-store sampling, print, digital and social media support.  
We expect to see continued sequential improvements in both top line and profit performance from Quaker in the fourth quarter as our new product innovation takes hold, and our investments in innovation and value begin to pay back. However, we expect it will take several quarters for our restaging program to fully take hold and get us to where we want to be with this powerful brand.
In our Latin American Foods business, volume was up 5%, net revenues were up 12% and operating profit rose 22%. As expected, we're starting to see your investments in new routes, continued focus on value, marketplace execution and innovative promotions drive improved volume results. Also, effective net price realization drove strong volume to net revenue leverage and the strict cost-control focus drove flow-through from revenue to operating profit.
Throughout the Latin America region, macros remain mixed however. Mexico is showing moderate improvement, although they're still below pre-crisis levels. In South America, there are pockets of real strength, though Venezuela continues to be challenged. Our Latin American team's ability to navigate through shifting economic landscapes has been a long standing capability for PepsiCo.
For example, Sabritas delivered strong volume growth through continued focus on value, strong marketplace execution and innovative programs that drive consumer engagement. Our Paketaxo value brand continues to show strong growth, and year-to-date the sales of this brand alone now exceed the total sales of each of our top two competitors.
Gamesa grew volumes across all channels behind the successful execution of a soccer promotion, which featured cash prizes. We also benefited from the marketplace investments we made earlier in the year when we added 150 incremental routes, which are now fully optimized. Additionally, we gained 1.6 points of value share, a 3.6-point favorable swing versus our nearest competitor. In South America, volume growth accelerated from Q2 with strong performance in Brazil, Argentina and Chile.
Turning now to PAB, volume was up 13%, net revenue was up 118% and operating profit was up 79%, as we continue to benefit from the impact of the bottler acquisitions. Acquisitions contributed 14 points to PAB's volume growth.  Despite what remains a difficult consumer and retail environment, excluding the impact of acquisitions, volume in North America was flat as sequential improvement of one point versus the second quarter. 
Our belief in the long-term attractiveness and resiliency of the liquid refreshment beverage category has been bolstered as we're starting to see some positive signs of recovery in the category and expected to return to modest growth this year. We are being judicious though, and we'll continue to concentrate our efforts on specific categories that offer opportunities for profitable growth, while also maintaining pricing discipline.
We are focusing our resources, innovation, messaging and execution against these specific opportunities, and we're increasing our investments in brand building to support the growth. We are starting to see the pay off from our efforts as evidenced by the positive swing in total LRB volume share versus our nearest competitor that we achieved in the quarter.
The integration of our Bottling businesses is proceeding in line with our expectations. We're on track to deliver our full year synergy target and continue to look for further opportunities across a number of markets that will drive savings and incremental revenue in the future. As Indra mentioned, we're moving beyond delivering pure cost synergies to now realizing top line benefits and truly unlocking the strategic value of the merger.
Let me pause here and highlight the significance of being able to distribute Gatorade via DSD in the convenience and up and down the street channels. This is an important unlock for us. With this move, we'll align our go-to-market actions in small format, giving us strength in every product category and throughout the cold vault. This is a great example of how we're using PepsiCo's broad set of go-to-market systems to better serve our customers with more frequent service, fewer out of stocks and greater flexibility and responsiveness, while improving our own economics by adding scale and increasing drop sizes.
In the quarter, we accelerated volume growth in Gatorade through our transformation of the brand, which centers on innovation with the new G Series products, the expansion of our retail footprint and a targeted efficacy message aimed at rebuilding the brand's credentials. While we benefited from favorable weather, we're encouraged by our progress as the growth was across all channels in both ambient and cold formats. Our brand health metrics also continued to improve, and both our Prime and Recover products continue to do extremely well. While it is still early days, we are very pleased by the marketplace reaction and our recent results.
Another example of the power of integrated beverage company is in Food Service, where the merger removed historical structural barriers and created new growth opportunities. We're already making great progress by getting new business via commissaries, and we are not stopping there. We're using our Power of One sales teams to sell-in the entire PepsiCo portfolio across the largest workplace, healthcare and education accounts. We're already well on our way to doubling our market penetration this year and have plans to continue the expansion.
Regarding CSDs, clearly the overall category continues to be challenging. In this environment, it is imperative that we drive differentiated innovation, targeted at the current and future profitable segments of the category. We will do this while refining our price pack offerings by channel and occasion and striking the right balance between value, volume and profitability.
For instance, we're actively addressing two of the key barriers to CSD consumption: artificiality in calories through innovation and consumer engagement to rebuild our CSD momentum. Prime example of this are Sierra Mist Natural and Pepsi MAX. Indra already touched on Sierra Mist, I'll talk a little bit about Pepsi MAX. 
The relaunch of MAX is off to a great start, and we're investing heavily in our zero calorie, maximum Pepsi-taste communications. We've already stepped up our brand building support for MAX through a multi-year effort to raise the zero-calorie awareness among consumers. You'll see more of this during the Power of One Super Bowl lineup in January.
Finally, we announced the collaboration with Senomyx to develop new sweetener systems. The real challenge is to create products that are not only healthier, but also taste great. And Senomyx has unique technologies that will allow us to improve the nutritional profile of our products without sacrificing taste. This will complement the work our current partners and internal R&D teams are undertaking and will help us achieve our health and wellness goals of reducing calories and artificiality in our beverage products, including our commitment to reduce added sugar per serving by 25% in key brands in key markets over the next decade. This relationship with Senomyx reflects our increasingly long-term approach to research and development, as well as our belief that global food and beverage companies can play an important role in identifying new ingredients that can lead to healthier products.
Turning to Europe, we delivered a very strong quarter with sequential improvement in top line growth across both snacks and beverages. Year-over-year, snack volume was up 3%, beverage volume up 17%, net revenue up 55% and division operating profit up 45%. Europe's results continue to be positively impacted by the inclusion of the bottling acquisition. 
The macro environment we faced in the second quarter remains largely unchanged, and we expect only modest GDP growth across Europe. Unemployment remains high and the impact of austerity measures in a number of markets continues to depress consumer confidence. Despite the mixed economic picture however, we're seeing underlying growth return across Snacks and Beverages in several key markets.
Our Snacks business improved significantly in Eastern Europe and matched the strong growth we saw in the second quarter in Western Europe. This performance was underpinned by the success of our incremental investments this year and strong commercial programs. We built our Flavor Cup promotion around soccer in the U.K. and expanded our Benenuts nuts products into Poland. We continue to offer consumers differentiated value by leveraging successful concepts, such as Do Us a Flavor, which ran in Holland, Poland and Turkey as well as new programs such as travel promotions in Russia.
Beverage volume grew 17 points, but importantly, we delivered 10% growth, excluding the acquisition impact. This represents a 6-point sequential improvement in organic growth over the second quarter. While there was a sequential improvement in volume growth in Western Europe, the majority of the six-point sequential improvement came from Eastern Europe, where we've been aggressively adding new routes and coolers. A strong commercial calendar helped us capture share while an unusually hot summer helped to drive category growth.
Our consumer focus commercial programs continue to drive strong volume growth, and we delivered dollar share gains in key markets, such as Russia, Turkey, Spain, and the U.K. As with Snacks, most markets focused their activity around soccer, and our promotions continue to generate a very positive response from consumers. We also kept up the momentum on our differentiated value programs with our text message programs in Turkey enjoying strong consumer uptick. 
While the unusually hot summer in Eastern Europe has helped our beverage volume, it has also affected crop harvest in the region. As a result, we absorbed higher than planned input costs for our Snack business in the quarter, and this will continue into the fourth quarter.
Turning now to AMEA, Snack volume was up 16%, Beverage volume rose 4% and net revenue grew 13%. As expected, division operating profit declined 19% as AMEA overlapped more than 30 points of operating profit growth associated with the contribution of our Snacks business in Japan last year to form a joint venture with Calbee Foods Company, the Snack's market leader in Japan. Profit growth was also impacted by our decision to invest in longer-term strategic initiatives in both our Snacks and Beverage business in this key growth region, especially in China.
AMEA delivered top line growth across both Snacks and Beverages, and we successfully defended our CSD and savory share positions in many markets despite competitive challenges. Snack volume continue to grow in the mid-teens driven by double-digit gains in India, China, the Middle East and Indonesia. In India, volume growth was up over 20% behind the continued success of our marketing efforts such as Lay’s Give Us Your Delicious Flavor promotion, new product innovations like Kurkure, which is tailored for local consumer taste and a strong performance of our Quaker brands.
In China, Snack volume grew 15% driven by potato chip growth and distribution gains on Quaker. Across the balance of the region, our results were supported by new product introductions, such as Sun Bites in Thailand, Nori Seaweed flavor Lay's potato chips in Vietnam and Doritos Tandoori Chicken in Egypt.
In Beverages, volume growth was driven by double-digit gains in Egypt and in Thailand. China's growth of 9% reflects continued strong growth in NCBs and high single-digit growth in CSDs, as we stepped up our marketplace investments in routes, coolers and brand building.
Adding to the NCB growth was the national launch of our Tropicana Pulp Sacs product, which is helping to drive record-high brand scores as well as share gains. While the CSD category in China continues to be challenged, we grew our CSD share behind gains in Mirinda and 7UP, and we remain the leader in the Cola segment.
We're well positioned to realize the long-term potential of the many developing markets in this region. The investments we have in place are bearing fruit, and we still have a long way to go. We will continue to invest in innovation and build scale businesses to expand our footprint across Beverages and Snacks, especially in China and India and increase our sales and go-to-market capability. China is expected to overtake the U.S. as the world's largest packaged foods market by 2014, and as the second largest food and beverage company in the world, it's imperative that we expand our footprint in this critical market.
Now let me turn to our outlook for the year. We are on track to deliver EPS results within our original target range. With three quarters of the year now behind us, we are tightening our range to 11% to 12% growth in core constant currency EPS for 2010. We expect to deliver on our full year EPS target, while also investing in many of the initiatives that we've talked about this morning. 
As a result of our strong operating productivity, focused investments and working capital discipline this year, we now expect to deliver about $8 billion in cash flow from operating activities, with management operating cash flow, excluding certain items and net of capital expenditures of about $6.1 billion. That's about $500 million higher than our previous forecast.
Net CapEx should total about $3.3 billion, which includes about $200 million in capital investments related to the bottler acquisition. We expect to capture about $150 million in synergies from the bottling acquisitions this year with $400 million in annual savings once fully implemented by 2012. And lastly, we still expect our full year reported tax rate to be roughly 23% to 24%, which reflect a benefit of about four percentage points from non-core items.
Before we go to Q&A, let me leave you with a few of my own observations about the quarter. First, we delivered on our EPS commitments while responsibly balancing growth, investments, profitability and liquidity. Second, we're making clear strides in the revitalization of our North American Beverage business in key strategic areas, and we are delivering on the benefits of the acquisitions. And third, our scale, geographic footprint and broad product portfolio positioned us well to capture growth and improve our performance across all the regions and product categories.
Overall, we feel very good about PepsiCo's performance and also about PepsiCo as an investment. We deliver strong, steady cash flow, and we convert that cash to shareholder return with a solid dividend yield, plus an attractive share repurchase program. Further, we have both geographic and product portfolio diversity that offers the prospect of growth and durability in operating performance.
In sum, even while the consumer, financial and economic environments are difficult and challenging, we believe that Pep is an equity that is built to perform. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator for questions."

And so, we're generally seeing a higher level of competitive spending across consumer staples right now. I think if you look at this, there is some concern that the reduction in guidance for additional spending is simply a reaction to higher competitive spending levels, what have you, or potentially just simply, you know what the margins -- as you look at the margins heading out to 2011, they're still too high. So we talked about this before, but what will we see on the top line as we look out into 2011 and beyond that really highlights the fact that this is additional investment, and this is being done from a position of strength as opposed to a position of weakness?"

We are saying we tightened the guidance. We gave you a range, 11% to 13%. All that we're doing now is tightening the guidance. So we feel very good about where we've been so far in the year, and we feel good about the fourth quarter. And in today's macroeconomic environment, to deliver 11% to 12% EPS growth for a company of our size and scale, I think it's fantastic performance. So that's the first point. Point two, we're managing the company for the long term. And when we see opportunities to make investments, which we think will pay off may not be in the next quarter or two, but over the long term. Because many of these require investments in platforms in R&D, we are going to make those investments because we have to make sure that we're looking at innovation 24, 36 months out. Because as we move more in more into the nutrition space, it's no longer mere line extensions, but we have to think about products backed by science. And science takes some time to be proved and authenticated and that's what we're focusing on. But that's just a word by way of preamble.

We're now tightening it to 11% to 12%, as we've now gotten into Q4 and the latter part of the year, we obviously had more line of sight as to where the year is ultimately going to come in. The second points on that is, we're seeing signs that the investments that we have been making in the business really are creating payback, whether you look at things that are going on with an NAB or the things that are happening internationally with China and India and developing markets. So as we see that positive response, we do view it as an opportunity to invest more, and frankly, an opportunity to get good pay back over time. In terms of the specific investments, what we're really doing is investing, I think in a couple of places -- and a lot of it is additional relative to what we've talked about in the past, which is further investments in things like China and Russia, in areas like selling, coolers, rack and systems infrastructure. Second, in brand building, particularly in NAB, around things like MAX and Sierra Mist. And third, as we talked about these Global Nutrition Group, it's making investments in things that will support our future and nutrition, things like Quaker brand building and innovation and investments around fruits and vegetables, salt reduction and grains technology. So these are the types of investments that, as Indra said, are things that are going to pay back over time, but they're the types of investments that really do drive the long-term value of the company.

Hugh talked about spending in China, accelerated spending in China, stepped-up levels. Look, when you spend in China and put in coolers, marketplace investments, you're not going to get the profitability impact in the next 12 or 24 months. It takes a longer time because we are still in a massive investment mode in China. This has got years and years of growth. When we step up investments in India, again, you're not getting the returns right away. But it's a must-invest market because the demographics and the fact that per capita levels are so low gives you many years of growth. So we are making stepped-up investments in these countries because either we've got the permission to invest or we see an opportunity to go in with a new product or a marketplace investment at favorable terms today. So we're looking around the world and wherever we see the opportunity, we are ramping up the investments.

During today's call, unless otherwise noted, all references to net revenue growth are on a constant-currency basis. And all references to EPS growth and division operating profit growth are on a core constant-currency basis. Please read our Q3 earnings release for more detail.
Before we begin, please take note of our cautionary statement. This conference call includes forward-looking statements based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. Our actual results could differ materially from those predicted in such forward-looking statements, but we undertake no obligation to update any such statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

32854,112172201,79653,"Pepsico, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 07, 2010",2010-10-07,"Earnings Calls","PepsiCo, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I want to highlight three significant takeaways from PepsiCo's performance this quarter. First, in a very challenging macro environment, we delivered great results for Q3 on the top line, bottom line and cash fl",2050,"Thanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I want to highlight three significant takeaways from PepsiCo's performance this quarter. 
First, in a very challenging macro environment, we delivered great results for Q3 on the top line, bottom line and cash flow. Second, while delivering these strong results, we are investing in both innovation in, brand and these investments are already yielding returns. And third, consistent with what we shared with you in March, we are making strategic investments to transform PepsiCo in specific ways that we believe will enhance our competitiveness, solidify our growth and expand the value of the company well into the future.
So let me turn to the first key takeaway, our strong results. As we've discussed in recent calls, there's been bated improvement in the consumer and economic environment. Looking at the markets in which we operate, there is no doubt that economic uncertainty and high unemployment levels are keeping a consumer-led recovery at bay in many reasons, especially in developed markets like the United States and Western Europe. We expect these conditions to persist and are planning accordingly with a keen eye on delivering value to customers with an efficient cost structure to ensure that we remain competitive and grow profitably. 
Our ability to accelerate profitable growth this quarter in both developed and developing markets demonstrates our ability to control costs, while leveraging the significant advantages provided by the scale and breadth of our portfolio.
In the quarter, volume in our Global Snacks portfolio was up 2%, and volume in our Global Beverage portfolio was up 11%. That growth fueled a 41% increase in net revenue and a 29% increase in division operating profit. Core constant currency EPS grew 15%. 
Year-to-date, management operating cash flow, excluding certain items, was up 29% to $5.3 billion. And this strong cash flow allowed us already to achieve our 2010 target of repurchasing $4.4 billion of stock by the third quarter. And while developed countries are challenging, we are seeing healthy consumer spending in emerging countries, with strong GDP growth in countries such as China, India and Brazil, as well as those that are improving like Russia and Turkey. In fact, in our emerging markets, snack volume grew at a high single-digit rate, while beverage volume grew at the mid-teens rate.
Throughout the world though, consumers remain value conscious. This is where the advantages of PepsiCo possesses and granular management of productivity and local execution in the market drove differentiated performance this quarter. For example, at Frito-Lay, we've launched a new urban program. The target's close to 100,000 underserved retail partners. This program is dedicated to leveraging the power of our direct store delivery system to bring these retailers more relevant product categories at more attractive prices.
In markets where we have rolled out this program, our top line has grown at two to three times the average of our base business. And now to the Power of One, we will leverage this program across both our Snacks and Beverage business.
More broadly, at Pepsi Americas Beverages, we've worked aggressively to capture post-merger SG&A cost synergies and we're now on track to hit above the $150 million in synergies this year. Now we're focused on operating revenue synergies that will help fuel top line momentum going forward. For example, in the third quarter, we announced that early next year, we will start distributing Gatorade to small format stores through our DSD systems. As you know, this is a major shift that could not have come without the bottling acquisition, and it will bring additional go-to-market strength to the many ongoing improvements we are making to the Gatorade brand and product portfolio.
But while we continue to see improving trends across our business in North America, the power of PepsiCo's balanced portfolio maybe even more evident in Europe. Our Snacks business there continue to perform well, with 3% volume growth driven by differentiated value offerings, such as the rollout of our successful ""Do Us a Flavor"" snack promotion in Holland, Poland and Turkey.
Simultaneously, the European Beverage business grew by 10% organically, where our consumer-focus commercial programs drove at least one point of CSD [carbonated soft drink] value and volume share in key markets such as the U.K., Russia and Turkey. Our balance is also evident geographically, where on an organic basis, we grew a solid 6% in Western Europe and 14% in Eastern Europe. 
In sum, all of these results demonstrate the strength and balance of our portfolio in delivering sequential improvement in business performance through a difficult macroeconomic environment. And I'm pleased to say that we gained LRB share versus our closest competitor in both North America and in Europe.
Let me turn now to my second key takeaway. Our positive performance this quarter clearly benefited from focused investments we're making in product innovations and stepped-up brand building in key areas of our portfolio. For example, Frito-Lay's Salty Snack value share gains were aided by the launch of Lay's all-natural regional flavors. These are products that allow us to elevate our core portfolio in the near term, and we are targeting to have about 50% of our portfolio all natural by the end of 2011.
I know that some of you recently visited Frito-Lay's culinary center and experienced first hand some of the wonderful products we're developing, such as the Tostitos Artisan products. 100% of our Tostitos chips are naturally made with whole-grain corn. These will enable us to make our snacks portfolio more wholesome, while retaining the best characteristics of our snack products.
We're also expanding further into adjacencies. For example, we continue to expand our dip portfolio, leveraging our fantastic Sabra brand, and we're broadening our bread-based platforms through Twistos and Stacy's.
At Quaker, after several quarters of increased investments, we have brought to market a promising combination of improved quality and value, product innovation and a creative new brand-building campaign. This launch is off to a good start, driving both market share gains and sequential improvement in volume, revenue and operating profit performance as we continue to turn around this very important business.
At Pepsi Americas Beverages, in the United States, we had a positive swing in LRB volume share versus our closest competitor driven by the very successful launch of our Gatorade Performance Series and strength across our tea portfolio. Also, our relative carbonated soft drink volume share position strengthened sequentially in the quarter versus our closest competitor aided by the relaunch of Pepsi MAX. We also launched the first natural mainstream CSD with Sierra Mist Natural, which is made with five simple ingredients and nothing artificial.
This is a large opportunity and allows consumers to what they love about CSD while removing some key barriers. We launched this product only few weeks ago, and advertising has just kicked in across multiple media vehicle.  
On October 9, we will hand out over 10 million full can samples of Wal-Mart Supercenters across America, the largest sampling event either Pepsi or Wal-Mart has ever undertaken. In addition to the sampling event, we have put a full year growth of marketing support in the fourth quarter 2010, with continued heavy support in 2011, which leads me then to the third key takeaway I shared at the start of the call. 
Even as we're investing to improve near-term performance, we're also investing to advance the longer-term strategic initiatives we shared with you at our Investor Meeting in March.
Let me touch on two of these initiatives. Power of One and NutritionCo, as examples of how we're building long-term growth potential and shareholder value. Many of you asked us whether the Power of One is anything more than just joint merchandising or can you really change the way you go to market and service your customers in a way that drives accretion for PepsiCo? Good question. And the answers are yes and yes.
Our focused Power of One team have a whole range of initiatives underway designed to provide enhanced solutions to our customers to better optimize our advantage supply chain and also to enhance organizational effectiveness and efficiency. For example, for our customers in the United States, we have streamlined our customer-facing resources to shopper insights teams under one organization. And we've held joint planning and growth summit with our largest customers with a focused effort to provide Power of One insights and solutions. We have dedicated Power of One resources in each region, and we're increasing by tenfold the number of sales leaders selling Power of One solutions.
To enhance organizational effectiveness and efficiency, in the United States, we are harmonizing our regional structures for beverages and snacks, which will allow us to better balance size and scale, share geographic boundary and align Power of One accountabilities and performance targets. 
On the marketing side, our teams have also driven unprecedented levels of Power of One activation in both the grocery and convenience channel. For over 70% of our Grocery business or about 200-plus customers, we have Power of One ads, growth in inventory on display and increased revenue. From July through September, we had 20,000 convenience outlets featuring Power of One activation, all of which was incremental to last year. 
And while the Super Bowl has traditionally been a strong shared merchandising opportunity for us, we are kicking it up a notch next year with the joint advertising of Frito-Lay and Pepsi Throwback products and also Pepsi MAX. We're just beginning to stress the surface of the vast opportunities available to us right here in the United States. 
So let me now turn to NutritionCo. I'm very pleased to announce today that we're establishing the Global Nutrition Group within PepsiCo. The creation of this group is consistent with the vision we shared with you in March, and our goal is to take roughly the $10 billion portfolio today and grow it into a $30 billion Nutrition business by 2020. 
The good news is that we're starting from a strong position, with high-quality nutritious brands like Quaker, Tropicana, Gatorade, Naked Juice, Alvalle soups, Sabra Dips, Sandora and Lebedyansky juices just to name a few. Our objective is to position PepsiCo globally as a leader in wholesome and convenient nutrition. We believe we can leverage our great portfolio of brands across four target platforms: Fruits & Vegetables, Grains, Dairy and Functional Nutrition to put PepsiCo in a uniquely advantaged position to win in the $500 billion global market for packaged nutrition.
To enable us to move even more aggressively towards our goal, today we announced several organizational changes that will accelerate our progress. Dr. Mehmood Khan, our Chief Scientific Officer and Corporate Leader of Research and Development, will assume additional responsibility as the CEO of the new Global Nutrition Group reporting directly to me. Based in Chicago, this group will collaborate with businesses across the globe to ensure rapid growth of our nutrition portfolio. 
They will be responsible for the following: First, the global product innovation agenda for Fruits & Vegetables, Grains and Dairy; second, functional nutrition, expanding beyond sports nutrition into new functional arenas over time; third, nutrition services, providing education incentives to help consumers change and sustain behaviors related to nutrition.
Jaya Kumar, President of Quaker Foods North America and previously Chief Marketing Officer of Frito-Lay North America, will move into a role as President, Global Nutrition Platforms reporting to Mehmood. To ensure a smooth transition, Jaya will maintain responsibility for Quaker North America under whose successor is named.
With this new group, we will be able to harness the best of PepsiCo by retaining the operating capability for these business in the sectors, while centralizing very important innovation and development of nutrition products based on science.
Mehmood and his team will work closely with all four PepsiCo sectors to integrate these innovations appropriately to each of the regional organizations and these sales and distribution systems.
So taking a step back, I would summarize the quarter as follows. We believe we delivered balanced top quartile performance in a very challenging macro environment. Even more importantly, we achieved this while investing in near-term opportunities like innovation and brand building and the longer-term initiatives that will transform PepsiCo and expand the value of the company well into the future. 
With that, Hugh, let me turn this call over to you."

As you review our results, you'll see that our teams did a tremendous job balancing growth and investments while delivering on profitability and cash. Even in an economic environment that continues to be c",3141,"Great, thanks, Indra, and good morning, everyone. As you review our results, you'll see that our teams did a tremendous job balancing growth and investments while delivering on profitability and cash. Even in an economic environment that continues to be challenging, our steadfast commitment to surgical investments is producing results. That's why we've decided to maintain, and where it's warranted, step up our investment plans in the second half of this year, while targeting 11% to 12% growth in core constant currency EPS for the full year.
This step-up in investments is incremental to the $0.10 per share in strategic spending that we earmarked at the beginning of the year. In total, these investments include, first, expanding our beverage footprint in China, which is expected will be the world's largest LRB market by 2015 and the source of more than one of every three LRB cases in the next five years. This includes investment in routes, coolers, systems and additional capacity.
Second, revitalizing our North American Beverage business with increased investments in innovation and brand building, including our partnership with Senomyx, as well as increased levels of support for that Pepsi MAX and Sierra Mist. 
Third, laying a firm foundation for our Global Nutrition Group by reinforcing a key pillar, our pre-eminent health and wellness brand, Quaker. 
And finally, adding to our world-class R&D capabilities through building a brand new fruit and juice research center in Hamburg, Germany to support our European Juice businesses, expanding our salt-reduction technology and research and delivering whole grain nutrition in beverage forms using technology that is proprietary to PepsiCo.
All of these investments are closely scrutinized. Each business case must show a positive return on investment and drive directly or indirectly the long-term value of the company. And our business leaders are held accountable for the capital they request. As I review our operating results, I'll highlight in more detail some of these investments and the returns that they are already generating.
So let me start with PAF. FLNA division operating profit grew 10% on a 1% increase in net revenue. Volume growth, which was down 2%, improved sequentially as did our leverage from net revenue to profit driven by lower commodity costs, top line performance and Frito-Lay's focus on productivity. 
Units were up low single digits, which as we said last quarter, is a good proxy for a consumer pull of our products as the business overlaps last year's 20% More Free promotion. We finished that overlap very early in the fourth quarter, so we do expect that unit growth to translate to pound growth in the fourth quarter.
In the quarter, FLNA gained 70 basis points of salty snack value share and posted the fastest growth among top 20 food and beverage companies in measured channels. As Indra mentioned, we're having great success with our Lay's all-natural local flavors, which helped to drive solid revenue growth for the brand. Additionally, we continue to see double-digit growth volume growth in our Stacy's and Sabra products as we further our expansion into adjacent snack categories.
Our Food Service business was also a strength, driven by the very successful $2 Meal Deal promotion with Taco Bell. This is another example of how we strive to provide value offerings to our consumers through the Power of One with our great customer partners, and we're looking to extend this promotion.
At QFNA [Quaker Foods North America], we saw improved sequential performance with volume down just 1%, net revenue down 3.5% and operating profit down 5.5%. As we've said last quarter, we've been making investments in innovation and value to restage the Quaker brand as the pre-eminent health and wellness brand and to return the business to profitable growth. The majority of our instant oatmeal products have been reformulated with 25% less sugar, all-natural flavors, a hardier texture and improved taste. We're giving consumers the product experience that they've always loved with our standard oatmeal, but with the convenience of instant. 
We've also launched new innovative offerings targeted to two important consumer groups, Hearty Medleys, a multi-grain oatmeal for boomers made with real fruits and nuts and Mix-Up Creations, a healthy create-your-own oatmeal for kids. The early read is positive with shipments in distribution exceeding our expectations. The fourth quarter is a key selling season for oatmeal, and we are supporting our new product launches with in-store sampling, print, digital and social media support.  
We expect to see continued sequential improvements in both top line and profit performance from Quaker in the fourth quarter as our new product innovation takes hold, and our investments in innovation and value begin to pay back. However, we expect it will take several quarters for our restaging program to fully take hold and get us to where we want to be with this powerful brand.
In our Latin American Foods business, volume was up 5%, net revenues were up 12% and operating profit rose 22%. As expected, we're starting to see your investments in new routes, continued focus on value, marketplace execution and innovative promotions drive improved volume results. Also, effective net price realization drove strong volume to net revenue leverage and the strict cost-control focus drove flow-through from revenue to operating profit.
Throughout the Latin America region, macros remain mixed however. Mexico is showing moderate improvement, although they're still below pre-crisis levels. In South America, there are pockets of real strength, though Venezuela continues to be challenged. Our Latin American team's ability to navigate through shifting economic landscapes has been a long standing capability for PepsiCo.
For example, Sabritas delivered strong volume growth through continued focus on value, strong marketplace execution and innovative programs that drive consumer engagement. Our Paketaxo value brand continues to show strong growth, and year-to-date the sales of this brand alone now exceed the total sales of each of our top two competitors.
Gamesa grew volumes across all channels behind the successful execution of a soccer promotion, which featured cash prizes. We also benefited from the marketplace investments we made earlier in the year when we added 150 incremental routes, which are now fully optimized. Additionally, we gained 1.6 points of value share, a 3.6-point favorable swing versus our nearest competitor. In South America, volume growth accelerated from Q2 with strong performance in Brazil, Argentina and Chile.
Turning now to PAB, volume was up 13%, net revenue was up 118% and operating profit was up 79%, as we continue to benefit from the impact of the bottler acquisitions. Acquisitions contributed 14 points to PAB's volume growth.  Despite what remains a difficult consumer and retail environment, excluding the impact of acquisitions, volume in North America was flat, a sequential improvement of one point versus the second quarter. 
Our belief in the long-term attractiveness and resiliency of the liquid refreshment beverage category has been bolstered as we're starting to see some positive signs of recovery in the category and expected it to return to modest growth this year. We are being judicious though, and we'll continue to concentrate our efforts on specific categories that offer opportunities for profitable growth, while also maintaining pricing discipline.
We are focusing our resources, innovation, messaging and execution against these specific opportunities, and we're increasing our investments in brand building to support the growth. We are starting to see the pay off from our efforts as evidenced by the positive swing in total LRB volume share versus our nearest competitor that we achieved in the quarter.
The integration of our Bottling businesses is proceeding in line with our expectations. We're on track to deliver our full year synergy target and continue to look for further opportunities across a number of markets that will drive savings and incremental revenue in the future. As Indra mentioned, we're moving beyond delivering pure cost synergies to now realizing top line benefits and truly unlocking the strategic value of the merger.
Let me pause here and highlight the significance of being able to distribute Gatorade via DSD in the convenience and up and down the street channels. This is an important unlock for us. With this move, we'll align our go-to-market actions in small format, giving us strength in every product category and throughout the cold vault. This is a great example of how we're using PepsiCo's broad set of go-to-market systems to better serve our customers with more frequent service, fewer out of stocks and greater flexibility and responsiveness, while improving our own economics by adding scale and increasing drop sizes.
In the quarter, we accelerated volume growth in Gatorade through our transformation of the brand, which centers on innovation with the new G Series products, the expansion of our retail footprint and a targeted efficacy message aimed at rebuilding the brand's credentials. While we benefited from favorable weather, we're encouraged by our progress as the growth was across all channels in both ambient and cold formats. Our brand health metrics also continued to improve, and both our Prime and Recover products continue to do extremely well. While it is still early days, we are very pleased by the marketplace reaction and our recent results.
Another example of the power of integrated beverage company is in Food Service, where the merger removed historical structural barriers and created new growth opportunities. We're already making great progress by getting new business via commissaries, and we are not stopping there. We're using our Power of One sales teams to sell-in the entire PepsiCo portfolio across the largest workplace, healthcare and education accounts. We're already well on our way to doubling our market penetration this year and have plans to continue the expansion.
Regarding CSDs, clearly the overall category continues to be challenging. In this environment, it is imperative that we drive differentiated innovation, targeted at the current and future profitable segments of the category. We will do this while refining our price pack offerings by channel and occasion and striking the right balance between value, volume and profitability.
For instance, we're actively addressing two of the key barriers to CSD consumption: artificiality in calories through innovation and consumer engagement to rebuild our CSD momentum. Prime example of this are Sierra Mist Natural and Pepsi MAX. Indra already touched on Sierra Mist, I'll talk a little bit about Pepsi MAX. 
The relaunch of MAX is off to a great start, and we're investing heavily in our zero calorie, maximum Pepsi-taste communications. We've already stepped up our brand building support for MAX through a multi-year effort to raise the zero-calorie awareness among consumers. You'll see more of this during the Power of One Super Bowl lineup in January.
Finally, we announced the collaboration with Senomyx to develop new sweetener systems. The real challenge is to create products that are not only healthier, but also taste great. And Senomyx has unique technologies that will allow us to improve the nutritional profile of our products without sacrificing taste. This will complement the work our current partners and internal R&D teams are undertaking and will help us achieve our health and wellness goals of reducing calories and artificiality in our beverage products, including our commitment to reduce added sugar per serving by 25% in key brands in key markets over the next decade. This relationship with Senomyx reflects our increasingly long-term approach to research and development, as well as our belief that global food and beverage companies can play an important role in identifying new ingredients that can lead to healthier products.
Turning to Europe, we delivered a very strong quarter with sequential improvement in top line growth across both snacks and beverages. Year-over-year, snack volume was up 3%, beverage volume up 17%, net revenue up 55% and division operating profit up 45%. Europe's results continue to be positively impacted by the inclusion of the bottling acquisition. 
The macro environment we faced in the second quarter remains largely unchanged, and we expect only modest GDP growth across Europe. Unemployment remains high and the impact of austerity measures in a number of markets continues to depress consumer confidence. Despite the mixed economic picture however, we're seeing underlying growth return across Snacks and Beverages in several key markets.
Our Snacks business improved significantly in Eastern Europe and matched the strong growth we saw in the second quarter in Western Europe. This performance was underpinned by the success of our incremental investments this year and strong commercial programs. We built our Flavor Cup promotion around soccer in the U.K. and expanded our Benenuts nuts products into Poland. We continue to offer consumers differentiated value by leveraging successful concepts, such as Do Us a Flavor, which ran in Holland, Poland and Turkey as well as new programs such as travel promotions in Russia.
Beverage volume grew 17 points, but importantly, we delivered 10% growth, excluding the acquisition impact. This represents a 6-point sequential improvement in organic growth over the second quarter. While there was a sequential improvement in volume growth in Western Europe, the majority of the six-point sequential improvement came from Eastern Europe, where we've been aggressively adding new routes and coolers. A strong commercial calendar helped us capture share while an unusually hot summer helped to drive category growth.
Our consumer focus commercial programs continue to drive strong volume growth, and we delivered dollar share gains in key markets, such as Russia, Turkey, Spain, and the U.K. As with Snacks, most markets focused their activity around soccer, and our promotions continue to generate a very positive response from consumers. We also kept up the momentum on our differentiated value programs with our text message programs in Turkey enjoying strong consumer uptick. 
While the unusually hot summer in Eastern Europe has helped our beverage volume, it has also affected crop harvest in the region. As a result, we absorbed higher than planned input costs for our Snack business in the quarter, and this will continue into the fourth quarter.
Turning now to AMEA, Snack volume was up 16%, Beverage volume rose 4% and net revenue grew 13%. As expected, division operating profit declined 19% as AMEA overlapped more than 30 points of operating profit growth associated with the contribution of our Snacks business in Japan last year to form a joint venture with Calbee Foods Company, the Snack's market leader in Japan. Profit growth was also impacted by our decision to invest in longer-term strategic initiatives in both our Snacks and Beverage business in this key growth region, especially in China.
AMEA delivered top line growth across both Snacks and Beverages, and we successfully defended our CSD and savory share positions in many markets despite competitive challenges. Snack volume continue to grow in the mid-teens driven by double-digit gains in India, China, the Middle East and Indonesia. In India, volume growth was up over 20% behind the continued success of our marketing efforts such as Lay’s Give Us Your Delicious Flavor promotion, new product innovations like Kurkure, which is tailored for local consumer taste and a strong performance of our Quaker brands.
In China, Snack volume grew 15% driven by potato chip growth and distribution gains on Quaker. Across the balance of the region, our results were supported by new product introductions, such as Sun Bites in Thailand, Nori Seaweed flavor Lay's potato chips in Vietnam and Doritos Tandoori Chicken in Egypt.
In Beverages, volume growth was driven by double-digit gains in Egypt and in Thailand. China's growth of 9% reflects continued strong growth in NCBs and high single-digit growth in CSDs, as we stepped up our marketplace investments in routes, coolers and brand building.
Adding to the NCB growth was the national launch of our Tropicana Pulp Sacs product, which is helping to drive record-high brand scores as well as share gains. While the CSD category in China continues to be challenged, we grew our CSD share behind gains in Mirinda and 7UP, and we remain the leader in the Cola segment.
We're well positioned to realize the long-term potential of the many developing markets in this region. The investments we have in place are bearing fruit, and we still have a long way to go. We will continue to invest in innovation and build scale businesses to expand our footprint across Beverages and Snacks, especially in China and India and increase our sales and go-to-market capability. China is expected to overtake the U.S. as the world's largest packaged foods market by 2014, and as the second largest food and beverage company in the world, it's imperative that we expand our footprint in this critical market.
Now let me turn to our outlook for the year. We are on track to deliver EPS results within our original target range. With three quarters of the year now behind us, we are tightening our range to 11% to 12% growth in core constant currency EPS for 2010. We expect to deliver on our full year EPS target, while also investing in many of the initiatives that we've talked about this morning. 
As a result of our strong operating productivity, focused investments and working capital discipline this year, we now expect to deliver about $8 billion in cash flow from operating activities, with management operating cash flow, excluding certain items and net of capital expenditures of about $6.1 billion. That's about $500 million higher than our previous forecast.
Net CapEx should total about $3.3 billion, which includes about $200 million in capital investments related to the bottler acquisition. We expect to capture about $150 million in synergies from the bottling acquisitions this year with $400 million in annual savings once fully implemented by 2012. And lastly, we still expect our full year reported tax rate to be roughly 23% to 24%, which reflect a benefit of about four percentage points from non-core items.
Before we go to Q&A, let me leave you with a few of my own observations about the quarter. First, we delivered on our EPS commitments while responsibly balancing growth, investments, profitability and liquidity. Second, we're making clear strides in the revitalization of our North American Beverage business in key strategic areas, and we are delivering on the benefits of the acquisitions. And third, our scale, geographic footprint and broad product portfolio positioned us well to capture growth and improve our performance across all the regions and product categories.
Overall, we feel very good about PepsiCo's performance and also about PepsiCo as an investment. We deliver strong, steady cash flow, and we convert that cash to shareholder return with a solid dividend yield, plus an attractive share repurchase program. Further, we have both geographic and product portfolio diversity that offers the prospect of growth and durability in operating performance.
In sum, even while the consumer, financial and economic environments are difficult and challenging, we believe that Pep is an equity that is built to perform. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator for questions."

I think if you look at this, there is some concern that the reduction in guidance for additional spending is simply a reaction to higher competitive spending levels, what have you, or potentially just simply, you know what the margins -- as you look at the margins heading out to 2011, they're still too high. So we talked about this before, but what will we see on the top line as we look out into 2011 and beyond that really highlights the fact that this is additional investment, and this is being done from a position of strength as opposed to a position of weakness?"

We are saying we tightened the guidance. We gave you a range, 11% to 13%. All that we're doing now is tightening the guidance. So we feel very good about where we've been so far in the year, and we feel good about the fourth quarter. And in today's macroeconomic environment, to deliver 11% to 12% EPS growth for a company of our size and scale, I think it's fantastic performance. So that's the first point. Point two, we're managing the company for the long term. And when we see opportunities to make investments, which we think will pay off may not be in the next quarter or two, but over the long term. Because many of these require investments in platforms in R&D, we are going to make those investments because we have to make sure that we're looking at innovation 24, 36 months out. Because as we move more in more into the nutrition space, it's no longer mere line extensions, but we have to think about products backed by science. And science takes some time to be proved and authenticated and that's what we're focusing on. But that's just a word by way of preamble.

We're now tightening it to 11% to 12%, as we've now gotten into Q4 and the latter part of the year, we obviously had more line of sight as to where the year is ultimately going to come in. The second point on that is, we're seeing signs that the investments that we have been making in the business really are creating payback, whether you look at things that are going on with an NAB or the things that are happening internationally with China and India and developing markets. So as we see that positive response, we do view it as an opportunity to invest more, and frankly, an opportunity to get good pay back over time. In terms of the specific investments, what we're really doing is investing, I think in a couple of places -- and a lot of it is additional relative to what we've talked about in the past, which is further investments in things like China and Russia, in areas like selling, coolers, rack and systems infrastructure. Second, in brand building, particularly in NAB, around things like MAX and Sierra Mist. And third, as we talked about these Global Nutrition Group, it's making investments in things that will support our future and nutrition, things like Quaker brand building and innovation and investments around fruits and vegetables, salt reduction and grains technology. So these are the types of investments that, as Indra said, are things that are going to pay back over time, but they're the types of investments that really do drive the long-term value of the company.

But it's a must-invest market because the demographics and the fact that per capita levels are so low gives you many years of growth.
