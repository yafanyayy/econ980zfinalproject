It's my pleasure to be speaking with you today on Northern Trust's Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, Northern Trust reported fourth quarter 2009 net income of $200 million, equal to $0.82 a share. These results were achieved in the context of an economic environment that continues to be challenging on several fronts. Although equity markets have improved, interest rates and spreads remain very low, which impacts several revenue sources and market volatility is dramatically lower than it was a year ago, which impacts our foreign exchange trading income. For the full year 2009, despite these difficult business conditions, we achieved record net income of $864 million. As I'll discuss in more detail later, we continue to win new clients in both our personal and our institutional businesses. Economic conditions notwithstanding, we think that our highly focused client-centric business model underpinned by our strong financial condition positions Northern Trust very well for growth and success in the years ahead.To assist you in understanding our performance for this quarter, we've organized today's remarks under the following sections: First, I'll discuss market conditions that impacted our performance in the fourth quarter; second, I'll review our financial performance focusing on those items that most impacted our results; and third, I'll offer our perspectives on the near-term environment and the longer-term strategic positioning of Northern Trust; and finally, Bev and I will be happy to answer your questions.The equity market environment continued to show signs of improvement in the fourth quarter, the S&P 500 was up over 23% in 2009 and improved 5Â½% during the fourth quarter. Some of our trust investment and other servicing fees are earned based on lagged market values. Let me review those impacts. Equity market performance calculated on a one quarter lag basis, which is the methodology used for calculating C&IS custody and PFS wealth management fees remain weak, as the S&P 500 declined by 9.2% year-over-year on a one quarter lag basis. On a sequential quarter basis, however, the one quarter lag markets were up 15%. Using the one month lag methodology that applies to PFS fees, excluding wealth management, the S&P 500 was up 5.3% versus the prior year and up 8.9% versus the third quarter. We're very encouraged by the improvement in the equity markets since March but mindful that the quarter lag equity markets are still lower on a year-over-year basis.A second market condition that's impacting our performance is the historically low interest rate environment. For example, in the United States, overnight interest rates averaged only 12 basis points for the fourth quarter. Three months rates averaged only 27 basis points. Short-term rates for the euro and sterling were also at low levels by historical standards. Our economist expects central banks to maintain their low interest rate policies for much of 2010 and this has impacted the industry and Northern Trust by compressing spreads in net interest income and securities lending and pressuring some of the revenues that we earn on money market mutual funds.With that environmental backdrop, let me review our fourth quarter results. Please note that in all discussions, I'll be referencing operating performance, which includes certain Visa related items in prior periods. Revenues in the fourth quarter equaled $950 million, representing a significant decline of 17% or almost $200 million compared to last year. On a sequential quarter basis however, revenues increased 2% or $23 million. Trust investment and other servicing fees are the largest component of our revenues, representing about 54% of total revenues in 2009. Trust investment and other servicing fees of $549 million increased 12% year-over-year and 5% on a sequential quarter basis.In our institutional business, C&IS trust investment and other servicing fees equaled $329 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 20% year-over-year and 6% on a sequential quarter basis. C&IS fees include three primary revenue areas: Custody and fund administration, institutional asset management and securities lending. Let me discuss the performance of each in the fourth quarter.C&IS custody and fund administration fees equaled $156 million in the fourth quarter, up 4% on both a year-over-year and sequential quarter basis. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects new business success in global custody while the sequential quarter increase reflects the improving market environment and new business wins in global custody and fund administration. C&IS investment management fees equaled $65 million in the fourth quarter, up 3% year-over-year and 6% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year increase was driven by new business wins and quantitative strategies, institutional mutual funds and cash. The sequential quarter increase was driven by the improving market environment over the last several quarters, as well as new business and quantitative management and mutual funds.Securities lending fees equaled $90 million in the fourth quarter, which included approximately $70 million in positive marks associated with the one mark-to-market investment fund used by certain securities lending clients. This compares with $44 million in negative marks in the fourth quarter of 2008 and $57 million in positive marks last quarter. On a cumulative basis dating back to the third quarter of 2007, the fourth quarter's positive impact of $70 million reduces to approximately $95 million, the cumulative impact that negative marks have had on our securities lending fees.Excluding the impact of mark-to-market fund across all periods, C&IS securities lending fees declined approximately 77% year over year and 20% sequentially. On this suggested basis, the year-over-year decline was primarily attributable to lower spreads due to the reinvestment of maturing higher-yielding investments at lower interest rates. In addition, average collateral volumes declined 14% year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, the decline was entirely attributable to lower spreads, once again due to the maturity of higher-yielding investments in this historically low interest rate environment. The three components of our institutional fees that I've just discussed are all impact by the value of assets that we custody, administer or manage for our institutional clients. Let me review with you our various institutional client asset levels.Institutional assets under custody equaled $3.3 trillion at quarter end, representing a double-digit increase of 22% versus last year and we're up 3% versus the last quarter. Global custody assets, which are an important subcomponent of total C&IS assets under custody equaled $1.9 trillion at year end, up a very strong 36% year over year and 2% on a sequential quarter basis. The increase in institutional assets under custody represents improving equity markets, both year-over-year and in the fourth quarter, as well as the new business results that I've mentioned earlier. Managed assets for institutional clients equaled $482 billion at year end, up 13% compared with one year ago and almost 3% sequentially. Securities lending collateral equaled $114.5 billion at year end, up 4% year-over-year and 3Â½% sequentially. However, as I mentioned earlier, securities lending collateral on an average daily basis was actually down 14% year-over-year yet up 8% sequentially. Excluding securities lending collateral from C&IS that's under managed assets for institutional clients were up 16% year over year and up 3% sequentially. As you compare our performance with market indices, note that equities represented about 44% of total C&IS managed assets at year end with a significant majority of those equity assets being managed in quantitative strategies.Let me now switch to our personal business, which we refer to as Personal Financial Services or PFS. Trust investment and other servicing fees in PFS equaled $220 million in the fourth quarter, representing an increase of approximately 3% on both a year-over-year and a sequential quarter basis. The year-over-year and sequential quarter comparisons were both positively impacted by the improving market environment, as well as new business. Offsetting these positive factors, however, was the impact of fee waivers on PFS money market mutual funds due to the very low level of short-term interest rates. In the fourth quarter, fee waivers equaled $11 million in PFS, up from $8 million last quarter. Fees in PFS are derived from the assets that we manage and custody for personal clients. PFS assets under management equaled $145 billion at year end, up almost 10% compared with a year ago and up 3% from last quarter. Assets under custody in PFS equaled $331 billion at year end, up 15% year-over-year and up 3% from last quarter. Recent new business success and improving markets combined to fuel the higher level of personal client assets at year end. As you evaluate this performance, note that about 35% of PFS managed assets and 42% of PFS custody assets were equity securities at year end.Net interest income equaled $244 million in the fourth quarter, down 30% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. The net interest margin equaled 1.43% in the current quarter, 57 basis points lower than the elevated net interest margin of 2% last year. Recall that our net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2008 benefited from three Federal Reserve rate cuts during the quarter and the significant widening of credit spreads. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income declined 2% and the net interest margin declined by 11 basis points. During the fourth quarter, interest rates remained at historic lows and spreads continued to tighten at the short end of the yield curve. For example, the spread between the overnight Fed effective rate and the three-month LIBOR averaged only 15 basis points in the fourth quarter compared with 26 basis points in the third quarter and 224 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2008. Low rates, tighter spreads and the reduced value of non-interest related funds continue to pressure net interest income and the net interest margin.Foreign exchange trading income equaled $87 million, down 63% compared with the highly volatile fourth quarter of 2008 and down 6% compared with last quarter. Currency volatility and client volumes continued to moderate in the fourth quarter as financial markets stabilize. We recorded a modest $3.4 million of credit related other-than-temporary-impairment during the fourth quarter in our balance sheet investment portfolio, compared with $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 and $5.3 million last quarter. This amount is reflected in the investment security transaction line of our income statement.During the fourth quarter, we recorded the loan loss provision of $40 million compared with the $60 million provision recorded in both last year's fourth quarter and in the third quarter. Net charge-offs equals $32 million, down from $46 million last quarter. Our reserve for credit losses equaled $341 million at year end, up 36% or $90 million compared with last year and up 2% or $8 million sequentially. Nonperforming loans declined to $14 million sequentially to $278 million, reflecting a lower level of non-accrual commercial and industrial loans. Nonperforming assets, however, increased $7 million sequentially as other real estate owned increased from $9 million at September 30 to almost $30 million at year end. A significant portion of the net increase and other real estate owned was concentrated in two residential properties, one in Florida and one in California.Credit quality within our balance sheet investment portfolio also continues to profile very well when compared with industry peers. Net unrealized losses in our $17 billion Available for Sale Securities portfolio equaled approximately $60 million pretax at year end, down 25% from $81 million on September 30. Let me now shift my comments to a review of the key expense categories that impacted our fourth quarter performance.Operating expenses equaled $621 million in the fourth quarter, representing an increase of 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. On an adjusted basis, taking into account unusual or one-time items in both years, operating expenses were down 2% year over year and down 1% sequentially, reflective of ongoing expense management initiatives at Northern Trust. Compensation expense equaled $270 million, down 13% year-over-year. Recall that our results in the fourth quarter of last year included a $17 million severance accrual and compensation expense related to initiatives to reduce staff expenses. Absent that item in last year's results, compensation expense would have declined 8% year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in compensation expense primarily reflects the reversal of prior period accruals related to performance-based compensation, as well as lower salary expense. Staffing levels equaled approximately 12,400 full-time equivalent positions at year end, an increase of 2% year-over-year and essentially unchanged sequentially. New staff positions on a year-over-year basis were concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region. On a sequential quarter basis, compensation expense decreased 5%, primarily reflecting lower equity-based compensation expense. Outside services expense equaled $118 million, an increase of 10% compared with last year and 9% sequentially.The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher investment manager sub-advisory fees, which are influenced by higher market values and by higher technical services. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher technical services, consulting fees and investment manager sub-advisory expenses. Equipment and software expense equaled $73 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% year over year and 11% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects ongoing investment in technology. The sequential increase represents a typical annual pattern where expense associated with depreciation and amortization of equipment and capitalized software is typically higher in the second half of the year.Other operating expenses equaled $63 million in the fourth quarter, compared with only $4 million last year and $54 million in the third quarter. Recall that our results in the fourth quarter of 2008 included two positive expense items, totaling $45.5 million, one related to the reduction of accruals in connection with our program to purchase certain auction rate securities from clients and the other, a currency translation benefit. Absent those two items last year, other operating expense would've equaled $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The adjusted year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to the November 2009 support payments and expiration of the Capital Support Agreements established originally in 2008. At expiration, we funded approximately $138 million under the terms of the two remaining Capital Support Agreements, which was approximately $12 million higher than the expense accrued through September 30, 2009. Thus, our fourth quarter results included $12 million in CSA expense compared with the $9.7 million expense reduction in the fourth quarter of 2008. Other operating expense on a year-over-year basis also reflects a $4.3 million increase in FDIC premiums. The sequential quarter increase in other operating expense reflects the impact of the funding and expiration of the Capital Support Agreements. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 28% and for the full year of 2009 was 31%. The lower tax rate in the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to a greater proportion of earnings being generated in jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the United States, as well as the favorable resolution of certain state tax matters. Let me wrap up today's call by offering our thoughts on the near-term environment within which Northern Trust operates and the longer-term positioning of our company. Equity markets continue to trend positively in the fourth quarter and ended the year at levels higher than a year ago, a welcome occurrence. Fixed income markets were strong throughout 2009, which was most significantly favorable to our securities lending results. Interest rates, however, remain at historic lows and appear poised to stay there for much of 2010. This adversely impacts net interest income, securities lending and money market mutual fund fees. We were very pleased to report a reduction in nonperforming loans, which was achieved despite the fragile economic environment. Our relationship orientation and conservative underwriting practices continue to position our loan quality stats very well relative to industry peers. In sum, our focus at Northern Trust remains on our clients and our long-standing business strategies and philosophies. We continue to focus on very attractive businesses where our competitive positioning is outstanding and prospects for long-term growth are strong. We support our clients with a broad array of asset servicing, investment management, fiduciary and banking solutions and have been viewed by many as a provider of choice throughout this turbulent environment. Our financial positioning remains top tier as best exemplified by strong capital ratios and a healthy balance sheet. All in all, we feel very positively about the long-term positioning of Northern Trust. Let me thank you for joining Northern Trust for this fourth quarter of 2009 conference call. We'd be happy now to answer your questions. Kayla, would you poll for questions please?"

Is that mainly because you've had money fund assets roll-off, maybe talk a little bit about what may be happening there? And then, as a follow-up to that, if I look within wealth management in particular, it seems like revenues there are kind of really flat and down. Can you maybe talk about that a bit?"

So very much underweighted in equities, 22% during the fourth quarter as compared to a much higher level and the rest of the PFS business. So relative to the lower growth rates and investment management fee income, I would just point to the low allocation to equities and high-risk investments and also to the fact that in some of the investment vehicles in which we manage clients cash and wealth management, we again are not generating enough return to both pay the clients expected returns and our fees so we're rebating some fees in there. I would say that also, during the quarter, wealth management did lose about $2 billion in AUM out of the cash portion of their client AUM."

Also in PFS, a number of the markets that we're in and which we have large positions in are still pretty weak, Florida, Arizona, Southern California as an example and loan demand is low."

I can't give you the metrics around that but that organization or that reorganization or client segmentation that we put into place three years ago, is having the desired outcome. So significantly, more new business in that larger space, larger than we previously were in, and a good chunk of that in that northeast region but also in Illinois and also in California and also in Florida and every place we do business.

Let me add my welcome to those of you listening to Northern Trustâs first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Earlier this morning Northern Trust reported first quarter 2010 net income of $157 million equal to $0.64 per share.
To assist you in understanding our performance this quarter, weâve organized todayâs remarks into the following sections. First, Iâll discuss market conditions that impacted our performance in the first quarter. Second, Iâll review our financial performance focusing on those items that most impacted our results. Third, Iâll offer our perspectives on the near term environment as well as the strong competitive positioning of Northern Trust. And finally, Bev and I will be pleased to answer your questions.
The equity market environment improved for the fourth consecutive quarter. The S&P 500 was up 46.6% when compared with one year earlier and increased 4.9% during the first quarter. Let me give you the equity market trends that are most relevant to our fees.
Equity market performance calculated on a one quarter lag basis, which is the methodology used for calculating C&IS custody and PFS Wealth Management fees, was strong. The S&P 500 increased 23.5% year-over-year on a one quarter lag basis.
On a sequential quarter basis the one quarter lag markets 5.5%. Using the one month lag methodology that applies to PFS fees, excluding Wealth Management, the S&P 500 was up 34% versus the prior year and up 3% versus the first quarter. The positive impact of improving equity markets while welcome and encouraging was diminished in our performance by the ongoing negative impact of historically low short-term interest rates.
For example, in the United States overnight interest rates averaged only 14 basis points in the first quarter. Three-month rates averaged only 26 basis points and short-term rates for the euro and sterling were also at low levels by historical standards.
Our economists expect central banks to maintain their low interest rate policies until January of 2011. Low interest rates are impacted our performance most noticeably but pressuring both net interest margin and the fees that we earn on our money market mutual funds.
With that environmental background, let me review our first quarter results. Revenues in the first quarter equaled $908 million, up slightly about $3 million compared to last yearâs first quarter. On a sequential quarter basis revenues decreased 4% or $43 million.
Trust investment and other servicing fees are the largest component of our revenues representing 57% of total revenues in the first quarter. Trust investment and other servicing fees of $515 million increased 25% year-over-year, but were down 6% on a sequential quarter basis.
In our institutional business, C&IS trust investment and other servicing fees totaled $297 million in the first quarter, an increase of 44% year-over-year, but were down 10% on a sequential quarter basis. C&IS fees include three primary revenue areas; custody and fund administration, institutional asset management and securities lending.
Let me discuss the performance of each of these in the first quarter. C&IS investment management fees equaled $64 million in the first quarter, up 5% year-over-year, yet down 1% compared with last quarter. Our results in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $4 million in waived fees associated with institutional money market funds. As I mentioned earlier, fee waivers are one area where low interest rates are directly pressuring our revenues. Absent fee waivers, C&IS investment management fees would have shown growth of 12% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. These results show the impact of the improving market environment on our institutional index and managers businesses, as well as new business in both institutional index and short duration.
Securities lending fees equaled $56 million in the first quarter, including approximately $38 million in positive marks associated with the one mark-to-market investment fund used by certain securities lending clients. This compares with $52 million in negative marks in the first quarter of 2009 and $70 million in positive marks last quarter. The first quarterâs positive impact of $38 million reduces to approximately $57 million the cumulative impact that negative marks have had on our securities lending fees going back to the third quarter of 2007.
Excluding the impact of the mark-to-market fund across all periods, C&IS securities lending fees declined approximately 60% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. On this adjusted basis, the year-over-year and sequential declines are primarily attributable to lower spreads as maturing investments were reinvested at lower rates.
The three components of our institutional fees that Iâve just discussed are all impacted by the value of assets that we custody, administer or manage for our institutional clients. Let me review our various institutional client asset levels with you.
Institutional assets under custody equaled $3.4 trillion at quarter end representing a double digit increase of 32% versus last year and an increase of 1% versus last quarter. Global custody assets, an important high growth sub component of total C&IS assets under custody equaled $2 trillion at quarter end, up a very strong 44% year-over-year and 1% on a sequential quarter basis.
The increase in institutional assets under custody represents improving equity markets and new business partially offset in the sequential quarter comparison by the weakening of the euro and sterling relative to the dollar.
Managed assets for institutional clients were $498 billion at quarter end, up 27% compared with one year ago and up 3% sequentially. Securities lending collateral equaled $121 billion at quarter end, up 27.5% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. As you compare our performance with market indices, notes that equities represented about 45% of total C&IS managed assets at quarter end with the significant majority of those equity assets being managed in index strategies.
Let me now switch to our personal financial services business. Trust investment and other servicing fees in PFS were $218 million in the first quarter representing an increase of 7% year-over-year. PFS fees declined 1% on a sequential quarter basis. The improving equity market environment was a welcome tailwind on both the year-over-year and a sequential quarter basis as I mentioned earlier. Also our net new business results in PFS were very strong in the first quarter, increasing over 50% when compared with last year's first quarter and 33% when compared with last quarter.
The first quarter of 2010 was in fact the best first quarter we have ever seen in PFS gross new business going back to when we began tracking this metric in the early 1990s. We are seeing clients and prospects alike begin to move back into the market and beginning to focus on implementing longer-term investment strategies. Unfortunately some of this momentum was masked by the impact of fee waivers on PFS money market mutual funds, again due to the very low level of short term interest rates. These fee waivers reduced PFS trust investment and other servicing fees by $16 million in the first quarter compared with fee waivers of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, and $8 in the third quarter.
Fees in PFS are derived from the assets that we manage and custody for personal clients. PFS assets under management were $149 billion at quarter end, up 14% compared with a year ago and up 3% from last quarter. Assets under custody in PFS equaled $341 billion at quarter end, up 21% year-over-year and up 3% from last quarter.
Recent new business success and improving markets combined to fuel this higher level of personal client assets at quarter end. As you evaluate PFS performance, note that about 35.5% of PFS managed assets and 44% of PFS custody assets were equity securities at quarter end.
Net interest income equaled $240 million in the first quarter, down 17% when compared to the first quarter of 2009. Our net interest margin was 1.44% in the current quarter, 24 basis points lower year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income declined 2% and the net interest margin actually increased by 1 basis point. During the first quarter, interest rates remained at historic lows since spreads tightened at the short end of the yield curve.
For example, the spread between the overnight Fed effective rate and the three month LIBOR averaged only 12 basis points in the first quarter compared with 15 basis points in the fourth quarter and 105 basis points in the first quarter of 2009. Low rates, tighter spreads and the reduced value of non interest related funds continue to pressure net interest income and the net interest margin.
Foreign exchange trading income was $80 million, down 39% compared with the first quarter of 2009 and down 9% compared with the last quarter. Currency volatility was meaningfully lower on a year-over-year basis and was also lower on a sequential quarter basis, although the rate of decline in volatility appears to have slowed. Client volumes partially offset lower volatility as trading activity continued to recover with more stable market conditions.
During the first quarter, our loan loss provision was $40 million unchanged from last quarter. Net charge offs equaled $31 million down just slightly from $32 million last quarter. Non-performing loans, however, increased $41 million sequentially to $319.5 million, with about half of the increase related to residential real estate. Other real estate owned increased $16 million, principally related to two commercial real estate properties which converted from non-accrual to ORE.
Now, let me shift my comments to a review of the key expense categories that impacted our first quarter performance. Expenses equaled $620 million in the first quarter representing an increase of 4% year-over-year. Total expenses were essentially flat on a sequential quarter basis.
Compensation expense equaled $275 million, up 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Recall please that the equity based component of total compensation expense was impacted in 2009 by the reversal of prior expense accruals for performance stock units, which were not expected to divest. These reversals reduced our total compensation expense in both the year earlier quarter as well as the prior quarter. Compensation expense adjusted for these accrual reversals would have increased less than 1% year-over-year and would have declined 1% sequentially.
Staffing levels were approximately 12,500 full time equivalent positions at quarter end, an increase of 2% year-over-year and less than 1% sequentially. New staff positions were concentrated in our Asia Pacific region. Employee benefit expense equaled $63 million in the first quarter, down 4% year-over-year and up 15% sequentially. The sequential quarter increase primarily reflects higher FICO [ph] expense, which is a normal seasonal pattern for us and others, as well as higher health care and pension expense.
Outside services expense equaled $106 million in the first quarter; an increase of 10% compared with last year, yet was down 11% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher investment manager sub advisory fees, which are influenced by higher market values and higher technical services. The sequential increase primarily reflects lower cost associated with technical, legal and consulting services.
Equipment and software expense equaled $67 million in the first quarter, up 8% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects depreciation expense associated with ongoing investments in technology. The sequential decline represents the typical annual pattern where expense associated with depreciation and amortization of equipment and capitalized software is typically lower in the first half of the year.
Other operating expenses equaled $67 million in the first quarter down 5% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. Recall that our expenses in this category during 2009 included the impact of the now expired capital support agreements. Included in our first quarter 2009 expenses was $8 million associated with the capital support agreements. Similarly the fourth quarter of 2009 included $12 million in final expense associated with the funding and exploration of the capital support agreements.
Aside from the impact of the capital support agreements, other operating expense reflects higher business promotion and FDIC insurance premiums.
Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 34%. The tax rate in the first quarter reflects the impact of the write-off of the deferred tax asset as a result of the recently enacted federal healthcare legislation.
Let me wrap up todayâs call by offering our thoughts on two frequent topics of discussion, the environment within which Northern Trust operates currently, which recently has been challenging on several fronts and the strategic positioning of our company, which remains quite positive.
Similar to my environmental comments last quarter, improving equity and fixed-income markets continued to be beneficial to both our clients and our businesses. That said, short-term interest rates remain at extremely low levels, and our economists do not expect rates to rise meaningfully early 2011. As noted throughout my remarks today, this adversely affects net interest income, securities lending, and money market mutual fund fees.
Likewise, the still challenging economic environment drove non-performing assets higher in the quarter by $57 million. Most of that increase was centered in the real estate markets both residential and commercial. Our long-standing conservative and relationship oriented lending practices have allowed us to weather this cycle better than most banks, but our non-performing asset trends are reflective of the difficult economy and the stress is being felt by even the most conservative of lenders.
Offsetting the near-term macroeconomic environment is the excellent competitive positioning of Northern Trust businesses. Perhaps the best reflection of that strong strategic positioning is the outstanding new business we achieved in the first quarter. In our personal business, first-quarter net new business increased over 50% year-over-year and 30% sequentially. Our new business results in the month of March alone were the best achieved since we began tracking this metric. We are also seeing success with both existing clients and new clients, who appear to be moving back into the market, as well as focusing on longer term investment strategies that Northern Trust is particularly qualified to implement.
In our institutional business, net new business increased 11% on both a year-over-year and sequential quarter basis, representing our highest level of net new business since the first quarter of 2008. The expanded relationships with many existing clients, won a number of new relationships during the quarter, and ended March with a solid pipeline in both North America and around the world.
In sum, our focus at Northern Trust remains on our clients and on the very attractive businesses within which we have chosen to compete. We continue to feel very positive about the long-term positioning of Northern Trust.
Before I conclude, I want to point out that our annual shareholders meeting begins at 10:30 Central Time this morning. As is customary for our first quarter calls we will need to end todayâs call to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our annual meeting. Please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off Q&A period earlier than is our normal practice.
Now Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Andrea, would you please open the call for questions.

Assuming, to respond more directly to your question, that we had some clarity around that, we would like to do the things that you and others who own our stock would like to see us do, including perhaps buybacks on stocks at what would turn out to be attractive prices. I don't think we are going to be able to do that in the near-term until we get the kind of definition we are looking at - we're looking for. And so, we have become a little more focused than traditionally has been the case on acquisition opportunities both for the personal side of our business and the institutional side of our business, and in our investment management business.
Obviously, we have not done anything materially, but we are out there looking in all segments.

I would really suggest that you do it over the course of the last couple of years.
One of the things you will note is that there is some relatively meaningful noise in the component of share based compensation related to performance stock units, and that is because we actually reverse prior expense accruals as Bill mentioned in his prepared remarks in both the first quarter of 2009 and in the fourth quarter of 2009. And again that is all disclosed in our annual report prior 10-Qs and we will provide the details next week.
In addition to that, your other question is that there is traditionally some seasonal uptick in stock option expense portion of share-based compensation because of the fact that any stock options issued to retirement eligible employees need to be immediately expensed in the first quarter. Obviously that didn't have as much of an effect last year, because stock option grants were lower last year as a result of circumstances you are aware of.
So you will definitely see that the performance of stock had the impact on last year, and you will also see an uptick in the first quarter in stock option expense because of the seasonality that you exactly described.

Let me add my welcome to those of you listening to Northern Trust's First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, Northern Trust reported first quarter 2010 net income of $157 million equal to $0.64 per share.
To assist you in understanding our performance this quarter we've organize today's remarks into the following sections: first, I'll discuss market conditions that impacted our performance in the first quarter. Second, I'll review our financial performance, focusing on those items that most impacted our results. Third, I'll offer our perspectives on the near-term environment, as well as the strong competitive positioning of Northern Trust. And finally, Bev and I will be pleased to answer your questions.
The equity market environment improved for the fourth consecutive quarter. The S&P 500 was up 46.6% when compared with one year earlier and increased 4.9% during the first quarter.
Let me review the equity market trends that are most relevant to our fees. Equity market performance calculated on a one quarter lag basis, which is the methodology used for calculating C&IS custody and PFS wealth management fees was strong. The S&P 500 increased 23.5% year-over-year on a one quarter lag basis. On a sequential quarter basis, the one quarter lag markets increased 5.5%. Using the one-month lag methodology that applies to PFS fees, excluding wealth management, the S&P 500 was up 34% versus the prior year and up 3% versus the fourth quarter.
The positive impact of improving equity markets, while welcome and encouraging, was diminished in our performance by the ongoing negative impact of historically low short-term interest rates. For example, in the United States, overnight interest rates averaged only 14 basis points in the first quarter. [Indiscernible]Pre-month rates averaged only 26 basis points. Short-term rates for the euro and sterling were also at low levels by historical standards. Our economists expect central banks to maintain their low interest rate policies until January of 2011. Low interest rates have impacted our performance most noticeably by pressuring both our net interest margin and the fees that we earn on our money market mutual funds.
With that environmental background, let me review our first quarter results. Revenues in the first quarter equaled $908 million up slightly about $3 million compared to last yearâs first quarter. On a sequential quarter basis, revenues decreased 4% or $43 million. Trust investment and other servicing fees are the largest component of our revenues, representing 57% of total revenues in the first quarter. Trust investment and other servicing fees of $515 million increased 25% year-over-year, but we're down 6% on a sequential quarter basis.
In our institutional business, C&IS trust investment and other servicing fees totaled $297 million in the first quarter, an increase of 44% year-over-year, but were down 10% on a sequential quarter basis. C&IS fees include three primary revenue areas, custody and fund administration, institutional asset management, and securities lending. Let me discuss the performance of each of these in the first quarter. C&IS custody and fund administration fees were $159 million in the first quarter, up 17% on a year-over-year basis and up 2% on a sequential quarter basis. The year-over-year increase primary reflects the improving market environment and new business success in both U.S. and global custody and in fund administration. Across C&IS, our net new business results in the first quarter were the best in two years, with new to Northern and existing clients both contributing significantly to the new business traction we saw in the first quarter. The sequential quarter increase primary reflects both new business and improving market environment. Partially offset by the impact of lower transaction volumes.
C&IS investment management fees equaled $64 million in the first quarter, up 5% year over year, yet down 1% compared with last quarter. Our results in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $4 million in waived fees associated with institutional money market funds. As I mentioned earlier, fee waivers are one area where low interest rates are directly pressuring our revenues. Absent fee waivers, C&IS investment management fees would've shown growth of 12% year over year and 3% sequentially. These results reflect the impact of the improving market environment on our institutional index and manager or managers businesses, as well as new business in both institutional index and short duration.
Securities lending fees equaled $56 million in the first quarter, including approximately $38 million in positive marks associated with the one mark-to-market investment fund used by certain securities lending clients. This compares with $52 million in negative marks in the first quarter of 2009 and $70 million in positive marks last quarter. The first quarter's positive impact of $38 million reduces to approximately $57 million the cumulative impact that negative marks have had on our securities lending fees going back to the third quarter of 2007. 
Excluding the impact of the mark-to-market fund across all periods, C&IS securities lending fees declined approximately 60% year over year and 12% sequentially. On this adjusted basis, the year-over-year and sequential declines are primarily attributable to lower spreads, as maturing investments were reinvested at lower rates.
The three components of our institutional fees that I've just discussed are all impacted by the value of assets that we custody administer or manage for our institutional clients. Let me review our various institutional client asset levels with you.
Institutional assets under custody equaled 3.4 trillion at quarter end, representing a double-digit increase of 32% versus last year and an increase of 1% versus last quarter. Global custody assets, an important high-growth sub-component of total C&IS assets under custody equaled $2 trillion at quarter end, up a very strong 44% year over year, and up 1% on a sequential quarter basis. 
The increase in institutional assets under custody represents improving equity markets and new business, partially offset in the sequential quarter comparison by the weakening of the euro and sterling relative to the dollar. 
Managed assets for institutional clients were $498 billion at quarter end, up 27% compared with one year ago and up 3% sequentially. Securities lending collateral equaled a $121 billion at quarter end up 27.5% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. As you compare our performance with market induces, note that equities represented about 45% of total C&IS managed assets at quarter end with a significant majority of those equity assets being managed in index strategies.
Let me now switch to our Personal Financial services business. Trust investment and other servicing fees and PFS were $218 million in the first quarter representing an increase of 7% year-over-year. PFS fees declined 1% on a sequential quarter basis. The improving equity market environment was a welcomed tailwind on both the year-over-year and a sequential quarter basis as I mentioned earlier.
Also our net new business results and PFS were very strong in the first quarter increasing over 50% when compared with last year's first quarter and 33% when compared with last quarter. The first quarter of 2010 was in fact the best first quarter we've ever seen in PFS gross new business, going back to when we began tracking this metric in the early 1990s.
We're seeing clients and prospects alike begin to move back into the market and beginning to focus on implementing longer-term investment strategies. Unfortunately, some of this momentum was masked by the impact of fee waivers on PFS money market mutual funds, again due to the very low level of short-term interest rates. These fee waivers reduced PFS trust investment and other servicing fees by $16 million in the first quarter compared with fee waivers of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, and $8 million in the third quarter.
Fees and PFS are derived from the assets that we manage in custody for Personal clients. PFS assets under management were $149 billion at quarter-end, up 14% compared with a year ago, and up 3% from last quarter. Assets under custody in PFS equaled $341 billion at quarter-end, up 21% year-over-year, and up 3% from last quarter. Recent new business success and improving markets combined a field of higher level of personal client assets at quarter end. As you evaluate PFS performance, note that about 35.5% of PFS managed assets and 44% of PFS custody assets were equity securities at quarter-end.
Net interest income equaled to $240 million in the first quarter, down 17% when compared to the first quarter of 2009. Our net interest margin was 1.44% in the current quarter, 24 basis points lower year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income declined 2% and the net interest margin actually increased by one basis point.
During the first quarter, interest rates remained at historic lows and spreads tightened at the short end of the yield curve. For example, the spread between the overnight fed effective rate and the three-month LIBOR, averaged only 12 basis points in the first quarter compared with 15 basis points in the fourth quarter and 105 basis points in the first quarter of 2009. Low rates, tighter spreads and the reduced value of noninterest related funds continued to pressure net interest income and the net interest margin.
Foreign exchange trading income was $80 million, down 39% compared with the first quarter of 2009 and down 9% compared with the last quarter. Currency volatility was meaningfully lower on a year-over-year basis and was also lower on a sequential quarter basis, although the rate of decline in volatility appears to have slowed. Client volumes partially offset lower volatility as trading activity continued to recover with more stable market conditions.
During the first quarter, our loan loss provision was $40 million, unchanged from last quarter. Net charge-offs equaled $31 million down just slightly from $32 million last quarter. Non-performing loans however increased $41 million sequentially to $319.5 million with about half of the increase related to residential real estate. Other real estate owned increased $16 million principally related to two commercial real estate properties which converted from non-accrual to ORE. 
Now let me shift my comments to a review of the key expense categories that impacted our first quarter performance. Expenses equaled $620 million in the first quarter representing an increase of 4% year-over-year. Total expenses were essentially flat on a sequential quarter basis. Compensation expense equaled $275 million, up 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Recall please that the equity base component of total compensation expense was impacted in 2009 by the reversal of prior expense accruals for performance stock units which were not expected to divest. These reversals reduced our total compensation expense in both the year-earlier quarter as well as the prior quarter. Compensation expense adjusted for these accrual reversals would have increased less than 1% year-over-year and would have declined 1% sequentially.
Staffing levels were approximately 12,500 full-time equivalent positions at quarter end, an increase of 2% year-over-year and less than 1% sequentially. New staff positions were concentrated in our Asia-Pacific region. Employee benefit expense equaled $63 million in the first quarter down 4% year-over-year and up 15% sequentially. The sequential quarter increase primarily reflects higher FICA insurance expense which is a normal seasonal pattern for us and others, as well as higher health care and pension expense.
Outside services expense equaled $106 million in the first quarter, an increase of 10% compared with last year, yet was down 11% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher investment management sub-advisory fees which are influenced by higher market values and higher technical services. The sequential increase primarily reflects lower cost associated with technical, legal and consulting services.
Equipment and software expense equaled $67 million in the first quarter, up 8% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects depreciation expense associated with ongoing investments in technology. The sequential decline represents the annual pattern, typical annual pattern where expense associated with depreciation and amortization of equipment in capitalized software is typically lower in the first half of the year.
Other operating expenses equaled $67 million in the first quarter, down 5% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. Recall our expenses in this category during 2009 included the impact of the now expired Capital Support Agreements. Included in our first quarter 2009 expenses was $8 million associated with the capital support agreements. Similarly, the fourth quarter of 2009 included $12 million in final expense associated with the funding and expiration of the Capital Support Agreements.  Aside from the impact of the Capital Support Agreements, other operating expense reflects higher business promotion and FDIC insurance premiums.
Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 34%. The tax rate in the first quarter reflects the impact of the write off of the deferred tax asset, as a result of the recently enacted federal health-care legislation.
Let me wrap up today's call by offering our thoughts on two frequent topics of discussion. The environment within which Northern Trust operates currently, which recently has been challenging on several fronts, and the strategic positioning of our company, which remains quite positive.
Similar to my environmental comments last quarter, improving equity and fixed income markets continue to be beneficial to both our clients and our businesses. That said, short-term interest rates remain in extremely low levels and our economist do not expect rates to rise meaningfully until early 2011. As noted throughout out my remarks today, this adversely affects net interest income, securities lending and money market mutual fund fees. Likewise, this still challenging economic environment drove non-performing assets higher in the quarter by $57 million. Most of that increase was centered in the real estate markets both residential and commercial. 
Our long-standing conservative and relationship oriented lending practices have allowed us to weather this cycle better than most banks, but our non-performing asset trends are reflective of the difficult economy and the stresses being felt by even the most conservative of lenders. 
Off setting the challenging near-term macroeconomic environment is the excellent competitive positioning of Northern Trust businesses. Perhaps the best reflection of that strong strategic positioning is the outstanding new business that we achieved in the first quarter. In our Personal business, first quarter net new business increased over 50% year-over-year and 30% sequentially. Our new business results in the month of March alone were the best achieved since we began tracking this metric. We're also seeing success with both existing clients and new clients who appear to be moving back into the market, as well as focusing on longer term investment strategies that Northern Trust is particularly qualified to implement.
In our Institutional business, net new business increased 11% on both the year-over-year and sequential quarter basis, representing our highest level of net new business since the first quarter of 2008. We expanded relationships with many existing clients, won a number of new relationships during the quarter, and ended March with a solid pipeline In both North America and around the world. 
In sum, our focus at Northern Trust remains on our clients and on the very attractive businesses within which we have chosen to compete. We continue to feel very positive about the long-term positioning of Northern Trust.
Before I conclude, I want to point out that our annual shareholder's meeting begins at 10:30 central time this morning. As is customary for our first quarter calls, we'll need to end today's call to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our annual meeting. Please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the Q&A period earlier than is our normal practice.
Now Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Andrea, would you please open the call for questions."

One of the things that you'll notice is that there is some relatively meaningful noise in the component of share-based compensation related to performance stock units. And that's because we actually reverse prior expense accruals as Bill mentioned in his prepared remarks in both the first quarter of 2009 and in the fourth quarter of 2009. And again that's all disclosed in our annual report, prior 10-Qs and we'll provide the details next week. In addition to that, your other question is that there is traditionally some seasonal uptick in the stock option expense portion of share-based compensation because of the fact that any stock options issued to retirement eligible employees need to be immediately expensed in the first quarter. Obviously, that didn't have as much of an effect last year because our stock option grants were lower last year as a result of circumstances you're aware of. So you will definitely see that the performance of stock had the impact on last year, and you'll also see an uptick in the first quarter for stock option expense because of the seasonality that you exactly described."

And then as for other custody, it's up, and you said new business, its the best since the first quarter of 2008, assets under management are up. So the core franchise is growing at the same time, the revenues aren't doing a whole lot. So can you quantify the impact of all the seasonal and all the non-permanent factors the are hurting revenues to help fix that disconnect that I'm having?"

Let me add my welcome to those of you listening to Northern Trust's First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier this morning, Northern Trust reported first quarter 2010 net income of $157 million equal to $0.64 per share.
To assist you in understanding our performance this quarter, we've organized today's remarks into the following sections: First, I'll discuss market conditions that impacted our performance in the first quarter; second, I'll review our financial performance, focusing on those items that most impacted our results; third, I'll offer our perspectives on the near-term environment, as well as the strong competitive positioning of Northern Trust; and finally, Bev and I will be pleased to answer your questions.
The equity market environment improved for the fourth consecutive quarter. The S&P 500 was up 46.6% when compared with one year earlier and increased 4.9% during the first quarter.
Let me review the equity market trends that are most relevant to our fees. Equity market performance calculated on a one-quarter lag basis, which is the methodology used for calculating C&IS custody and PFS wealth management fees was strong. The S&P 500 increased 23.5% year-over-year on a one-quarter lag basis. On a sequential quarter basis, the one-quarter lag markets increased 5.5%. Using the one-month lag methodology that applies to PFS fees, excluding wealth management, the S&P 500 was up 34% versus the prior year and up 3% versus the fourth quarter.
The positive impact of improving equity markets, while welcome and encouraging, was diminished in our performance by the ongoing negative impact of historically low short-term interest rates. For example, in the United States, overnight interest rates averaged only 14 basis points in the first quarter. Pre-month rates averaged only 26 basis points. Short-term rates for the euro and sterling were also at low levels by historical standards. Our economists expect central banks to maintain their low interest rate policies until January of 2011. Low interest rates have impacted our performance most noticeably by pressuring both our net interest margin and the fees that we earn on our money market mutual funds.
With that environmental background, let me review our first quarter results. Revenues in the first quarter equaled $908 million, up slightly, about $3 million compared to last yearâs first quarter. On a sequential quarter basis, revenues decreased 4% or $43 million. Trust investment and other servicing fees are the largest component of our revenues, representing 57% of total revenues in the first quarter. Trust investment and other servicing fees of $515 million increased 25% year-over-year but were down 6% on a sequential quarter basis.
In our institutional business, C&IS trust investment and other servicing fees totaled $297 million in the first quarter, an increase of 44% year-over-year but were down 10% on a sequential quarter basis. C&IS fees include three primary revenue areas: custody and fund administration, institutional asset management and securities lending. Let me discuss the performance of each of these in the first quarter. C&IS custody and fund administration fees were $159 million in the first quarter, up 17% on a year-over-year basis and up 2% on a sequential quarter basis. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the improving market environment and new business success in both U.S. and global custody and in fund administration. Across C&IS, our net new business results in the first quarter were the best in two years, with new to Northern and existing clients both contributing significantly to the new business traction we saw in the first quarter. The sequential quarter increase primary reflects both new business and improving market environment, partially offset by the impact of lower transaction volumes.
C&IS investment management fees equaled $64 million in the first quarter, up 5% year-over-year, yet down 1% compared with last quarter. Our results in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $4 million in waived fees associated with institutional money market funds. As I mentioned earlier, fee waivers are one area where low interest rates are directly pressuring our revenues. Absent fee waivers, C&IS investment management fees would've shown growth of 12% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. These results reflect the impact of the improving market environment on our institutional index and manager or managers businesses, as well as new business in both institutional index and short duration.
Securities lending fees equaled $56 million in the first quarter, including approximately $38 million in positive marks associated with the one mark-to-market investment fund used by certain securities lending clients. This compares with $52 million in negative marks in the first quarter of 2009 and $70 million in positive marks last quarter. The first quarter's positive impact of $38 million reduces to approximately $57 million the cumulative impact that negative marks have had on our securities lending fees going back to the third quarter of 2007. 
Excluding the impact of the mark-to-market fund across all periods, C&IS securities lending fees declined approximately 60% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. On this adjusted basis, the year-over-year and sequential declines are primarily attributable to lower spreads, as maturing investments were reinvested at lower rates.
The three components of our institutional fees that I've just discussed are all impacted by the value of assets that we custody administer or manage for our institutional clients. Let me review our various institutional client asset levels with you.
Institutional assets under custody equaled 3.4 trillion at quarter end, representing a double-digit increase of 32% versus last year and an increase of 1% versus last quarter. Global custody assets, an important high-growth sub-component of total C&IS assets under custody equaled $2 trillion at quarter end, up a very strong 44% year-over-year, and up 1% on a sequential quarter basis. 
The increase in institutional assets under custody represents improving equity markets and new business, partially offset in the sequential quarter comparison by the weakening of the euro and sterling relative to the dollar. 
Managed assets for institutional clients were $498 billion at quarter end, up 27% compared with one year ago and up 3% sequentially. Securities lending collateral equaled a $121 billion at quarter end up 27.5% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. As you compare our performance with market induces, note that equities represented about 45% of total C&IS managed assets at quarter end with a significant majority of those equity assets being managed in index strategies.
Let me now switch to our Personal Financial services business. Trust investment and other servicing fees and PFS were $218 million in the first quarter representing an increase of 7% year-over-year. PFS fees declined 1% on a sequential quarter basis. The improving equity market environment was a welcomed tailwind on both the year-over-year and a sequential quarter basis as I mentioned earlier.
Also, our net new business results and PFS were very strong in the first quarter increasing over 50% when compared with last year's first quarter and 33% when compared with last quarter. The first quarter of 2010 was in fact the best first quarter we've ever seen in PFS gross new business, going back to when we began tracking this metric in the early 1990s.
We're seeing clients and prospects alike begin to move back into the market and beginning to focus on implementing longer-term investment strategies. Unfortunately, some of this momentum was masked by the impact of fee waivers on PFS money market mutual funds, again due to the very low level of short-term interest rates. These fee waivers reduced PFS trust investment and other servicing fees by $16 million in the first quarter compared with fee waivers of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, and $8 million in the third quarter.
Fees and PFS are derived from the assets that we manage in custody for Personal clients. PFS assets under management were $149 billion at quarter-end, up 14% compared with a year ago, and up 3% from last quarter. Assets under custody in PFS equaled $341 billion at quarter-end, up 21% year-over-year, and up 3% from last quarter. Recent new business success and improving markets combined a field of higher level of personal client assets at quarter end. As you evaluate PFS performance, note that about 35.5% of PFS managed assets and 44% of PFS custody assets were equity securities at quarter-end.
Net interest income equaled to $240 million in the first quarter, down 17% when compared to the first quarter of 2009. Our net interest margin was 1.44% in the current quarter, 24 basis points lower year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income declined 2% and the net interest margin actually increased by one basis point.
During the first quarter, interest rates remained at historic lows and spreads tightened at the short end of the yield curve. For example, the spread between the overnight fed effective rate and the three-month LIBOR, averaged only 12 basis points in the first quarter compared with 15 basis points in the fourth quarter and 105 basis points in the first quarter of 2009. Low rates, tighter spreads and the reduced value of noninterest related funds continued to pressure net interest income and the net interest margin.
Foreign exchange trading income was $80 million, down 39% compared with the first quarter of 2009 and down 9% compared with the last quarter. Currency volatility was meaningfully lower on a year-over-year basis and was also lower on a sequential quarter basis, although the rate of decline in volatility appears to have slowed. Client volumes partially offset lower volatility as trading activity continued to recover with more stable market conditions.
During the first quarter, our loan loss provision was $40 million, unchanged from last quarter. Net charge-offs equaled $31 million down just slightly from $32 million last quarter. Non-performing loans however increased $41 million sequentially to $319.5 million with about half of the increase related to residential real estate. Other real estate owned increased $16 million principally related to two commercial real estate properties which converted from non-accrual to ORE. 
Now let me shift my comments to a review of the key expense categories that impacted our first quarter performance. Expenses equaled $620 million in the first quarter representing an increase of 4% year-over-year. Total expenses were essentially flat on a sequential quarter basis. Compensation expense equaled $275 million, up 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Recall please that the equity base component of total compensation expense was impacted in 2009 by the reversal of prior expense accruals for performance stock units which were not expected to divest. These reversals reduced our total compensation expense in both the year-earlier quarter as well as the prior quarter. Compensation expense adjusted for these accrual reversals would have increased less than 1% year-over-year and would have declined 1% sequentially.
Staffing levels were approximately 12,500 full-time equivalent positions at quarter end, an increase of 2% year-over-year and less than 1% sequentially. New staff positions were concentrated in our Asia-Pacific region. Employee benefit expense equaled $63 million in the first quarter down 4% year-over-year and up 15% sequentially. The sequential quarter increase primarily reflects higher FICA insurance expense, which is a normal seasonal pattern for us and others, as well as higher health care and pension expense.
Outside services expense equaled $106 million in the first quarter, an increase of 10% compared with last year, yet was down 11% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher investment management sub-advisory fees which are influenced by higher market values and higher technical services. The sequential increase primarily reflects lower cost associated with technical, legal and consulting services.
Equipment and software expense equaled $67 million in the first quarter, up 8% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects depreciation expense associated with ongoing investments in technology. The sequential decline represents the annual pattern, typical annual pattern where expense associated with depreciation and amortization of equipment in capitalized software is typically lower in the first half of the year.
Other operating expenses equaled $67 million in the first quarter, down 5% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. Recall our expenses in this category during 2009 included the impact of the now expired Capital Support Agreements. Included in our first quarter 2009 expenses was $8 million associated with the capital support agreements. Similarly, the fourth quarter of 2009 included $12 million in final expense associated with the funding and expiration of the Capital Support Agreements. Aside from the impact of the Capital Support Agreements, other operating expense reflects higher business promotion and FDIC insurance premiums.
Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 34%. The tax rate in the first quarter reflects the impact of the write off of the deferred tax asset, as a result of the recently enacted federal health-care legislation.
Let me wrap up today's call by offering our thoughts on two frequent topics of discussion. The environment within which Northern Trust operates currently, which recently has been challenging on several fronts, and the strategic positioning of our company, which remains quite positive.
Similar to my environmental comments last quarter, improving equity and fixed income markets continue to be beneficial to both our clients and our businesses. That said, short-term interest rates remain in extremely low levels and our economist do not expect rates to rise meaningfully until early 2011. As noted throughout out my remarks today, this adversely affects net interest income, securities lending and money market mutual fund fees. Likewise, this still challenging economic environment drove non-performing assets higher in the quarter by $57 million. Most of that increase was centered in the real estate markets both residential and commercial. 
Our long-standing conservative and relationship oriented lending practices have allowed us to weather this cycle better than most banks, but our non-performing asset trends are reflective of the difficult economy and the stresses being felt by even the most conservative of lenders. 
Offsetting the challenging near-term macroeconomic environment is the excellent competitive positioning of Northern Trust businesses. Perhaps the best reflection of that strong strategic positioning is the outstanding new business that we achieved in the first quarter. In our Personal business, first quarter net new business increased over 50% year-over-year and 30% sequentially. Our new business results in the month of March alone were the best achieved since we began tracking this metric. We're also seeing success with both existing clients and new clients who appear to be moving back into the market, as well as focusing on longer-term investment strategies that Northern Trust is particularly qualified to implement.
In our Institutional business, net new business increased 11% on both the year-over-year and sequential quarter basis, representing our highest level of net new business since the first quarter of 2008. We expanded relationships with many existing clients, won a number of new relationships during the quarter, and ended March with a solid pipeline in both North America and around the world. 
In sum, our focus at Northern Trust remains on our clients and on the very attractive businesses within which we have chosen to compete. We continue to feel very positive about the long-term positioning of Northern Trust.
Before I conclude, I want to point out that our annual shareholder's meeting begins at 10:30 central time this morning. As is customary for our first quarter calls, we'll need to end today's call to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our annual meeting. Please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the Q&A period earlier than is our normal practice.
Now Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Andrea, would you please open the call for questions."

And that you look at the trends in the share-based portion of compensation expense. I'd really suggest that you do it over the course of the last couple of years. One of the things that you'll notice is that there is some relatively meaningful noise in the component of share-based compensation related to performance stock units. And that's because we actually reverse prior expense accruals as Bill mentioned in his prepared remarks in both the first quarter of 2009 and in the fourth quarter of 2009. And again, that's all disclosed in our annual report, prior 10-Qs and we'll provide the details next week. In addition to that, your other question is that there is traditionally some seasonal uptick in the stock option expense portion of share-based compensation because of the fact that any stock options issued to retirement-eligible employees need to be immediately expensed in the first quarter. And obviously, that didn't have as much of an effect last year because our stock option grants were lower last year as a result of circumstances you're aware of. So you will definitely see that the performance of stock had the impact on last year, and you'll also see an uptick in the first quarter for stock option expense because of the seasonality that you exactly described."

Itâs my pleasure to speak with you today on Northern Trustâs second quarter earnings conference call. Earlier this morning Northern Trust reported second quarter net income of $200 million. Reported earnings",2764,"Thank you, Bev and good morning, everybody. Itâs my pleasure to speak with you today on Northern Trustâs second quarter earnings conference call. Earlier this morning Northern Trust reported second quarter net income of $200 million. Reported earnings equaled $0.82 per share. Our second quarter results include an expense credit of $0.04 per share related to the 2008 IPO of Visa which impacted all of Visa member banks.
In our press release issued earlier today, we provided operating results which are exclusive of this Visa-related item. We believe operating results provide a clearer indication of the results and trends in our core businesses, therefore, our commentary for the remainder of todayâs conference call, will focus on operating results, which are exclusive only of the Visa-related item.
To that end, Northern Trust today announced second quarter operating net income of $192 million. Operating earnings equaled $0.78 per share.
To help you evaluate our performance this quarter, I will begin with a brief overview of market conditions that influenced our results, specifically equity markets and interest rates. Equity markets, as you know, deteriorated during the second quarter, with the S&P 500 and EAFE indices both falling approximately 12%.
Let me review the impact of these equity market trends on fees earned by Northern Trust. Equity market performance calculated on a one-quarter lag basis is the methodology used for calculating C&IS custody and PFS wealth management fees. The S&P 500 increased 46% year-over-year on a one-quarter lag basis.
On a sequential quarter basis, the one-quarter lag markets increased 5%. Using the one-month lag methodology that applies to PFS fees, excluding wealth management, the S&P 500 was up 33% versus the prior year and up 4.6% versus the first quarter.
Short-term interest rates remained at extremely low levels throughout the second quarter. For example, in the United States, overnight interest rates averaged only 19 basis points in the second quarter, a modest improvement from 14 basis points in the first quarter.
Three-month rates averaged 44 basis points, a welcome increase of 18 basis points sequentially, but still 40 basis points below one year ago. Short-term interest rates for the euro and sterling were also at low levels by historical standards.
Our Chief Economist, Paul Kasriel, recently pushed out his forecast for Fed tightening from early 2011 to mid 2011, and noted that the first tightening might not take place until early 2012. As many of you know, low interest rates have impacted our recent performance most noticeably by pressuring both our net interest margin and the fees that we earn on money market mutual funds. Iâll discuss both of those impacts in more detail later on the call.
With that environmental backdrop, let me review of our second quarter results. Revenues in the second quarter equaled $974 million, down 7% compared to last yearâs second quarter, but up 7% sequentially.
Trust, investment and other servicing fees are the largest component of our revenues, representing 56% of total revenues in the second quarter. Trust, investment, and other servicing fees of $544 million decreased 10% or $75 million year-over-year.
Virtually, the entire decline reflects the year-over-year change in positive marks associated with the one mark-to-market fund used by certain securities lending clients.
Positive marks impacted our fees in the second quarter of last year by $129 million, compared to $37 million in this yearâs second quarter or $92 million year-over-year difference. Adjusting for these positive marks in both years, trust fees increased 7% year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, trust fees increased 6%.
In our institutional business, C&IS, trust, investment and other servicing fees totaled $316 million in the second quarter, down 19% year-over-year, but up 6% on a sequential quarter basis.
Adjusting for the impact of positive marks in both years, C&IS fees were up 7% year-over-year. C&IS fees include three primary revenue categories, custody and fund administration, institutional asset management, and securities lending.
Letâs take a look at the performance of each of those in the second quarter. C&IS custody and fund administration fees were $162 million in the second quarter, up a strong 15% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially, reflecting our best quarterly results since the third quarter of 2008.
The year-over-year increase reflects improving markets and new business success in global custody and fund administration. The sequential quarter increase primarily reflects new business in global custody and fund administration.
We are very pleased with our C&IS new business efforts thus far in 2010, with a strong pipeline of committed transitions and a very healthy pipeline globally of new business opportunities. Representative examples of new clients include announced wins from KLP, one of Norwayâs largest life insurance companies and West Sussex Pension Fund, one of the largest pension funds in the United Kingdom.
We have recently announced the successful migration of Hermes Fund Managers to our investment operations platform, cross-selling to existing clients. A longstanding and important contributor to C&IS fee growth was particularly strong on both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons.
C&IS investment management fees equaled $69 million in the second quarter, up 14% year-over-year and up 9% compared to the last quarter, representing our best quarter since the second quarter of 2008.
Waived fees associated with institutional money market mutual funds equaled $2.6 million in the second quarter up from only $300,000 one year ago and down from $4.2 million in the first quarter.
Absent fee waivers, C&IS investment management fees were up 17% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. This growth reflects improving markets on a year-over-year basis and new business in our Manager of Managers and index management business offset by lower client balances in some institutional cash investment products.
Securities lending fees equaled $66 million in the second quarter, including approximately $37 million in positive marks associated with one mark-to-market investment fund used by certain securities lending clients.
As I mentioned earlier, this compares with $129 million in positive marks in the second quarter of 2009 and $38 million in positive marks last quarter.
The second quarterâs positive impact of $37 million reduces to approximately $20 million, the cumulative impact that negative marks have had on our securities lending fees going back to the third quarter of 2007.
Excluding the impact of the mark-to-market fund across all periods, C&IS securities lending fees declined approximately 33% year-over-year, reflecting lower spreads as maturing investments were reinvested at very low interest rates.
On a sequential quarter basis, adjusted C&IS securities lending fees increased to strong 66% primarily reflecting the traditional second quarter impact of the international dividend season as well as slightly wider spreads.
The three components of our institutional fees that Iâve just discussed are all impacted by the value of assets that we custody, administer or manage for our institutional clients.
Let me review our various institutional client asset levels. Institutional assets under custody were $3.2 trillion at quarter end representing an increase of 11% versus last year and a decrease of 4% sequentially.
Global custody assets or sub-component of assets under custody were $1.9 trillion up 14% year-over-year but down 4% on a sequential quarter basis. In both cases the sequential quarter decline reflects lower equity market values and the weakening of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar, offset partially by new business wins.
Managed assets for institutional clients were $462 billion at quarter end, up 9% compared with one year ago, and down 7% sequentially. Securities lending collateral equal to $110 billion at quarter end up 9% year-over-year, yet down 9% sequentially. On an average daily basis, securities lending collateral equaled $124 billion in the second quarter up 2% sequentially.
Now, let me switch to our Personal Financial Services business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees in PFS were $228 million in the second quarter reflecting our best quarterly results since the third quarter of 2008.
PFS fees increased 8% year-over-year and 4% on a sequential quarter basis. Year-over-year PFS fee growth was driven by improved markets and new business, offset partially by the impact of fee waivers on PFS money market mutual funds, due again to the very low level of short-term interest rates. Sequential quarter PFS fee growth was driven equally by improved markets and by new business.
Money market fund fee waivers reduced PFS fees by $12.9 million in the second quarter, compared with PFS fee waivers of $16 million in the first quarter and $3.6 million in the second quarter of 2009. The sequential decline in fee waivers reflects the net yield improvement in the relevant funds, due to higher second quarter short-term interest rates.
Our net new business results in PFS moderated from the very strong first quarter results that we talked with you about in April. Weâve seen that equity market volatility has created a degree of unease with some perspective clients and a slower more cautious transition to new investment providers and strategies.
That said, our PFS net new business results for the first half of the 2010 increased more than 20% from the level experienced in the first half of 2009. Fees in PFS are derived from the assets that weâve managed in custody for personal clients. PFS assets under management were $142 billion at quarter end, up 3% compared with a year ago, yet down 5% from last quarter.
Assets under custody in PFS were $328 billion at quarter and, up 9% year-over-year and down 4% from last quarter. Approximately 33% of PFS managed assets and 41% of PFS custody assets were equity securities at quarter end, both lower than last quarter by several percentage points due to lower market equity market levels.
Net interest income equaled $242 million in the second quarter, down 7% when compared to the second quarter of 2009. Our net interest margin of 1.47% in the current quarter is 12 basis points lower than the year-over-year comparison.
Interest rates remained near historic lows and spreads were tighter year-over-year at the short end of the yield curve. For example, the spread between the overnight Fed effective rate and three-month LIBOR averaged only 25 basis points in the second quarter compared with 66 basis points in the second quarter of 2009. Lower rates, tighter spreads year-over-year, and the reduced value of non-interest related funds continue to pressure net interest income and the net interest margin.
On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income increased 1% and the net interest margin increased by 3 basis points. The sequential increase in net interest income was primarily driven by one additional day during the second quarter as compared to the first quarter.
Foreign exchange trading income was $115 million, down 14% compared to the second quarter of 2009, but up 45% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year decline reflects heightened volatility in the year earlier quarter related to the credit crisis.
The sequential quarter improvement reflects renewed volatility in recent months associated with the financial uncertainty in the Eurozone and concerns about the pace of global economic recovery.
In the second quarter, our loan loss provision was $50 million, $10 million lower than our $60 million provision in last yearâs second quarter, but $10 million higher than our provision in the first quarter.
Net charge-offs were $38 million down $6 million year-over-year, but up $8 million sequentially.
Non-performing assets increase $25 million sequentially to $390 million. Of the $25 million increase in nonperforming assets $19 million was in the residential real estate portfolio and $5 million was in the commercial real estate portfolio. At quarter end nonperforming assets equaled 1.37% of total loans, a ratio that continues to position Northern Trust very favorably among our banking industry peers.
Now, let me shift my comments to a review of the key expense categories that impacted our second quarter performance. Operating expenses which exclude the Visa benefit that I mentioned equaled $627 million in the second quarter representing an increase of 25% year-over-year.
Recall that two items had a significant impact on our second quarter 2009 expenses. First, we recorded a $130 million expense reduction related to the capital support agreements in place at that time. Second, we recorded $20 million in additional expense related to the FDIC special assessment.
Adjusting for those two items, operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, operating expenses increased 1%. Compensation expense equaled $278 million down 3% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Salaries and incentives were lower year-over-year despite annual merit increases.
The sequential quarter increase was driven by higher accruals for cash-based incentives. Staffing levels equaled approximately 12,600 full time equivalent positions at quarter end, an increase of 2% year-over-year, and less than 1% sequentially. New staff positions were concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region.
Employee benefit expense equaled $59 million in the second quarter, down 5% year-over-year, and 7% sequentially. In both comparisons, the decline in employee benefit expense was broad-based across pension, FICA insurance and other benefit categories.
Outside services expense equaled $115 million in the second quarter, an increase of 12% compared with last year and 8% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher investment management, sub-advisory and sub-custodian fees, which are influenced by higher market values, and higher technical services. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher sub-custodian and sub-advisory fees, along with higher legal and technical services cost.
Equipment and software expense equaled $70 million in the second quarter, up 14% year-over-year, and 5% sequentially. In both comparisons, the increase reflects depreciation expense associated with ongoing investments in technology.
Other operating expense equaled $64 million in the second quarter, compared with a negative $51 million in the second quarter last year and $67 million last quarter. Recall my earlier comments that our second quarter 2009 results included a $130 million expense reduction related to the capital support agreements, and $20 million in expense related to the FDIC special assessment.
Adjusting for those two items, other operating expense increased 8% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase reflects a number of items including the U.K. bonus tax, which we estimate will be $0.01 to $0.02 a share and higher business promotion offset partially by a lower level of charges related to account servicing activities. The sequential quarter decline of 5% reflects lower business promotion and advertising expense.
At our Investor Day in May, we spoke about the excellent strategic provisioning of our businesses and the many growth opportunities we see for the future. We also discussed how the current environment, particularly very low interest rates, is negatively impacting our revenues.
I want to close today with an update on those two important topics. Strategically, Northern Trust enjoys the position of leadership in the businesses in which we have chosen to compete.
PFS is the market leader in the United Sates and serving the financial needs of wealthy individuals and their families. C&IS is one of only a handful of global banks that can serve the sophisticated needs of complex institutional clients.
NTGI is one of the largest asset managers in the world, focusing its expertise on the investment management needs of our target personal and institutional clients, and their operations and technology platform offers our clients an integrated global infrastructure.
Our clients are among the best in the world and are the envy of many in the industry. Demographic trends that affect the markets we serve are supportive of the strong growth outlook. Likewise, continued globalization creates complexity for our clients and growth opportunities for us.
This strong positioning in great businesses is currently being masked, however, by extremely low short-term interest rates. First; low rates means that our money market mutual funds cannot generate sufficient yield to cover the management fees.
Second, our net interest margin of 1.4% in the second quarter was significantly lower than at longer term average of 1.74%. In securities lending, the relationship between our annual fees and average collateral levels was the lowest across the past decade in the first quarter, and while rebounding slightly in the second quarter due to traditional seasonality and some pickup in spreads, weâre still below historical averages.
Altogether, the extremely low interest rate environment reduced second quarter revenues by about $70 million when compared with historical averages equal to about $0.19 in quarterly earnings per share. I shared this updated perspective with you, simply to demonstrate again, as we did at our Investor Day, how the low interest rate environment is negatively impacting our revenues.
Our focus at Northern Trust remains on our clients and on the very attractive businesses within which we compete we continue to feel positively about the long-term positioning of Northern Trust.
Now, Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Cynthia, please open the call for questions.

I feel like one of the concerns people always have is just the dollars of expenses creeping up, and against that, a risk if the volatility environment goes back down or the sec lending environment goes back down, that you would have negative operating leverage.
So, maybe can you touch on, are you managing to a rate of growth or are you managing to a dollar level, and if we do have a drop-off in something like FX trading what kind of operating leverage should we expect? And then maybe on the flip side, in the more optimistic scenario where revenue growth accelerates, in that scenario, could you continue to grow expenses at this kind of very modest year-over-year rate or should we expect some pent-up investments or salary increases or something like that to kick-in?

I think, Brian, so far weâve been able to strike a pretty good balance, and that speaks to the history of the expense growth. I think we need to continue to invest in our business, and I think in the near-term, we will do that. As to your question about a more difficult environment and can we adjust our expenses accordingly? Yes, we always can. Thatâs a subject that we monitor every month and every quarter as you would imagine.
The other part of your question envisioning a more optimistic environment and the possibility that our expense rates would continue to run at these levels is pretty hard to think about. I really havenât thought that much about a much improved environment at least in the very near-term, someday weâll get one, but itâs down the road. I think our expenses would probably go up from todayâs level. Our expense growth would go up in a more positive environment, as we would bring forward some of the initiatives that weâve put on the back burner in this low interest rate environment. Hope that answers your question.

The residential loan market is still tough.
Iâll remind you all that, while our loans are distributed across the United States, we do have a significant presence in some difficult markets, Florida, Arizona being key among them. While residential trends have improved a little bit, obviously, they are still problematic in those markets. Commercial real estate, while weâve been pretty aggressive in dealing with our exposure, at least in terms of our now nonperforming loans in the commercial real estate area. Weâve seen some new situations come up as loans have matured and new appraisals are being received and evaluated. Again, substantially all of the charge-off activity within those two categories, more in residential loans than commercial real estate loans.

First for others on the call, remember that our Wealth Management Group is focused on family offices globally and very high net worth individuals and historically, that group of clients have had a little different asset allocation than the typical PFS client. Rob, you mentioned, a year and a half ago 50% of the average of our total AUM in the Wealth Management Group was in cash or short duration assets, much, much higher levels of cash than the rest of our PFS business.
What weâve seen over the last six quarters, some acceleration in the first six months of this year is a reallocation of that cash in short duration business to riskier asset allocation groupings, hedge funds, private equity, equity all across the board and several of those reinvestments had not been in Northern Trust products.
Weâve retained the custody, where there are custodiable [ph] assets, but the shift is just that. Weâve seen a reduction in asset allocation of about 7% from 50% to about 43% over the last six quarters out of cash. Recall, in the cash environment, weâre getting an investment management fee, and when that money moves to a riskier investment and we donât manage it, we either get a custody fee in lieu of an asset management fee or we get just a line item carrying fee if itâs a private equity investment. So I think that speaks for the difference and the lack of growth relatively in wealth management versus the rest of PFS.

291896,113751664,80899,"Northern Trust Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Northern Trust Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Bev, and good morning, everybody.  Itâs my pleasure to speak with you today on Northern Trustâs third quarter earnings conference call.  Earlier this morning Northern Trust reported third quarter net income of $156 million or $0.64 a share.",2479,"Thank you, Bev, and good morning, everybody.  Itâs my pleasure to speak with you today on Northern Trustâs third quarter earnings conference call.  Earlier this morning Northern Trust reported third quarter net income of $156 million or $0.64 a share.  This compares to reported earnings per share of $0.77 in the third quarter of 2009 and $0.82 in the second quarter of this year.  
Recall that our earnings last year and last quarter each benefited from reduction and indemnification liability related to Visa.  We've provided operating earning in the relevant quarters which exclude they include of Visa items.  To reiterate operating earnings per share equal $0.72 in the year ago quarter and $0.78 last quarter.
Before I begin reviewing our performance in the third quarter let me remind you that market conditions continue to influence our results specifically uneven equity markets and very low interest rates.  Equity markets as you know improved during the third quarter with the S&P500 and EFA Indexes rising 10.7% and 6.5% respectively.  However, recall that equity markets declined 12% in the second quarter which is relevant to our businesses which use a quarter latent methodology in calculating some fees specifically C&IS custody and PFS wealth management.  Likewise equity markets declined 7.7% in the third quarter using the one-month latent methodology which is relevant to fees that we earned in PFS, excluding wealth management.  
While we're certainly encouraged by the performance of het equity markets in the third quarter particularly during the month of September we remind you that some of the fees that we earn are based on lag calculation methodologies.  The level of short-term interest is very relevant to our earnings and has had an ongoing negative impact on interest income, some investment management fees and securities lending revenues.  
As you know interest rates remained at extremely low levels throughout the third quarter, in the United States overnight interest rates averaged only 19 basis points in the third quarter unchanged from the second quarter.  Three months LIBOR averaged 39 basis points, a decrease of five basis points sequentially, short-term interest rates for the Euro and Furling were also at low levels by historical standards although a short-term interest rates in the Euro increased modestly.  
With that environmental backdrop let me review our third quarter results.  Revenues in the third quarter equaled $899 million, down 3% compared to last years third quarter and down 8% sequentially.  Trust, investment, and other serving fees, are the largest component of our revenues representing 58% of total revenues in the third quarter.  Trust investment and other serving fees of 519 million dollars decreased 1% year-over-year and 5% sequentially.  
In our institutional business C&IS trust investment and other serving fees totaled $293 million in the third quarter down 5% year-over-year and down 7% on a sequential quarter basis, C&IS fees including three primary categories, custody and fund administration, institutional asset management and securities lending.  Before I move into a review of our C&IS fee trends please make note of the commentary in our earnings press release that C&IS custody and fund administration fees were increased and investment management fees were decreased by $4.3 million each as a result of the fee classification.  
Prior periods have not been restated.  So you'll want to be mindful of this reclassification as you evaluate those two institutional fee categories.  C&IS custody and fund administration fees were $159 million in the third quarter up 6% year-over-year.  Yet down 2% sequentially, excluding the reclassification that I mentioned earlier C&IS custody and fund administration fees would have been up 3% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially.  The year-over-year increase reflects new business success in global custody and fund administration as well as improved market values partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates; primarily against the British Pound.  
The sequential quarter decline primarily reflects the impact of quarter-lag markets which were down 12% as well as unfavorable exchange rates partially offset by new business in global custody and fund administration.  
We're very pleased with our C&IS new business results in the third with net new business at its best level since the fourth quarter of 2007.  On a year-to-date basis in 2010 C&IS net new business is 16% higher than the first nine months of 2009 and we have a healthy pipeline globally of new business opportunities.  Cross selling to existing clients, a long standing and important contributor to C&IS fee growth has been particularly strong in 2010.
C&IS investment management fees were $61 in the third quarter essentially flat year-over-year and down 13% compared with last quarter.  Waived fees associated institutional money market mutual funds equaled $2.5 million in the third quarter up from only $800,000 one year ago and similar to $2.6 million last quarter.  Absent fee waivers and the fee reclassification C&IS investment management fees were up 9% year-over-year and down 6% sequentially.  
The year-over-year growth reflects improving markets and new business in our index management, institutional mutual fund, and manager of manager businesses, partially offset by higher money market fee waivers.  The sequential decline primarily reflects lower quarter-lag equity markets and a decline in average institutional mutual fund balances.  
Securities lending fees total $56 million in the third quarter, including approximately $39 million in positive marks associated with the one mark-to-market investment fund used by certain of our securities clients.  This compares with $57 million in positive marks in the third quarter of 2009 and $37 million in positive marks last quarter.  As mentioned in our earnings press release all remaining securities in the mark-to-market fund were sold during the third quarter.  The mark-to-market fund is now entirely invested in a short duration fund, thus eliminating any mark-to-market impacts on our security lending revenues going forward.  
Securities lending fees excluding the mark-to-market impact equaled $17 in the third quarter and declined approximately 30% year-over-year reflecting lower spreads.  On a sequential quarter basis securities lending fees decreased 41%.  The sequential decline was not unexpected and represents a normal after effect of the traditional second quarter seasonal peak in securities lending due to the international dividend season.  
Our institutional fees are impacted by the value of assets that we custody, administer or manage for our institutional clients.  So let's look at the various C&IS client asset levels.  Institutional assets under custody were $3.6 trillion at quarter end.  Representing an increase of 10% both year-over-year and sequentially.  Global custody assets, a sub-component of assets under custody, were $2.2 trillion up 13% year-over-year and up 15% on a sequential quarter basis.  The sequential quarter increase reflects higher global equity market values, the strengthening of the Euro and British Pound Sterling relative to the U.S. dollar and new business success.  
Managed assets for institutional clients were $509 billion at quarter end, up 8% compared with one year ago and up 10% sequentially.  Securities lending collateral equaled $112 billion at quarter end, up 1% year-over-year and also sequentially.  Average securities lending collateral however, was down 4% compared to the second quarter.  
Now let's move to the personal financial services business.  Trust investment and other servicing fees in PFS were $225.5 million in the third quarter.  PFS fees increased 6% year-over-year and decreased 1% on a sequential quarter basis.  Year-over-year growth was driven by new business and improved market values offset partially by the impact of fee waivers on PFS money market mutual funds due to the very low level of short-term interest rates.      Money market fee waivers reduced PFS fees by $10.4 million in the third quarter compared with PFS fee waivers of $8.1 million in the third quarter of 2009 and $12.9 million last quarter.  The sequential quarter decline in PFS fees was driven by lower month lag and quarter-lag equity markets partially offset by new business and lower mutual fund fee waivers.  
Year-to-date, PFS net new business increased approximately 20% from the level achieved in the first nine months of 2009.  That said as the year has progressed we've seen a certain amount of delays and indecision with prospective clients given market volatility and by that I refer to the flash crash in May and the generally weak economic conditions.  
Fees in PFS are derived from the assets that we manage and in custody for personal clients, PFS assets under management were a $149 billion at quarter end up 5% with compared with a year ago and with last quarter.  Assets under custody in PFS were $349 billion at quarter end up 8% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially.  
Approximately 34% of PFS managed assets and 43% of PFS custody assets were invested in equity securities at quarter end.  Both slightly higher than last year due principally to improved equity market levels.  Net income equaled $243 million in the third quarter down 2% when compared to the third quarter of 2009 and essentially flat sequentially.  
Our net interest margin was 1.44% in the current quarter, 10 basis points lower year-over-year and 3 basis points lower sequentially.  Interest rates remain near historic lows and spreads were tighter both on a year-over-year and sequentially at this short end of the yield curve.  For example, the spread between the overnight Fed effective rate and three month LIBOR averaged only 20 basis points in the third quarter compared with 26 basis points in the third quarter of 2009 and 25 basis points last quarter.  
Growth and earning assets which were up 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially was more than offset by the negative impact of low rates and tight spreads.  Foreign exchange trading income was $89 million down 4% compared to the third quarter of 2009 and down 23% compared with last quarter.  The sequential quarter decline reflects the normal second quarter to the third quarter seasonal pattern and a reduction in volatility during the third quarter versus the second quarter.  
Other operating income of $28 million to decreased 21% year-over-year and 26% sequentially.  The primary driver of the decrease was $6.3 million in pretax losses that resulted from the discontinuance of cash flow hedges relating to hedging non-U.S. dollar denominated revenue and expense transactions.  
In the third quarter we recorded $14 million in credit related other than temporary impairment on residential mortgage back investment securities held within our balance sheet securities portfolio.  This amount is reflected in the investment security transactions line on our income statement and primarily reflects additional deterioration on five previously identified and impaired securities.  That said the quality of our balance sheet securities portfolio remains high with 87% of the portfolio rated AAA as of September 30th.
In the third quarter our loan loss prevision was $30 million, half of the $60 million provision recorded last year and $20 million below our $50 million provision last quarter.  Net charge-offs were also $30 million down $16 million year-over-year and $80 million sequentially.  Non-performing loans declined $18 million sequentially to $327 million at quarter end.  Of the $18 million decreased in no-performing loans $9 million was in the residential real estate portfolio and $8 million was in the commercial real estate portfolio.  
Some of the reduction in non-performing loans moved into other real estate owned which was up $6 million in the third quarter.  At quarter end non-performing assets equaled 1.35 percent of total loans.  A ratio that continues to position Northern Trust favorably among our banking industry peers.  Let me shift my comments now to a review of the key expense categories that impacted our third quarter performance.  
In all comparisons to the prior year in the prior quarter, I'll be referring to operating expenses which exclude the Visa benefits that impacted the prior periods.  Total expenses equaled $622 million in the third quarter representing an increase of 1% year-over-year and a decrease of 1% sequentially.  
Compensation expense equaled $273 million, down 4% or $10 million year-over-year.  The primary driver of lower compensation expense was a decline in equity-based compensation, which equaled $11 million in the third quarter of 2010 and $18 million in the third quarter of 2009.  On a sequential quarter basis, compensation expense was down 2% or $5 million primarily reflecting lower accruals for cash-based incentives.
Staffing levels equaled approximately 12,700 full-time equivalent positions at quarter end, an increase of 2% year-over-year and less than 1% sequentially.  New staff positions were generally concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region.  Outside services expense equaled $111 million in the third quarter, an increase of 2% or $2 million compared with last year, but weâre down 3% or $4 million sequentially.  The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher expenses associated with investment manager sub-advisory fees and technical services.  The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower sub-custodian fees and technical services.
Equipment and software expense equaled $73 million in the third quarter, up 11% or $7 million year-over-year and 4% or $3 million sequentially.  In both comparisons the increase reflects depreciation expense associated with ongoing investments in technology.  Other operating expense equaled $63 million in the third quarter, an increase of $9 million or 16% year-over-year, but were down 1% or $1 million sequentially.  The year-over-year increase reflects a number of items including higher charges associated with account servicing activities and higher business promotion, partially offset by a reduction in the accrual established last quarter for the United Kingdom bonus tax.  The sequential quarter decline reflects the lower impact of the U.K. bonus tax and lower FDIC premiums, partially offset by higher charges associated with account servicing activities.
Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 34.5% compared with 33.5% in the second quarter, primarily driven by a change in the geographic mix of earnings.  Our tax rate for the first nine months of 2010 was 33.9%.
Now, let me sum up with a few closing comments.  Although the environment in which Northern Trust is operating remains challenging, I'm encouraged by what we're seeing across a number of fronts.  For example, client acquisition and retention in 2010, that is net new business from both personal and institutional clients, is up 18% compared with the first nine months of 2009.
Client assets under custody and managed assets have both increased nicely year-over-year, those were 10% and 8%, respectively, reflecting higher market values, new business success and client retention.  Our expense management has been sound with 1% growth in total non-interest expense year-over-year and 1% contraction in expenses on a sequential quarter basis.
The overall quality of our loan portfolio improved in the third quarter with nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and the loan loss provision, all coming in at levels better than the second quarter.  Our capital position, which has been an important differentiator for many years, remained strong with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.2% and a Tier 1 common ratio of 12.7%.
So notwithstanding the challenging environment, we continue to serve our clients with distinction and we remain confident in our strategic, competitive and financial positioning.
Thank you for your time today.  Bev and I would now be happy to answer your questions.

Actually, we'd had pretty strong growth across all four segments.  I would say that the principal driver of new business in PFS has been the Wealth Advisory sector or segment, which you'll recall is focused on clients with $10 million to $200 million in liquidity.  
The Institutional segment, which focuses on principally foundations and endowments with less than $250 million in investable assets, has been growing strongly, but it's of a relatively small base.  PCS is doing reasonably well.  I would say Wealth Management has not been so strong in this year based on the lack of M&A activity and the lack of wealth creation in the United States.  So, again, principal business driver in the Wealth Advisory segment.
<TAG>Howard Chen - Credit Suisse    Then shifting gears, given all that what we've seen with short-term rate movements, Bill, could you just give a sense of where your NIM maybe existed the quarter and where you anticipate that to be all else being equal?

I think on average we were a little bit lower than that right at the end of the quarter.  There are some dynamics that, obviously, would suggest that if rates stay where they are and everything else stays equal, net interest margin will probably drift a little bit lower here, and those are principally the reinvestment of our investment portfolio, which you all know is quite short, and if we continue to reinvest in common duration and common credit quality, we'll see some small degradation there.  We're going to have I think some - or we're seeing some impact on our net interest margin from what's happening in the residential mortgage market from a pricing point of view as we begin to modify some loans for our existing clients.  So there's no question, if everything stays the way it is going into the future, we'll have a little bit of net interest margin deterioration.
<TAG>Howard Chen - Credit Suisse    Then it sounds like what you're saying there's nothing that you're necessarily changing in terms of philosophy on the investment side or the funding side.

We've seen what others have done as a view, and we're not inclined to follow suit at the present time.  Let me just leave it at that.
<TAG>Howard Chen - Credit Suisse    Then final one for me.  We got some clarity on Basel III during the quarter.  Any evolved thoughts that you can share on just how you're thinking about the proposals on capital leverage and liquidity and any adjustments you think you might need to make to conform?
<TAG>William  Morrison     You have in our press release what our capital ratios were at the end of the quarter.  As we understand Basel III, and I have to quantify what I'm about to say by saying there could be significant changes between now and final implementation by U.S.  regulators, but based on what we know today we could comply with Basel III from a capital point of view with some margin given our balance sheet dynamics at September 30.

<TAG>Operator    And we'll next to Jeff Hopson with Stifel.
<TAG>Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel Nicolaus    You mentioned that new business continues to be driven by existing clients.  I am curious, are these more new products or are you getting more penetration down into the middle office, etcetera, from existing clients? My sense is that, with the strong equity markets here, your strong new business at what point do you think some of your ongoing recurring fees can offset some of the negative effect from lower interest rates?
<TAG>Beverly Fleming     Jeff, let me start with the clarification and then I'll hand it off to Bill.  I don't think we did say that new business was exclusively driven by our existing clients.  I think we said in the C&IS section that we did have strong new business from our existing clients which actually has been something that's been in place for quite some time.  I would say that in C&IS our add-ons of additional business with existing clients over time roughly 50-50 sometimes 60-40, sometimes 40-60.  So I just want to clarify that it wasn't exclusively from existing clients although that was quite strong.
<TAG>Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel Nicolaus    But from those existing clients, anything driving kind of the new business of new products or just adding more services to those existing clients?

So it's really very well diversified across the product offerings that C&IS offers, and I think that's great personally.  We view that as quite a positive.
<TAG>Beverly Fleming     The one thing that I would add and I would maybe point you to our Investor Day presentation from earlier this year, is that from a new product development perspective, certainly our clients like our industry, are facing a lot of complexity in regulation and reporting requirement.  So we and others, of course, have seen opportunities from a new product development perspective to support our clients as they go through an environment, where their needs are evolving as well.

<TAG>Beverly Fleming     I can get back to you on that, Tom.  I can certainly ask my colleagues in securities lending.  I would say it's certainly short selling, may be market volatility like the VIX would be something that might be an indication, but as you know the demand side is influenced by the leverage that the borrowers choose to take on, and that there is a number of different ways that you can evaluate that.

First, Bill, understanding your comments about in the wealth management segment of the PFS business there is not lot of M&A so maybe not as much wealth creation.  If I look at the fee line there in page four of your disclosure of your trend support, you've seen it's been actually kind of down over the last 18 months, pretty flat last year and a half.  Revenue has been kind of flat the last three quarters.  Is that where most of the fee waivers in PFS are hitting and that's why that's kind of been trending down, flat or is it really something else there too, I mean understanding that maybe there's not a lot of new account creation because of M&A, but what's kind of impacting the existing clients?
<TAG>William  Morrison     I think the story in wealth management is more around the mix in our asset management business.  We had a big inflow of cash and short duration business here in 2008 and 2009, and of course that generates an investment management fee.  Then as our wealth clients here more recently seem to be getting more confidence and putting more risk in their solutions, they are moving out of managed cash and out of our investment management fee world into an environment where weâre collecting a custody fee on a more risk intensive investment solution in some cases implemented by somebody else.  So thatâs the dynamic there.
<TAG>Robert Lee - KBW    Maybe a little bit more color also on the C&IS business or on the custody business, as you pointed out pretty good new customer wins.  If I look at, at least asset growth to last year up about 10%, but if I break it down and looks like virtually all the growth or most of the growth is still being driven outside the U.S.  Could you comment a little bit about what you are seeing domestically in the C&IS business? Has that business really just been kind of stagnant and the market is up, so you are seeing kind of assets rise a little bit there or how should we be thinking about the domestic trends specifically?

Weâve had some successes in the IOO space, investment operations outsourcing space, recently and a number of those opportunities have been global opportunities, which impacts our business not only here but elsewhere as well.  
So I think we would and, particularly, Steve Fradkin, who runs the businesses was here, I think he would tell you that the opportunities are probably still greater in the institutional business outside the United States, but there is still considerable opportunity for us here and we're realizing that.  We've talked about our funded new business, but we really haven't talked about our pipeline.  We talked about our pipeline last quarter, but I'd update that and say that our pipeline across all of our product segments in C&IS across all geographies was quite strong.  
You all know that the transition period that is the time from which we win a piece of business until the time that we book it and then report it as new business in C&IS is much longer than it is in PFS.  So pipeline strength and one not funded business, which will not be reported in the new business line is extremely important to future revenues.
<TAG>Robert Lee - KBW    Maybe one last question.  Following up on capital, understanding that Basel is not finalized, but I guess presumably it will be over the coming months or quarter versus a couple of quarters.  Looking out ahead, you seem pretty comfortable with where you'll be post Basel III from a capital perspective.  You guys never cut your dividend but once you were kind of over that hump, is there anything we should be thinking about or how would you be thinking about at that point deploying your capital, would it be kind of you may go back to buying back stock to offset some options, issuance or restricted stock issuances? Is there any change, anything, any priority you have kind of post Basel for your capital?
<TAG>William  Morrison     Let me take the dividend.  First, we never cut it.  It's reasonably competitive within the financial services space.  In fact, I'd say at the top of the pile to be more specific.  So, we'll continue to evaluate our dividend from time to time as we always have.  We believed that the best way to employ excess capital, if we can get everybody to agree that we have excess capital and we think ultimately we'll be able to do that, is to invest in our businesses, to make acquisitions that augment our capabilities or expand our presence in our client count in both businesses.  
We've said this before, but in the PFS space, it's more around building presence in some of the very high wealth concentration markets in the United States, including the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and West, and expanding our wealth management business a little bit in Europe and in Asia.  On the Institutional side, it's more around capabilities in the fund administration business and possibly, in the custody client acquisition business.  But those goals are unchanged business unit by business unit.  
Of course, we'd have interest in certain investment managers that fit our prioritization in NTGI.  But my quicker answer to your question would be we think the best utilization of that excess capital is building our client facing businesses, longest and best benefit to the shareholders over time.

<TAG>Operator    Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Nomura Securities.
<TAG>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities    Hi, thanks very much, I know it's not a big number.  We're coming off a small base, but if you look at the interest rate trends, I find it kind of interesting to see such a big percentage increase or just a lift of bottom in the yields you're paying on the non-U.S.  time deposits, and just curious if there's any comment you can make from there? Is that pressure from client? Is that a currency thing? Just curious.
<TAG>Beverly Fleming    I think, Glenn.  This is Bev.  You hit the nail on the head when you said is it a currency thing and that is exactly what's going on here.  The rates that we pay, both on the non-U.S. office time deposits, which would be the liability side, as you know, is a driver of our balance sheet, and then the rate that we earn on the category called money market assets or the sub-component time deposits with banks is a blended rate based on holdings in those two accounts at a variety of different currencies.  
One of the things that has been going on here, as you know, we've been relatively successful in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years and in particular in Australia, and what happened is that in both of those categories, the funding side and the asset side, the proportion of those two line items that are now denominated in the Australian dollar is higher.  As I'm sure you're aware, the Australian dollar is paying I think it's 4.5% on an overnight rate and 4.88% on a three-month rate.  So you've got a mix there from a currency perspective, which is driving those two line items.
<TAG>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities    Just curious on the last question you were talking about won but not funded business, but correct me if somehow I did miss it, you didn't say what that number was on an asset basis.  Do you have those numbers handy?
<TAG>William  Morrison     We didn't say and we haven't said.
<TAG>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities    Is it bigger than a bread box?  I'm kidding.  Okay, how about flows in asset management land, I would imagine that the stars are aligned towards your passive business, but do you break that out?

<TAG>Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities    Finally just a small one, on the OTTI, I know itâs a small number and of the time it's episodic, but in the quarter it felt like spreads kind of arrived and things did fine.  Just curious what drove the OTTI adjustment now?
<TAG>William  Morrison     If you went back and looked at the detail on those securities, those are subordinated residential mortgage-backed securities in difficult markets and while generally the dynamics around residential mortgage-backed should be flat or maybe even improved a bit on a national level, these particular geographies, subordinated positioning, and the vintages of the mortgages in these portfolios are going the other way.  So it does seem counterintuitive we'd be taking an increased OTTI I agree with that, but it is issue specific locality and subordination.

<TAG>Beverly Fleming    We didn't disclose the breakdown, but there definitely was an unfavorable exchange rate on a sequential quarter basis, and that just has to do basically with our hedging strategy.  Youâve said your hedge is 12 to 18 months ago, so that would be a pretty normal phenomenon in an environment like we're in.
<TAG>Mike Mayo - CLSA    Because wouldn't you expect the weaker dollar that might have been a positive, I guess, while it went up being a negative with the hedging?

<TAG>Beverly Fleming    It's the hedging, right.  You're thinking spot rates and we're talking hedge rates.
<TAG>Mike Mayo - CLSA    Then a separate question.  No reserve release, is that because you see some concerns out there even though your trends are favorable, or are you just more conservative orâ¦
<TAG>William  Morrison     Mike, you know we've always been pretty conservative in this area.  We've got a to reserve the total loans to 1.17%, and some of the markets we're in are still pretty tough.  So, we're going to look at the next couple of quarters and see where we are.

The markets that I am concerned about are Florida, Arizona and Nevada, to a lesser extent, Southern California.  But the one that really is important to us is Florida because we have about $6 billion in funded loans in Florida, and a lot of commercial real estate loans and a lot of residential real estate loans there.  So, as you well know, the improvement in the economy is very regional in the U.S., and Florida is reasonably slow in terms of recovery.  So we're just watching that carefully, and as I say, we need a couple more quarters around it.
<TAG>Mike Mayo - CLSA    Last question, securities lending $56 million, you had $39 million of benefit.  So does that mean the run rate going forward is $17 million for securities lending?
<TAG>William  Morrison     Yes, that's correct.
<TAG>Mike Mayo - CLSA    That's lower than it had been.
<TAG>William  Morrison     That's right.  Again, you've got the narrowing between the Fed funds rate and LIBOR spreads, and you all track that pretty well.
<TAG>Mike Mayo - CLSA    Well, if that's going down, does that mean personnel expense might show a little decline?
<TAG>William  Morrison     We're always looking at personnel expense across the businesses.
<TAG>Beverly Fleming    Mike, one thing that I would add is that the $17 million that you cited, that actually is the same as what it was in the first quarter.  In the second quarter, obviously, it went up because of the international dividend season as well as the spread environment.  So I just wanted to point out for those on the call that the amount ex the mark-to-market fund was pretty much exactly the same as it was in the first quarter.

<TAG>Brian Bedell - ISI Group    Sure, we could do that.  That's fine.  I can move on.

How do you think sort of strategically about spending on the initiatives that you have been doing in terms of the new product rollouts on advertising, bringing on folks to service the new assets? How do you think about like to what degree you have some flexibility around the weak environment, if the environment stays very subdued for the next two to three quarters, are you able to throttle back expenses to some degree or would you rather just continue to reinvest in the business because that's going to be a longer term benefit to you?

There is a very high appreciation today for the quality of what we do and the service level, which we get out to our clients, both on the institutional side and on the personal side.  
At the same time, there is a high level of appreciation for our single operating platform and the fact that when we put a technological improvement onto that platform, it benefits all geographies and all types of clients.  Part of the reason that we're able to sell effectively onto that single global operating platform is the fact that we're spending a fair amount of money on it.  
You'll notice that one of the categories in which we have increased expense pretty well back for several years now is depreciation expense that we depreciate what I think relative to our peers are relatively high capital expenses.  We would not want to stop spending on technology because itâs driving I think a good percentage of our wins currently.

I don't have the growth rates compared to prior nine-month periods or quarter-to-quarter handy.  We can try to come back to you on that.  
I would just say that from a macro point of view, and I made these comments earlier in this call, the personal clients, while we are winning particularly in the higher end, new business in the personal side, a lot of people are kind of caught in the headlights as a result of the flash crash and what people think are inadequate explanation of how that happened.  So there's still a lot of concern about going to more risk intensive solutions on our personal client side.  
There's a lot less of that on the institutional side as you would expect, and there's a lot less of that in our wealth management space.  I would probably say that in the third quarter our growth in new business, even though it's different than what the percentages tell you when I take into consideration the pipelines, is probably stronger than the institutional side than it is in the personal side.  I would have told you at the end of the first quarter and at the end of the second quarter exactly the opposite.
<TAG>Beverly Fleming    John, one thing that I would restate, which we said in the conference call, is that for C&IS the new business in the third quarter itself because these percent rate recording are year-to-date, and the third quarter itself was the best that weâve seen since the fourth quarter of 2007.  So I think thatâs a very specific comparison that we can make for you.  I think if you add to that those comments about our view of the pipeline globally, I think that would speak to pretty sound excitement about what weâre seeing in the institutional business.
<TAG>John Stilmar - SunTrust    Just with that enthusiasm, with all due respect, is this a Northern Trust specific or are you finding that there is just the macro themes that weâve been talking about for some time with new products, new services themselves are starting to get traction? Or is it really there is a specific or isolated distinct advantage to Northern Trust absent the longstanding relationships that youâve had with your client segments?
<TAG>Beverly Fleming    As you and, I am sure, most of the people on this call have done this week, we certainly have listened to what our closest peers said earlier in the week and I think that all of us are speaking with enthusiasm about opportunities in the global marketplace.  So where we do have some specific wins to Northern Trust that weâre very excited about, I would say that weâre just in an environment right now where opportunities for the businesses that we are in on a global basis are quite good.
