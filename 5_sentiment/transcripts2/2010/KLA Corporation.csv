Welcome to our second quarter fiscal year 2010 earnings call. In my remarks today, I'll discuss the financial highlights and the demand environment in the December quarter, provide some perspective on our industry outlook for calendar 2010",1064,"Thank you, Ed. Welcome to our second quarter fiscal year 2010 earnings call. In my remarks today, I'll discuss the financial highlights and the demand environment in the December quarter, provide some perspective on our industry outlook for calendar 2010 and provide guidance for the March quarter. Mart Dentinger will then take you to the details of the December quarter results, and we'll conclude with your questions. Let's get started.We're pleased with the company's second quarter performance. A combination of strengthening industry dynamics, strong demand for new products and good execution contributed to solid results for KLA-Tencor. Second quarter revenue was $440 million, an increase of 28% compared with September. Non-GAAP net income was $49 million, up 88% sequentially. And non-GAAP net income per share, including stock-based compensation but excluding some one-time charges, was $0.28 in the quarter. In addition to strong revenue growth and profit performance, we also generated $164 million in operating cash flow in the period, and our cash position grew to $1.5 billion at quarter end. So by any of these measures, a very good result for KLA-Tencor in the December quarter. As we look into calendar 2010, we see the semiconductor equipment marketplace on solid footing and progressing steadily in what analysts project to be a healthy cyclical recovery for the industry. This is driven by solid IC growth and a favorable supply-demand balance and high fab utilization.  Current consensus for the semiconductor revenue percentage growth in the mid-teens range in 2010, and the market analysts are forecasting capital expenditure to increase in the range of 50% to 60% for the year with investment focused primarily on advanced technology development. We expect process control will be a key enabler to our customer success in this period of technology-focused capital investment. This is because our customers execute their investment strategies to drive down costs and achieve better device performance. Each successive generation in new technology is characterized by increased process complexity, shorter market windows and more challenging yield requirements. Process controls on the critical path for successful management of these complex technical challenges, enabling our customers to quickly ramp new processes, get them into production and then maintain high yields in order to cost efficiencies and meet their time-to-market goals. As the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is positioned to benefit from higher option of inspection and measurement and to achieve our goal of growth in excess of the industry.Now turning to some specific of KLA-Tencor's performance, gross bookings in Q2 were $516 million, an increase of 5% compared with September. And we delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of order growth off our December 2008 low. Demand was characterized by sustained high levels of investment from foundry, increasing strength in memory and continued technology investment in logic. Orders were focused primarily on advanced technology development, with some capacity investment at the advanced nodes. Foundries were 59% of system orders in Q2. The continued challenges in achieving 4X-nm yield targets, increased demand from fabless customers and heightened competition are driving foundry capital intensity to levels not seen in recent years. We expect this trend to continue and to benefit KLA-Tencor as our foundry customers are typically high doctors of process control. With market leaders forecasting higher levels of capital spending in calendar 2010, it appears the investment cycle in foundry is poised to continue.Memory grew sequentially in the December quarter to 17% of orders and our near-term forecast show memory orders on an upward trajectory, with demand primarily focused on technology buys. Memory customers are facing increased technical challenges as they develop advanced technologies such as DDR3 for DRAM and 3X-nm in NAND. The increased complexity associated with introducing new architectures and materials in advanced memory devices is driving more inspection of metrology steps in the manufacturing process. We believe memory customers are progressing along the same path as did the foundries early in the development stage of 4X-nm. We anticipate as memory customers ramp their processes over the next few quarters, they too will encounter additional yield challenges, driving an increased need for inspection and measurement to ramp their yields to meet tight market windows leading to additional business for KLA-Tencor. Logic was up sequentially in Q2 to 24% of bookings as this market continues to ramp 3X-nm technology. We look ahead to 2010 with a great deal of excitement. We have new products in place, addressing both our core semiconductor and emerging markets such as the High-Brightness LED market. We're well positioned with our customers, and our adoption story is playing out very well in the early stages of this cycle. Our expectation is for process control adoption to continue to grow as customers in each of our semiconductor end market face the increasing challenges of bleeding edge.From a business model perspective, our relentless focus on operational excellence continues to differentiate KLA-Tencor and provides resources to fuel our investments and growth. With the benefit of the actions we've taken throughout the past several years, in particular in response to the recent industry downturn and world economic crisis, we're positioned to deliver higher profitability than we have at comparable revenue levels in the past. Driving improved operational leverage remains a key focus of the management team, and we're committed to translating our strong business returns and the increased shareholder value as we progress through the growth stage of the cycle.Now I'd like to give my perspective on guidance for the March quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the prevailing view for the calendar 2010 is for the semiconductor equipment demand to grow in the range of 50% to 60%, driven largely by catch-up technology spending for memory customers after a period of underinvestment and continued high capital intensity in foundry. In addition, with spending primarily focus on advancing Moore's law and the increased technical complexity at the advanced nodes, driving new yield challenges and resulting in higher adoption of process control, we see 2010 shaping up to be a very strong year for our industry and for KLA-Tencor. In terms of our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, we expect orders in March to be flat to up 20% compared with December. Revenues are expected to be between $450 million and $480 million with non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.31 to $0.37. I'll now turn the call over to Mark for his comments. Mark?"
282225,84157157,47870,"KLA-Tencor Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jan-28-2010",2010-01-28,"Earnings Calls","KLA Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rick.

As a reminder, we've presented our income statement in two formats, one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, expenses associated with our stock options-related litigation and certain cost and expenses which we do not expect to be recurring such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will reference our non-GAAP income statement, but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website.Revenue for Q2 was $440 million, slightly towards the high end of our guided range of $420 million to $450 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.28. Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.13. A summary of the differences between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are as follows: Acquisition-related charges of $8 million before taxes or $0.03 per share after taxes; restructuring and severance charges of $40 million before taxes or $0.05 per share after taxes; stock option litigation expenses of $7 million pre-tax or $0.02 per share after taxes. We also recorded a non-cash tax charge of about $9 million associated with the cumulative shortfall position in our employee stock activity. Removing this charge from GAAP earnings added $0.05 per share to non-GAAP EPS. The recent improvement in order activity continued in Q2 with foundry orders generating the largest portion of new business. New orders for Q2 were $516 million, an increase of 5% over Q1 new orders. We also scheduled in about $33 million of orders received in prior quarters, resulting in net orders of $549 million, up about 15% from Q1. To clarify the new versus net order phenomenon, over orders tend to be delayed or scheduled out of our 12-month delivery window during downturns, resulting in new orders that exceed net. Conversely, older orders tend to be scheduled in during upturns, and as a result, net will exceed new. We added over $110 million to our backlog in Q2 and ended the quarter with $759 million in total systems backlog. The backlog at December 31 included $245 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue and $514 million in systems orders that have not yet shipped. Most of the backlog typically ships over the following six months.The regional distribution of new systems orders in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows: U.S. was 16% of new system orders in Q2, up from 13% in the September quarter; Europe was 4% of new systems orders, up from 3% in Q1; Japan was 14%, up from 9% last quarter; Korea was 19%, up from 6% last quarter; Taiwan was 33%, down from 51% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 14%, down from 18%, Q1. The Q2 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows: Wafer inspection was 42%, up from 32% last quarter; Reticle inspection was 15%, down from 22% last quarter; metrology was 13%, down from 17% in the prior quarter; and solar storage High-Brightness LED and other non-semi was 6% compared with 7% last quarter; services was 24% of new orders in Q2, up from 22% last quarter.Foundry customers comprised 59% of semiconductor systems orders in Q2 versus 76% in Q1. Logic and memory orders were 24% and 17% in Q2 versus 11% and 13% in Q1, respectively. Technology purchases generated most of the activity this quarter with 45-nm and below developed pilot activity, comprising 95% of the semiconductor systems orders, the same percentage we experienced in Q1. Looking forward, we are assuming new orders in Q2 will be within a range of flat to up to 20% from Q2. Shipments in Q2, which include both system shipments and services revenue, were $459 million, up 20% from $383 million last quarter.Systems revenue for Q2 was up 38% to $315 million versus $229 million in Q1. Services revenue was $125 million in Q2, up 11% from $113 million in Q1. Our expectations for total revenue in Q3 is a range between $450 million and $480 million, and we expect services to contribute a little less than 30% of the total.Non-GAAP gross margin was 55% in December, up three percentage points from September. The improved margin percentage in Q2 was consistent with our stated margin leverage targets, and we expect the gross margin percentage will continue to improve in Q3 as well.Operating expenses were $164 million, an increase of $11 million from the September quarter. R&D was $82 million, a $4 million increase from Q1. Selling, general and administrative expenses or SG&A were also $82 million this quarter, a $7 million increase from last quarter. Primary reasons for the operating expense increase was a higher accrual rate for variable pay based upon our updated full-year projections for operating profit. These higher accruals resulted in $8 million in additional operating expenses this quarter. Without the additional accruals, operating expenses would've been about $156 million or up $3 million versus Q1.Other income and expense or OIE was a net $9 million expense in Q2 or approximately $17 million lower than our Q1 net credit of $8 million. The Q1 net credit largely resulted from a non-recurring $16 million gain from reversing a consumption tax contingency. Without this credit, Q1 OIE would've been a net expense of about $8 million. In Q3, we expect the OIE to be a net expense of approximately $8 million to $10 million. In Q2, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $18 million or 27% of pre-tax income versus $6 million in Q1 or 17% of pre-tax income. The rate increase in Q2 was largely because we had non-taxable investment gains in our deferred compensation plan in Q1. Our GAAP tax percentage rose considerably from Q1 as a result of a non-cash component that added $9 million in additional tax expense in Q2. This additional expense results from how accounting rules are applied to cumulative shortfalls in our employee stock activity and will be more fully described in our 10-Q for this quarter. Because this expense is non-cash, non-predictable and materializes only when a company is in a accumulative shortfall position, we removed it in preparing our non-GAAP statements.Non-GAAP net income was $49 million or $0.28 per share in Q2. These numbers include pre-tax stock-based compensation expenses of $21 million. At our model tax rate of 30%, our Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.27. At the revenue range I previously mentioned, we would expect our Q3 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.31 and $0.37 per share, assuming a tax rate of 30%. The weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q2 were $173.8 million versus $173 million in Q1. For the March quarter, our average share count should be approximately 175 million, assuming we do not repurchase shares. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $1.5 billion, an increase of $135 million quarter to quarter. Cash generated from operations was $164 million in Q2 and included a U.S. federal tax refund of about $72 million. Excluding the tax refund, our cash flow from operations would've been about $92 million in Q2 compared with $73 million in Q1. In Q3, our cash flow from operations will likely decrease because we won't be receiving a tax refund.Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $298 million, up from $244 million at September 30, mostly because of higher shipments. DSOs were 62 days at December 31 versus 66 days at the end of September. Net inventories increased by $5 million from last quarter and ended the quarter at $352 million, but inventory turnover, based upon GAAP cost of revenues, improved from 1.9 turns last quarter to 2.4 turns this quarter because of higher volumes. Net capital expenditures were $11 million in Q2 versus $4 million in Q1, a significant portion of the Q2 capital spending increased related to our Bay Area campus consolidation projects. Total headcount for the quarter ended at 4,850, no change from September 30. We expect our headcount will remain relatively flat during Q3. With today's report, hopefully we have closed the book on a tough two-year period. We saw the cap equipment industry experience significant double-digit percentage declines in both 2008 and 2009. Although business improved steadily in 2009 and we are optimistic about our prospects for calendar in 2010, we will continue to manage the business prudently based upon the adjustments we have made during the last 18 months, and we expect our financial performance will continue to reflect the improved leverage in our model. In summary, our guidance for Q3 is: New orders are expected to be flat to plus 20% versus Q2; total revenue between $450 million and $480 million; non-GAAP earnings per share will be $0.31 to $0.37, assuming a tax rate of 30% of the pre-tax income. This concludes our prepared remarks in the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A."

And I think that their first inclination in those situations was to ramp up starts and get some process equipment in. But they didn't really got to work on yield. We know that the native yield before people can do repair is very low on the advanced devices. But you can make up for that with repair but it's not long term which you really want to be doing in process. So all the conversations, all the discussions we're having with our customers lead us to believe that there's a very high likelihood that we're going to see increased demand as we go forward in enabling our customers to get native yields up, and ultimately, to get their costs down over time. In terms of the NAND, the complexion, NAND was about 25% of the memory orders and memory is only about 17% of what we saw in the December quarter, and we anticipate those going to about 35% in the March quarter and we see memory up to probably about 35% of our overall business. So we see 1/3 of the 1/3 being left to NAND, so not huge levels of investments yet in NAND and DRAM peaking up before NAND does."

So it will become a smaller percent of our overall business as our business is going up. So we think foundry continues to invest at similar levels. There's some pretty big foundry projects that are not currently being booked because they are out their ways in terms of getting facilities ready. So while there could be near-term lulls in that, the largest foundry player is committed to increasing CapEx, we see other players having to follow. And the demand position, along with competitive pressures, are driving those guys. So we think that it should be a pretty robust year for foundry throughout the year, but you could always -- it's very hard smoothing function on this to predict exactly quarter by quarter, but we anticipate in the calendar year that foundry will be strong throughout 2010."

I mean, I think, that with every sequential generation for memory, they start off with lower yields and they have to compensate through repair. And that's certainly the understanding that we have. So the native yield right out is rather low. And as we see it, that's not really different. It's gotten more difficult, I think, for our customers but it doesn't keep them from shipping and it actually doesn't even keep them from yielding. What it does is keep them from being as cost effective as they want to be. So what we play a part in is improving that overall native yield. And sometimes that results in them having to ship a lower-density device off the same ship because of the yield concerns. So we are seeing a lot of pressure. Without going in a specific customer details, you can imagine what's driving it. The NAND guys are driving the most advanced design roles, as you know, and the memory guys have a lot of concerns about the overall process integration. So we are seeing that pressure right now for many of our customers and are working closely with them to serve it. We're also engaged heavily in the R&D, but also trying to help them in production work through those problems. But I'd say increased problems and they do have a way to compensate, but it's harder for them. At the beginning of a ramp, they just want to get wafers out and they want to get chips out. So I think they're more prone to start more wafers than a foundry might be."

That said, you could imagine there's tremendous amount of work going on to close those gaps, to not miss those shipments and to be in a position to support our customers. So from our standpoint, our materials people, our manufacturings people are working really hard and doing a great job of closing those gaps so we can meet those customer demands. But there's no question that when you whipsaw an industry they way this one has been whipsawed, you're going to run into some of those constrains. Fortunately, I think throughout the cycle we stayed very close with our key suppliers, worked closely with them to be in a position to anticipate ramping up and we continue to do that.

So I think that gives us probably, naturally, a bit more visibility into what's going on with our customer base. That's why I think if you look back at the ramp, we've been pretty consistently doing what we thought we would do relative to this ramp. So I would say from that perspective, our visibility is better, actually, than it's been quite a while. A year ago, I understand we have no visibility in anything.

We have an unresolved stock option litigation exercise, which we're hoping comes to an end at some point in the future, but that's very difficult to predict. And as long as that's out there, we're adopting the industry convention and sweeping that out. Obviously, that's one where it will not be ongoing in the long term run on the model, but it's hard to say when it gets cut off short term. The second sort of batch of GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments goes with acquisition premiums. Typically, those are intangible assets that we acquire along with the acquisitions. They get amortized over three to five years, so if you don't do an acquisition for three to five years after about a five-year period, you will see those things essentially fade away. The third category is something that is completely out of the normal operating per-view of the company or just a one-time settlement, something like that. Those are a little bit difficult to predict. In terms of restructuring charges, which we did have a small amount this quarter, we're pretty much near the end of that, presuming we don't have a big course correction with the worldwide economic situation in 2010. The latest restructuring charge had to do with the campus consolidation from us moving out of our former San Jose facility over to Millipede. That is now done, so we don't anticipate anything there. The final category, which I won't bore you with, has to do with the tax treatment of employee stock grants and that is that we're an unusual, meaning that not many other companies are in it, where we're in an excess shortfall position cumulatively. And we're you're in that position, the tax impact, if it exceeds the book impact of employee stock charges, actually winds up running through your tax expense of line instead of your equity. That will go back and forth between quarters. Most companies are not in the excess shortfall position so they basically take all those charges through equity. We are doing that sometimes in the quarters in which we're taking it through the tax expense line. We are actually scheduling those out. So the short answer to your question is, the non-recurring stuff that comes out of the blue that's hard to see should be in frequent. The other areas where we are seeing some consistency hopefully fade in the relatively, let's call it the intermediate-term. It won't be next quarter."

And I'll just give you a perspective. We did see wafer increase in the December quarter to 42%, metrology is down slightly as wafer picked up to 13% and radical went from 21% to 15%. And service crept up to 24%.  There is a lot of opportunity in metrology and as we go forward, we do see a lot of opportunities, but that's another case where we just got to be in a position to capitalize on it. So some of it is a matter of us executing on our products and demonstrating that to our customers. So we think there's a lot of opportunity. That said, I would say right now, there's probably more opportunity in the yield challenges that our customers face. So I don't know that we're going to see metrology increase as a percentage given the enormous opportunities there are in wafer inspection. But there's definitely growth potential in metrology and we're, I think, well-positioned to build on that as we go forward. Radical is kind of an interesting story. That's a lumpier business because of the nature of the products that we have, and I think that we'll continue to see strength in radical but it will continue to be lumpy just by the nature of the ASPs and the relative small number of units that we sell in radical. And service, while we've seen healthy service growth in an environment where CapEx is growing faster, service ends up becoming a smaller percentage of the business. In an environment where CapEx is growing slower, service becomes a larger percent. Does that answer your question?"

We are pleased with the company's performance in the March quarter, and as a result show KLA-Tencor successfully executing our strategic objectives in an improving industry environment. The new orders in March were $649 million, an increase of 26% compared with December, and above our range of guidance, a result of better than expected demand in our core markets and increased bookings from new markets.
Third quarter revenue was $478 million, which was at the high end of guidance. With the combination of new product revenue and solid operations execution, we delivered strong margin performance in the quarter and non-GAAP EPS came in above the range of guidance at $0.41.
We also grew our cash and investments to approximately $1.6 billion by quarter end, while repurchasing 2 million shares of common stock in the period. These numbers demonstrate the effectiveness of strategies we have been implementing since 2006 to extend our leadership in process control, access new growth markets and drive operational excellence. Mark will provide some greater detail on the much quarter in his comments that follows.
Looking forward, we are very excited about the opportunity for more good news to come. Given the healthy investment cycle and the continued strong execution by the teams, we believe KLA-Tencor is positioned to deliver top line growth and profitability performance that will rival prior peaks of the company.
I'd like to give you some perspective on how we aim to achieve this as it relates to our four strategic objectives. Our first strategic objective is customer focus. This really speaks to how we collaborate with our customers, how we drive innovation, and how we execute our product strategy. And we measure success and customer focus in terms of our market position, where our goal is to lead every market we serve.
Today, we are the leader in nearly every one of our end markets, and our position in our core inspection and measurement markets remain strong as ever with our new bright field, dark field and radical inspection products enjoying strong acceptance in the marketplace.
On top of continued strength in the core, we are making advances in markets where we have not traditionally been a leader. One example is the recent success of our new e-beam review tool, the eDR-5210. Our penetration in e-beam review markets strengthens our overall market position and helps drive adoption in the process control markets.
By collaborating to anticipate our customers’ needs and executing, we are able to deliver the best tools for the market at the right time, which helps our customers maximize their ROI, and serves as an integral part of their business success.
Our second strategic objective is growth. Our objective here is to drive growth over time in excess of the market, driven by increased process control adoption, diversification into new markets, and continued expansion of our services business.
Regarding adoption, we see technical complexity at the leading edge driving an increasing need for process control. The industry research shows that adoption continues to be the peak in this cycle, and as the market leader we anticipate seeing our share of growth contributing to our top line.
We also see our acquisition strategy now making an impact. Our approach for growth in new markets is to focus on extending KLA-Tencor’s technology and market leadership in to adjacent industries. We believe recent acquisitions have increased our available market by about 20%, adding new revenue opportunities to our business.
Finally, we see services becoming increasingly more important as our installed base grows. Successful execution in our service business is first and foremost, defined by addressing our customers’ needs. We have over 22,000 tools in the field today. As the complexity of our tools increases and the breath of our services offerings continue to grow, the services we provide make an even better contribution to our customer success.
When we evaluate our progress in our growth objectives, the data indicates we are successfully delivering on our targets. For example, the estimates show that those WFE, wafer front end expense recovering in 2010 to 20% to 30% of 2006 levels, which is when we first launched these strategies. We believe the success in our growth strategies and increased adoption in new markets has enabled KLA-Tencor to outperform this expected recovery in WFE.
Our focus on diversification also helps buffer declines in a downturn. For example, when we look at calendar 2009, when WFE investments declined 46%, our revenue was down 35% in the year. Looking ahead in the cycle and beyond, we believe the continued strong execution in our growth objectives will fuel top line performance that could rival the prior peaks for KLA-Tencor.
Our third objective is operational excellence. Successful execution here not only enables the resources to return value to shareholders, but also helps fuel investment in growth and innovation, which of course would drive future profitability. Execution in our operations focus is about decisively and effectively taking action to adjust to changing industry conditions, which we demonstrated in the recent downturn.
Ongoing efforts related to this objective include our move to Singapore manufacturing, platform consolidation and programs, which are focused on streamlining our operations and supply chain. The March results showed our operational excellence focus bearing fruit, as evidenced by strong margin performance in the quarter, which exceeded our targets of 60% to 70% for incremental gross margins, and our targets for 50% to 60% for incremental operating margins.
Long-term comparisons also demonstrate the strong leverage effect enabled in our model. Today we are supporting business levels that are not far from calendar year 2006, but on an operating cost structure that is 15% below 2006 levels.
KLA-Tencor features a flexible business model that response well both in good times and bad. This is not by accident, but it is direct result of our market leadership and a continuing commitment to drive improved efficiencies in our global operations.
And our fourth objective is talent. People are the key to our success at KLA-Tencor. Our recent accomplishments as well as our ability to achieve our future goals are only possible with the dedicated commitment of everyone in our workforce. So in conclusion, the March quarter results reflect a healthy demand environment, and shows the company is performing at a high level.
We are well positioned with our customers with new products in the marketplace, our growth strategies are delivering results, and we're delivering increased leverage in our business model. We have great deal of optimism as we look forward. We think we are well positioned for even stronger results as we move through the cycle.
Turning now to our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, we expect this momentum to continue with gross bookings in June projected up 5% to 25% compared with March, revenue expected in the range of $530 million to $570 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.54 to $0.62.
With that I will turn the call over to Mark for his review of the numbers. Mark.

282225,100702902,58524,"KLA-Tencor Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","KLA Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rick. As most of you know, we present our income statement in two formats. One under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes acquisition and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, expenses associated wi",1605,"Thanks, Rick. As most of you know, we present our income statement in two formats. One under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes acquisition and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, expenses associated with our stock options related litigation and certain cost and expenses which are outside of our core operations, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items.
Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will reference our non-GAAP income statement, but where I reference GAAP numbers will make the distinction. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our web site.
Revenue for Q3 was $478 million at the high end of our guided range of $450 to $480 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.41. Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.33. A summary of the differences between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are as follows. Acquisition-related charges of $8 million before taxes or $0.03 per share after taxes, restructuring and severance charges of $4 million before taxes or $0.01 per share after taxes, and stock option litigation expenses of $5 million pretax or $0.02 per share after taxes.
We also recorded a non-cash tax charge of about $3 million associated with the cumulative shortfall position in our employee stock activity. Removing this charge from GAAP earnings added $0.02 per share to non-GAAP earnings. The recent improvement in order activity continued in Q3.
New orders for the March quarter were $649 million, an increase of 26% over Q2 new orders of $516 million. We also scheduled in about $10 million of orders received in prior quarters resulting in net orders of $659 million, up about 20% from Q2. We added $180 million to our backlog in Q3, and ended the quarter with $939 million in total systems backlog.
The backlog at March 31 included $280 million of revenue backlog, for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue, and $659 million in system orders that have not yet shipped. Most of the backlog typically ships over the following six months.
The regional distribution of new systems orders in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows, the U.S. was 23% of new system orders in Q3, up from 16% in the December quarter; Europe was 3% of new systems orders, down from 4% in Q2; Japan was 10%, down from 14% last quarter; Korea was 15%, down from 19% last quarter; Taiwan was 39%, up from 33% last quarter and the rest of Asia was 9%, down from 14% in Q2.
The Q3 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows: wafer inspection was 48%, up from 42% last quarter. Radical inspection was 15%, even with last quarter, metrology was 10%, down from 13% in the prior quarter and solar storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was 8% compared to 6% last quarter.
Services was 19% of new orders in Q3, down from 24% last quarter. Foundry customers comprised 50% of the semiconductor systems orders in Q3 versus 59% in Q2. Logic customers were 13% of systems orders in Q3 versus 24% in Q2, and memory system orders rose to 37% in Q3 compared with 17% in Q2. Technology purchases generated most of the activity this quarter, with 45-nanometer and below development pilot activity, comprising 93% of the semiconductor systems orders, versus 95% in Q2. Orders for 32-nanometer and below were 43% of semiconductor orders received in the quarter.
Looking forward, we expect that new orders in Q4 will increase between 5% and 25% over Q3 new orders for a range of about $680 million to $810 million. Shipments in Q3, which include both systems shipments and services revenue, were $515 million, up 12% from $459 million last quarter.
Systems revenue for Q3 was up 11% to $350 million compared with $315 million in Q2. Services revenue was $128 million in Q3, up 2% from $125 million in Q2. Our expectations for total revenue in Q4 is a range between $530 and $570 million, and we expect services to contribute about 25% of the total.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 58% in the March quarter, up three percentage points from December. The improved gross margin percentage in Q3 was better than our incremental target of 60% to 70%, because of favorable product mix and lower excess and obsolete reserve requirements. For Q4, we are modeling an incremental gross margin target roughly equal to our stated goal of 60% to 70%.
Operating expenses were $167 million, an increase of $3 million from the December quarter. R&D was $84 million, a $2 million increase from Q2. Selling, general and administrative expenses or SG&A were $83 million this quarter, up $1 million from last quarter.
The primary reason for the operating expense increase was a higher accrual rate for variable pay based upon our updated full-year projections for operating profit. These higher accruals resulted in about $4 million in additional operating expenses this quarter. Without the additional accruals, operating expenses would have been about $163 million or down $1 million versus Q2.
Other income and expense or OIE was a net $11 million expense in Q3 or approximately $2 million higher than the $9 million we recorded in Q2. The Q3 increase in OIE was essentially attributable to a write-down of two investments in our KT Ventures portfolio.
In Q4, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $9 to $10 million. In Q3, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $27 million or 27% of pretax income versus $18 million in Q2, which was also 27% of pretax income.
Our GAAP tax rate in Q3 was 29%, down considerably from 43% in Q2, mostly because of lower non-cash charges resulting from how accounting rules are applied to cumulative shortfalls in our employee stock activity.
Non-GAAP net income was $71 million or $0.41 per share in Q3. These numbers include pretax stock-based compensation expenses of $21 million.
And our model tax rate of 30%, our Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.39. At the revenue range I previously mentioned, we would expect our Q4 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.54 and $0.62 per share, assuming a tax rate of 30%.
The weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q3 were $173.4 million versus $173.8 million in Q2. During Q3, we also started our stock repurchase program, and spent $55 million buying back about 2 million shares. As of March 31, we had 7.8 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization, and we anticipate some repurchase activity in the June quarter. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of 172 million for Q4.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at about $1.6 billion, about even with the prior quarter end.
Cash generated from operations was $128 million in Q3 compared with 164 million in Q2, which included a tax refund of $72 million.
Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $323 million, up from $298 million at December 31, mostly because of higher shipments. DSOs were 61 days at March 31 versus 62 days at the end of December. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factors.
Net inventories increased by $22 million from last quarter and ended the quarter at $374 million, inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.3 turns in Q3, down slightly from 2.4 turns last quarter.
Net capital expenditures were $10 million in Q3 versus $11 million in Q2. Total headcount ended the quarter at 4,873, up slightly from 4850 at December 31. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q4, especially in our manufacturing locations as we adjust our capacity in response to the recent demand increase.
During Q3, we entered into a proposed settlement of the Federal derivative shareholder suit stemming from our historical stock option granting practices, and we reached proposed settlements with two former KLA executives, which will resolve their claims against us. The proposed settlement is scheduled to be heard for final approval on May 24. When the settlements are approved by the court, they will result in KLA making cash payments of approximately $27 million, and issuing about $8 million in KLA stock.
We also expect to receive cash proceeds of about $33 million, mostly from our insurance carriers as a result of resolving these matters. While we can't predict the exact timing of the payments and receipts associated with these settlements until they become effective, resolution of these matters should significantly reduce or eliminate KLA’s ongoing cost of the stock option related litigation after Q4.
Overall, we're very happy with how Q3 unfolded. Net systems orders were the best we have seen in 11 quarters. The increased production volumes have allowed us to take advantage of the lower cost manufacturing location moves we have made over the last three years, and we are very happy at the prospect of getting most of the options related litigation behind us.
In summary, our guidance for Q4 is new orders are expected to increase by 5% to 25% over Q3 new orders, total revenue between $530 million and $570 million, non-GAAP earnings per share will be $0.54 to $0.62 assuming a tax rate of 30% of the pretax income. This concludes our prepared remarks in the quarter.
I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A.

The answer is we are probably getting as much as we had originally expected out of the moves to Singapore and our lower cost manufacturing locations. We are not completely at full capacity yet, but we are certainly starting to get there, and that is part of the contribution. I also noted in my prepared remarks that we are getting some benefit from the mix of very high margin products in the performance that we just posted for this quarter. And we still think that our long-term trajectory from here is 60 to 70 incremental points of margin improvement with each additional dollar of revenue.
So most of what we have done in terms of preparing for this upturn is coming to pass in terms of our cost savings, and I would say that we're putting a lot of operational focus on just making sure that we are running as lean an operation as possible. So all of that has turned in our favor, and we are seeing the benefits in the line. I would say we are still on our long-term growth trajectory of 60 to 70 incremental gross margin target.

You know, if you sort of do some run rate work and you look at the bookings and the shipments, we are pretty much within a very close shouting distance of what the peak was last cycle on kind of a run rate basis for wafer fab equipment, certainly for some types of equipment.
So I'm sort of wondering what you think in terms of what the environment holds from kind of back half versus front half. I think most companies would have thought that there was a pull-back in the back half, but I guess recently some companies have been a bit more positive about the back half.

And so we actually think there is more opportunity, and we talk to a lot of customers about new projects. So even if the core semi stuff cools off, we think we have got the ability to continue to grow, and as you are seeing in our operational performance, gross margin and bottom-line, it is not dilutive to our model. In fact, what we see is we are putting up better numbers than we did at the same point in the cycle. So I think we are not the same as the other players in this space.

So, you know, a year ago we would have said it was pretty isolated, and now it is much broader. So there is a bit of a challenge out there for multiple companies and multiple fabs to execute on 40.
The other thing you see is when they are hitting defect densities, you look at the volume and it is pretty small. So what we are talking about is a relatively early part of the manufacturing ramp on the advance design rules and a recognition that in order to maintain those defect densities as they ramp, they got to have more coverage from inspection and measurement.
So I like to think of that we are helping contribute to the fact that people are driving down their densities. They are seeing the value and they will expand out as they ramp on those nodes. Because many of the tool sets out there just weren’t capable of handling broad-based 40 nm production.

Given that we provided the comprehensive strategic update just two weeks ago at SEMICON West, I'll focus my commentary today on summary highlights of our results and provide guidance for September. Then Mark will follow with a more detailed review of the financials.
Today's numbers demonstrate the KLA-Tencor's market leadership is as strong as ever and the company is executing at a high level delivering exceptional growth in financial performance against the backdrop of a very robust industry environment.
Bookings for the June quarter were $956 million, an increase of 47% compared with March and above our original range of guidance.
During the quarter we saw broad based strength in each of our major end markets, geographies and products including record quarterly bookings and our Reticle and wafer inspection businesses.
Revenues in June grew 17% to $559 million coming in above the midpoint of the range of guidance and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.70 in Q4, significantly above the original guidance range of $0.54 to $0.62 per share.
The growth we are experiencing in the marketplace today is driven in part by strong adoption of profit control in our core semiconductor markets and increase in contribution from new markets and a healthy services business.
And underlying our strong profitability performance in the June quarter our non-GAAP gross margins of 60% and non-GAAP operating margins of 31%, both record results for KLA-Tencor illustrating continued success in our operations excellence focus.
The healthy profitability and cash generating power enabled our business helped fuel a high level of investment in R&D to enable our customer focus and growth strategies while also providing resources for the company to deliver significant cash returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
To that end, KLA-Tencor generated approximately $448 million in cash flow from operations in fiscal year 2010. And we were active in returning value to shareholders, repurchasing over $136 million in common stock and paying cash dividends of approximately $102 million in the year. Additionally, on July 13th we announced that our Board of Directors has authorized an increase in the level of the company's quarterly dividends, $0.25 per share.
This move reflects management and the Board's confidence in our long term outlook for the company as well as the ongoing efforts to reward our shareholders for their continued investment.
Looking ahead, end market demand is expected to remain strong as our customers' businesses continue to grow at a healthy pace.
Average third-party forecasts show semiconductor revenues projected to be up 28% in calendar 2010 with growth also forecasted for 2011. Plants are running today at high utilization levels and our customers are rapidly migrating to new more complex technologies and investing to improve yields and lower costs. All while operating under tremendous competitive and time to market pressures.
In this environment the outlook for profit, controlled investment remains excellent.
KLA-Tencor's market leadership and customer focus, the breadth of our technologies and our ongoing operations excellence position the company to capitalize on this robust industry growth and to continue to deliver strong financial performance as we progress through the cycle. Of course, the driving force behind our success is our strong support and collaboration of our customers and business partners as well as the great execution of our worldwide workforce.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank each of our employees for their contributions in helping KLA-Tencor continue to excel and in shaping our future success.
Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we see continued strong demand across all major end markets with sustained strength from foundry and memory and solid logic demand. Gross bookings in September are projected to be in the range of 750 to $900 million. We also expect continued strong revenue growth and margin performance with September revenue expected to be in the range of $620 million to $660 million and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.80 to $0.88.
With that I'll turn the call over to Mark Dentinger for his review of the numbers. Mark?

As most of you know, we present our income statement in two formats, one under US GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, expenses associated with",1370,"Thanks, Rick. As most of you know, we present our income statement in two formats, one under US GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, expenses associated with our stock options-related litigation and certain costs and expenses which are outside of our core operations, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only.
Most of my prepared remarks in operations will refer to non-GAAP information, but where I reference GAAP numbers I'll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website.
The summary of the differences between this quarter's GAAP to non-GAAP numbers are as follows.
Acquisition-related charges of $8 million before taxes or $0.03 cents per share after taxes, restructuring and severance charges of $3 million before taxes or $0.01 cent per share after taxes and a stock option litigation credit of $1 million pre-tax which had no after tax effect on EPS.
Revenue for Q4 was $559 million towards the high end of our guided range of 530 to 570 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.70, Q4 GAAP EPS was $0.66.
By almost all measures Q4 was strong and the new order total of $956 million easily eclipsed our prior peak of 824 million.
Net orders were approximately $955 million as virtually none of our customers pulled in or scheduled out orders we had processed in prior quarters.
We added almost $400 million to our backlog in Q4 and ended the quarter with 1.34 billion in total systems backlog. The backlog at June 30th included $343 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue and $992 million in system orders that have not yet shipped. The reasonable distribution of new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows.
The US was 25% of new systems orders in Q4, up from 23% in the March quarter. Europe was 12% of new systems orders, up from 3% in Q3. Japan was 12%, up from 10% last quarter; Korea was 19% up from 16% last quarter. Taiwan was 18%, down from 39% last quarter and the Rest of Asia was 14% up from 9% in Q3.
The Q4 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family in the quarter to quarter change in distribution was as follows. Wafer inspection was 48%, even with last quarter. Reticle inspection was 19%, up from 15% last quarter. Metrology was 14% up from 10% in the prior quarter, solar, storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was 6% down from 8% last quarter and services was 13% of new orders in Q4, down from 19% last quarter.
Foundry customers comprised 41% of semiconductor systems orders in Q4 versus 50% in Q3. Logic customers were 21% of systems orders in Q4 versus 13% in Q3 and memory systems orders rose slightly to 38% in Q4 compared to 37% in Q3. Orders for 32-nanometer and below technology were 41% of the semiconductor orders received in the quarter.
Looking forward we expect that new orders for our fiscal Q1 will be in range of 750 to 900 million.
Shipments for Q4 which include both system shipments and services revenue were $622 million, up 21% from $515 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q4 was up 23% to 430 million compared with 350 million in Q3. Services revenue was 129 million in Q4, essentially even with Q3. Our expectations for total revenue in Q1 is a range of 620 to $660 million.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 60% in the June quarter, up two percentage points from March. The improved gross margin percentage in Q4 was better than our incremental target of 60 to 70% largely because of favorable mix between products and services contributions as well as lower excess in obsolete reserve requirements. For Q1 we are modeling an incremental gross margin target roughly equal to our stated goal of 60 to 70%.
Operating expenses were $166 million, essentially flat for the March quarter. However, a component of the Q3 to Q4 change in operating expenses was a $3 million reversal of bad debt expense we originally reported when Spansion declared bankruptcy in fiscal 2009. Spansion recently issued stock in its new US entity as partial consideration for what we were owed when they went bankrupt.
The Q3 to Q4 decrease in operating expenses from the Spansion recovery was mostly offset by increased expenses for variable compensation and additional materials consumption in our R&D activities.
Other income and expense or OIE was a net $11 million expense in Q4 about even with Q3. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $11 million in Q1. In Q4 our non-GAAP income tax expense was $41 million or 25% of pre-tax income versus $27 million in Q3 which is 27% of pre-tax income. The tax rate improvement in Q4 largely arose from change in distribution of earnings between the US and lower taxed international operations.
Non-GAAP net income was $120 million or $0.70 per share in Q4. If we exclude the Spansion recovery credit and apply our model tax rate of 30%. Our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.65. At the revenue range I previously mentioned we would expect our Q1 fiscal '11 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.80 and $0.88 per share assuming a tax rate of 30%.
Weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q4 were 171.3 million versus 173.4 million in Q3. During Q4 we spent $82 million repurchasing about 2.6 million shares and as of June 30th, we had 5.2 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We will continue repurchasing shares in the September quarter. For guidance purposes we are modeling an average share count of 170 million for Q1.
As announced at the SEMICON West analyst meeting we hosted in San Francisco two weeks ago, our Board of Directors has authorized a $0.10 share increase to our quarterly dividend bringing our total quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share. This increase is expected to take effect beginning with the dividend to be declared in August, 2010. The increase will have the affect of raising our cash outlay for dividends to about $43 million per quarter beginning Q1.
Turning to the balance sheet cash and investments ended the quarter at 1.5 billion about even with prior quarter end. Cash generated from operations was $83 million in Q4 compared with $128 million in Q3. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating cash flow largely resulted because we have $14 million more in tax payments in Q4 versus Q3 and we made a $26 million semiannual interest payment in Q4 versus Q3.
Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $440 million up from $323 million at March 31, largely resulting from the $107 million increase in shipments from Q3 to Q4.
DSOs were 72 days at June 30th versus 61 days at the end of March. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts in factoring. The increase in DSOs during Q4 was within our normal range of expectations in periods where business activity is rising quickly.
Net inventories increased by $28 million from March 31st and ended the quarter at 402 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.3 turns in Q4 approximately even with last quarter.
Net capital expenditures were $6 million in Q4 versus $10 million in Q3. Total headcount at June 30th was 4,989 up from 4,873 at March 31. We expect our headcount will increase slowly during Q1 especially in our manufacturing locations as we adjust or capacity in response to the recent demand increase.
In summary, our guidance for Q1 is new orders between 750 and $900 million, total revenue between 620 and $660 million and non-GAAP EPS between $0.80 and $0.88 assuming a tax rate of 30% of the pre-tax income.
This concludes our prepared remarks in the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A?

What's happening now is it's showing up in the form of these foundries and so I think that the growth in foundries has some legs to it based on the fact that there are more opportunities to pick up more orders from the people that are no longer building fabs and we really didn't see that in the past.
The other factor is from a capital intensity perspective, obviously KLA think what does very well when it comes to serving foundries because our products really support their particular business model extremely well. So we think it's a good story for foundries and a good story for KLA-Tencor.

The range guide - we try to put in what we think is reasonable. While it is true there's tightness out there, there is a lot of volatility and, of course, as I'm sure you know, we end up wanting to make sure that we optimize the business we have with our customers and so we don't want to tighten that range because you wouldn't want a particular customer to feel like they had additional leverage as to placing an order within the quarter. So we try to keep that range reflecting what we think as the normal volatility in the market. So I think that from that standpoint that kind of explains it.
And the second question was on metrology. We did see some increase in share. We also saw penetration of metrology associated with increasing capacity and metrology perhaps is more directly aligned to some of the capacity buys and, you know, we've definitely benefited from that growth.
Metrology is a market which has inherently a lot of growth because there's so many more materials that need to be measured and in the case of overlay there is a lots of litho challenges in the films may affect so that's why we think we saw that run up and we expect the metrology as a percent to actually see some more improvement as we go forward to September as a percent of our total order book.

So the question is I mean from an equipment point of view do you see a change in mindset that maybe the Tier 1 foundries are willing to run utilization at much lower levels, you know, maybe 80 to 85% on a normalized basis and kind of little bit lower utilization and settle on market share.

So there's more investment in newer technologies than perhaps in the last cycle.
In terms of the utilization rate, you would have to ask the foundries, but clearly some people believe there's a trade-off between utilization rate and cycle time and in a market where you're running for market share, lower utilization will enable you in some cases, in some cases to have faster cycle time and be more responsive to customers. Does that make sense?

Thank you all for joining us for our call today. I’m going to focus my commentary on the summary highlights for the September quarter and then provide guidance for December then Mark is going to follow with the review of the financials.
First of all, there is no storage of the bay today as to the pace of the global economic recovery or the near term direction in semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment market. So KLA-Tencor September results demonstrate the process control adoption remains at a very high level. Our numbers also show the company is successfully executing on our long-term strategic objectives, delivering sustained market leadership, strong revenue growth, record margins, record earnings per share in the quarter.
New bookings in the September quarter were $785 million that’s the third highest level in the company’s history. The high level of demand we’re experiencing today is driven by the combination of strong adoption in the core market and a healthy contribution from new markets in our services business.
Revenues grew 22% sequentially to $682 million significantly above the range of guidance and indicative of the high sense of urgency among our customers for getting our latest generation process control technologies qualified and in place. Non-GAAP earnings, was a record $0.99 per share in Q1, significantly above the guidance range of $0.80 to $0.88 per share. Underlying this outstanding financial performance in Q1, were record non-GAAP gross margins of 62% and record non-GAAP operating margins of 36%.
With incremental margins coming in above our 60 to 70% target for gross margin and our 50 to 60% target for operating margins. And we ended the quarter with the $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $1.4 billion in backlog.
Now in response to the high levels of demand we’ve been experiencing lately, we’re focused on driving our operations to meet customer requirements and we are positioned for continued growth in shipments, revenue and earnings as we move forward. Our strong financial performance as a result of KLA-Tencor’s technology and market leadership and it demonstrates the value our technology and services deliver in helping our customers execute their leading edge technology roadmaps.
And also helps us sustain a high level of R&D which is essential to achieve our customer focus and growth strategies and provides the resources for us to deliver significant cash returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
To that end, KLA-Tencor repurchased approximately 2 million shares of our common stock for approximately $62 million and paid cash dividends of approximately $42 million in the quarter. As you may recall, on July 13, we announced that our board of directors authorized an increase in the level the quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share which took effect with our first quarter dividend. That move reflects management and the board’s confidence in the long-term outlook for the company as well as the ongoing efforts to reward our shareholders for their continued investment.
Turning now on to some specifics of the demand picture, gross bookings in Q1 were $785 million the third highest on record for KLA-Tencor but below the midpoint of the range of guidance for the quarter. The first quarter end market picture was highlighted by a sustained strong demand from foundries coming in at 44% of new orders in the September quarter. Our foundry customers are operating at high levels of capital intensity as they expand capacity to address the heightened competitive environment and increased business levels driven by rapid proliferation of new fabulous designs.
Looking at the memory market, bookings for memory customers were 38% of the total in Q1. Well DRAM pricing in PC demand have been declining off late, our leading edge DRAM customers remain very profitable and are sustaining their investments to transition to the 4X nanometer and the 3X nanometer technology nodes.
We also saw an increase in NAND equipment demand in Q1 to meet strong bit growth driven by rapid adoption in smartphones and Tablet PCs. Orders from NAND flash customers grew to 72% of memory orders with market leaders investing to ramp 30 nanometer and to qualify 20 nanometer technologies. Logic was 18% of bookings in September, driven by the continued migration to 22 nanometer.
Now as you know, technology changes that enable Moore’s Law are constant in our industry. Regardless of where we are in the industry cycle, ship manufacturers are continuously innovating to lower the cost of production and improve performance of their products and process control is essential to successful innovation.
Although orders remained at a high level compared with historical averages, the downward trend in bookings in the first quarter, following an extended period of robust growth was consistent with seasonality for KLA-Tencor. Is also indicative of a more cautious approach our customers have recently adopted with our capital spending budget, as weakening consumer PC demand and persistent uncertainty regarding the macro economy have impacted the spending in the short-term.
However, overall semiconductor industry dynamics remained healthy, and the importance of maintaining cost and performance leadership continues to drive investments at a high level. Current external market estimates have semiconductor revenues growing in the range of 30% in calendar 2010, with growth currently forecast in the mid-single digits for calendar 2011. Fab utilization also remains at a high level and the WFE market is forecast to grow 120% in calendar 2010 with 2011 expected to be roughly flat year-over-year.
We’re tracking 13 new fab projects currently in development or scheduled to qualify over the next several quarters. The majority of semiconductor capital spending today is focused primarily on technology investment and not capacity. And that focus is a key driver of the high demand we’re seeing in process control. And with the continued success of new products and sustain market leadership, coupled with our strong backlog and high performance business model, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to deliver outstanding revenue, profitability and earnings as we move ahead.
Moving now to guidance. Gross bookings in December are projected to be flat to down 20%. We also expect continued revenue growth and strong margin performance, with December revenue expected to be in the range of 700 million to $740 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.00 to $1.10 per share.
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Mark for his review of the numbers.

As most of you know, we present our income statement in two formats. One under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions. Expenses associated with our stock options related litigation and certain costs and expenses which are outside of our core operations such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items.
Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks and operations will refer to non-GAAP information but were a reference GAAP numbers, I’ll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website.
The differences between this quarter’s GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are: acquisition related charges of $8 million before taxes or $0.03 a share after-taxes and a $9 million non-cash tax charge due to accumulative shortfall position in our employ stock activity. Removing this charge from GAAP earnings added about $0.06 per share to non-GAAP EPS.
Following our record Q4, the Q1 new order total was $785 million which was our third best quarter ever. Net orders were 787 million, revenue and EPS for Q1 were above the top-end of our guidance ranges we issued in July, as we process the strong order pickup we experienced in the last few quarters.
The regional distribution of new systems orders in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows
the U.S. was 21% of new systems orders in Q1, down from 25% in the June quarter; Europe was 4% of new systems orders, down from 12% in Q4; Japan was 7%, down from 12% last quarter; Korea was 24%, up from 19% last quarter; Taiwan was 34%, up from 18% last quarter and the rest of Asia was 10%, down from 14% in Q4.
The Q1 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows
Wafer inspection was 49% compared with 48% last quarter, Reticle inspection was 11%, down from 19% last quarter; Metrology was 17%, up from 14% from prior quarter; solar storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was 6% even with last quarter and services was 17% of new orders in Q1, up from 13% last quarter.
Foundry customers comprised 44% of semiconductor systems orders in Q1 versus 41% in Q4. Logic customers were 18% of systems orders in Q1 versus 21% in Q4 and memory system orders were 38% in Q1, even with last quarter. 67% of the semiconductor systems orders in Q1 were for 32 nanometer and below technology versus 41% in the June quarter.
Looking forward, we expect that new orders for fiscal Q2 will be within a range of flat to down 20% from Q1. Shipments in Q1 which include both system shipments and services revenue were $677 million, up from 622 million last quarter. We added a little over $100 million to our backlog in Q1 and ended the quarter with 1.44 billion in total systems backlog. The backlog at September 30th included $337 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue and $1.1 billion in system orders that have not yet shipped.
Systems revenue for Q1 was up 28% to $550 million compared with $430 million in Q4. Services revenue was $132 million in Q1, up slightly from $129 million in Q4. Our expectations for total revenue in Q1, is a range between 700 and 740 million. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62% in the September quarter, up 2 percentage points from June. For Q2, we are modeling an incremental gross margin target roughly equal to our stated goal of 60 to 70%.
Operating expenses were 180 million, up $15 million from the June quarter. About 3 million of the quarter-to-quarter increase resulted from giving our employees new iPad devices and grossing them for taxes. Another 3 million of the increase was due to a Q4 credit in G&A expense for recovery of our claim arising from the Spansion bankruptcy which did not repeat in Q1.
We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to increase slightly in Q2, in line with our stated incremental operating margin target of 50 to 60%. Other income and expense or OIE, was a net $12 million expense in Q1, about $1 million higher than Q4. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $11 million in Q2. In Q1, our non-GAAP income tax expenses $63 million or $0.27 of pretax income versus $41 million in Q4, which was 25% of pretax income. The tax rate increase arose largely from a change in the distribution of earnings between the U.S. and lower taxed international operations.
Non-GAAP net income was $169 million or $0.99 per share in Q1. If we exclude the iPad distribution expense and apply our model tax rate of 38 - excuse me, 30%, our Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.96. At the revenue range I previously mentioned, we would expect our Q2 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1.00 and $1.10 per share assuming a tax rate of 30%.
Weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q1 were 169.8 million versus 171.3 million in Q4. During Q1, we spent $62 million repurchasing about 2 million shares and as of September 30th, we had approximately 3.2 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares in the December quarter. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of 169 million for Q2.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at 1.5 billion about even with prior quarter-end. Cash generated from operations was $96 million in Q1 compared with $83 million in Q4. The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating cash flow largely resulted because we had $133 million more in customer collections and we did not have to make a $26 million semiannual interest payment this quarter. These effects were partially offset by larger outlays including annual bonus payments we made in September.
Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at 500 million up from $440 million at June 30th, largely resulting from the $55 million increase in shipments from Q4 to Q1. DSOs were 67 days at September 30th versus 72 days at the end of June. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts in factoring. Net inventories increased by $62 million from June 30th and ended the quarter at 464 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.3 turns in Q1 flat with Q4.
Net capital expenditures were $11 million in Q1 versus $6 million in Q4. Total headcount at September 30th was 5,180 up from 4,989 at June 30th. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q2.
In summary, our guidance for Q2 is: new orders flat to down 20% from Q1, total revenue between 700 and 740 million, non-GAAP EPS between $1.00 and $1.10 assuming a tax rate of 30% of the pretax income.
This concludes our prepared remarks in the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A.

Whether 2011 will repeat? 2010, our current model is we see 2011 normally being flat with what we see 2010 shaping up to be very hard to predict at this time where that’ll happen inside of the different segments, but we think foundries stays pretty long, logic pretty steady and I think DRAM is probably remain soft offset by NAND spending continuing.

Well, clearly in 2011, what we’re counting on is continued investment as I said probably steady investment in logic. We think that there would be continued investment in foundry as the foundry competition really increases and actually gets more meaningful, more players investing. I think DRAM is likely to be a little bit soft and the NAND would make that up. So if you take any of those and they don’t hold then that obviously would have a downward pressure. On the other hand, if we see more strength let’s say, in the second half to a DRAM then that could strengthen the position of the DRAM customers driving more investment by them. So when we balance the whole thing, we do come up with a range where we scenarios were its up and then we see scenarios where it’s down and we end it up coming out right in the middle.

It seems like you’re building a decent amount of deferred revenue now.
And just second question, sort of a bigger picture question with still a lot of sort of new fab projects in the pipeline particularly for NAND in 2011. There is just sort of common perception that NAND is less CapEx intensive then DRAM per semi-cap equipment spending overall. I was wondering if that - the same case for inspection or metrology and whether or not inspection and metrology could actually see higher CapEx intensity with NAND compared to processing.

Really start with the second part of your question, capital intensity for NAND and DRAM. From our perspective, in a process control world, we are seeing new challenges emerge in advanced design rolls on NAND that even our customers weren’t to wear out that as recently as three or six months ago challenges they’re having. So as a result, we are seeing increased activity and then increased in the process control percentage, the people are willing to invest and need to invest. So I think for us, NAND is going to be a healthy market as we go forward. That said, we still got a lot of work to do to execute on our strategy to support that.
And I don’t see, DRAM right now, I just think its overall there are many challenges associating with the technology but we start to see the overall activity level being as high for DRAM in general as we do for NAND. And Mark, can you split?

In the - first of all, it usually takes at least 90 days to turn shipments into revenue when you get into just passing the units along installing customer burn in and then final product acceptance. When we are moving in, let’s call it normal circumstances which isn’t that often as it turns out. You will see a 90-day turn of that or a little bit longer than 90-days. When you are in a step-up ramp like we’re in right now. It takes a little bit longer to turn that into revenue. I will say that however, in Q1 we actually revenued ahead of the prior quarter shipment. So we actually revenued 683 this quarter and we shipped 622 last quarter. So it can move back and forth. That won’t every quarter, but it will happen often just to let you know that it should vacillate at 90 or slightly greater than 90 days. I hope that responses to your question. And again, if we meet the shipment, the revenue will follow relatively shortly thereafter in the next couple of quarters.

Thank you all for joining us for our call today. I'm going to focus my commentary on the summary highlights of the September quarter and then provide guidance for December, then Mark is going to follow with a review of the financials. First of",1046,"Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us for our call today. I'm going to focus my commentary on the summary highlights of the September quarter and then provide guidance for December, then Mark is going to follow with a review of the financials. First of all, there's no shortage of debate today as to the pace of the global economic recovery or the near-term direction in the semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment market. But KLA-Tencor September results demonstrate that process control adoption remains at a very high level. Our numbers also show the company's successfully executing on our long-term strategic objectives, delivering sustained market leadership, strong revenue growth, record margins, record earnings per share in the quarter. New bookings in the September quarter were $785 million. That's the third-highest level in the company's history. The high level of demand we're experiencing today is driven by the combination of strong adoption in the core markets and the healthy contribution from new markets in our services business. Revenues grew 22% sequentially to $682 million, significantly above the range of guidance and indicative of the high sense of urgency among our customers for getting our latest generation process technologies qualified and in place. Non-GAAP earnings was a record $0.99 per share in Q1, significantly above the guidance range of $0.80 to $0.88 per share. Underlying this outstanding financial performance in Q1 were record non-GAAP gross margins of 62% and record non-GAAP operating margins of 36%, with incremental margins coming in above our 60% to 70% target for gross margin and our 50% to 60% target for operating margin. And we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $1.4 billion in backlog. 
Now, in response to the high levels of demand we've been experiencing lately, we're focused on driving our operations to meet customer requirements and we are positioned for continued growth in shipments, revenue and earnings as we move forward. Our strong financial performance is a result of KLA-Tencor's technology and market leadership and it demonstrates the value our technology and services deliver in helping our customers execute their leading-edge technology roadmaps. It also helps us sustain the high level of R&D, which is essential to achieve our customer focus and growth strategies and provides the resources for us to deliver significant cash returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
To that end, KLA-Tencor repurchased approximately 2 million shares of our common stock for approximately $62 million and paid cash dividends of approximately $42 million in the quarter. As you may recall, on July 13, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the level of the quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share, which took us back with our first quarter dividend. That move reflects management and the board's confidence in the long-term outlook for the company, as well as the ongoing efforts to reward our shareholders for their continued investment. 
Turning now into some specifics of the demand picture, gross bookings in Q1 were $785 million, the third-highest in record for KLA-Tencor but below the midpoint of the range of guidance for the quarter. The first quarter end market picture was highlighted by a sustained strong demand from foundries, coming in at 44% of new orders in the September quarter. Our foundry customers are operating at high levels of capital intensity as they expand capacity to address the heightened competitive environment and increased business levels, driven by rapid proliferation of new tablet designs. Looking at the memory market, bookings for memory customers were 38% of the total in Q1. While DRAM pricing and PC demand have been declining of late, our leading-edge DRAM customers remain very profitable and are sustaining their investments to transition to the 4x nanometer and the 3X nanometer technology nodes. We also saw an increase in NAND equipment demand in Q1 to meet strong bit growth, driven by rapid adoption of smartphones and tablet PCs. Orders from NAND Flash customers grew to 72% of memory orders, with market leaders investing to ramp 30-nanometer and to qualify 20-nanometer technologies. Logic was 18% of bookings in September, driven by the continued migration to 22-nanometer. Now as you know, technology changes that enable Moore's Law are constant in our industry. But regardless of where we are in the industry cycle, chip manufacturers are continuously innovating to lower the cost of production and improve performance of their products and process control is essential to successful innovation. Although orders remained at a high level compared with historical averages, the downward trend in bookings in the first quarter, following an extended period of robust growth, was consistent with seasonality for KLA-Tencor. It's also indicative of a more cautious approach our customers have recently adopted with their capital spending budgets as weakening consumer PC demand and persistent uncertainty regarding the macroeconomy have impacted spending in the short term. However, overall semiconductor industry dynamics remain healthy and the importance of maintaining cost and performance leadership continues to drive investment at a high level. Current external market estimates have semiconductor revenues growing in the range of 30% in calendar 2010, with growth currently forecast in the midsingle digits for calendar 2011. Fab utilization also remains at a high level, and the WFE market is forecast to grow 120% in calendar 2010, with 2011 expected to be roughly flat year-over-year. We're tracking 13 new fab projects currently in development or scheduled to qualify over the next several quarters. 
The majority of semiconductor capital spending today is focused primarily on technology investment and not capacity. And that focus is a key driver of the high demand we're seeing in process control. And with the continued success of new products and sustained market leadership, coupled with our strong backlog and high-performance business model, KLA-Tencor is well-positioned to deliver outstanding revenue, profitability and earnings as we move ahead. 
Moving now to guidance. Gross bookings in December are projected to be flat to down 20%. We also expect continued revenue growth in strong margin performance, with December revenue expected to be in the range of $700 million to $740 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.00 to $1.10 per share. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his review of the numbers."
282225,114649381,144762,"KLA-Tencor Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","KLA Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rick. As most of you know, we present our income statement in 2 formats, one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and writedown of tangible assets associated with acquisition, expenses associated with our",1206,"Thanks, Rick. As most of you know, we present our income statement in 2 formats, one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and writedown of tangible assets associated with acquisition, expenses associated with our stock option-related litigation and certain costs and expenses, which are outside of our core operations, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks and operations will refer to non-GAAP information but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available on our website. The differences between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are: acquisition-related charges of $8 million before taxes or $0.03 a share after taxes; and a $9 million noncash tax charge due to a cumulative shortfall position in our employee stock activity. Removing this charge from GAAP earnings added about $0.06 per share to non-GAAP EPS. 
Following our record Q4, the Q1 new order total was $785 million, which was our third best quarter ever. Net orders were $787 million. Revenue and EPS for Q1 were above the top end of our guidance ranges we issued in July, as we processed the strong order pickup we experienced in the last few quarters. The regional distribution of new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: the U.S. was 21% of new systems orders in Q1, down from 25% in the June quarter; Europe was 4% of new systems orders, down from 12% in Q4; Japan was 7%, down from 12% last quarter; Korea was 24%, up from 19% last quarter; Taiwan was 34%, up from 18% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 10%, down from 14% in Q4. The Q1 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows: wafer inspection was 49% compared with 48% last quarter; radical inspection was 11%, down from 19% last quarter; metrology was 17%, up from 14% in prior quarter; solar, storage, high-brightness LED and other nonsemi was 6%, even with last quarter; and services were 17% of new orders in Q1, up from 13% last quarter. Foundry customers comprise 44% of semiconductor systems orders in Q1 versus 41% in Q4. Logic customers were 18% of systems orders in Q1 versus 21% in Q4 and memory system orders were 38% in Q1, even with last quarter. 67% of the semiconductor systems orders in Q1 were for 32-nanometer and below technology versus 41% in the June quarter. 
Looking forward, we expect that new orders for our fiscal Q2 will be within a range of flat to down 20% from Q1. Shipments in Q1, which include both system shipments and services revenue, were $677 million, up from $622 million last quarter. We added a little over $100 million to our backlog in Q1 and ended the quarter with $1.44 billion in total systems backlog. The backlog at September 30 included $337 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced that have not yet been recognized as revenue and $1.1 billion in system orders that have not yet shipped. Systems revenue for Q1 was up 28% to $550 million compared with $430 million in Q4. Services revenue was $132 million in Q1, up slightly from $129 million in Q4. Our expectations for total revenue in Q1 is a range between $700 million and $740 million. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 62% in the September quarter, up 2 percentage points from June. For Q2, we are modeling an incremental gross margin target roughly equal to our stated goal of 60% to 70%. Operating expenses were $180 million, up $15 million from the June quarter. About $3 million of the quarter-to-quarter increase resulted from giving our employees new iPad devices and grossing them up for taxes. Another $3 million of the increase was due to a Q4 credit in G&A expense for recovery of our claim arising from the Spansion bankruptcy, which did not repeat in Q1. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to increase slightly in Q2, in line with our stated incremental operating margin target of 50% to 60%. Other income and expense or OIE was a net $12 million expense in Q1, about $1 million higher than Q4. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $11 million in Q2. In Q1, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $63 million or 27% pretax income versus $41 million in Q4, which was 25% of pretax income. The tax rate increase arose largely from a change in the distribution of earnings between the U.S. and lower tax in international operations. Non-GAAP net income was $169 million or $0.99 per share in Q1. If we exclude the iPad distribution expense and apply our modeled tax rate of 30%, our Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share would've been $0.96. At the revenue range I previously mentioned, we would expect our Q2 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1 and $1.10 per share, assuming a tax rate of 30%. Weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q1 were 169.8 million versus 171.3 million in Q4. During Q1, we spent $62 million repurchasing about 2 million shares and as of September 30, we had approximately 3.2 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares in the December quarter. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of 169 million for Q2. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $1.5 billion, about even with the prior quarter end. Cash generated from operations was $96 million in Q1, compared with $83 million in Q4. The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating cash flow largely resulted because we had $133 million more in customer collections and we did not have to make a $26 million semiannual interest payment this quarter. These effects were partially offset by larger outlays, including annual bonus payments we made in September. Net accounts receivables ended the quarter at $500 million, up from $440 million at June 30, largely resulting from the $55 million increase in shipments from Q4 to Q1. DSOs were 67 days at September 30 versus 72 days at the end of June. All DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factory. Net inventories increased by $62 million in June 30 and ended the quarter at $464 million. Inventory turnover baked upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.3 turns in Q1, flat with Q4. Net capital expenditures were $11 million in Q1 versus $6 million in Q4. Total headcount at September 30 was 5,180, up from 4,989 at June 30. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q2. 
In summary, our guidance for Q2 is: new orders flat to down 20% from Q1; total revenue between $700 million and $740 million; non-GAAP EPS between $1 and $1.10, assuming the tax rate of 30% of the pretax income. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A."

Whether 2011 will repeat 2010, our current model is we see 2011 not only being flat but we see 2010 shaping up to be very hard to predict at this time where that will happen inside of the different segments. But we think foundry stays pretty strong, logic pretty steady and I think DRAM's probably remain soft, offset by NAND spending continuing. That's kind of how we see it."

First of all, it usually takes at least 90 days to turn shipments into revenue when you get into just passing the units along, installing customer burn-in and then the product final acceptance. When we're moving in let's call it normal circumstances, which isn't that often as it turns out, you will see a 90-day turn of that or a little bit longer than 90 days. When you're in a stepup ramp like we're in right now, it takes a little bit longer to turn that into revenue. We'll say this however, in Q1, we actually revenued ahead of the prior quarter's shipments. So we actually revenued $683 million this quarter and we shipped $622 million last quarter. So it can move back and forth. That won't happen ever quarter but it will happen often enough just to let you know that it should vacillate at 90 or slightly greater than 90 days. I hope that's responsive of your question. And again, if we meet the shipping profile, the revenue will follow relatively shortly thereafter in the next couple of quarters."

We obviously are getting more than that right now.

Thank you all for joining us for our call today. I'm going to focus my commentary on the summary highlights of the September quarter and then provide guidance for December, then Mark is going to follow with the review of the financials. First",1049,"Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us for our call today. I'm going to focus my commentary on the summary highlights of the September quarter and then provide guidance for December, then Mark is going to follow with the review of the financials. First of all, there's no shortage of debate today as to the pace of the global economic recovery or near-term direction in semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment market. But KLA-Tencor's September results demonstrate that process control adoption remains at a very high level. Our numbers also show the company is successfully executing on our long-term strategic objectives, delivering sustained market leadership, strong revenue growth, record margins, record earnings per share in the quarter. New bookings in the September quarter were $785 million. That's the third highest level in the company's history. The high level of demand we're experiencing today is driven by the combination of strong adoption in the core markets and the healthy contribution from new markets in our services business. Revenues grew 22% sequentially to $682 million, significantly above the range of guidance and indicative of the high sense of urgency among our customers for getting our latest generation process control technologies qualified and in place. Non-GAAP earnings was a record $0.99 per share in Q1, significantly above the guidance range of $0.80 to $0.88 per share. Underlying this outstanding financial performance in Q1 were record non-GAAP gross margins of 62% and record non-GAAP operating margins of 36%, with incremental margins coming in above our 60% to 70% target for gross margin and our 50% to 60% target for operating margin. And we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $1.4 billion in backlog.
Now in response to the high levels of demand we've been experiencing lately, we're focused on driving our operations to meet customer requirements, and we are positioned for continued growth in shipments, revenue and earnings as we move forward. Our strong financial performance is a result of KLA-Tencor's technology and market leadership, and it demonstrates the value our technology and services deliver in helping our customers execute their leading-edge technology roadmaps. It also helps us sustain the high level of R&D, which is essential to achieve our customer focus and growth strategies and provides the resources for us to deliver significant cash returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
To that end, KLA-Tencor repurchased approximately 2 million shares of our common stock for approximately $62 million and paid cash dividends of approximately $42 million in the quarter. As you may recall, on July 13, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the level of the quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share, which took us back with our first quarter dividend. That move reflects management and the board's confidence in the long-term outlook for the company, as well as the ongoing efforts to reward our shareholders for their continued investment. 
Turning now into some specifics of the demand picture. Gross bookings in Q1 were $785 million, the third highest on record for KLA-Tencor but below the midpoint of the range of guidance for the quarter. The first quarter end market picture was highlighted by a sustained strong demand from foundries, coming in at 44% of new orders in the September quarter. Our foundry customers are operating at high levels of capital intensity as they expand capacity to address the highly competitive environment and increased business levels, driven by rapid proliferation of new fabless designs. Looking at the memory market, bookings for memory customers were 38% of the total in Q1. While DRAM pricing and PC demand have been declining of late, our leading-edge DRAM customers remain very profitable and are sustaining their investments to transition to the 4x nanometer and the 3X nanometer technology nodes. We also saw an increase in NAND equipment demand in Q1 to meet strong bit growth, driven by rapid adoption of smartphones and tablet PCs. Orders from NAND flash customers grew to 72% of memory orders, with market leaders investing to ramp 30-nanometer and to qualify 20-nanometer technologies. Logic was 18% of bookings in September, driven by the continued migration to 22-nanometer. Now as you know, technology changes that enable Moore's Law are constant in our industry. But regardless of where we are in the industry cycle, chip manufacturers are continuously innovating to lower the cost of production and improve performance of their products, and process control is essential to successful innovation. Although orders remained at a high level compared with historical averages, the downward trend in bookings in the first quarter following an extended period of robust growth, was consistent with seasonality for KLA-Tencor. It's also indicative of a more cautious approach our customers have recently adopted with their capital spending budgets as weakening consumer PC demand and persistent uncertainty regarding the macroeconomy have impacted spending in the short term. However, overall semiconductor industry dynamics remain healthy, and the importance of maintaining cost and performance leadership continues to drive investment at a high level. Current external market estimates have semiconductor revenues growing in the range of 30% in calendar 2010, with growth currently forecast in the midsingle digits for calendar 2011. Fab utilization also remains at a high level, and the WFE market is forecast to grow 120% in calendar 2010, with 2011 expected to be roughly flat year-over-year. We're tracking 13 new fab projects currently in development or scheduled to qualify over the next several quarters. 
The majority of semiconductor capital spending today is focused primarily on technology investment and not capacity. And that focus is a key driver of the high demand we're seeing in process control. And with the continued success of new products and sustained market leadership, coupled with our strong backlog and high-performance business model, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to deliver outstanding revenue, profitability and earnings as we move ahead. 
Moving now to guidance. Gross bookings in December are projected to be flat to down 20%. We also expect continued revenue growth and strong margin performance, with December revenue expected to be in the range of $700 million to $740 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.00 to $1.10 per share. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his review of the numbers."

As most of you know, we present our income statement in 2 formats, one under U.S. GAAP then the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisition, expenses associated with our stock options related litigation and certain costs and expenses, which are outside of our core operations, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks in operations will refer to non-GAAP information, but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website. The differences between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are acquisition-related charges of $8 million before taxes or $0.03 a share after taxes, and a $9 million noncash tax charge due to a cumulative shortfall position in our employee stock activity. Removing this charge from GAAP earnings added about $0.06 per share to non-GAAP EPS. 
Following our record Q4, the Q1 new order total was $785 million, which is our third best quarter ever. Net orders were $787 million. Revenue and EPS for Q1 were above the top end of our guidance ranges we issued in July, as we process the strong order pickup we experienced in the last few quarters. The regional distribution of new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows: the U.S. was 21% of new systems orders in Q1, down from 25% in the June quarter; Europe was 4% of new systems orders, down from 12% in Q4; Japan was 7%, down from 12% last quarter; Korea was 24%, up from 19% last quarter; Taiwan was 34%, up from 18% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 10%, down from 14% in Q4. The Q1 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows: wafer inspection was 49% compared with 48% last quarter; radical inspection was 11% down, from 19% last quarter; metrology was 17%, up from 14% in prior quarter; solar, storage, high-brightness LED and other nonsemi was 6%, even with last quarter; and services was 17% of new orders in Q1, up from 13% last quarter. Foundry customers comprise 44% of semiconductor systems orders in Q1 versus 41% in Q4. Logic customers were 18% of systems orders in Q1 versus 21% in Q4, and memory system orders were 38% in Q1, even with last quarter. 67% of the semiconductor systems orders in Q1 were for 32-nanometer and below technology versus 41% in the June quarter. 
Looking forward, we expect that new orders for our fiscal Q2 will be within the range of flat to down 20% from Q1. Shipments in Q1, which include both system shipments and services revenue, were $677 million, up from $622 million last quarter. We added a little over $100 million to our backlog in Q1 and ended the quarter with $1.44 billion in total systems backlog. The backlog at September 30 included $337 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue, and $1.1 billion in system orders that have not yet shipped. Systems revenue for Q1 was up 28% to $550 million compared with $430 million in Q4. Services revenue was $132 million in Q1, up slightly from $129 million in Q4. Our expectations for total revenue in Q1 is a range between $700 million and $740 million. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 62% in the September quarter, up 2 percentage points from June. For Q2, we are modeling an incremental gross margin target roughly equal to our stated goal of 60% to 70%. Operating expenses were $180 million, up $15 million from the June quarter. About $3 million of the quarter-to-quarter increase resulted from giving our employees new iPad devices and grossing them up for taxes. Another $3 million of the increase was due to Q4 credit in G&A expense for recovery of our claim arising from the Spansion bankruptcy, which did not repeat in Q1. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to increase slightly in Q2, in line with our stated incremental operating margin target of 50% to 60%. Other income and expense or OIE was a net $12 million expense in Q1, about $1 million higher than Q4. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $11 million in Q2. In Q1, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $63 million or 27% pretax income versus $41 million in Q4, which was 25% of pretax income. The tax rate increase arose largely from a change in the distribution of earnings between the U.S. and lower tax international operations. Non-GAAP net income was $169 million or $0.99 per share in Q1. If we exclude the iPad distribution expense and apply our modeled tax rate of 38 -- excuse me, 30%, our Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.96. At the revenue range I previously mentioned, we would expect our Q2 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1 and $1.10 per share, assuming a tax rate of 30%. Weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q1 were 169.8 million versus 171.3 million in Q4. During Q1, we spent $62 million repurchasing about 2 million shares and as of September 30, we had approximately 3.2 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares in the December quarter. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of 169 million for Q2. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $1.5 billion, about even with the prior quarter end. Cash generated from operations was $96 million in Q1, compared with $83 million in Q4. Quarter-over-quarter increase in operating cash flow largely resulted because we had $133 million more in customer collections, and we did not have to make a $26 million semiannual interest payment this quarter. These effects were partially offset by larger outlays, including annual bonus payments we made in September. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $500 million, up from $440 million at June 30, largely resulting from the $55 million increase in shipments from Q4 to Q1. DSOs were 67 days at September 30 versus 72 days at the end of June. All DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factory. Net inventories increased by $62 million in June 30 and ended the quarter at $464 million. Inventory turnover baked upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.3 turns in Q1, flat with Q4. Net capital expenditures were $11 million in Q1 versus $6 million in Q4. Total headcount at September 30 was 5,180, up from 4,989 at June 30. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q2. 
In summary, our guidance for Q2 is new orders flat to down 20% from Q1, total revenue between $700 million and $740 million, non-GAAP EPS between $1 and $1.10, assuming the tax rate of 30% of the pretax income. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A."

But there are several projects on the books and when we look out, there are major foundry players talking about increasing CapEx for calendar '11, and we see many projects outside of just the major players there. You go across the space, and there's a lot of investment across foundries. Whether 2011 will repeat 2010, our current model is we see 2011 not only being flat, but what we see in 2010 is shaping up to be very hard to predict at this time whether that will happen inside of the different segments. But we think foundry stays pretty strong, logic pretty steady, and I think DRAM's probably remaining soft, offset by NAND spending continuing. That's kind of how we see it."

Well, clearly in 2011, what we're counting on is continued investments, as I said probably steady investment in logic. We think that there will be continued investment in foundry as the foundry competition really increases and actually gets more meaningful, more players investing. I think DRAM is likely to be a little bit soft, and NAND would make that up. So if you take any of those and they don't hold, then that obviously would have a downward pressure. On the other hand, if we see more strength, let's say in the second half to our DRAM, then that could straighten the position of the DRAM customers, driving more investment by them. So when we balance the whole thing, we do come up with the range where we see scenarios where it's up, and then we see scenarios where it's down, and we end up coming out right in the middle."

First of all, it usually takes at least 90 days to turn shipments into revenue when you get into just passing the units along, installing customer burn-in and then the product final acceptance. When we're moving in, let's call it normal circumstances, which isn't that often as it turns out, you will see a 90-day turn of that or a little bit longer than 90 days. When you're in a step-up ramp like we're in right now, it takes a little bit longer to turn that into revenue. I will say this, however, in Q1, we actually revenued ahead of the prior quarter's shipments. So we actually revenued $683 million this quarter, and we shipped $622 million last quarter. So it can move back and forth. That won't happen every quarter, but it will happen often enough just to let you know that it should vacillate at 90 or slightly greater than 90 days. I hope that's a response of your question. And again, if we meet the shipping profile, the revenue will follow relatively shortly thereafter in the next couple of quarters."

Thank you all for joining us for our call today. I'm going to focus my commentary on the summary highlights of the September quarter and then provide guidance for December, then Mark is going to follow with the review of the financials. First",1048,"Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us for our call today. I'm going to focus my commentary on the summary highlights of the September quarter and then provide guidance for December, then Mark is going to follow with the review of the financials. First of all, there's no shortage of debate today as to the pace of the global economic recovery or near-term direction in semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment market. But KLA-Tencor's September results demonstrate that process control adoption remains at a very high level. Our numbers also show the company is successfully executing on our long-term strategic objectives, delivering sustained market leadership, strong revenue growth, record margins, record earnings per share in the quarter. New bookings in the September quarter were $785 million. That's the third highest level in the company's history. The high level of demand we're experiencing today is driven by the combination of strong adoption in the core markets and the healthy contribution from new markets and our services business. Revenues grew 22% sequentially to $682 million, significantly above the range of guidance and indicative of the high sense of urgency among our customers for getting our latest generation process control technologies qualified and in place. Non-GAAP earnings was a record $0.99 per share in Q1, significantly above the guidance range of $0.80 to $0.88 per share. Underlying this outstanding financial performance in Q1 were record non-GAAP gross margins of 62% and record non-GAAP operating margins of 36%, with incremental margins coming in above our 60% to 70% target for gross margin and our 50% to 60% target for operating margin. And we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $1.4 billion in backlog.
Now in response to the high levels of demand we've been experiencing lately, we're focused on driving our operations to meet customer requirements, and we are positioned for continued growth in shipments, revenue and earnings as we move forward. Our strong financial performance is a result of KLA-Tencor's technology and market leadership, and it demonstrates the value our technology and services deliver in helping our customers execute their leading-edge technology roadmaps. It also helps us sustain the high level of R&D, which is essential to achieve our customer focus and growth strategies and provides the resources for us to deliver significant cash returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. 
To that end, KLA-Tencor repurchased approximately 2 million shares of our common stock for approximately $62 million and paid cash dividends of approximately $42 million in the quarter. As you may recall, on July 13, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the level of the quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share, which took effect with our first quarter dividend. That move reflects management and the board's confidence in the long-term outlook for the company, as well as the ongoing efforts to reward our shareholders for their continued investment. 
Turning now into some specifics of the demand picture. Gross bookings in Q1 were $785 million, the third highest on record for KLA-Tencor but below the midpoint of the range of guidance for the quarter. The first quarter end market picture was highlighted by a sustained strong demand from foundries, coming in at 44% of new orders in the September quarter. Our foundry customers are operating at high levels of capital intensity as they expand capacity to address the highly competitive environment and increased business levels, driven by rapid proliferation of new fabless designs. Looking at the memory market, bookings for memory customers were 38% of the total in Q1. While DRAM pricing and PC demand have been declining of late, our leading-edge DRAM customers remain very profitable and are sustaining their investments to transition to the 4x nanometer and the 3X nanometer technology nodes. 
We also saw an increase in NAND equipment demand in Q1 to meet strong bit growth, driven by rapid adoption of smartphones and tablet PCs. Orders from NAND flash customers grew to 72% of memory orders, with market leaders investing to ramp 30-nanometer and to qualify 20-nanometer technologies. Logic was 18% of bookings in September, driven by the continued migration to 22-nanometer. Now as you know, technology changes that enable Moore's Law are constant in our industry. But regardless of where we are in the industry cycle, chip manufacturers are continuously innovating to lower the cost of production and improve performance of their products, and process control is essential to successful innovation. 
Although orders remained at a high level compared with historical averages, the downward trend in bookings in the first quarter following an extended period of robust growth, was consistent with seasonality for KLA-Tencor. It's also indicative of a more cautious approach our customers have recently adopted with their capital spending budgets as weakening consumer PC demand and persistent uncertainty regarding the macroeconomy have impacted spending in the short term. However, overall semiconductor industry dynamics remain healthy, and the importance of maintaining cost and performance leadership continues to drive investment at a high level. Current external market estimates have semiconductor revenues growing in the range of 30% in calendar 2010, with growth currently forecast in the midsingle digits for calendar 2011. Fab utilization also remains at a high level, and the WFE market is forecast to grow 120% in calendar 2010, with 2011 expected to be roughly flat year-over-year. We're tracking 13 new fab projects currently in development or scheduled to qualify over the next several quarters. 
The majority of semiconductor capital spending today is focused primarily on technology investment and not capacity. And that focus is a key driver of the high demand we're seeing in process control. And with the continued success of new products and sustained market leadership, coupled with our strong backlog and high-performance business model, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to deliver outstanding revenue, profitability and earnings as we move ahead. 
Moving now to guidance. Gross bookings in December are projected to be flat to down 20%. We also expect continued revenue growth and strong margin performance, with December revenue expected to be in the range of $700 million to $740 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.00 to $1.10 per share. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his review of the numbers."
282225,114649381,145092,"KLA-Tencor Corporation, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","KLA Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Rick. As most of you know, we present our income statement in 2 formats, one under U.S. GAAP then the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisition, expenses associated with",1209,"Thanks, Rick. As most of you know, we present our income statement in 2 formats, one under U.S. GAAP then the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisition, expenses associated with our stock options related litigation and certain costs and expenses, which are outside of our core operations, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks in operations will refer to non-GAAP information, but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website. The differences between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are acquisition-related charges of $8 million before taxes or $0.03 a share after taxes, and a $9 million noncash tax charge due to a cumulative shortfall position in our employee stock activity. Removing this charge from GAAP earnings added about $0.06 per share to non-GAAP EPS. 
Following our record Q4, the Q1 new order total was $785 million, which is our third best quarter ever. Net orders were $787 million. Revenue and EPS for Q1 were above the top end of our guidance ranges we issued in July, as we process the strong order pickup we experienced in the last few quarters. The regional distribution of new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows: the U.S. was 21% of new systems orders in Q1, down from 25% in the June quarter; Europe was 4% of new systems orders, down from 12% in Q4; Japan was 7%, down from 12% last quarter; Korea was 24%, up from 19% last quarter; Taiwan was 34%, up from 18% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 10%, down from 14% in Q4. The Q1 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows: wafer inspection was 49% compared with 48% last quarter; reticle inspection was 11% down, from 19% last quarter; metrology was 17%, up from 14% in prior quarter; solar, storage, high-brightness LED and other nonsemi was 6%, even with last quarter; and services was 17% of new orders in Q1, up from 13% last quarter. Foundry customers comprise 44% of semiconductor systems orders in Q1 versus 41% in Q4. Logic customers were 18% of systems orders in Q1 versus 21% in Q4, and memory system orders were 38% in Q1, even with last quarter. 67% of the semiconductor systems orders in Q1 were for 32-nanometer and below technology versus 41% in the June quarter. 
Looking forward, we expect that new orders for our fiscal Q2 will be within the range of flat to down 20% from Q1. Shipments in Q1, which include both system shipments and services revenue, were $677 million, up from $622 million last quarter. We added a little over $100 million to our backlog in Q1 and ended the quarter with $1.44 billion in total systems backlog. The backlog at September 30 included $337 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue, and $1.1 billion in system orders that have not yet shipped. Systems revenue for Q1 was up 28% to $550 million compared with $430 million in Q4. Services revenue was $132 million in Q1, up slightly from $129 million in Q4. Our expectations for total revenue in Q1 is a range between $700 million and $740 million. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was 62% in the September quarter, up 2 percentage points from June. For Q2, we are modeling an incremental gross margin target roughly equal to our stated goal of 60% to 70%. Operating expenses were $180 million, up $15 million from the June quarter. About $3 million of the quarter-to-quarter increase resulted from giving our employees new iPad devices and grossing them up for taxes. Another $3 million of the increase was due to Q4 credit in G&A expense for recovery of our claim arising from the Spansion bankruptcy, which did not repeat in Q1. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to increase slightly in Q2, in line with our stated incremental operating margin target of 50% to 60%. Other income and expense or OIE was a net $12 million expense in Q1, about $1 million higher than Q4. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $11 million in Q2. 
In Q1, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $63 million or 27% pretax income versus $41 million in Q4, which was 25% of pretax income. The tax rate increase arose largely from a change in the distribution of earnings between the U.S. and lower tax international operations. Non-GAAP net income was $169 million or $0.99 per share in Q1. If we exclude the iPad distribution expense and apply our modeled tax rate of 38 -- excuse me, 30%, our Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.96. At the revenue range I previously mentioned, we would expect our Q2 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1 and $1.10 per share, assuming a tax rate of 30%. Weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q1 were 169.8 million versus 171.3 million in Q4. During Q1, we spent $62 million repurchasing about 2 million shares and as of September 30, we had approximately 3.2 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares in the December quarter. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of 169 million for Q2. 
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $1.5 billion, about even with the prior quarter end. Cash generated from operations was $96 million in Q1, compared with $83 million in Q4. Quarter-over-quarter increase in operating cash flow largely resulted because we had $133 million more in customer collections, and we did not have to make a $26 million semiannual interest payment this quarter. These effects were partially offset by larger outlays, including annual bonus payments we made in September. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $500 million, up from $440 million at June 30, largely resulting from the $55 million increase in shipments from Q4 to Q1. DSOs were 67 days at September 30 versus 72 days at the end of June. All DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factory. Net inventories increased by $62 million in June 30 and ended the quarter at $464 million. Inventory turnover baked upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.3 turns in Q1, flat with Q4. Net capital expenditures were $11 million in Q1 versus $6 million in Q4. Total headcount at September 30 was 5,180, up from 4,989 at June 30. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q2. 
In summary, our guidance for Q2 is new orders flat to down 20% from Q1, total revenue between $700 million and $740 million, non-GAAP EPS between $1 and $1.10, assuming the tax rate of 30% of the pretax income. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A."

You go across the space, and there's a lot of investment across foundries. Whether 2011 will repeat 2010, our current model is we see 2011 not only being flat, but what we see in 2010 is shaping up to be very hard to predict at this time where that will happen inside of the different segments. But we think foundry stays pretty strong, logic pretty steady, and I think DRAM's probably remaining soft, offset by NAND spending continuing. That's kind of how we see it."

First of all, it usually takes at least 90 days to turn shipments into revenue when you get into just passing the units along, installing customer burn-in and then the product final acceptance. When we're moving in, let's call it normal circumstances, which isn't that often as it turns out, you will see a 90-day turn of that or a little bit longer than 90 days. When you're in a step-up ramp like we're in right now, it takes a little bit longer to turn that into revenue. I will say this, however, in Q1, we actually revenued ahead of the prior quarter's shipments. So we actually revenued $683 million this quarter, and we shipped $622 million last quarter. So it can move back and forth. That won't happen every quarter, but it will happen often enough just to let you know that it should vacillate at 90 or slightly greater than 90 days.

It is possible that we would have some upward pressure on the R&D line next year just as function of the total OpEx and as a function of revenue. And that could be just as a result of the timing in new product introductions and certainly, EUV is a big frontier for us on the R&D side. What you'll see right now is that we previously laid out the model for KLA-Tencor. We're experiencing levels of profitability in the current performance that were considerably ahead of where we were before. And we believe moving into this period, when we spoke in 3 or 4 years ago, we believe that we would get a 200 to 300 basis point improvement, both from the operational improvements and some of the decisions that we made with respect to offshore manufacturing and things like that, 200 to 300 basis point improvement in operating margin. We obviously are getting more than that right now. But that is certainly partially a function of the actions we took, but it's also partially a function of the timing of when new projects come on board and when new R&D hits. And it's possible we could experience some of that pressure as we look out into the first half of next year and certainly beyond that a little bit.

Thank you all for joining us for our call today. I'm going to focus my commentary on the summary highlights of the September quarter and then provide guidance for December, then Mark is going to follow with the review of the financials. First",1049,"Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us for our call today. I'm going to focus my commentary on the summary highlights of the September quarter and then provide guidance for December, then Mark is going to follow with the review of the financials. First of all, there's no shortage of debate today as to the pace of the global economic recovery or near-term direction in semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment market. But KLA-Tencor's September results demonstrate that process control adoption remains at a very high level. Our numbers also show the company is successfully executing on our long-term strategic objectives, delivering sustained market leadership, strong revenue growth, record margins, record earnings per share in the quarter. New bookings in the September quarter were $785 million. That's the third highest level in the company's history. The high level of demand we're experiencing today is driven by the combination of strong adoption in the core markets and the healthy contribution from new markets and our services business. Revenues grew 22% sequentially to $682 million, significantly above the range of guidance and indicative of the high sense of urgency among our customers for getting our latest generation process control technologies qualified and in place. Non-GAAP earnings was a record $0.99 per share in Q1, significantly above the guidance range of $0.80 to $0.88 per share. Underlying this outstanding financial performance in Q1 were record non-GAAP gross margins of 62% and record non-GAAP operating margins of 36%, with incremental margins coming in above our 60% to 70% target for gross margin and our 50% to 60% target for operating margin. And we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $1.4 billion in backlog.
Now in response to the high levels of demand we've been experiencing lately, we're focused on driving our operations to meet customer requirements, and we are positioned for continued growth in shipments, revenue and earnings as we move forward. Our strong financial performance is a result of KLA-Tencor's technology and market leadership, and it demonstrates the value our technology and services deliver in helping our customers execute their leading-edge technology roadmaps. It also helps us sustain the high level of R&D, which is essential to achieve our customer focus and growth strategies and provides the resources for us to deliver significant cash returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
To that end, KLA-Tencor repurchased approximately 2 million shares of our common stock for approximately $62 million and paid cash dividends of approximately $42 million in the quarter. As you may recall, on July 13, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the level of the quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share, which took effect  with our first quarter dividend. That move reflects management and the board's confidence in the long-term outlook for the company, as well as the ongoing efforts to reward our shareholders for their continued investment.
Turning now into some specifics of the demand picture. Gross bookings in Q1 were $785 million, the third highest on record for KLA-Tencor but below the midpoint of the range of guidance for the quarter. The first quarter end market picture was highlighted by a sustained strong demand from foundries, coming in at 44% of new orders in the September quarter. Our foundry customers are operating at high levels of capital intensity as they expand capacity to address the highly competitive environment and increased business levels, driven by rapid proliferation of new fabless designs. Looking at the memory market, bookings for memory customers were 38% of the total in Q1. While DRAM pricing and PC demand have been declining of late, our leading-edge DRAM customers remain very profitable and are sustaining their investments to transition to the 4x nanometer and the 3X nanometer technology nodes.
We also saw an increase in NAND equipment demand in Q1 to meet strong bit growth, driven by rapid adoption of smartphones and tablet PCs. Orders from NAND flash customers grew to 72% of memory orders, with market leaders investing to ramp 30-nanometer and to qualify 20-nanometer technologies. Logic was 18% of bookings in September, driven by the continued migration to 22-nanometer. Now as you know, technology changes that enable Moore's Law are constant in our industry. But regardless of where we are in the industry cycle, chip manufacturers are continuously innovating to lower the cost of production and improve performance of their products, and process control is essential to successful innovation.
Although orders remained at a high level compared with historical averages, the downward trend in bookings in the first quarter following an extended period of robust growth, was consistent with seasonality for KLA-Tencor. It's also indicative of a more cautious approach our customers have recently adopted with their capital spending budgets as weakening consumer PC demand and persistent uncertainty regarding the macro economy have impacted spending in the short term. However, overall semiconductor industry dynamics remain healthy, and the importance of maintaining cost and performance leadership continues to drive investment at a high level. Current external market estimates have semiconductor revenues growing in the range of 30% in calendar 2010, with growth currently forecast in the mid-single digits for calendar 2011. Fab utilization also remains at a high level, and the WFE market is forecast to grow 120% in calendar 2010, with 2011 expected to be roughly flat year-over-year. We're tracking 13 new fab projects currently in development or scheduled to qualify over the next several quarters.
The majority of semiconductor capital spending today is focused primarily on technology investment and not capacity. And that focus is a key driver of the high demand we're seeing in process control. And with the continued success of new products and sustained market leadership, coupled with our strong backlog and high-performance business model, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to deliver outstanding revenue, profitability and earnings as we move ahead.
Moving now to guidance. Gross bookings in December are projected to be flat to down 20%. We also expect continued revenue growth and strong margin performance, with December revenue expected to be in the range of $700 million to $740 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.00 to $1.10 per share. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his review of the numbers."

As most of you know, we present our income statement in 2 formats, one under U.S. GAAP then the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisition, expenses associated with our stock options related litigation and certain costs and expenses, which are outside of our core operations, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks in operations will refer to non-GAAP information, but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website. The differences between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are acquisition-related charges of $8 million before taxes or $0.03 a share after taxes, and a $9 million noncash tax charge due to a cumulative shortfall position in our employee stock activity. Removing this charge from GAAP earnings added about $0.06 per share to non-GAAP EPS.
Following our record Q4, the Q1 new order total was $785 million, which is our third best quarter ever. Net orders were $787 million. Revenue and EPS for Q1 were above the top end of our guidance ranges we issued in July, as we process the strong order pickup we experienced in the last few quarters. The regional distribution of new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows: the U.S. was 21% of new systems orders in Q1, down from 25% in the June quarter; Europe was 4% of new systems orders, down from 12% in Q4; Japan was 7%, down from 12% last quarter; Korea was 24%, up from 19% last quarter; Taiwan was 34%, up from 18% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 10%, down from 14% in Q4. The Q1 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows: wafer inspection was 49% compared with 48% last quarter; reticle inspection was 11% down, from 19% last quarter; metrology was 17%, up from 14% in prior quarter; solar, storage, high-brightness LED and other nonsemi was 6%, even with last quarter; and services was 17% of new orders in Q1, up from 13% last quarter. Foundry customers comprise 44% of semiconductor systems orders in Q1 versus 41% in Q4. Logic customers were 18% of systems orders in Q1 versus 21% in Q4, and memory system orders were 38% in Q1, even with last quarter. 67% of the semiconductor systems orders in Q1 were for 32-nanometer and below technology versus 41% in the June quarter.
Looking forward, we expect that new orders for our fiscal Q2 will be within the range of flat to down 20% from Q1. Shipments in Q1, which include both system shipments and services revenue, were $677 million, up from $622 million last quarter. We added a little over $100 million to our backlog in Q1 and ended the quarter with $1.44 billion in total systems backlog. The backlog at September 30 included $337 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue, and $1.1 billion in system orders that have not yet shipped. Systems revenue for Q1 was up 28% to $550 million compared with $430 million in Q4. Services revenue was $132 million in Q1, up slightly from $129 million in Q4. Our expectations for total revenue in Q1 is a range between $700 million and $740 million.
Non-GAAP gross margin was 62% in the September quarter, up 2 percentage points from June. For Q2, we are modeling an incremental gross margin target roughly equal to our stated goal of 60% to 70%. Operating expenses were $180 million, up $15 million from the June quarter. About $3 million of the quarter-to-quarter increase resulted from giving our employees new iPad devices and grossing them up for taxes. Another $3 million of the increase was due to Q4 credit in G&A expense for recovery of our claim arising from the Spansion bankruptcy, which did not repeat in Q1. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to increase slightly in Q2, in line with our stated incremental operating margin target of 50% to 60%. Other income and expense or OIE was a net $12 million expense in Q1, about $1 million higher than Q4. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $11 million in Q2.
In Q1, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $63 million or 27% pretax income versus $41 million in Q4, which was 25% of pretax income. The tax rate increase arose largely from a change in the distribution of earnings between the U.S. and lower tax international operations. Non-GAAP net income was $169 million or $0.99 per share in Q1. If we exclude the iPad distribution expense and apply our modeled tax rate of 38 -- excuse me, 30%, our Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.96. At the revenue range I previously mentioned, we would expect our Q2 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1 and $1.10 per share, assuming a tax rate of 30%. Weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q1 were 169.8 million versus 171.3 million in Q4. During Q1, we spent $62 million repurchasing about 2 million shares and as of September 30, we had approximately 3.2 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares in the December quarter. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of 169 million for Q2.
Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $1.5 billion, about even with the prior quarter end. Cash generated from operations was $96 million in Q1, compared with $83 million in Q4. Quarter-over-quarter increase in operating cash flow largely resulted because we had $133 million more in customer collections, and we did not have to make a $26 million semiannual interest payment this quarter. These effects were partially offset by larger outlays, including annual bonus payments we made in September. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $500 million, up from $440 million at June 30, largely resulting from the $55 million increase in shipments from Q4 to Q1. DSOs were 67 days at September 30 versus 72 days at the end of June. All DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factory. Net inventories increased by $62 million in June 30 and ended the quarter at $464 million. Inventory turnover baked upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.3 turns in Q1, flat with Q4. Net capital expenditures were $11 million in Q1 versus $6 million in Q4. Total headcount at September 30 was 5,180, up from 4,989 at June 30. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q2.
In summary, our guidance for Q2 is new orders flat to down 20% from Q1, total revenue between $700 million and $740 million, non-GAAP EPS between $1 and $1.10, assuming the tax rate of 30% of the pretax income. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A."

You go across the space, and there's a lot of investment across foundries. Whether 2011 will repeat 2010, our current model is we see 2011 not only being flat, but what we see in 2010 is shaping up to be very hard to predict at this time where that will happen inside of the different segments. But we think foundry stays pretty strong, logic pretty steady, and I think DRAM's probably remaining soft, offset by NAND spending continuing. That's kind of how we see it."

On the other hand, if we see more strength, let's say in the second half to our DRAM, then that could straighten the position of the DRAM customers, driving more investment by them.

Seems like you're building a decent amount of deferred revenue now. And just second question, sort of a bigger picture question, with still a lot of sort of new fab projects in the pipeline, particularly for NAND in 2011, there's this sort of common perception that NAND is less CapEx intensive than DRAM for semi-cap equipment spending overall?

So as a result, we are seeing increased activity and an increase in the process control percentage that people are willing to invest and need to invest. So I think for us, NAND is going to be a healthy market as we go forward. That said, we still got a lot of work to do to execute on our strategy to support that.

First of all, it usually takes at least 90 days to turn shipments into revenue when you get into just passing the units along, installing customer burn-in and then the product final acceptance. When we're moving in, let's call it normal circumstances, which isn't that often as it turns out, you will see a 90-day turn of that or a little bit longer than 90 days. When you're in a step-up ramp like we're in right now, it takes a little bit longer to turn that into revenue. I will say this, however, in Q1, we actually revenued ahead of the prior quarter's shipments. So we actually revenued $683 million this quarter, and we shipped $622 million last quarter. So it can move back and forth. That won't happen every quarter, but it will happen often enough just to let you know that it should vacillate at 90 or slightly greater than 90 days. I hope that's responsive to  your question. And again, if we meet the shipment profile, the revenue will follow relatively shortly thereafter in the next couple of quarters."
