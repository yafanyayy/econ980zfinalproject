I'm pleased to report that despite some significant challenges, FPL Group grew adjusted earnings per share by more than 5% in 2009 and continued its strong long streak of strong returns on equity by the earnin",1763,"Thank you Rebecca and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that despite some significant challenges, FPL Group grew adjusted earnings per share by more than 5% in 2009 and continued its strong long streak of strong returns on equity by the earning 13.5% adjusted ROE. NextEra Energy Resources 2009 was another year of record adjusted earnings per share which grew by approximately 6% over 2008. The key drivers were new win projects and strong performance by our wholesale marketing and trading business and our Texas retail business. This strong economic performance occurred despite the expense outage at our Seabrook nuclear plant a polar wind resource of gross across our fleet of nearly 9000 turbines and unfavorable market conditions in Texas region. At Florida Power & Light come up for your earnings were approximately 4% per share principal drivers were favorable weather conditions during much of the year and completion of two generating units at our West County Energy Center in Palm Beach County which allowed for base rate adjustment under the Generation Base Rate Adjustment mechanism.These drivers were partially offset by the continuing effects of the fragile Florida economy including flat customer growth and weak underlying usage. For the fourth quarter of 2009, FPL Group's adjusted earnings were $323 million compared to $361 million in the prior-year quarter. As were the case for the full year, the most significant drivers were the outages at our Seabrook nuclear plant and exceptionally weak wind resource somewhat offset by higher than expected weather related usage in Florida.The outages at our Seabrook plant alone negatively affected earnings by $0.13. In addition, we are continuing to experience an El Ni√±o influenced weather pattern which we believe partially explains the reduction in short-term wind resources across Texas and the Midwest.Over the long-term, we remain confident in our wind resource projections. Armando will discuss zebra cottage in our wind resource analysis in more detail in a few moments.Although we are our 2009 adjusted earnings did not meet our original expectations we had a number of accomplishments during the year that should provide long-term benefits to our stakeholders. For example, our twin 1,220-megawatt combined cycle generating units at the West County Energy Center will increase the efficiency of FPL's generation lead providing savings the customer from slow cost reductions over the life of the projects and reduce emissions.In addition, with President Obama in attendance, FPL in October commissioned the DeSoto Next Generation Solar Energy Center, the largest solar photovoltaic power plant in the United States. Construction also began on FPL's Martin and Space Coast Next Generation Solar Energy Center which was slated to open this year. I think in no FPL will cover the cost of these projects under a Florida statute enacted to encourage renewable energy projects.Operationally, FPL's fossil fuel fleet reached a record level of efficiency in 2009. FPL's investment since 2002 in cleaner more efficient technology avoided approximately 4.9 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2009 and saved customers an estimated $440 million in fuel costs during the year.No less important are FPL's efforts to prudently manage cost. For all of 2009, FPL's O&M expenses were $1.42 per kilowatt hour. Industry as whole over them expenses were $2.11 per kilowatt hour as of 2008, the most recent data available. NPL's efficiency is matched by its reliability with the company's assisted average interruption duration index is up 47% better than the national average.NextEra Energy Resources, we added approximately 1,170 megawatts of wind capacity in North America in 2009. We now own 7,540 megawatts of wind capacity in 17 states in Canada, maintaining our position as North America's wind energy leader. Today, our total investment in wind is approximately $11 billion.In addition, you've heard me say before that we hope solar will be the next wind business in next energy resources. And that strategy has started to bear fruit in 2009. In October, we found large long-term power purchase agreement with Pacific Gas and Electric Company for the sale of 250-megawatt solar thermal power from our proposed Genesis Solar Energy Project. This plant would use the same basic technology we have mastered at our existing solar arrays in California.The Genesis project is expected to produce enough renewable electricity to power more than 80,000 homes while creating jobs and a positive economic impact for California's Riverside County.Also during the year, we completed a roughly 200-mile generation timeline linking some of our West Texas wind assets to the more favorable South Texas zone. And we continued to prudently grow our wholesale marketing and trading business in conjunction with the growth of next year generation business.And lastly, we were able to finance the growth of our portfolio on a primarily nonrecourse base during the year, the especially difficult financing environment that prevailed for much of the year. It is attributed to the quality of our deal that they were able to meet the market test for finance ability by a third-party.Overall, we were able to raise approximately $1.1 million billion in project financing during the last 12 or so months.Let me spend a moment on the outcome of our rate proceedings before the Florida Public Service Commission which as you know from our prior comments was extremely disappointing to us. We'll get into some of the details of the commission's decision later on the call but as you know, the decision caused us to suspend some of our large capital expenditure projects pending further review.As I said immediately after the commissioners concluded our rate case, historically Florida has been constructive regulatory environment which is provided benefits to both customers and investors. This historically favorable environment has allowed us to invest billions of dollars to benefit Florida FPL customers were having reasonable confidence that our investors will be allowed to earn their returns.While the proceedings of two weeks ago clearly indicates that the situation has changed, we need to be mindful that the poor economic climate in Florida has significantly impacted our customers and the political environment. And this in turn affected our rate proceedings including the ultimate outcome.I remain optimistic that as the Florida economy improves, and as we do a better job telling our story, the regulatory climate will improve. Now despite the setback, I want to remind you that we continue to have certain attractive elements to our regulatory structure including clauses for fuel, energy efficiency and environmental cost. We also have immediate increases to rates in our new solar projects and our nuclear upgrades and cost recovery from new nuclear development in latency costs.Over the long-term, I continue to be optimistic about Florida's prospects. Our state has historically been one of the fastest-growing in the nation. With good weather, no state income taxes, and affordable housing, combined with the baby boomers starting to reach retirement age, we believe that Florida should return to strong growth.Now what I'm most disappointed about our rate case is that the company with the lowest rates of the State's 54 utilities, reliability that is 47% better than the national average, and power generation that is among the cleanest and most efficient in the country, namely Florida Power & Light, was granted the lowest ROE among the investor owned in 2009. This type of performance should be rewarded, not penalized.Never be disappointment must was not getting cost recovery progressed on the Unit 3 which is expected to go into service in mid-2011. This plant represents an investment of $865 million, for which we will get the return until we find another rate request. Either a limited scope rate case as has been suggested by one commissioner or a full-fledged case such as the one we just completed.Again, I don't think this is good regulatory policy either as likely put a dampen on future investment.Clearly, we need to do some things differently in response to the PSC's decision. We've already announced that we suspended for the time being our efforts on several large capital projects. And I emphasized the word suspend as opposed to the word canceled. These are significant projects that we ultimately hope to build and operate but the decision to suspend them were made in response to the negative impact negative decision NPL's creditworthiness and its ability to attract capital at attractive rates.honestly preserving FPL's credit rating is important to the customer rates low and for maintaining access to the capital markets. Our efforts to offset the negative impact of the rate decision on FPL's credit worthiness will necessarily involve reductions in capital spending, a point we repeatedly made throughout the period of the rate proceedings.As a result, we are reviewing our capital expenditure program to determine what changes we should meet our current capital plans. In doing so, we will carefully examine the impact of any potential changes on reserve margins, customer rates, reliability as well as the company's credit worthiness. Our review of major projects will also consider factors that may have changed his original investment decisions were made, including low growth estimates, fuel cost forecast, demand management requirements and environmental advances.It is important to note that we are continuing to invest in Florida's electrical infrastructure. Last year, our capital expenditures were $2.5 billion. And this year, despite suspending certain projects, we are still expecting to invest $22.4 billion, which is well in excess of FPL's cash generation.Is one commissioner noted, we are going to have to and I quote, ""tighten our belt."" This will be difficult given that our own M-cost per kilowatt hour are already 33% below the industry's 2008 average. Anything we do has to pass the test of not affecting customer service, safety or reliability.Our last full-fledged rate case was about 35 years ago. I think it's safe to say that we cannot go another five years without filing another rate case but we have not decided when we will do so again. We also need to work in communicating our messages better and being more in touch with all of our constituents in Florida. There is a lot we can learn from this experience and I assure you we will.We are currently undergoing a thorough review of FPL's operation and capital plans including the suspended projects. We intend to discuss these plans with investors and other constituents no later than the end of the second quarter.Finally, despite the setback at FPL, we expect decent growth in FPL Group 2010. Amanda will fill you in on the details when he discusses our updated guidance for 2010. And with that I will turn the call over to Armando Pimentel before returning for a few final remarks. Armando?"

In the fourth quarter of 2009, FPL Group's GAAP net income results were $349 million or $0.85 per share compared to $408 million or $1.01 per share during the fourth quarter of 2008. FPL Group's adjusted 2009 four",4332,"Thank you, Lew and good morning everyone. In the fourth quarter of 2009, FPL Group's GAAP net income results were $349 million or $0.85 per share compared to $408 million or $1.01 per share during the fourth quarter of 2008. FPL Group's adjusted 2009 fourth quarter earnings and EPS were $323 million and $0.79 respectively compared to $351 million or $0.19 per share in 2008.for the full year 2009 come FPL Group's GAAP net income results were $1.6 billion or $3.79 per share compared to $1.6 billion or $4.07 per share in 2008. FPL Group's adjusted 2009 earnings and EPS were $1.6 billion and $4.05 respectively compared with $1.5 billion or $3.84 per share in 2008.The difference between the GAAP results and the adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our non-qualifying hedge category and the exclusion of the net other than temporary impairments or OTTI.As you're well aware, whether has an impact on many of our businesses and in 2009 its effect was significant. The diversity of our company's operations in terms of geography, fuel and other factors means that weather may have offsetting impacts across our portfolio as was somewhat the case in 2009. This slide shows the fourth and full year 2000 results of actual weather both compared to the prior periods and to normal.In 2009, whether had a positive impact on Florida Power & Light's results for having an overall, negative impact on the portfolio of NextEra Energy Resources. In the fourth quarter alone, weather compared to normal was $0.05 lower than expected. Florida Power & Light's 2009 results were higher than we were expecting when we began the year although part of the improvement is due to favorable weather conditions. Fourth quarter 2009 earnings at Florida Power & Light were $186 million up 23% from $151 million a year ago. The corresponding earnings-per-share contribution was $0.45 this year versus $0.38 in 2008.Full year 2009 earnings were $831 million, up 5% from $789 million a year ago. The corresponding earnings-per-share contribution was $2.04 per share this year versus $1.96 per share in 2008. Based on preliminary data, the 12 month average regulatory ROE ending December 30, 2009 was 10.1%.Although we realized strong kilowatt hour sales growth in the fourth quarter, we caution investors that the underlying trends that drive our business remain weak. As you know, we monitor a number of economic and usage indicators to gauge the economic health of Florida in general and our customers in particular.The table in the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt hour sales versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt hour sales grew by 7.7%, an improvement due solely to higher weather-related usage.Usage growth due to weather helped the quarterly earnings comparisons by approximately $0.10 per share. For the full year, weather contributed $0.14 per share relative to the prior year.The right-hand graph at the top shows sequential changes in our quarterly customer accounts. Although there is a seasonal component to our customer base, the silent customer count grew slightly in the quarter. The graph in the bottom left-hand corner of this page shows inactive and low usage customers which we believe depict the level of empty homes in our service territory. Since year-end 2007, the number of inactive account as increased by about 68,000 to approximately 312,000 with most of that increase occurring in 2008.However, since the end of the third quarter, both the number of inactive and number of low usage customers have declined for the first time since 2007.The chart on the bottom right depicts a year-over-year change in housing starts for single family homes in FPL service territory. Housing starts are a fairly good leading indicator of additions to our customer base roughly a year out. As we have discussed, much of Florida's economic lows have been directly tied to the housing industry. After a prolonged period of decline, by the end of 2009, we actually saw some growth in housing starts. It is clearly too early to say that this is a long-term trend but we are encouraged by the increase in activity over the last couple of months.In sum, the general economic environment in Florida remains challenging and the outlook remains uncertain. The 11.8% unemployment rate in December is the highest unemployment rate in Florida since May, 1975. For comparison, the Florida unemployment rate was 11.1% in September and 8.8% in January, 2009.The table shown here summarizes the earnings drivers for Florida Power & Light for the just completed quarter as well as for the full year 2009. In total, the quarterly comparison increased by $0.07 per share driven primarily by favorable weather conditions and the rate adjustment for West County Units 1 and 2. These are partially offset by a higher O&M and depreciation expenses. Full year 2009 results were driven by favorable weather conditions and the addition of West County Units 1 and 2 partially offset by lower underlying usage and the higher O&M and depreciation expenses.After a very lengthy process, on January 13, the Florida Public Service Commission reached a decision on the revenue requirements portion of our rate increase request. There were approximately 170 individual issues that the commission had to decide but I will discuss only a handful of this with you today.Our adjusted regulatory equity ratio which is 59% of total sources of capital including short and long-term debt, was approved by the commission. This is the actual amount of equity that we have in the business today and is what we requested in our filings. The equity ratio when compared to all sources of regulatory capital, including customer deposits, and deferred taxes, is 47%.The commission authorize regulatory return on equity of 10% plus or minus 100 basis points. Importantly, this also affects the return we earn on investments recovered through environmental costs which is our solar and investment compliance with environmental laws are recovered. As part of our rate case, it was determined that we have approximately $895 million of theoretical net depreciation surplus. FPL requested these we amortize the remaining lives of assets however the commission decided that we should amortize this amount to customers over the next four years.This will reduce depreciation expense by approximately $224 million per year over that period. Under our previous rate agreement, we had been reducing depreciation expense by roughly $125 million per year. Along with other changes in the depreciation parameters, we expect these depreciation expense in 2010 to be $30 million to $45 million lower than in 2009.The commission decided against a subsequent year revenue adjustment for 2011 and voted against the extension of the GBRA mechanism which will allow us to adjust based base rates for the first year revenue requirements of West County 3 upon its expected completion this summer of 2011. In summary, the decisions resulted in revenue requirement attributable to base rates of $75 million on an annualized basis.As such, we expect cash from operations in 2010 to be slightly higher than 2009 excluding the effects of the fuel clause. As Lew mentioned, there are many questions need to address for the business on a go forward basis. We are in the process of doing that and expect to further communicate our plans before the end of the second quarter.Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Resources where adjusted earnings per share were higher by approximately 6% for the full year driven by new wind additions and strong growth in our Wholesale, Marketing and Trading business. Those earnings however, were tempered by the extended outage at Seabrook Station, poor wind resource across our wind fleet and an unfavorable market conditions at our Texas fossil fuel facilities. They finished 2009 at approximately 1170 megawatts of wind facilities. During the fourth quarter, we close in our acquisition of 185 megawatts of recently completed wind projects from Babcock & Brown for approximately $352 million. For 2010, we are well hedged against the impacts of natural gas price movements and very significantly hedged against other price movements including spark spreads. Roughly 96% of equivalent gross margin we expect our existing asset portfolio to generate in 2010 protected against commodity price volatility.For 2011, comparable figures about 92% regarding sensitivities, the earnings sensitivity to change the natural gas prices on our 2010 open positioned as modest.For every dollar per MMBTu change in gas prices, the annualized impact is approximately $0.01 per share on an adjusted earnings basis at FPL Group for 2011, the equivalent adjusted earnings sensitivity is approximately $0.04 per share. As we have highlighted to you in many occasions, significant portion of our gross margin and earnings are generated by assets under long-term contracts. The weighted average remaining contract life of our non-wind assets that are under long-term contracts is 15 years. The comparable figure for the contracted wind assets is 17 years. The remaining contract lives are weighted by the gross margin dollars expected over the remaining lives of the various contracts.For certain wind facilities, we were eligible for an elective to receive production tax credits or PTCs for the first 10 years of the wind facilities lines. They will begin to have an increasing amount of PG see expirations as we begin the ten-year anniversary of Assets Put in Service as we ramped up our wind development program. In 2010, we will have an approximately $11 million less in equivalent gross margin relative to 2009 due to PTC expirations.In 2011, and 2012, the comparable figures are $24 million and $60 million respectively. The appendix to this presentation contains both the typical information we provide to you regarding our hedging status as well as these new pieces of information.For the fourth quarter of 2009, NextEra Energy Resources GAAP earnings were $170 million or $0.43 per share compared with $255 million or $0.66 per share in the prior period results. Adjusted earnings for the same period, which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges in net OTTI, were $152 million compared to $218 million. The equivalent adjusted earnings per share contributions were $0.37 and $0.55, respectively.for the full year 2009, NextEra Energy Resources GAAP earnings were $849 million or $2.08 per share compared with $915 million or $2.27 per share in 2008. Adjusted earnings which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges and net OTTI, were $882 million compared to $821 million. The equivalent adjusted earnings per share contributions were $2.16 and $2.04 per share, respectively.NextEra Energy Resources fourth quarter adjusted EPS declined $0.18 from last year's comparable quarter, a disappointing result relative to our expectations. Although we realized strong contribution from our new assets, our retail business and our Wholesale, Marketing and Trading business, performance from our existing assets was hindered by several factors, including the planned and extended outages at the Seabrook nuclear facility and the four wind and resource across our fleet.New wind investments contributed $0.10 per share incrementally, approximately $0.08 per share of this $0.10 improvement can be attributed to our decision to elect convertible investment tax credits this on 815 megawatts of wind build. On its own, the outage at Seabrook we've renewed by $0.13 per share compared to prior year. $0.05 due to the planned refueling, which we did not have in the comparable quarter last year and $0.08 due to the outage being extended.Poor wind resource across all geographies reduced results by $0.07 this quarter and contributions from our Texas gas fired facilities fell $0.07 per share relative to a year ago. Due to the significant impact on our earnings, we wanted to provide some additional detail on the Seabrook outage that occurred during the quarter. In October, Seabrook was taken off-line for a planned refueling outage after completing a record 511 day run of uninterrupted service.One element of the outage involved the replacement of one low-pressure rotor and the steam turbine with a new more efficient router. As the unit was ramping up, the full power in November 14, a higher-than-expected vibration level was detected in the steam turbine and units electricity output was reduced to 65% to minimize the vibration to allow for careful analysis of the problem. On December 6, the plant was taken off-line to implement the appropriate corrective measures and it was returned to service on December 24. The plant continues to operate today at full output and all indicators are within normal ranges. Safety is always our highest priority and at no time that the vibration level compromised nuclear safety.The wind resource in the fourth quarter was well below normal impacting the existing assets results by roughly $0.07 per share as compared to the year ago period. For the year, the full wind resource has reduced per share result relative to the prior year by approximately $0.15.Wholesale marketing and trading activities increased by $0.09 per share as market conditions were beneficial to this business. As we've indicated before, quarterly results from this segment will often be higher or lower than we expect based on a number of factors including market volatility and opportunities. All other factors that at a loss of $0.04 per share. Of this once it is attributable to higher interest expense, corporate G&A and taxes of 1 cent and share dilution and rounding of 1 cent each.for the full year 2009, adjusted earnings per share grew over 6% driven by new wind additions strong growth in our retail and wholesale power market in trading business, offset by the per wind resource, the outage at Seabrook and adverse market conditions across our market merchant fleet. New wind additions contributed $0.42 which includes $0.22 on our election to receive tax credits on 815 megawatts.From a cash perspective, this convertible investment tax credits totaled $470 million of which we have already received $100 million in cash in 2009 and expect to receive the balance in the first quarter of 2010.For the full year, the contribution from existing wind assets declined $0.19 most of which was due to the poor wind resource. Remembering that we manage our Texas business as a portfolio, our Texas merchant gas facilities were negatively impacted by $0.20 compared to the prior year due to poor market conditions while our Retail Supply business was up $0.10 due to lower energy supply costs.Approximately 90% of Retail Energy business' gross margin is generated in taxes. Remember that fore purposes of this light, retail business is part of existing asset.for the year, the merchant Northeast asset were down $0.03 due largely to unfavorable market conditions for the gas and Hydro assets and the outages at Seabrook in the fourth quarter offset partially by the lack of a refueling outage at Seabrook in the first quarter and favorable pricing at Seabrook. Wholesale marketing and trading contributed an additional $0.19. We will provide some additional color on the breakdown of all of our supply related and non-asset based businesses later in my remarks. The other category includes the impact of higher interest expense, corporate G&A, rounding differences and share dilution.As we anticipated in our third quarter conference call, the wind resource was particularly poor during the fourth quarter and indeed this entire year. To put it into perspective, based on actual wind speed observations, and public meteorological towers near our projects, this quarter was the worst quarter and this year, the worst year over the last 30 years. On the slide , we show both the fourth quarter and full year 2009 average historical wind speeds from 34 meteorological towers we believe are most geographically relevant to our various wind facilities.The raw data used to build this index is publicly available via Noah's website for a nominal annual fee. We wait these by our estimates of the long-term estimate megawatt production took for the portfolio. This wind speed index is intended to reflect the most basic components of the wind resource break it simply an indication of how fast the wind was blowing at a meteorological Mac measurement towers at specific points in time. This index is different from the wind energy index that we have shown in the past and that year, we have not made any adjustments to the data such as incorporating adjustments for the higher turbine height and running this adjusted wind speeds to turbine specific our curbs.Before you attempt the model of the wind resource yourselves, we would like to caution you that while we believe the wind speed at this towers can give you a good general sense of the wind resource, they do not give you the entire picture of what drives our wind fleet performance. The bottom 2 graphs of the slide show you the reason the wind speed index and the actual wind performance of our wind projects in Texas and the Midwest. These wind speed in this as our 93 and 75% correlated for our actual wind performance in Texas and the Midwest, respectively over the last two years.The aspects of the wind resource that are not captured by the simple measure of wind speed at the public towers include the fact the fact that the government on towers are generally 10 miles of 50 miles from our wind facilities. The towers are often at 10 meters whereas our wind turbines are primarily at 50 meters or 80 meters and data are typically hourly average measurements that do not reflect the actual distribution of wind speeds over time.However, we thought it was important to give you an unbiased view of the wind resource from towers that we do not own or manage.On the third quarter call, we indicated to you that we believe there is a correlation between El Ni√±o weather patterns and poor wind resource particularly across Texas and the Midwest were many of our wind investments are located. The El Ni√±o effect was particularly strong during the fourth quarter and we believe this event explains some of the poor wind resource that we experienced.The U.S. Natural Weather Services Climate Prediction Center is forecasting that El Ni√±o has reached its peak and will continue to be in effect into the second quarter. Although the El Ni√±o weather pattern is as stated to moderate over time, it strengthens duration has been difficult to predict.To be clear though, it is not possible for us to say how much the El Ni√±o pattern directly affects wind results although we can see evidence of its effect. Looking back, we can tell you that approximately 40% of the days in which the wind resource was poor during the fourth quarter, the dominant weather pattern across Texas and the Midwest regions was consistent with the El Ni√±o.For forecasting purposes, we assume we will experience normal weather. As I noted at the beginning of my remarks, weather can have a positive or negative impact to the individual components of our business that I noted that across the portfolio, the various impacts may offset one another. for your reference, we estimate that based on the wind turbines we have in service as of December 31, 2009, each 1% change in annual production equates to approximately $0.02 impact to our adjusted earnings at FPL Group.During 2009, I indicated that we would be providing further details on the relative contributions from both our supply related businesses and our non-asset based businesses. As we have noted to you in the past, our supply related businesses include our full requirements in retail supply business. Our non-asset based category includes power and gas marketing and trading operations.Also as we noted in the first quarter, our expectations has been that we plan to grow these businesses generally in line with the gross margin growth of the rest of NextEra Energy Resources and then in aggregate, they have represented approximately 5% to 8% of the total gross margin of NextEra Energy Resources since late 2006, which is when we first started presenting the gross margin information in this fashion. We indicated to you in the third quarter that the businesses were growing a bit more this year due to the favorable market conditions. Today, we would like to provide some detail on the performance of both the supply related and non-asset based businesses on a gross margin basis.For the full year 2009, full requirements contributed $74 million and our retail operations contributed $132 million in gross margin. Remember that the full requirements in retail operations serve in part as a hedge of our assets. In 2009, we hedged approximately 3.2 million-megawatt hours, a full requirement in retail load with energy and/or basis from our portfolio of merchant-generation assets. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier in my comments, the results of our Texas portfolio are an example of the benefits of having these complementary businesses. During 2009, the prevailing market conditions have reduced the earnings contribution from our merchant, Texas Gas Asset, benefited our Texas Retail Supply business.Power and gas, marketing and trading contributed $205 million in gross margin. None of these gross margin numbers include G&A, interest or other corporate charges that these businesses need to operate. And the inclusion of these discharges would of course temper the results of these businesses to an extent. We wanted to give you a view based on gross margin information since that is what we have previously provided. We have also provided the comparable gross margin contribution for the businesses for 2008. You will notice on the 2010 and 2011 slides located in the appendix of this presentation, that we have included gross margin detail for both the supply related and Non-Asset Based businesses. Providing further details on these businesses will be something that we plan to continue to work on during 2010.To summarize 2009, fourth quarter results on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.45, NextEra Energy Resources contributed $0.37 and Corporate and Other was negative $0.03 contribution. As a total, $0.79 per share compared to $0.90 per share into 2008 fourth quarter or a 12% decrease year-over-year. On an adjusted basis for the full year 2009, FPL contributed $2.04, NextEra Energy Resources contributed $2.16 and Corporate and Other was a negative $0.15 contribution. As a total, $4.05 per share compared to $3.84 per share in 2008 or 5% increase year-over-year.For 2010, we believe that adjusted EPS expectations within the range of $4.25 and $4.65 are reasonable expectations. We are not providing earnings expectations beyond 2010 at this point, although we are currently planning on providing longer-term earnings expectations at our investor meeting in May.During the 2009 second quarter call, I mentioned that we were starting to see a slowdown in counterparties willingness to contract for long-term wind power. At the same time, we reduced wind build expectations for 2009 and the next several years. In addition, during the third quarter, I indicated that we have seen some pick up in activity in signing wind PPAs for our developed projects. I think it is fair to say that we had a very successful year, negotiating and signing wind purchase power agreements. Signing over 750 megawatts of long-term power purchase agreements during 2009, with an additional 300 to 400 of 2009 megawatts in advanced stages of negotiation. That said, the goal of adding a minimum of 1,000 megawatts of new wind with power purchase agreements over each of the next several years is not a slam dunk. The combination of lower power prices, primarily as a result of the economic downturn coupled with continued uncertainty regarding federal climate or renewable portfolio standards, is clearly adding to the industry's development challenges. We continue to see increased activity in the market for wind properties owned by distressed sellers when compared to six to nine months ago. We continue to be active on this front and are looking at a number of assets that we believe would fit nicely into our portfolio.  Although there's no assurance that any assets will be acquired, we are looking at several opportunities that will supplement the 1,000 megawatts of wind that we are expecting to add this year. As I have indicated before, we will have more to say about our long-term development plans for wind and other activities at our investor conference in May.Let me spend just a couple of minutes discussing our capital structure. Earlier this month, as a result of the FPL rate case, the three debt rating agencies placed the debt of both FPL and FPL Group capital on negative watch, signaling their intent to review the credit of the companies within the next 60 to 90 days. We have previously indicated to you, to both debt and equity investors, that we believe the strong capital position was important to our business model and we continue to believe that today. Over the last year or so, we have issued common stock through our aftermarket program totaling $160 million and plan to issue another $240 million to that same program this year subject to marketing conditions we view as acceptable. This would fulfill our goal of issuing $400 million of equity through this program in 2009 and 2010. This of course is not taking into account the ongoing issuances of common stock associated with our dividend reinvestment and employee programs which had roughly $40 million a year of issuances to those numbers.Also during 2009, we entered into a contract issue $350 million in equity in 2012, although essentially locking in the price of that issuance in 2009. We certainly understand that the outcome of the Florida rate case has caused some anxiety regarding the Florida regulatory and political environment. We cannot predict how soon this environment will improve. We also cannot predict what future actions each of the credit rating agencies will take on our debt ratings. However, our current and expected overall credit metrics remains strong. Additionally, we believe maintaining a strong balance sheet is in the long-term interest of our investors and our customers. We also believe that we can sustain our strong capital position while continuing to prudently invest in appealing opportunities that provide attractive returns to our shareholders. With that, let me now turn the call back over to Lew for some concluding remarks."

Even though we faced some unexpected challenges in 2009, we had a solid year overall, which is a testament to the strategy we've adopted at FPL Group. On a one-year basis, we delivered a total return to our shareholders of 9%, which lagged the 26% return by the S&P 500 Index, but exceeded the 3% return by the S&P Electric Utilities Index.Over the longer term, shareholders have been handsomely rewarded by FPL Group strategy. In the past five years, our 66% return easily outpaced the 37% return for the Electric Utilities Index, and the 2% return of the S&P 500. And over the 10 years, our 253% return towered over the 134% return by the Electric Utilities Index and the negative 9% return by the S&P 500. We're proud of the returns we have delivered to you over the past 10 years. And you have our commitment that we will work hard to make the next 10 years just as rewarding. What is consistent across both of our main businesses is a strong commitment to operational excellence, financial strength, financial discipline and being a leading player in building the leading clean energy company of the future. The focus on these areas has served us well in the past, and I'm confident it will do so as well in the future. Let me close by extending a special thanks to the 15,000 employees of FPL Group who made 2009 a solid year. I've never worked with a more talented and committed team. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the conference moderator for questions. Thank you."

Let me try to address them. First, I'd say it's more subjective rather than objective when we make a determination of how much visibility we need and to power purchase agreements for the year before we decide to move forward. But we clearly, even today, we have pretty good visibility into the types of power purchase contracts and the terms of those power purchase contracts that we can sign in 2010. That's one of the things that we look at before we sit here in front of you and say that we still feel comfortable with the roughly 1,000 megawatts of wind in 2010. That could change. Clearly, it could change. But we feel comfortable based on the number of projects that we have and the visibility that we have into PPAs. And you also inserted convertible ITC in that. I did go into some detail either last quarter or the quarter before as to how we look at convertible ITCs. It's not 10 projects, each of 100 megawatts that we have on the list and say these are absolutely the 10 projects that we're going to build and because it's only these 10, we have a pretty good indication of which ones we're going to take convertible ITC on because obviously, you have the wind resource information, you've run the economics and so on. Projects shift, if ever so slightly, and ones that you believe at the beginning of the year that you had good visibility to build this year may actually fall off the list for a number of factors. But right now, our plan for 2010 is to take the convertible ITC on essentially 800, I was thinking of another list, on approximately 800 of the 1,000 megawatts that we think we would build. For 2011 and 2012, the rules, as we understand them, and we certainly have had plenty of discussions with others that are in a better position to understand them than us, either ones that write them, we believe that we will have projects that are in construction at the end of 2010 that we'll get built in 2011 and 2012. It's a little early for us to say at this point how many of those projects we believe will qualify for convertible investment tax credit. But we believe it's going to be more than a small amount."

You're right, it is different than what some people believe our competitors are. But as I've tried to indicate over and over again to both equity and debt investors, it's really a different business from most folks that are out there, whoever might be on that competitor list. And NextEra Energy Resources has a business that is largely contracted for several years out with long-term contracts, with investment-grade counterparties. And it's also a business that we're growing, but we indicated that we would continue to grow that business prudently. We would continue to grow that business when we felt comfortable that the revenue stream i.e. the PPA or other mechanism we felt comfortable with. We were not going to be building merchant assets, and we haven't built merchant assets. I just want to clarify that first because I want to make sure that when we get lumped with others, that we all sit back and recognize that it really is a truly unique business. On what I thought was your primary point, how important is that to us and to the business,  Lew mentioned it, I mentioned it a couple of times, sitting here reading the script again, I almost thought to myself the third time I said it that, ""Gee whiz, maybe we said it too much."" But a strong financial position at both companies, we believe is in the long-term interest of our investors. Having said that, if you look at the credit metrics that we have, compared to others in the industry, our credit metrics in and of themselves are very strong. And it's something that we have focused on for a very long period of time. Certainly, even before I was here. Our credit metrics are improving year-over-year. And as I also indicated last year, if we were to go ahead with our plans for the next four to five years, that would mean some equity issuances in the future. We did that last year with our equity at the aftermarket program. I indicated just a couple of minutes ago that we were going to continue the aftermarket program this year to the tune of about $240 million. So I don't want anybody to think that it's not important to us, it clearly is important to us. But we're already a pretty strong company and we're truly unique."

As many of you know, next week, we are planning to host our Investor Conference which will be webcast.

As many of you know, next week, we are planning to host our Investor Conference which will be webcast. At that time, we plan to provide a strategy review of both of our main businesses, as well as our long-term growth prospects.
Today, we will review our results for the first quarter of 2010. FPL Group‚Äôs adjusted earnings per share results grew approximately 4% over the comparable period a year ago. Our quarterly results were driven by favorable weather and new asset additions at Florida Power & Light Company primarily offset by lower-than-normal wind resource at NextEra Energy Resources.
At FPL, we continued to make capital investments that we expect will improve our already clean emission profile and provide long-term customer benefits. On January 11, 2010, FPL‚Äôs electrical system experienced not only a new winter record peak demand, but also an all-time record peak demand of 24,346 megawatt hours. We are proud that our system performed well and FPL continued to provide safe and reliable service with minimal disruptions to its customers.
Shortly after the quarter ended, FPL commissioned the Space Coast Next Generation Solar Energy Center. It is located on NASA property at the Kennedy Space Center, and is producing an estimated 10 megawatts of clean, emissions-free power. With the completion of this facility, we have commissioned 35 megawatts of the total 110 megawatts of solar capacity that we indicated we would add at FPL. The 75-megawatt Martin Solar Thermal facility is expected to be placed in service by the end of this year.
The three facilities in total will add roughly $700 million to our rate base and be recovered through the environmental clause. Also in April, FPL announced that we signed a definitive agreement with the US Department of Energy to receive $200 million in Recovery Act Funding, which FPL will use to further our Energy Smart Florida initiative. Energy Smart Florida represents an expected overall investment of about $800 million. We are investing in Smart Grid technologies as part of our commitment to building a stronger, smarter, cleaner and more efficient electrical infrastructure.
Energy Smart Florida is designed to help keep service reliability high over the long term and get customers more information to manage their energy usage. The deployment of state-of-the-art Smart Grid technologies including smart meters which should improve the service we provide our 4.5 million customers and provide them with changeable benefits today while laying out the foundation for a host of future benefits. Although the weak wind resource negatively affected first quarter results of NextEra Energy Resources, the operational performance of our fleet was strong.
The forced outage rate for our fossil fleet was best-in-class for the industry based on available data and in addition the forced outage rate for our wind fleet was one of our best ever and continues to lead the industry.
Finally during the quarter, our Point Beach nuclear facility completed the refueling outage. In addition, we continued to pursue development opportunities in Canada, and a couple of weeks ago, we were awarded approximately 148 megawatts of wind projects in Ontario, Canada, as part of the province's feed-in tariff program.
We were excited that one of the projects we were awarded was the largest projects selected and that in total we were awarded approximately 12% of the total land-based wind projects. Separately, in the last couple of weeks, we commissioned 99 megawatts of new wind in the US and we have approximately 140 megawatts either under construction or approved for construction.
During the first quarter, FPL Group adopted a new method for allocating non-utility interest expense in shared service costs between our NextEra Energy Resources and Corporate and Other reporting segments. This change resulted a more meaningful current presentation of segment‚Äôs financial results. Previously, as our segment disclosures have shown, we have allocated interest expense in NextEra Energy Resources based on a deemed capital structure of 50% debt for operating projects and a 100% debt for projects under construction.
The allocation was based on our experience in financing our growth during the early part of the last decade. In practice, we have been successful in financing NextEra Energy Resources‚Äô growth, particularly through the use of projects that are wind projects with somewhat higher debt without adversely affecting our overall credit position. Consequently, we recently decided to review our methodology for allocating debt for segment reporting purposes.
Under the new methodology, interests allocated between NextEra Energy Resources and the Corporate and Other reporting segment based on a method that more closely aligns with actual leverage being employed at NextEra Energy Resources. The change impacts both GAAP segment disclosure and adjusted earnings results for the NextEra Energy Resources and Corporate and Other reporting segments. The main effects of this new allocation methodology will be first, NextEra Energy Resources‚Äô income will be lower than under the prior methodology while the Corporate and Other segment will be higher.
Second, NextEra Energy Resources‚Äô return on equity will be higher than under the prior methodology. It is important to recognize that we are not making any change in our overall financial policy with this change. We will continue to employ an overall financing strategy designed to achieve a target level of financial strength as reflected in our consolidated adjusted credit metrics. On a quarterly basis, we have always provided to you the GAAP debt equity ratios and the adjusted ratios in our earnings release, and we will continue to do so.
In addition to the change in interest allocation, certain shared service costs that were previously captured at Corporate and Other are now allocated directly to NextEra Energy Resources. We have summarized the impact of the change in the allocation of interest and shared services cost on this slide. Again to be clear, there is no impact of the consolidated financial statements of FPL Group or its credit metrics. There is also no change to the Florida Power and Light financial statements or credit metrics.
Additionally, you will note that the reallocation of these expenses does not significantly change any of the metrics that we have previously reported to you, including earnings growth at NextEra Energy Resources.
Now, let‚Äôs look at the results for the first quarter. In the first quarter of 2010, FPL Group‚Äôs GAAP net income results were $556 million or $1.36 per share compared to $364 million or $0.90 per share during the 2009 first quarter. FPL Group‚Äôs adjusted 2010 first quarter net income and EPS were $386 million and $0.94 respectively compared with $364 million or $0.90 per share in 2009.
The difference between the GAAP results and the adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our non-qualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments, or OTTI. As we discussed during the fourth quarter 2009 earnings call, sometimes weather has offsetting effects across our portfolio, due to the diversity of our company‚Äôs operations in terms of geography, fuel and other factors. All of that may not always be the case. In the first quarter, we again realized some offsetting impacts from weather at our two main businesses. This slide shows the impact of weather during the first quarter, both against the prior year as well as against normal.
Weather had a positive impact on Florida Power and Light results while having an overall negative impact on NextEra Energy Resources, resulting in a net negative $0.05 impact to adjusted earnings per share at FPL Group. The wind resource in the quarter was the worst it has been in 31 years of history. So far in April, the wind resource has improved, but does remain below normal. As we discussed in detail during the third and fourth quarter 2009 conference calls, the wind resource is primarily affected by local weather patterns. However, we also noted that we believe there is some correlation between the El Nino weather pattern and a poor wind resource in the Texas and Mid-West regions where many of our wind investments are located.
There continued to be strong evidence of the El Nino weather pattern during the first quarter. The US Climate Prediction Center currently predicts that the El Nino weather pattern will weaken during the second quarter. We spend a significant amount of time and resources evaluating historic, current and forecasted wind results, and we continue to be comfortable with demand on which we estimate wind resource for both investments and forecasting purposes. We will have additional detail on our work in this area at next week‚Äôs Investor Conference.
For the first quarter, Florida Power and Light reported net income of $191 million compared with $127 million in last year‚Äôs first quarter. The corresponding contributions to EPS were $0.47 this year compared to $0.31 last year. Florida Power and Light‚Äôs first quarter results were higher primarily due to weather and an increase in base revenues for the replacement and service of West County Energy Center units 1 & 2. As graphs on the accompanied slide illustrates, we are starting to see some signs of improvement in our customer metrics.
The table in the upper-left shows the change in retail kilowatt hour sales versus last year‚Äôs comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt hour sales grew by 6.6%, an improvement due primarily to higher weather-related usage. Usage growth due to weather helped the quarterly earnings comparisons by approximately $0.08 per share. Non-weather related or underlying usage growth remains under pressure due to a decline in economic conditions on a year-over-year basis.
Despite some positive signs in certain customer metrics, the general economic environment in Florida still remains challenging as evidenced by Florida‚Äôs unemployment rate, which rose to 12.3% in March of this year. The graph in the upper-right hand corner indicates sequential increases in customer accounts. As we have said before, during the downturn, the change in our customer accounts did not follow normal seasonal patterns, which historically had generally met higher increases in customer accounts during the fourth and first quarters of the year, and lower increases during the second and third quarters of the year.
Although we expect seasonality had something to do with the sequential improvement in the first quarter, we believe it is still a positive sign since it is the highest quarterly increase in customers on a sequential basis since 2007. As of March 31, 2010, we had approximately 14,000 more customers than we did at the end of March 2009. The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low usage customers, which we believe depicts a level of empty homes in our service territory. Since year-end 2007, the number of inactive accounts has increased by 53,000 to about 298,000. However, both the number of inactive and the number of low-usage customers have been declining since the fourth quarter of 2009.
The chart on the bottom right depicts the level of new housing starts for single-family homes in FPL‚Äôs service territory. Housing starts are fairly good leading indicator of additions to our customer base, roughly a year out. As we have discussed, much of Florida‚Äôs economic wealth has been directly tied to the housing industry. After a prolonged period of decline, we may be starting to see a bit of a bottoming here, but it is clearly too early to say that housing starts in our service territory are improving.
The table shown here summarize the earnings drivers for Florida Power and Light for the just-completed quarter. In total, earnings increased by $0.16 per share, driven primarily by weather and the increase in base revenues related to West County Energy Center‚Äôs units 1 & 2 as well as an increase in clause revenues from our solar investments in nuclear upgrades. These results were partially offset by slightly higher O&M costs and lower AFUDC, which are due primarily to the commissioning of West County Energy Center units 1 & 2.
Earlier this month, Florida Power and Light filed a motion with the Florida Public Service Commission for reconsideration and clarification of its final order in our rate proceedings. The motion requests corrections to specific computational errors on certain issues. In addition, the motion requests clarification of an inconsistency in the computation of the test year depreciation expense used in setting FPL‚Äôs base rates. Regardless of whether the commission ultimately concludes that revenue requirement should be higher or lower, FPL‚Äôs motion requested its commission resolve this through an adjustment to depreciation, which would keep rates and revenues the same as approved in January and implemented in March.
Approval of this approach will ensure that FPL‚Äôs reconsideration and clarification requests are addressed with no change in rates charged to customers and no change in revenues to FPL. At this point, the commission and its staff have not indicated when our motion for reconsideration will be addressed.
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Resources. Since the first quarter of 2009, we have added 1,360 megawatts of new wind and continued to be the nation‚Äôs leading producer of wind power. We are proud of this achievement considering the difficult market conditions for power purchase agreements. We will have more to say about this in a couple of minutes. During the first quarter of 2009, we received $314 million of the approximate $470 million we expect to receive in cash from the convertible investment tax credits related to our 2009 wind development efforts. Recall that we already received $100 million in 2009. Regarding our 2010 convertible IT fee elections, we concluded during the first quarter that it was probable that we would elect to take convertible IT fees on 600 megawatts of specific new wind projects we expect to be completed during 2010.
As a reminder, production tax credits reported in earnings as we produced power during the first 10 years of commercial operations. The earnings recognition of convertible investment tax credits is a bit more complicated. Roughly 25% of the earnings from convertible IT fees is related to a deferred tax benefit as recorded upfront in the year of project displacement service. The remaining 75% is recorded over the life of the project through reduced depreciation expense. GAAP accounting requires us to estimate this upfront deferred tax benefit and record the benefit throughout the year levelize our effective income tax rate. As conditions warrant during the year, we may elect to take more CIT fees in 2010 than the current 600 megawatts we have estimated and recorded.
On the financing front, we are pleased that we were able to issue approximately $560 million of project financed debt and roughly 458 megawatts of wind energy projects since the beginning of the year. These transactions were well received by the investment community and our sign that the project finance market continues to improve and generally remains accessible to NextEra Energy Resources projects.
There were no significant changes to our hedge gross margin during the quarter, and we continue to be well hedged in 2010 and 2011 against the impact of natural gas price movements. We will provide the gross margin hedging detail and additional information on our NextEra Energy Resources‚Äô assets next week at the Investor Conference.
NextEra Energy Resources reported first quarter 2010 GAAP earnings of $367 million or $0.89 per share, compared with $228 million, or $0.56 per share in the prior-period results. Adjusted earnings for the same period which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges and net OTTI were $196 million compared to $228 million. The equivalent per share contributions were $0.47 and $0.56 respectively. These amounts have been adjusted to reflect a retrospective application of a change in methodology for allocating interest and shared cost to affiliates.
NextEra Energy Resources‚Äô first quarter adjusted EPS declined $0.09 from last year‚Äôs comparable quarter. New wind investments contributed $0.03 per share. Because our estimate for CITC elections in 2010 is similar to what it was at this time last year, there is little variance in our adjusted earnings this quarter due to our CITC elections. The existing assets portfolio declined $0.08 relative to the prior year. Our existing wind assets declined $0.12, $0.09 of which can be attributed to the poor wind resource we already discussed. In the first quarter of 2009, we had realized a state investment tax credit on some of our wind projects that contributed $0.04 to last year‚Äôs results without a corresponding benefit this year.
Our NEPOOL merchant assets were up $0.03, owing primarily to higher-priced hedges at the Seabrook nuclear facility, but that was largely offset by the results of our Texas merchant gas assets. Wholesale marketing and trading activities increased by $0.03 per share. Substantially all of this increase can be attributed to the sale of a power supply contract that we had entered into in 2009. As a result of this sale, we realized nearly all of the value of the contract in the first quarter instead of ratably during the course of 2010.
Although the first quarter results were higher than we had previously expected due to the sale, full-year 2010 results are largely unaffected. We entered into the restructuring agreement as we felt that it allowed us to maximize the value of the opportunity for shareholders while reducing future load volatility risks. Asset sales contributed $0.02, $0.03 of which is due to the sale of our 40% limited partnership interest in a 27-megawatt waste to energy facility located in Pennsylvania. This was partially offset by the $0.01 gain in last year‚Äôs first quarter from the sale of wind development rights. Also during the first quarter of 2009, we made an investment in our Canadian wind operations that allowed us to reduce previously deferred income taxes. The absence of this benefit in 2010 reduced earnings by $0.04. All other factors were a negative $0.05. The other category includes interest expense, corporate G&A, shared dilution and rounding differences. No one item is particularly notable.
I would like to provide a brief update on our wind development plans for 2010. Since the fall of 2008, our new construction plans have been concentrating on developing wind plans where we believe there was a high likelihood that we would sell the plant‚Äôs power under long-term power purchase agreements. Most recently, during the fourth quarter earnings conference call, I stated that the goal of adding 1,000 megawatts of new wind in 2010 with power purchase agreements was not a slam dunk. The combination of lower power prices, the economic downturn and continued uncertainty regarding federal climate legislation or a renewable portfolio standard is clearly adding to the industry‚Äôs development challenges.
In the last couple of weeks, we have reevaluated our development pipeline for 2010, and at this point, believe that our wind build additions will be between 600 megawatts and 850 megawatts in 2010. This obviously does not include any wind assets that we could add through purchase transactions. Although we continue to look at a number of asset purchase transactions, there is obviously no assurance that we will be able to transact at prices that we would consider reasonable. Longer term, we continue to be optimistic about developing and owning wind and solar energy plants and we do not believe that the current development climate is indicative of longer-term trends.
We will discuss more details of our longer-term development goals at our upcoming Investor Conference. To summarize 2010 first quarter, on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.47, NextEra Energy Resources also contributed $0.47. That is a total of $0.94 compared to $0.90 in the 2009 first quarter or about a 4% increase year-over-year. For 2010, we continue to believe that adjusted EPS expectations within a range of $4.25 and $4.65 are reasonable. Currently, we are planning on providing longer-term earnings expectations at our investor meeting next week.
With that, I will turn the call over to the conference moderator for any questions.

As many of you know, next week, we are planning to host our investor conference which will be webcast. At that time, we plan to  
provide a strategy review of both of our main businesses as well as our long-term growth prospects. Today, we will review our results for the first quarter of 2010.
FPL Group's adjusted earnings per share results grew approximately 4% over the comparable period a year ago. Our quarterly results were driven by favorable weather and new asset  
additions at Florida Power & Light Company, primarily offset by lower-than-normal wind resource at NextEra Energy Resources. At FPL, we continue to make capital investments that  
we expect will improve our already clean emission profile and provide long-term customer benefits. On January 11, 2010, FPL's electrical system experienced not only a new winter  
record peak demand but also an all-time record peak demand of 24,346-megawatt hours. We are proud that our system performed well, and FPL continued to provide safe and reliable  
service with minimal disruptions to its customers.
Shortly after the quarter ended, FPL commissioned the Space Coast Next Generation Solar Energy Center. It is located on NASA property at the Kennedy Space Center and is  
producing an estimated 10 megawatts of clean emissions-free power. With the completion of this facility, we have commissioned 35 megawatts of the total 110 megawatts of solar  
capacity that we indicated we would add at FPL. The 75-megawatt Martin Solar Thermal facility is expected to be placed in service by the end of this year. The three facilities  
in total will add roughly $700 million to our rate base and be recovered through the environmental clause. 
Also in April, FPL announced that we signed a definitive agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy to receive $200 million in Recovery Act funding, which FPL will use to  
further our Energy Smart Florida initiative.  Energy Smart Florida represents an expected overall investment of about $800 million. We are investing in Smart Grid technologies  
as part of our commitment to building a stronger, smarter, cleaner, efficient electrical infrastructure. Energy Smart Florida is designed to help keep service reliability high  
over the long term and give customers more information to manage their energy usage. The deployment of state-of-the-art Smart Grid technologies, including smart meters, which  
should improve the service we provide our 4.5 million customers and provide them with tangible benefits today while laying out the foundation for a host of future benefits.
Although the weak wind resource negatively affected first quarter results at NextEra Energy Resources, the operational performance of our fleet was strong. The forced outage  
rate for our fossil fleet was best in class for the industry based on available data. And in addition, the forced outage rate for our wind fleet was one of our best ever and  
continues to lead the industry. Finally during the quarter, our Point Beach nuclear facility completed a refueling outage.
In addition, we continue to pursue development opportunities in Canada. And a couple of weeks ago, we were awarded approximately 148 megawatts of wind projects in Ontario,  
Canada as part of the province's Feed-in-Tariff program. We are excited that one of the project we were awarded was the largest project selected and that in total, we were  
awarded approximately 12% of the total land-based wind projects. Separately, in the last couple of weeks, we commissioned 99 megawatts of new wind in the U.S., and we have  
approximately 140 megawatts either under construction or approved for construction.
During the first quarter, FPL Group adopted a new method for allocating non-utility interest expense and shared service cost between our NextEra Energy Resources and corporate  
and other reporting segments. This change results in a more meaningful current presentation of segment financial results. 
Previously as our segment disclosures have shown, we have allocated interest expense in NextEra Energy Resources based on a deemed capital structure, 50% debt for operating  
projects and 100% debt for projects under construction. The allocation was based on our experience in financing our growth during the early part of the last decade. In practice,  
we have been successful in financing NextEra Energy Resources growth, particularly through the use of project-debt at our wind projects with somewhat higher debt without  
adversely affecting our overall credit position.
Consequently, we recently decided to review our methodology for allocating debt for segment reporting purposes. Under the new methodology, interest is allocated between NextEra  
Energy Resources and the corporate and other reporting segments based on a method that more closely aligns with actual leverage being employed at NextEra Energy Resources. The  
change impacts both GAAP segment disclosure and adjusted earnings results for the NextEra Energy Resources and corporate and other reporting segments. The main affects of this  
new allocation methodology will be: First, NextEra Energy Resources income will be lower than under the prior methodology while the corporate and other segment will be higher.  
Second, NextEra Energy Resources's return on equity will be higher than under the prior methodology.
It is important to recognize that we are not making any change in our overall financial policy with this change. We will continue to employ an overall financing strategy  
designed to achieve a target level of financial strength as reflected in our consolidated adjusted credit metrics. On a quarterly basis, we have always provided to you the GAAP  
debt to equity ratios and the adjusted ratios in our earnings release, and we will continue to do so.
In addition to the change in interest allocation, certain shared service costs that were previously captured at corporate and other are now allocated directly to NextEra Energy  
Resources. We have summarized the impact of the change in the allocation of interest and shared services costs on this Slide. Again, to be clear, there is no impact to the  
consolidated financial statements of FPL Group or its credit metric. There's also no change to the Florida Power & Light financial statements or credit metrics. Additionally,  
you will note that the reallocation of these expenses does not significantly change any of the metrics that we have previously reported to you, including earnings growth at  
NextEra Energy Resources.
Now, let's look at the results for the first quarter. In the first quarter of 2010, FPL Group's GAAP net income results were $556 million or $1.36 per share, compared to $364  
million or $0.90 per share during the 2009 first quarter. FPL Group's adjusted 2010 first quarter net income and EPS were $386 million and $0.94 respectively, compared with $364  
million or $0.90 per share in 2009. The difference between the GAAP results and the adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our non-qualifying hedge category and the  
exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments, or OTTI.
As we discussed during the fourth quarter 2009 earnings call, sometimes weather has offsetting effects across our portfolio due to the diversity of our company's operation in  
terms of geography, fuel and other factors. Although that may not always be the case in the first quarter, we again realized some offsetting impacts from weather at our two main  
businesses. This slide shows the impact of weather during the first quarter both against the prior year as well as against normal.
Weather had a positive impact on Florida Power & Light's results while having an overall negative impact on NextEra Energy Resources, resulting in a net negative $0.05 impact to  
adjusted earnings per share at FPL Group. The wind resource in the quarter was the worst it has been in 31 years of history. So far in April, the wind resource has improved but  
does remain below normal.
As we discussed in detail during the third and fourth quarter 2009 conference calls, the wind resource is primarily affected by local weather patterns. However, we also noted  
that we believe there's some correlation between the El Ni√±o weather pattern and a poor wind resource in the Texas and Midwest regions where many of our wind investments are  
located. There continued to be strong evidence of the El Ni√±o weather pattern during the first quarter. The U.S. climate prediction Center currently predicts that the El Ni√±o  
weather pattern will weaken during the second quarter. We spend a significant amount of time and resources in evaluating historic, current and forecasted wind results and we  
continue to be comfortable with the manner in which we estimate wind resource for both investment and forecasting purposes. We will have additional detail on our work in this  
area at next week's investor conference.
For the first quarter, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $191 million compared with $127 million in last year's first quarter. The corresponding contributions to EPS  
were $0.47 this year compared to $0.31 last year. Florida Power & Light's first quarter results were higher primarily due to whether and an increase in base revenues for the  
placement in service of West County Energy Center Units 1 and 2.
As graphs on the accompanying Slide illustrate, we are starting to see some signs of improvement in our customer metrics. The table in the upper left shows the change in retail  
kilowatt-hour sales versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt hour sales grew by 6.6%, an improvement due primarily to higher weather-related usage. Usage  
growth due to weather helped the quarterly earnings comparisons by approximately $0.08 per share. Non-weather-related or underlying usage growth remains under pressure due to a  
decline in economic conditions on a year-over-year basis.
Despite some positive signs in certain customer metrics, the general economic environment in Florida still remains challenging, as evidenced by Florida's unemployment rate which  
rose to 12.3% in March of this year. The graph in the upper right-hand corner indicates a sequential increases in customer accounts. As we have said before, during the downturn,  
the change in our customer account did not follow normal seasonal patterns, which historically had generally met higher increases in customer accounts during the fourth and  
first quarters of the year and lower increases during the second and third quarters of the year. Although we expect seasonality had something to do with the sequential  
improvement in the first quarter, we believe it is still a positive sign since it is the highest quarterly increase in customers on a sequential basis since 2007.
As of March 31, 2010, we had approximately 14,000 more customers than we did at the end of March 2009. The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low-usage  
customers, which we believe depicts the level of empty homes in our service territory. Since year-end 2007, the number of inactive accounts has increased by 53,000 to about  
298,000. However, both the number of inactive and the number of low-usage customers have been declining since the fourth quarter of 2009. The chart on the bottom right depicts  
the level of new housing starts for single-family homes in FPL's service territory. Housing starts are a fairly good leading indicator of additions to our customer base roughly  
a year out. As we have discussed, much of Florida's economic woes have been directly tied to the housing industry. After a prolonged period of decline, we may be starting to see  
a bit of a bottoming here. But it is clearly too early to say that housing starts in our service territory are improving.
The table shown here summarize the earnings drivers for Florida Power & Light for the just completed Quarter. In total, earnings increased by $0.16 per share driven primarily by  
weather and the increase in base revenues related to West County Energy Center's units 1 and 2 as well as an increase in clause revenues from our solar investments and nuclear  
upgrades. These results were partially offset by slightly higher O&M costs and lower AFUDC which are due primarily to the commissioning of West County Energy Center Units 1 and  
2.
Earlier this month, Florida Power and Light filed a motion with the Florida Public Service Commission
for reconsideration and clarification of it's final order in our rate proceeding. The motion requests corrections to specific computational errors on certain issues. In  
addition, the motion requests clarification of an inconsistency in the computation of the test year depreciation expense used in setting FPL's base rates. Regardless of whether  
the commission ultimately concludes that revenue requirements should be higher or lower, FPL's motion requested that the commission resolve this through an adjustment to  
depreciation which would keep rates and revenues the same as approved in January and implemented in March. Approval of this approach will ensure that FPL's reconsideration and  
clarification requests are addressed with no change in rates charged to the customers and no change in revenues to FPL.
At this point, the Commission and its staff have not indicated when our motion for reconsideration will be addressed. 
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Resources.  Since the first quarter of 2009, we have added 1360 megawatts of new wind and continue to be the nation's leading producer of wind  
power. We are proud of this achievement considering the difficult market conditions for Power Purchase Agreements. We will have more to say about this in a couple of minutes.
During the first quarter of 2010, we received $314 million of the approximate $470 million we expect to receive in cash from the convertible investment tax credits related to  
our 2009 wind development efforts. Recall that we already received $100 million in 2009. Regarding our 2010 convertible ITC elections, we concluded during the first quarter that  
it was probable that we would elect to take convertible ITCs on 600-megawatts of specific new wind projects we expect to be completed during 2010.
As a reminder, production tax credits recorded in earnings as we produced power during the first 10 years of commercial operations. The earnings recognition of convertible  
investment tax credits is a bit more complicated. Roughly 25% of the earnings from convertible ITCs is related to a deferred tax benefit and is recorded up front in the year a  
project is placed in service. The remaining 75% is recorded over the life of the project to reduce depreciation expense. GAAP accounting requires us to estimate this upfront  
deferred tax benefit and record the benefit throughout the year to levelize our effective income tax rate. As conditions warrant during the year, we may elect to take more CITCs  
in 2010 than the current 600-megawatts we have estimated and recorded.
On the financing front, we are pleased that we were able to issue approximately $560 million of project finance debt on roughly 458 megawatts of wind energy projects since the  
beginning of the year. These transactions were well-received by the investment community and are a sign that the project finance market continues to improve and generally  
remains accessible to NextEra Energy Resources projects.
There were no significant changes to our hedge gross margin during the quarter. And we continue to be well-hedged in 2010 and 2011 against the impacts of natural gas price  
movements. We will provide the gross margin hedging detail and additional information on our NextEra Energy Resources assets next week at the Investor Conference.
NextEra Energy Resources' reported first quarter 2010 GAAP earnings of $367 million or $0.89 per share, compared with $228 million or $0.56 per share in the prior-period  
results. Adjusted earnings for the same period, which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges and net OTTI, were $196 million compared to $228 million. The equivalent per  
share contributions were $0.47 and $0.56 respectively. These amounts have been adjusted to reflect the retrospective application of a change in methodology for allocating  
interest and shared cost to affiliates.
NextEra Energy Resources' first quarter adjusted EPS declined $0.09 from last year's comparable quarter. New wind investments contributed $0.03 per share. Because our estimates  
for CITC elections in 2010 is similar to what it was at this time last year, there is little variance in our adjusted earnings this quarter due to our CITC elections. The  
existing asset portfolio declined $0.08 relative to the prior year. Our existing wind assets declined $0.12, $0.09 of which can be attributed to the poor wind resource we  
already discussed. In the first quarter of 2009, we had realized a state investment tax credit on some of our wind projects that contributed $0.04 to last year's results without  
a corresponding benefit this year.
Our NEPOOL merchant assets were up $0.03, owing primarily to higher-priced hedges at Seabrook at the Seabrook nuclear facility. But that was largely offset by the results of our  
Texas merchant gas assets. 
Wholesale marketing and trading activities increased by $0.03 per share. Substantially all of this increase can be attributed to the sale of a power supply contract that we had  
entered into in 2009. As a result of the sale, we realized nearly all of the value of the contract in the first quarter instead of radibly [ph] during the course of 2010.  
Although the first quarter results were higher than we had previously expected due to the sale, full year 2010 results are largely unaffected. We entered into the restructuring  
agreement, as we felt it allowed us to maximize the value of the opportunity for shareholders while reducing future load volatility risk.
Asset sales contributed $0.02, $0.03 of which is due to the sale of our 40% limited partnership interest in a 27-megawatt waste-to-energy facility located in Pennsylvania. This  
was partially offset by the $0.01 gain in last year's first quarter from the sale of wind development rights. 
Also during the first quarter of 2009, we made an investment in our Canadian wind operations that allowed us to reduce previously deferred income taxes. The absence of this  
benefit in 2010 reduced earnings by $0.04.
All other factors were a negative $0.05. The other category includes interest expense, corporate G&A, share dilution and rounding differences. No one item is particularly  
notable. 
I would like to provide a brief update on our wind development plans for 2010.  Since the fall of 2008, our new construction plans have been concentrating on developing wind  
plants, where we believe there's a high likelihood that we would sell the plants' power under long-term power purchase agreements. Most recently, during the fourth quarter  
earnings conference call, I stated that the goal of adding 1,000 megawatts of new wind in 2010 with Power Purchase Agreements was not a slam dunk. The combination of lower power  
prices, the economic downturn and continued uncertainty regarding federal climate legislation or a Renewable Portfolio Standard is clearly adding to the industry's development  
challenges. 
In the last couple of weeks, we have re-evaluated our development pipeline for 2010, and at this point, believe that our wind build additions will be between 600 and 850  
megawatts in 2010. This obviously does not include any wind assets that we could add through purchase transactions. Although we continue to look at a number of asset purchase  
transactions, there's obviously no assurance that we will be able to transact at prices that we would consider reasonable.
Longer term, we continued to be optimistic about developing and owning wind and solar energy plants. And we do not believe that the current development climate is indicative of  
longer-term trends. We will discuss more details of our longer-term development goals at our upcoming Investor Conference.
To summarize the 2010 first quarter on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.47. NextEra Energy Resources also contributed $0.47. There's a total of $0.94 compared to $0.90 in  
the 2009 first quarter, or about a 4% increase year-over-year. For 2010, we continue to believe that adjusted EPS expectations within a range of $4.25 and $4.65 are reasonable.  
Currently, we are planning on providing longer-term earnings expectations at our Investor Meeting next week. With that, I'll turn the call over to the conference moderator for  
any questions."

As many of you know, next week, we are planning to host our investor conference which will be webcast.

As many of you know, next week, we are planning to host our investor conference which will be webcast. At that time, we plan to provide a strategy review of both of our main businesses as well as our long-term growth prospects. Today, we will review our results for the first quarter of 2010.
FPL Group's adjusted earnings per share results grew approximately 4% over the comparable period a year ago. Our quarterly results were driven by favorable weather and new asset additions at Florida Power & Light Company, primarily offset by lower-than-normal wind resource at NextEra Energy Resources. At FPL, we continue to make capital investments that we expect will improve our already clean emission profile and provide long-term customer benefits. On January 11, 2010, FPL's electrical system experienced not only a new winter record peak demand but also an all-time record peak demand of 24,346-megawatt hours. We are proud that our system performed well, and FPL continued to provide safe and reliable service with minimal disruptions to its customers.
Shortly after the quarter ended, FPL commissioned the Space Coast Next Generation Solar Energy Center. It is located on NASA property at the Kennedy Space Center and is producing an estimated 10 megawatts of clean emissions-free power. With the completion of this facility, we have commissioned 35 megawatts of the total 110 megawatts of solar capacity that we indicated we would add at FPL. The 75-megawatt Martin Solar Thermal facility is expected to be placed in service by the end of this year. The three facilities in total will add roughly $700 million to our rate base and be recovered through the environmental clause. 
Also in April, FPL announced that we signed a definitive agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy to receive $200 million in Recovery Act funding, which FPL will use to further our Energy Smart Florida initiative.  Energy Smart Florida represents an expected overall investment of about $800 million. We are investing in Smart Grid technologies as part of our commitment to building a stronger, smarter, cleaner, efficient electrical infrastructure. Energy Smart Florida is designed to help keep service reliability high over the long term and give customers more information to manage their energy usage. The deployment of state-of-the-art Smart Grid technologies, including smart meters, which should improve the service we provide our 4.5 million customers and provide them with tangible benefits today while laying out the foundation for a host of future benefits.
Although the weak wind resource negatively affected first quarter results at NextEra Energy Resources, the operational performance of our fleet was strong. The forced outage rate for our fossil fleet was best in class for the industry based on available data. And in addition, the forced outage rate for our wind fleet was one of our best ever and continues to lead the industry. Finally during the quarter, our Point Beach nuclear facility completed a refueling outage.
In addition, we continue to pursue development opportunities in Canada. And a couple of weeks ago, we were awarded approximately 148 megawatts of wind projects in Ontario, Canada as part of the province's feed-in-tariff program. We are excited that one of the project we were awarded was the largest project selected and that in total, we were  
awarded approximately 12% of the total land-based wind projects. Separately, in the last couple of weeks, we commissioned 99 megawatts of new wind in the U.S., and we have approximately 140 megawatts either under construction or approved for construction.
During the first quarter, FPL Group adopted a new method for allocating non-utility interest expense and shared service cost between our NextEra Energy Resources and Corporate and Other reporting segments. This change results in a more meaningful current presentation of segment financial results. 
Previously as our segment disclosures have shown, we have allocated interest expense in NextEra Energy Resources based on a deemed capital structure, 50% debt for operating projects and 100% debt for projects under construction. The allocation was based on our experience in financing our growth during the early part of the last decade. In practice, we have been successful in financing NextEra Energy Resources growth, particularly through the use of project debt at our wind projects with somewhat higher debt without adversely affecting our overall credit position.
Consequently, we recently decided to review our methodology for allocating debt for segment reporting purposes. Under the new methodology, interest is allocated between NextEra Energy Resources and the Corporate and Other reporting segments based on a method that more closely aligns with actual leverage being employed at NextEra Energy Resources. The change impacts both GAAP segment disclosure and adjusted earnings results for the NextEra Energy Resources and Corporate and Other reporting segments. The main effects of this new allocation methodology will be: First, NextEra Energy Resources income will be lower than under the prior methodology while the Corporate and Other segment will be higher. Second, NextEra Energy Resources' return on equity will be higher than under the prior methodology.
It is important to recognize that we are not making any change in our overall financial policy with this change. We will continue to employ an overall financing strategy designed to achieve a target level of financial strength as reflected in our consolidated adjusted credit metrics. On a quarterly basis, we have always provided to you the GAAP  
debt/equity ratios and the adjusted ratios in our earnings release, and we will continue to do so.
In addition to the change in interest allocation, certain shared service costs that were previously captured at Corporate and Other are now allocated directly to NextEra Energy Resources. We have summarized the impact of the change in the allocation of interest and shared services costs on this slide. Again, to be clear, there is no impact to the consolidated financial statements of FPL Group or its credit metrics. There's also no change to the Florida Power & Light financial statements or credit metrics. Additionally, you will note that the reallocation of these expenses does not significantly change any of the metrics that we have previously reported to you, including earnings growth at NextEra Energy Resources.
Now let's look at the results for the first quarter. In the first quarter of 2010, FPL Group's GAAP net income results were $556 million or $1.36 per share, compared to $364 million or $0.90 per share during the 2009 first quarter. FPL Group's adjusted 2010 first quarter net income and EPS were $386 million and $0.94 respectively, compared with $364 million or $0.90 per share in 2009. The difference between the GAAP results and the adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark [mark-to-market effects] in our non-qualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments, or OTTI.
As we discussed during the fourth quarter 2009 earnings call, sometimes weather has offsetting effects across our portfolio due to the diversity of our company's operations in terms of geography, fuel and other factors. Although that may not always be the case in the first quarter, we again realized some offsetting impacts from weather at our two main  
businesses. This slide shows the impact of weather during the first quarter both against the prior year as well as against normal.
Weather had a positive impact on Florida Power & Light's results while having an overall negative impact on NextEra Energy Resources, resulting in a net negative $0.05 impact to adjusted earnings per share at FPL Group. The wind resource in the quarter was the worst it has been in 31 years of history. So far in April, the wind resource has improved but does remain below normal.
As we discussed in detail during the third and fourth quarter 2009 conference calls, the wind resource is primarily affected by local weather patterns. However, we also noted that we believe there's some correlation between the El Ni√±o weather pattern and a poor wind resource in the Texas and Midwest regions where many of our wind investments are located. There continued to be strong evidence of the El Ni√±o weather pattern during the first quarter. The U.S. Climate Prediction Center currently predicts that the El Ni√±o weather pattern will weaken during the second quarter. We spend a significant amount of time and resources evaluating historic, current and forecasted wind results, and we continue to be comfortable with the manner in which we estimate wind resource for both investment and forecasting purposes. We will have additional detail on our work in this area at next week's investor conference.
For the first quarter, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $191 million compared with $127 million in last year's first quarter. The corresponding contributions to EPS were $0.47 this year compared to $0.31 last year. Florida Power & Light's first quarter results were higher primarily due to weather and an increase in base revenues for the placement in service of West County Energy Center units 1 and 2.
As graphs on the accompanying slide illustrate, we are starting to see some signs of improvement in our customer metrics. The table in the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt-hour sales versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt hour sales grew by 6.6%, an improvement due primarily to higher weather-related usage. Usage growth due to weather helped the quarterly earnings comparisons by approximately $0.08 per share. Non-weather-related or underlying usage growth remains under pressure due to a decline in economic conditions on a year-over-year basis.
Despite some positive signs in certain customer metrics, the general economic environment in Florida still remains challenging, as evidenced by Florida's unemployment rate which rose to 12.3% in March of this year. The graph in the upper right-hand corner indicates a sequential increases in customer accounts. As we have said before, during the downturn, the change in our customer account did not follow normal seasonal patterns, which historically had generally met higher increases in customer accounts during the fourth and first quarters of the year and lower increases during the second and third quarters of the year. Although we expect seasonality had something to do with the sequential improvement in the first quarter, we believe it is still a positive sign since it is the highest quarterly increase in customers on a sequential basis since 2007.
As of March 31, 2010, we had approximately 14,000 more customers than we did at the end of March 2009. The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low-usage customers, which we believe depicts the level of empty homes in our service territory. Since year-end 2007, the number of inactive accounts has increased by 53,000 to about 298,000. However, both the number of inactive and the number of low-usage customers have been declining since the fourth quarter of 2009. The chart on the bottom right depicts the level of new housing starts for single-family homes in FPL's service territory. Housing starts are a fairly good leading indicator of additions to our customer base roughly a year out. As we have discussed, much of Florida's economic woes have been directly tied to the housing industry. After a prolonged period of decline, we may be starting to see a bit of a bottoming here. But it is clearly too early to say that housing starts in our service territory are improving.
The table shown here summarize the earnings drivers for Florida Power & Light for the just-completed quarter. In total, earnings increased by $0.16 per share driven primarily by weather and the increase in base revenues related to West County Energy Center's units 1 and 2 as well as an increase in clause revenues from our solar investments and nuclear upgrades. These results were partially offset by slightly higher O&M costs and lower AFUDC which are due primarily to the commissioning of West County Energy Center units 1 and 2.
Earlier this month, Florida Power & Light filed a motion with the Florida Public Service Commission
for reconsideration and clarification of it's final order in our rate proceeding. The motion requests corrections to specific computational errors on certain issues. In addition, the motion requests clarification of an inconsistency in the computation of the test year depreciation expense used in setting FPL's base rates. Regardless of whether the commission ultimately concludes that revenue requirements should be higher or lower, FPL's motion requested that the commission resolve this through an adjustment to depreciation which would keep rates and revenues the same as approved in January and implemented in March. Approval of this approach will ensure that FPL's reconsideration and clarification requests are addressed with no change in rates charged to the customers and no change in revenues to FPL.
At this point, the Commission and its staff have not indicated when our motion for reconsideration will be addressed. 
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Resources.  Since the first quarter of 2009, we have added 1360 megawatts of new wind and continue to be the nation's leading producer of wind power. We are proud of this achievement considering the difficult market conditions for Power Purchase Agreements. We will have more to say about this in a couple of minutes.
During the first quarter of 2010, we received $314 million of the approximate $470 million we expect to receive in cash from the convertible investment tax credits related to our 2009 wind development efforts. Recall that we already received $100 million in 2009. Regarding our 2010 convertible ITC elections, we concluded during the first quarter that it was probable that we would elect to take convertible ITCs on 600-megawatts of specific new wind projects we expect to be completed during 2010.
As a reminder, production tax credits recorded in earnings as we produced power during the first 10 years of commercial operations. The earnings recognition of convertible investment tax credits is a bit more complicated. Roughly 25% of the earnings from convertible ITCs is related to a deferred tax benefit and is recorded up front in the year a  project is placed in service. The remaining 75% is recorded over the life of the project to reduce depreciation expense. GAAP accounting requires us to estimate this upfront deferred tax benefit and record the benefit throughout the year to levelize our effective income tax rate. As conditions warrant during the year, we may elect to take more CITCs  
in 2010 than the current 600-megawatts we have estimated and recorded.
On the financing front, we are pleased that we were able to issue approximately $560 million of project finance debt on roughly 458 megawatts of wind energy projects since the beginning of the year. These transactions were well-received by the investment community and are a sign that the project finance market continues to improve and generally remains accessible to NextEra Energy Resources projects.
There were no significant changes to our hedge gross margin during the quarter. And we continue to be well-hedged in 2010 and 2011 against the impacts of natural gas price movements. We will provide the gross margin hedging detail and additional information on our NextEra Energy Resources assets next week at the Investor Conference.
NextEra Energy Resources' reported first quarter 2010 GAAP earnings of $367 million or $0.89 per share, compared with $228 million or $0.56 per share in the prior-period results. Adjusted earnings for the same period, which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges and net OTTI, were $196 million compared to $228 million. The equivalent per  
share contributions were $0.47 and $0.56 respectively. These amounts have been adjusted to reflect the retrospective application of a change in methodology for allocating interest and shared cost to affiliates.
NextEra Energy Resources' first quarter adjusted EPS declined $0.09 from last year's comparable quarter. New wind investments contributed $0.03 per share. Because our estimates for CITC elections in 2010 is similar to what it was at this time last year, there is little variance in our adjusted earnings this quarter due to our CITC elections. The existing asset portfolio declined $0.08 relative to the prior year. Our existing wind assets declined $0.12, $0.09 of which can be attributed to the poor wind resource we already discussed. In the first quarter of 2009, we had realized a state investment tax credit on some of our wind projects that contributed $0.04 to last year's results without a corresponding benefit this year.
Our NEPOOL merchant assets were up $0.03, owing primarily to higher-priced hedges at Seabrook at the Seabrook nuclear facility. But that was largely offset by the results of our Texas merchant gas assets. 
Wholesale marketing and trading activities increased by $0.03 per share. Substantially all of this increase can be attributed to the sale of a power supply contract that we had entered into in 2009. As a result of the sale, we realized nearly all of the value of the contract in the first quarter instead of radibly [ph] during the course of 2010. Although the first quarter results were higher than we had previously expected due to the sale, full year 2010 results are largely unaffected. We entered into the restructuring agreement, as we felt it allowed us to maximize the value of the opportunity for shareholders while reducing future load volatility risk.
Asset sales contributed $0.02, $0.03 of which is due to the sale of our 40% limited partnership interest in a 27-megawatt waste-to-energy facility located in Pennsylvania. This was partially offset by the $0.01 gain in last year's first quarter from the sale of wind development rights. 
Also during the first quarter of 2009, we made an investment in our Canadian wind operations that allowed us to reduce previously deferred income taxes. The absence of this benefit in 2010 reduced earnings by $0.04.
All other factors were a negative $0.05. The other category includes interest expense, corporate G&A, share dilution and rounding differences. No one item is particularly notable. 
I would like to provide a brief update on our wind development plans for 2010.  Since the fall of 2008, our new construction plans have been concentrating on developing wind plants, where we believe there's a high likelihood that we would sell the plants' power under long-term power purchase agreements. Most recently, during the fourth quarter earnings conference call, I stated that the goal of adding 1,000 megawatts of new wind in 2010 with Power Purchase Agreements was not a slam dunk. The combination of lower power prices, the economic downturn and continued uncertainty regarding federal climate legislation or a Renewable Portfolio Standard is clearly adding to the industry's development challenges. 
In the last couple of weeks, we have re-evaluated our development pipeline for 2010, and at this point, believe that our wind build additions will be between 600 and 850 megawatts in 2010. This obviously does not include any wind assets that we could add through purchase transactions. Although we continue to look at a number of asset purchase  
transactions, there's obviously no assurance that we will be able to transact at prices that we would consider reasonable.
Longer term, we continued to be optimistic about developing and owning wind and solar energy plants. And we do not believe that the current development climate is indicative of longer-term trends. We will discuss more details of our longer-term development goals at our upcoming Investor Conference.
To summarize the 2010 first quarter on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.47. NextEra Energy Resources also contributed $0.47. There's a total of $0.94 compared to $0.90 in the 2009 first quarter, or about a 4% increase year-over-year. For 2010, we continue to believe that adjusted EPS expectations within a range of $4.25 and $4.65 are reasonable.  
Currently, we are planning on providing longer-term earnings expectations at our Investor Meeting next week. With that, I'll turn the call over to the conference moderator for any questions."

Thank you, Rebecca, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that NextEra Energy grew adjusted earnings per share by 12% over the prior-year quarter from $0.99 to $1.11. Now it's important to note that some of this growth is due to the po",665,"Okay. Thank you, Rebecca, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that NextEra Energy grew adjusted earnings per share by 12% over the prior-year quarter from $0.99 to $1.11. 
Now it's important to note that some of this growth is due to the positive effects of weather on our portfolio. The wind resource at Energy Resources was 96% at normal, and we experienced record warm temperatures in Florida. In fact, as measured by cooling degree hours, June was the third hottest month in 60 years in Florida Power & Light service territory. However, beyond favorable weather, our strategy of investing in clean, renewable and efficient generation continued to bear fruit.
In fact, on a weather-normalized basis, we have achieved a 7% year-to-date increase in adjusted earnings per share compared to the period last year. One example of this strategy at work is our West County Energy Center in Palm Beach County, where our new Units 1 and 2 helped second quarter earnings, while delivering lower fuel cost and cleaner air for customers. We have similarly compelling investment opportunities as we look to the future. 
For example, we announced our decision to invest approximately $2 billion on the modernizations of our Cape Canaveral and Riviera power plants. We estimate these new units will save customers $850 million to $950 million over the life of the plants compared with keeping the existing facilities in the fleet. And they will improve air quality by reducing particulate emissions by an estimated 88% at these sites and improve the plants' carbon dioxide emission rates by roughly 50%.
At Energy Resources, we have approximately 540 megawatts of new wind already in service or under construction, and likely to be commissioned within 2010. In addition to building new wind projects, we continue to make progress in the quarter on signing long-term power purchase agreements for our existing wind projects, which we expect will continue to improve our earnings risk profile in this part of the business. We also announced that we would invest in 100 megawatts of solar thermal generation in Spain. In a few minutes, Armando will bring you up to speed regarding the positive recent developments on this project.
Some of you know, I had the privilege of being at the New York Stock Exchange last month to mark the change of our stock ticker symbol to NEE. That was the final step in the process of changing our name from FPL Group to NextEra Energy, which better reflects our scope as one of the largest and cleanest power companies in the industry.
On the national front, the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed new rules governing the emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide has the potential to reshape our sector over the next several years. Those of you who have been listening to these calls for any length of time have heard me say that NextEra Energy is very well positioned for a world where is carbon priced. What sometimes gets lost is that we are also very well positioned for a world where carbon is not priced. 
With or without legislation to address climate change, the EPA is moving to strengthen environmental protections in multiple ways that will have a significant impact on the electric power sector. This extends well beyond the agency's recently issued replacement for the clean air interstate rule. It includes new rules regulating hazardous air pollutants such as mercury, tighter controls on coal ash, and of course, the EPA's own efforts to regulate carbon emissions. At NextEra Energy, we are not completely immune to potential adverse effects of these proposed changes, but was roughly 4% of our electricity production fueled by coal and only 3% by oil, we believe our long-term strategy of building a clean generation fleet will prove to be the right one for the environment and our shareholders alike. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Armando Pimentel before returning for some final comments at the end. Armando?"

I'd like to share a couple of additional accomplishments before getting into the financial details of the quarter.

I'd like to share a couple of additional accomplishments before getting into the financial details of the quarter. 
In April, Energy Resources completed a differential membership transaction designed to support the continued growth of our Wind business. This was the second differential membership transaction for Energy Resources and the first since 2007. Our transaction follows a common structure of tax equity partnership deals. The transaction consisted of a sale of roughly $190 million membership interest and approximately 170 megawatts of wind energy projects in North Dakota. 
Including some project-level debt issued in a separate transaction, we have recovered approximately 82% of the total capital invested during the development of these projects. The differential membership transaction allow us to more efficiently utilize the value of tax incentives such as production tax credits by managing the amount of deferred production tax credits on our balance sheet.
We are pleased that the market for differential membership opportunities appears to be opening back up and is a viable option to support the growth plans at Energy Resources at only slightly higher rates than those available before the economic downturn. Including the debt associated with the differential membership transaction, we have completed $638 million in project-level finance transactions year-to-date. Also, during the quarter, FPL Group Capital sold $250 million of principal amount of its debentures. 
Finally, as we highlighted at the investor conference in May, Florida Power & Light closed its global credit facility. This new facility is a $500 million three-year bank revolving credit agreement and is incremental to the existing $2.5 billion credit facility available to FPL. And it is truly global. Only European and Asian banks are participating in the facility.
Let me take a moment to discuss the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, also known as the Reform Act, which President Obama signed into law this week. The reform grants the CFTC broad authority in determining what entities will be subject to the new rules governing over-the-counter commodity transactions. 
While the details of the legislation will become more clear as the regulations are drafted, recent comments from key legislative supporters, including Senators Dodd and Lincoln, indicated that their intent behind the language of the Reform Act looks to exclude companies using swaps to hedge or manage commercial risk for many of the new rules. We will continue to closely monitor the regulations, assessing the potential impact on both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources.
In the second quarter of 2010, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $417 million or $1.01 per share compared to $370 million or $0.91 per share during the 2009 second quarter. NextEra Energy's adjusted 2010 second quarter net income and EPS were $457 million and $1.11 a share, respectively, compared with $401 million or $0.99 per share in 2009. The difference between the GAAP results and the adjusted results is the exclusion of the marking our non-qualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other-than-temporary impairments on certain investments or OTTI.
Weather had a positive effect on this quarter's comparable earnings. Compared to normal weather, there were offsetting effects across our portfolio due to the diversity of the company's operations in terms of geography, fuel and other factors. This slide shows the impact of weather during the second quarter, both against the prior year and against normal. Relative to prior year, weather had a positive impact on both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources, resulting in a positive $0.07 impact to adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy. 
At Energy Resources, the wind resource was approximately 96% relative to the long-term expected average, a significant improvement from the prior two quarters and up from the approximately 89% of normal in the second quarter last year. So far in July, the wind resources has been close to normal.  Year-to-date, NextEra Energy's consolidated adjusted earnings have been reduced by $0.01 per share relative to normal weather.
For the second quarter, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $265 million compared with $213 million in last year's second quarter. The corresponding contributions to EPS were $0.64 this year compared to $0.52 last year. The table shown here summarizes the earnings drivers for Florida Power & Light for the just-completed quarter. 
In total, earnings increased by $0.12 per share, driven primarily by weather and the increase in base revenues related to West County Energy Center Units 1 and 2, and the impact of our base rate increase. These results were partially offset by higher O&M costs and lower AFUDC, which are due primarily to the commissioning of these West County Energy Center units. Included in O&M are $0.03 in costs associated with our workforce reductions, which were implemented during the quarter. Although we are including these costs as part of our adjusted earnings, it is important that we point out that these will obviously not be normally recurring costs.
We are continuing to see some improvement as it relates to our customer metrics. The table in the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt-hour sales versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt-hour sales grew by 3%, an improvement due primarily to higher weather-related usage. Non-weather-related or underlying usage growth mix and all other was lower by 0.5%. The graph in the upper right-hand corner indicates a sequential increase in customer accounts. As of June 30, 2010, we had approximately 24,000 more customers than we did at the end of June 2009. 
As we have discussed on the last two earnings calls, we have been cautiously optimistic that our customer growth has been returning over the last couple of quarters, and we are encouraged that it appears that this trend has held up after the end of the winter season. We consider this customer increase to be a positive development, reversing the negative trend that we were seeing last year.
The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low-usage customers, which we believe depicts the level of empty homes in our service territory. Since the fourth quarter of last year, we have been experiencing improvements in both inactive and low-usage customers. Although inactive accounts rose modestly in the second quarter, the increases were smaller than what we have seen in the past associated with normal seasonal patterns. Low-usage accounts have improved modestly since the end of the first quarter.
The chart on the bottom right depicts the level of new housing starts for single-family homes in FPL service territory. Housing starts are a fairly good leading indicator of certain additions to our customer base roughly a year out. Although it appears that housing starts are no longer declining, we have yet to see clear signs that housing starts are significantly improving. This chart, coupled with the inactive and low-usage chart, tells us that our new customers appear to be primarily coming from formerly empty homes. We would expect this trend to continue in the short term.
Now let me just take this opportunity to briefly address the Gulf oil spill. While we currently don't see any imminent threat to FPL's coastal plants that are using cooling water from the Gulf or Atlantic Ocean, the events of this kind are difficult to predict, and we cannot guarantee that we won't experience adverse effects. Although the well appears to be capped, we continue to monitor the effects of the spill around the clock to ensure we are ready to take protective measures should they become necessary.
During the second quarter, several events occurred that will affect the Florida Public Service Commission. In April, the Florida Senate voted not to confirm Commissioners Stephens and Klement. Last week, Governor Crist appointed Ron Bris√© and Arthur Graham to fill these vacant positions. These new commissioners will need to be confirmed by the Florida Senate next spring. 
Separately, in the next couple of months, the Nominating Council will provide additional nominations to Governor Crist, who will then make two new appointments to the Commission when a new term begins on January 2, 2011. Ultimately, these new appointments also need to be confirmed by the Florida Senate during the spring.
Yesterday, the staff of the Public Service Commission issued a recommendation on the issues outlined in our motion for reconsideration on our rate case. The agenda conference is scheduled for August 3. We expect to communicate more after there is resolution on this matter.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources. Since the first quarter of 2009, we have added approximately 1,460 megawatts of new wind and continue to be the nation's leading producer of wind power. We have continued to make progress on our solar development pipeline, which includes more than 500 megawatts of projects expected to be in service by the end of 2014. To date, we have received $525 million in cash from convertible investment tax credits, or CITCs, including $470 million related to our 2009 wind projects and $55 million from our 2010 wind development. 
As we mentioned in the first quarter earnings release, we believe we will elect to take CITCs and roughly 600 megawatts of new wind projects we expect to complete during 2010. In May, Energy Resources entered into a joint venture agreement with PetroQuest Energy to produce shale gas, primarily in the Woodford region.
As we highlighted at our investor conference, we are making relatively modest investments in gas infrastructure, including shale gas production over the next five years, and this transaction is consistent with that strategy. We believe this investment should offer our shareholders attractive returns with manageable risks. We are already a significant player in the natural gas business due to our position as the largest consumer of natural gas in the power sector, and we think this investment will complement our existing assets and enhance our market knowledge.
For 2010, we are well hedged against the impacts of natural gas price movements and very significantly hedged against other price movements, including spark spreads. The appendix of this presentation contains both the typical information we provide to you regarding our hedging status, as well as updates of the incremental information we provided at our investor conference and on our website. We would like to highlight two changes that we have made to the slides.
The first change is to consolidate the gross margin contributions from gas infrastructure investments into one line item. Previously, we had new gas infrastructure investments included in the new investment line item, and now, new gas infrastructure investments are included with existing gas infrastructure investments in the gas infrastructure line. 
The second change is to the percentage hedge calculation for contracted wind assets. Previously, we had assumed that assets that we expected to be contracted in the near term were 100% hedged. The percentage of gross margin hedged now reflects only those PPAs that have actually been executed.
Energy Resources reported second quarter 2010 GAAP earnings of $154 million or $0.38 per share compared with $163 million or $0.40 per share in the prior period. Adjusted earnings for the same periods, which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges and net OTTI, were $195 million compared to $194 million. The equivalent adjusted earnings per share contributions were $0.48 in both periods.
As we mentioned in the first quarter, we have changed the methodology for allocating interest and shared costs to affiliates, and the historical figures have been adjusted to reflect the change. As I just mentioned, Energy Resources' second quarter adjusted EPS was flat relative to last year's comparable quarter. New wind investments contributed $0.03 per share. In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contributed $0.01 relative to the prior year. Our existing wind assets contributed $0.02, driven by better wind resource and lower curtailments in Texas, offset by several factors, none of which are particularly noteworthy.
Contributions from the NEPOOL portfolio improved by $0.02 a share, owing primarily to higher priced hedges at our Seabrook nuclear facility, which was offset by a negative $0.01 performance from our Texas gas fired facility as a result of market conditions. The remaining drivers from the existing merchant fleet amounted to negative $0.02, but there's nothing notable in any one category worth calling out. 
Wholesale marketing and trading activities were flat relative to the prior year. Asset sales contributed $0.01, which represents the gain we realized associated with the sale of our 44-megawatt Port of Stockton coal facility that was completed during the quarter. All other factors were a negative $0.05, primarily due to higher interest expense. It is worth noting that although weather effects compared to normal were better this quarter than the last several quarters, Energy Resources' current quarterly results were lower by roughly $0.04 due to weather versus normal. 
I would like to provide a brief update on our wind development plans for the remainder of 2010. Since the fall of 2008, our new construction plans have concentrated on developing wind plants where we believe there is a high likelihood that we would sell the plants' power under long-term power purchase agreements. Although we continue to experience difficult market conditions for power purchase agreements, we have signed 784 megawatts of new PPAs year-to-date, including 247 megawatts on projects expected to be placed in service in 2011.
During the first quarter earnings call, I stated that our wind build additions were expected to be between 600 and 850 megawatts in 2010. We currently have approximately 540 megawatts of new wind already in service or in construction and likely to be commissioned in 2010. Based on our current state of our development pipeline, we continue to believe that we will add between 600 and 850 megawatts of wind in 2010. For 2011, we continue to plan to add 700 to 1,000 megawatts of wind generation. Longer term, we continue to be optimistic about developing and owning wind and solar energy plants.
I would also like to provide a quick update regarding our concentrated solar development project in Spain that we highlighted at our investor conference. In July, the Spanish government proposed several changes to the solar thermal tariff, the net of which we believe would be roughly neutral for our project. 
Regarding the tariff, the government has proposed an ongoing annual cap on the number of hours, during which the project can earn the premium tariff and has proposed a fixed-rate tariff during the first year of production. We do not believe that either of those proposed changes should significantly alter the economics of our project. We believe changes to the tariff will be finalized over the course of the next several months, and we are actively working with government officials, banks and other parties involved in renewables development in Spain to support our interest.
To summarize the 2010 second quarter on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.64 per share, Energy Resources contributed $0.48 per share and corporate and other contributed a negative $0.01 per share. That is a total of $1.11 compared to $0.99 per share in the 2009 second quarter or about a 12% increase year-over-year. For 2010, we continue to believe that adjusted EPS expectations within the range of $4.25 and $4.65 are reasonable. In addition, we also believe that 2011 adjusted EPS will fall roughly in the same range. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Lew for some concluding remarks."

I would like to close with the observation that NextEra Energy remains one of the most compelling growth stories in the electric power sector. At a time when many electric power companies will be experiencing flat or declining earnings, we feel very good about our ability to continue to deliver significant adjusted earnings per share growth.
This is not to say that we don't face some challenges. At Energy Resources, in particular, low power prices will create earnings headwinds, and our ability to grow the Renewables business will be somewhat constrained as long as we have to rely solely on state renewable portfolio standards to stimulate demand. Even so, the company as a whole continues to enjoy strong growth prospects. At Florida Power & Light, our capital investments are paying off for both customers and shareholders, and with additional investment opportunities in the form of nuclear upgrades and power plant modernizations.
Our customer growth has turned positive again, and we see the long-term national demographic trends as fundamentally favorable for Florida and for Florida Power & Light. At Energy Resources, despite a challenging market for renewables, we still believe we can add 3,500 to 5,000 megawatts of wind through 2014, and another 400 to 600 megawatts of solar. Add to that the approximately $800 million we expect to invest in new transmission at Lone Star Transmission, and you'll understand why we are hard-pressed to think of another company in this sector with stronger growth prospects.
This is especially notable in an industry not known for growth. Consider, the average EPS growth rate for our industry as a whole over the last 10 years has been approximately zero. At NextEra Energy, we've grown adjusted EPS on average by 7.7% over that same period. We feel good about our ability to generate average adjusted earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% through 2014 from a 2009 base.  
Thanks for listening to our call. And with that, I'll turn the call over for questions."

There's a lot of numbers that go into that, and we've been actually looking at that over the last month or so. What I'd say is that clearly, and I've said this before, clearly that we are down on weather-normalized usage since the very top of what I would call the economic curve back in 2006 or so, and we've talked about that. Since then, it does look to have flatten out some, I'd say, in the last year or so. But there's a lot of factors that go into that, including the price of natural gas, which, as you know, has been pretty volatile during the last 18 to 24 months. So I wouldn't draw a lot of conclusions from my comment that it's 0.5% down year-over-year. I think that's more of a trend that we need to see, and I'm not sure that we can actually say that everything in Florida is back to normal. Certainly, not back to where it was in 2006. So we're going to have to keep watching that I think over the next several quarters and maybe even the next year to figure out how much of a bite energy efficiency has taken out of that and how much of that will come back just with normal economic conditions."

And I have said this before, which is, overall, the demand for paper that's backed by renewable projects, what we call, fixed income paper, or you can call it equity paper, seems to be pretty strong. We got a number of project-level debt transactions done this year, and others did, too. And it was very clear to us that the demand was strong because the economics that we were seeing in those transactions was much better than what we are seeing 12 to 18 months ago, specifically on the tax equity market. The yield that we were seeing just last year were double-digit after-tax yields to the investors. Those are down, and I'd say those are down considerably. They're certainly not back to the yields that we were seeing when we did our first transaction back in 2007. But I could say that we're pretty pleased, and I don't think we've formally said what those yields are publicly. But I can tell you that they're pretty far from the double-digit number that we were seeing last year that made us feel comfortable to get into the market. I think the depth is there, the depth will continue to be there. As I said last year, for each one of our projects, we actually take a look at whether taking the convertible ITC or actually taking the production tax credits makes the most sense. And in those situations where the production tax credits makes more sense, it would be very likely at this point because of our tax position for us to go out to the differential membership transaction of the tax equity market. So we're pretty comfortable with that market, and it might be something that you would see as tap again this year."

That transaction that you just mentioned, that AEP transaction, that is not included in the 784 megawatts. We've clearly have made -- we're selling that power today. We were selling that power before out into the market. We've identified several RFPs in the area where that project would be in good standing to actually fulfill that requirement. But we're not counting that as a signed contract at this point. We went back and we looked at our information since we've been doing this, we couldn't find another contract that had not been approved by a regulator. We've continued to believe that that's a good project, good location and it would've made sense, a lot of sense, for the customer. But we have to move on, we have to seek the next opportunity in the area, and we feel pretty confident that we'll be able to sign a long-term PPA in the near future."

But we've got a heck a lot of rules that need to be written, particularly by the CFTC. And they've got a deadline to write some of those rules within three months, six months, and some of those rules within a year. The definitions of swap dealers, the definitions of commercial end users, definitions of really, what derivatives are going to be are very important in the final interpretations. I can tell you that the letter from Senators Dodd and Lincoln seems to have made a big difference. I think most folks believe that they're just hedging for commercial purposes and they take physical delivery of the product are feeling like, well, this rule is not necessarily going to affect me. And I use ""affect"" pretty narrowly. In other words, it's not going to affect me because I may not have to clear it through an exchange and therefore provide mark-to-market margin. But even for those folks, it's unclear whether there are going to be changes in the marketplace -- changes in the marketplace, i.e., with derivative counterparties that will actually flow back and change how they do business. But at least I feel much better on that side of the business. The other side, what I'll call the middle side of the business, and many folks like us that are dynamic hedgers, I mean we clearly are hedging our assets longer-term. But in some cases, we put on a hedge and we take off a hedge and we put on another hedge for economic purposes. Clearly, a strategy that most people in the country do. That pot's in the middle. I'd say that you should fall under the exception for commercial end users and you should be okay. But we're going to have to see that in the rules. The rest of the business, I just don't know. Clearly us and others have a lot of interest. EEI has a lot of interest in how the rules are going to be written by the CFTC.

One of the things that I want to make sure that we say -- and Lew talked about it at the beginning as it dealt with the modernizations, Cape Canaveral and Riviera. But there are significant customer savings associated with us bringing these plants online, very, very significant. At this point, when you go back to where we're at right now, these are great plans for us to bring online and for our customers to be getting power from.

A little disappointing from our side. I'll actually go a little further than that, very disappointing from our side because we continue to believe that lopping together something on longer-term pricing for carbon, a bill that would also include some incentives for renewable generation, potentially transmission, would not only be good for the economic side of what we're facing right now in the U.S., but would be tremendous benefits to the public at large. And as Lew has mentioned before, that we don't get on with it, that other countries in the world certainly aren't going to hold back and eventually, we will lose the small head start that we have in overall renewable technology here in the U.S. So as far as the future, I don't know. I mean, certainly, none of us can predict the future. It doesn't look like the current Congress has any appetite to try to tackle it before the elections. I doubt seriously that it would be tackled between the elections and when the next Congress gets sworn in. So it's probably something that we'll be looking at in 2011.

But there's a limit on volatility in prices. That tends to dampen down on the opportunities that are available in the market. Folks that are in this business every day and are buying and selling the commodity not necessarily for physical delivery love to see volatility in the markets, whether it's volatility on the way up or volatility on the way down. When you start limiting the amount of volatility, especially in the short-term, that tends to drive down the number of opportunities. I don't think, at least at this point, I don't think that it's uncertainty over the financial regulatory reform. Although, some of our larger counterparties, which would be the banks, are clearly very concerned as of what this is going to mean from a capital-allocation standpoint. But that might be something that plays out in the future, but at least what we've seen in the past, it's really just a lack of volatility in the commodity market, at least in the gas and power market. Your second point about -- because I did mention we're doing a little bit better on the full requirements front than what we expected to do at the beginning of the year. I don't know that you can attribute it to any one factor. I think the factors, that certainly, that you pointed out, which have to deal with retail pricing and the spread there is one. But I think it's also the number of people that are in the market. We're seeing, and especially in what I would call the larger transactions, we're not seeing as many people in the market as we were seeing before, that doesn't necessarily mean that there won't be. One of the larger players that -- I won't mention who that is, but one of the larger players that seem to have pulled out or the market last year is now back in very aggressively. So I think it changes maybe as management focus changes and as they perceive opportunities. But at least for the rest of the year, we feel relatively comfortable that the small piece of business that we do there will continue to come to us."

I don't know that I've used the word easy in any comment that I would make regarding the contracting market. I think I would say, and we've said before, that as all other things held constant, as load picks up because the economy picks up, folks feel better; and by folks, I mean our potential customers. The large utilities feel better about taking on longer-term contracts to meet their own obligations, which, as load decreased over the last couple of years, that the amount of power that they were getting from renewable sources, hence, increased. And as the economy gets better, as folks start feeling better, I do believe that the opportunities will continue to pick up for us. It's clearly not -- as the environment is clearly not as difficult as it was last year. But as I mentioned, both in the fourth quarter last year and the first quarter this year, it's a number of factors. It's not just the reduction in load, it's really the uncertainty as to what's going on, on the federal level regarding energy legislation. It's also the fact that production tax credits do not expire at the end of this year. I mean, it's a number of factors. And so although as a team, we feel very good about having signed 784 megawatts of wind this year, I feel very good about 247 of that being for next year. We recognize that wind build across the U.S. is down. I don't think AWEA [American Wind Energy Association] has come out with their second quarter numbers yet, but I would expect that when they do come out, they're not going to be numbers that we can all kind of jump on the table and cheer about. But in that environment, we continue to do, I think, very well, 600 to 850 this year, 700 to 1,000 next year, 784 signed this year. We feel very better about what we're doing. We feel better about our development opportunities. But it's a really, really far cry as to what we were seeing back in 2007. I don't know that I can add any more color to that, Jay."

I think in the first quarter, I made comments that I wasn't as positive, that something might be able to get done by the end of this year on the asset front, as I had felt last year. Sitting here today, I feel a little better than the comment that I made in the fourth quarter last year. But it takes two to tango, if you will. There's been a number of transactions, as you know, that have been pulled from the market this year because folks didn't like the price that us and others kind of put on the table. Whether that changes or not the rest of the year remains to be seen. We continue to be active, looking at a number of projects. But the price that we're willing to pay is a price that gives us a good return for our shareholders, and this is not the market that it was in 2006 and 2007, even 2008 when some of these folks first got into these projects, first started getting permits, first started getting the wind turbines ordered at a pretty high price. So everybody's got to get comfortable with the ultimate transaction price. But the final thought that I'd leave you with is, we're looking at a number of opportunities that we think would be great opportunities if they come to fruition."

When you look at it, the value of a long-term wind contract relative to our customers' site plans or our customers' integrated resource plans, the value of wind remains very compelling on a long-term basis. And so we feel very comfortable from that standpoint. We also feel comfortable -- there continues to be demand from a state RPS standpoint. We would all love to have Federal RPS, and none of us have given up on the fact that we may get one sometime in the future. But in the meantime, there remain significant pockets of demands. And to give you a sense, our view this year, I think we said at the earnings conference that this would be a 4,000 to 6,000-megawatt year builds. I think some of us would say it's probably closer to 4,000- or 5,000-megawatt build in the U.S. this year. That still what the build was in I think '06  or '07 and we did 1,000 megawatts in all '06 and '07. Fundamentally, I continue to feel in the long term, very bullish about wind, in particular because it remains a tremendous value to our customers in the long-term."

And then I've talked before about the fact that some of our wind don't have long-term contracts, but we continue to include them in contracted. What we did this quarter was, just to change that a bit, we continue to put them in contracted because, again, that's our expectation, that we will have long-term contracts or we wouldn't have built the projects in the first place. But we changed the percentage hedged so that we no longer include in the gross margin hedged. We no longer include that margin that is not contracted. So I consider it a small change. We continue to feel comfortable. We have 7,600 megawatts of wind, roughly 400 of that is uncontracted, roughly 1,600 to 1,700 of that is hedged. So the 400 is a very small number in the overall scheme of things. I just wanted to make the change in the gross margin table because I just kind of felt better about it actually."

I'm pleased to report that NextEra Energy grew adjusted earnings per share by 12% over the prior-year quarter from $0.99 to $1.11.
Now, it's important to note that some of this growth is due to the positive effects of weather on our portfolio. The wind resource at Energy Resources was 96% of normal, and we experienced record warm temperatures in Florida. In fact, as measured by cooling degree hours, June was the third hottest month in 60 years in Florida Power & Light's service territory.
However, beyond favorable weather, our strategy of investing in clean, renewable and efficient generation continued to bear fruit. In fact, on a weather-normalized basis, we have achieved a 7% year-to-date increase in adjusted earnings per share compared to the period last year. One example of this strategy at work is our West County Energy Center in Palm Beach County where our new Units 1 and 2 helped second quarter earnings while delivering lower fuel costs and cleaner air for customers.
We have similarly compelling investment opportunities as we look to the future. For example, we announced our decision to invest approximately $2 billion on the modernizations of our Cape Canaveral and Riviera power plants. We estimate these new units will save customers $850 million to $950 million over the life of the plants compared with keeping the existing facilities in the fleet. And they will improve air quality by reducing particulate emissions by an estimated 88% at these sites and improve the plants' carbon dioxide emission rates by roughly 50%.
At Energy Resources, we have approximately 540 megawatts of new wind already in service or under construction and likely to be commissioned in 2010.
In addition to building new wind projects, we continued to make progress in the quarter on signing long-term power purchase agreements for our existing wind projects, which we expect will continue to improve our earnings risk profile in this part of the business. We also announced that we would invest in 100 megawatts of solar thermal generation in Spain. In a few minutes, Armando will bring you up to speed regarding some of the positive recent developments on this project.
As some of you know, I had the privilege of being at the New York Stock Exchange last month to mark the change of our stock ticker symbol to NEE. That was the final step in the process of changing our name from FPL Group to NextEra Energy, which better reflects our scope as one of the largest and cleanest power companies in the industry.
On the national front, the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed new rule governing the emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides has the potential to reshape our sector over the next several years. Those of you who have been listening to these calls for any length of time have heard me say that NextEra Energy is very well positioned for a world where carbon is priced. What sometimes gets lost is that we are also very well positioned for a world where carbon is not priced.
With or without legislation to address climate change, the EPA is moving to strengthen environmental protections in multiple ways that will have a significant impact on the electric power sector. This extends well beyond the agency's recently issued replacement for the Clean Air Interstate Rule. It includes new rules regulating hazardous air pollutants such as mercury, tighter controls on coal ash and of course the EPA's own efforts to regulate carbon emissions.
At NextEra Energy, we are not completely immune to potential adverse effects of these proposed changes, but with roughly 4% of our electricity production fueled by coal and only 3% by oil, we believe our long-term strategy of building a clean generation fleet will prove to be the right one, for the environment and our shareholders alike.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Armando Pimentel before returning for some final comments at the end.

I'd like to share a couple of additional accomplishments before getting into the financial details of the quarter.
In April, Energy Resources completed a differential membership transaction designed to support the continued growth of our wind business. This was the second differential membership transaction for Energy Resources and the first since 2007. Our transaction follows the common structure of tax equity partnership deals.
The transaction consisted of a sale of roughly $190 million membership interest in approximately 170 megawatts of wind energy projects in North Dakota. Including some project-level debt issued in a separate transaction, we have recovered approximately 82% of the total capital invested during development of these projects.
The differential membership transaction will allow us to more efficiently utilize the value of tax incentives such as production tax credits by managing the amount of deferred Production Tax Credits on our balance sheet.
We are pleased that the market for differential membership opportunities appears to be opening back up and is a viable option to support the growth plans at Energy Resources at only slightly higher rates than those available before the economic downturn. Including the debt associated with the differential membership transaction, we have completed $638 million in project level finance transactions year-to-date.
Also during the quarter, FPL Group Capital sold $250 million of principal amount of its debentures. Finally, as we highlighted at the Investor Conference in May, Florida Power & Light closed its Global Credit Facility. This new facility is a $500 million, three-year bank revolving credit agreement and is incremental to the existing $2.5 billion credit facility available to FPL. And it is truly global. Only European and Asian banks are participating in the facility.
Let me take a moment to discuss the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, also known as the Reform Act, which President Obama signed into law this week. The Reform Act grants the CFTC broad authority in determining what entities will be subject to the new rules governing over-the-counter commodity transactions.
While the details of the legislation will become clearer as the regulations are drafted, recent comments from key legislative supporters, including Senators Dodd and Lincoln, indicated that their intent behind the language of the Reform Act was to exclude companies using swaps to hedge or manage commercial risk from many of the new rules. We will continue to closely monitor the regulations, assessing the potential impact on both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources.
In the second quarter of 2010, NextEra Energy's GAAP net income was $417 million or $1.01 per share compared to $370 million or $0.91 per share during the 2009 second quarter. NextEra Energy's adjusted 2010 second quarter net income and EPS were $457 million and $1.11 per share respectively compared with $401 million or $0.99 per share in 2009.
The difference between the GAAP results and the adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our non-qualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments, or OTTI.
Weather had a positive effect on this quarter's comparable earnings. Compared to normal weather, there were offsetting effects across our portfolio due to the diversity of our company's operations in terms of geography, fuel and other factors.
This slide shows the impact of weather during the second quarter, both against the prior year and against normal. Relative to prior year, weather had a positive impact on both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources, resulting in a positive $0.07 impact to adjusted earnings per share at NextEra Energy.
At Energy Resources, the wind resource was approximately 96% relative to the long-term expected average, a significant improvement from the prior two quarters and up from the approximately 89% of normal in the second quarter last year. So far in July, the wind resource has been close to normal. Year-to-date, NextEra Energy's consolidated adjusted earnings have been reduced by $0.01 per share relative to normal weather.
For the second quarter, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $265 million compared with $213 million in last year's second quarter. The corresponding contributions to EPS were $0.64 this year compared to $0.52 last year.
The table shown here summarizes the earnings drivers for Florida Power & Light for the just completed quarter. In total, earnings increased by $0.12 per share, driven primarily by weather and the increase in base revenues related to West County Energy Center Units 1 and 2, and the impact of our base rate increase. These results were partially offset by higher O&M costs and lower AFUDC, which are due primarily to the commissioning of these West County Energy Center units.
Included in O&M is $0.03 in costs associated with our workforce reductions, which were implemented during the quarter. Although we are including these costs as part of our adjusted earnings, it is important that we point out that these will obviously not be normally recurring costs.
We are continuing to see some improvement as it relates to our customer metrics. The table in the upper left shows a change in retail kilowatt-hour sales versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt-hour sales grew by 3%, an improvement due primarily to higher weather-related usage. Non-weather-related, or underlying, usage growth, mix and all other, was lower by 0.5%
The graph in the upper right-hand corner indicates a sequential increase in customer accounts. As of June 30, 2010, we had approximately 24,000 more customers than we did at the end of June 2009. As we have discussed on the last two earnings calls, we have been cautiously optimistic that our customer growth has been returning over the last couple of quarters and we are encouraged that it appears that this trend has held up after the end of the winter season.
We consider this customer increase to be a positive development, reversing the negative trend that we were seeing last year.
The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low usage customers, which we believe depicts the level of empty homes in our service territory. Since the fourth quarter of last year, we have been experiencing improvements in both inactive and low usage customers.
Although inactive accounts rose modestly in the second quarter, the increases were smaller than what we have seen in the past associated with normal seasonal patterns. Low usage accounts have improved modestly since the end of the first quarter.
The chart on the bottom right depicts the level of new housing starts for single family homes in FPL's service territory. Housing starts are a fairly good leading indicator of certain additions to our customer base roughly a year out. Although it appears that housing starts are no longer declining, we have yet to see clear signs that housing starts are significantly improving.
This chart, coupled with the inactive and low usage chart, tells us that our new customers appear to be primarily coming from formerly empty homes. We would expect this trend to continue in the short-term.
And let me just take this opportunity to briefly address the gulf oil spill. While we currently don't see any imminent threat to FPL's coastal plants that are using cooling water from the Gulf or Atlantic Ocean, events of this kind are difficult to predict and we cannot guarantee that we won't experience adverse effects. Although the well appears to be capped, we continue to monitor the effects of the spill around the clock to ensure we are ready to take protective measures should they become necessary.
During the second quarter, several events occurred that will affect the Florida Public Service Commission. In April, the Florida Senate voted not to confirm Commissioners Stephens and Klement. Last week, Governor Crist appointed Ron Bris√© and Arthur Graham to fill these vacant positions. These new commissioners will need to be confirmed by the Florida Senate next spring.
Separately, in the next couple of months the Nominating Council will provide additional nominations to Governor Crist, who will then make two new appointments to the commission when the new term begins on January 2, 2011. Ultimately, these new appointments also need to be confirmed by the Florida Senate during the spring.
Yesterday the staff of the Public Service Commission issued their recommendation on the issues outlined in our Motion for Reconsideration on our rate case. The agenda conference is scheduled for August 3. We expect to communicate more after there is resolution on this matter.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources. Since the first quarter of 2009 we have added approximately 1,460 megawatts of new wind and continue to be the nation's leading producer of wind power. We have continued to make progress on our solar development pipeline, which includes more than 500 megawatts of projects expected to be in service by the end of 2014.
To date, we have received $525 million in cash from convertible investment tax credits, or CITCs, including $470 million related to our 2009 wind projects, and $55 million from our 2010 wind development. As we mentioned in the first quarter earnings release, we believe we will elect to take CITCs on roughly 600 megawatts of new wind projects we expect to complete during 2010.
In May, Energy Resources entered into a joint venture agreement with PetroQuest Energy to produce shale gas, primarily in the Woodford region. As we highlighted at our investor conference, we are making relatively modest investments in gas infrastructure, including shale gas production, over the next 5 years, and this transaction is consistent with that strategy.
We believe these investments should offer our shareholders attractive returns with manageable risks. We are already a significant player in the natural gas business due to our position as the largest consumer of natural gas in the power sector, and we think this investment will complement our existing assets and enhance our market knowledge.
For 2010, we are well-hedged against the impacts of natural gas price movements, and very significantly hedged against other price movements, including spark spreads. The appendix to this presentation contains both the typical information we provide to you regarding our hedging status, as well as updates to the incremental information we provided at our investor conference and on our website.
We would like to highlight two changes that we have made to the slides. The first change is to consolidate the gross margin contributions from gas infrastructure investments into one line item. Previously we had new gas infrastructure investments included in the ""New Investment"" line item, and now new gas infrastructure investments are included with existing gas infrastructure investments in the ""Gas Infrastructure"" line.
The second change is to the percentage hedged calculation for contracted wind assets. Previously we had assumed that assets that we expected to be contracted in the near term were 100% hedged. The percentage of gross margin hedged now reflects only those PPA's that have actually been executed.
Energy Resources' reported second quarter 2010 GAAP earnings of $154 million, or $0.38 per share compared with $163 million, or $0.40 per share in the prior period. Adjusted earnings for the same periods, which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges and net OTTI, were $195 million compared to $194 million. The equivalent adjusted earnings per share contributions were $0.48 in both periods.
As we mentioned in the first quarter, we have changed the methodology for allocating interest and shared cost to affiliates, and the historical figures have been adjusted to reflect the change.
As I just mentioned, Energy Resources' second quarter adjusted EPS was flat relative to last year's comparable quarter.
New wind investments contributed $0.03 per share.
In aggregate, the existing asset portfolio contributed $0.01 relative to the prior year. Our existing wind assets contributed $0.02 driven by better wind resource and lower curtailments in Texas, offset by several factors, none of which are particularly noteworthy.
Contributions from the NEPOOL portfolio improved by $0.02 a share, owing primarily to higher-priced hedges at our Seabrook nuclear facility, which was offset by a negative $0.01 performance from our Texas gas fired facilities as a result of market conditions. The remaining drivers from the existing merchant fleet amounted to negative $0.02, but there is nothing notable in any one category worth calling out.
Wholesale marketing and trading activities were flat relative to the prior year.
Asset sales contributed $0.01, which represents the gain we realized associated with the sale of our 44 megawatt Port of Stockton coal facility that was completed during the quarter.
All other factors were a negative $0.05, primarily due to higher interest expense. It is worth noting that although weather effects compared to normal were better this quarter than the last several quarters, Energy Resources' current quarterly results were lower by roughly $0.04 due to weather versus normal.
I would like to provide a brief update on our wind development plans for the remainder of 2010. Since the fall of 2008, our new construction plans have concentrated on developing wind plants where we believe there is a high likelihood that we would sell the plant's power under long term power purchase agreements.
Although we continue to experience difficult market conditions for power purchase agreements, we have signed 784 megawatts of new PPAs year-to-date, including 247 megawatts on projects expected to be placed in service in 2011.
During the first quarter earnings conference call, I stated that our wind build additions were expected to be between 600 and 850 megawatts in 2010. We currently have approximately 540 megawatts of new wind already in service, or in construction and likely to be commissioned in 2010.
Based on our current state of our development pipeline, we continue to believe that we will add between 600 and 850 megawatts of wind in 2010. For 2011, we continue to plan to add 700 to 1000 megawatts of wind generation. Longer-term, we continue to be optimistic about developing and owning wind and solar energy plants.
I would also like to provide a quick update regarding our concentrated solar development project in Spain that we highlighted at our investor conference. In July, the Spanish government proposed several changes to the solar thermal tariff, the net of which we believe would be roughly neutral for our project.
Regarding the tariff, the government has proposed an ongoing annual cap on the number of hours during which a project can earn the premium tariff and has proposed a fixed rate tariff during the first year of production. We do not believe that either of those proposed changes should significantly alter the economics of our project.
We believe changes to the tariff will be finalized over the course of the next several months, and we are actively working with government officials, banks and other parties involved in renewables development in Spain to support our interests.
To summarize, the 2010 second quarter, on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.64 per share, Energy Resources contributed $0.48 per share and Corporate and Other contributed a negative $0.01 per share. That is a total of $1.11 compared to $0.99 per share in the 2009 second quarter, or about a 12% increase year-over-year.
For 2010, we continue to believe that adjusted EPS expectations within a range of $4.25 and $4.65 are reasonable. In addition, we also believe that 2011 adjusted EPS will fall roughly in the same range.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Lew for some concluding remarks.

I would like to close with the observation that NextEra Energy remains one of the most compelling growth stories in the electric power sector. At a time when many electric power companies will be experiencing flat or declining earnings, we feel very good about our ability to continue to deliver significant adjusted earnings per share growth.
This is not to say that we don't face some challenges. At Energy Resources in particular, low power prices will create earnings headwinds, and our ability to grow the renewables business will be somewhat constrained as long we have to rely solely on state renewable portfolio standards to stimulate demand.
Even so, the company as a whole continues to enjoy strong growth prospects. At Florida Power & Light, our capital investments are paying off for both customers and shareholders, and we have additional investment opportunities in the form of nuclear uprates and power plant modernizations. Our customer growth has turned positive again, and we see the long-term national demographic trends as fundamentally favorable for Florida and FPL.
At Energy Resources, despite a challenging market for renewables, we still believe we can add 3,500 megawatts to 5,000 megawatts of wind through 2014 and another 400 megawatts to 600 megawatts of solar. Add to that the approximately $800 million we expect to invest in new transmission at Lone Star Transmission, and you'll understand why we are hard-pressed to think of another company in the sector with stronger growth prospects.
This is especially notable in an industry not known for growth. Consider: The average EPS growth rate for our industry as a whole over the last 10 years has been approximately zero. At NextEra Energy, we've grown adjusted EPS on average by 7.7% over that same period. We feel good about our ability to generate average adjusted earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% through 2014 from a 2009 base.

There's a lot of numbers that go into that, and we've been actually looking at that over the last month or so. What I would say is that, and I've said this before, clearly that we are down on weather normalized usage since the very top of what I would call the economic curve back in 2006 or so, and we have talked about that.
Since then, it does look to have flattened out some, I would say in the last year or so. But there are a lot of factors that go into that, including the price of natural gas, which as you know, has been pretty volatile during the last 18 to 24 months. So I wouldn't draw a lot of conclusions from my comment that it's 0.5% down year over year. I think that's more of a trend that we need to see, and I'm not sure that we can actually say that everything in Florida is back to normal, certainly not back to where it was in 2006.
So we are going to have to keep watching that I think over the next several quarters, and maybe even the next year, to figure out how much of a energy efficiency has taken out of that, and how much of that will come back just with normal economic conditions.

You know, we got a number of project level debt transactions done this year, and others did too, and it was very clear to us that the demand was strong, because the economics that we were seeing in those transactions was much better than what we were seeing 12 to 18 months ago.
Specifically on the tax equity market, the yields that we were seeing, just last year were double digit after tax yields to the investors. Those are down, and I would say those are down considerably. They are certainly not back to the yields that we were seeing when we did our first transaction back in 2007. But I could say that we are pretty pleased. And I don't think we have formally said what those yields are publicly, but I can tell you that they are pretty far from the double digit number that we were seeing last year that made us feel comfortable to get into the market.
I think the depth is there. The depth will continue to be there. As I said last year, for each one of our projects we actually take a look at weather, taking the convertible ITC or actually taking the production tax credits makes the most sense; and in those situations where the production tax credits makes more sense, it would be very likely at this point because of our tax position for us to go out to the differential membership transaction of the tax equity market.
So we are pretty comfortable with that market, and it might be something that you would see us tap again this year.

I think that, you know, obviously as a technical matter, any one of the rate regulated entities in Florida can reach a settlement on a longer term settlement on their rates really at any time. And whether you have something in front of the commission or not, you can have discussions with the interveners and other interested parties, and put something in front of the commission.
I have said before that our situation is a little different than what Progress's was, because we do need rate relief, some sort of revenue recovery on West County energy center number three, which is coming into operations in the summer of next year. I think it's certainly a positive development that Progress was able to reach a settlement that presumably they are comfortable with.
And just last week or earlier this week Tampa Electric was able to do the same thing. But we don't comment, we have never commented and we won't comment today, on any discussions that we are having with other parties on this matter.

I don't really consider those to be very significant in businesses that in 2011 have less than 50% of that margin locked up.
If you look at 2010, you will see that there is a roughly $45 million reduction in gross margin for power and gas trading, and roughly a $35 million increase in power supply, and that's just what we are seeing this year. Not only are we seeing some significant opportunities come up in the power supply business, the full requirements business, but we have done okay in that business, more okay than we believe that we were going to do in the first quarter.
And on the power and gas trading side of the business, as I think I've mentioned in just about every quarter, I don't think I mentioned it this quarter. And it's really difficult on a quarter-to-quarter basis to predict what's going to happen there. We take advantage of the market opportunities that exist, sometimes they do exist and we do okay in that space, and sometimes they don't exist and we don't do as well as what we expected at the beginning of the year, so that's just a reflection on what we are seeing currently and what we would expect to see for the rest of the year.

And they've got a deadline to write some of those rules within three months, six months, and some of those rules within a year.
The definitions of swap dealers, the definitions of commercial end users, the definitions of really what derivatives are, are going to be very important in the final interpretations. I can tell you that the letter from Senators Dodd and Lincoln seems to have made a big difference.
I think most folks that believe that they are just hedging for commercial purposes, and they take physical delivery of the product, are feeling like, well, this rule is not necessarily going to affect me. And I use 'affect' pretty narrowly. In other words, it's not going to affect me because I may not have to clear it through an exchange, and therefore provide mark-to-market margin.
But even for those folks, it's unclear whether there are going to be changes in the marketplace, i.e. with derivative counterparties that will actually flow back and change how they do business. But at least I feel much better on that side of the business.
The other side, or I'll call it the middle side of the business, and those folks, many folks like us that are dynamic hedgers, I mean, we clearly are hedging our assets longer-term, but in some cases we put on a hedge, and we take off a hedge and we put on another hedge for economic purposes, clearly a strategy that most people in the country do.
That pot's in the middle. I'd say that you should fall under the exception for commercial end users and you should be okay, but we are going to have to see that in the rules.

Obviously there's been a lot of press in the last couple of days as to the Senate, and not moving forward on a comprehensive energy bill.
A little disappointing from our side. I'll actually go a little further than that, very disappointing from our side, because we continue to believe that lopping together something on longer-term pricing for carbon, a bill that would also include some incentives for renewable generation, potentially transmission, would not only be good for the economic side of what we are facing right now in the US, but would be tremendous benefit to the public at large.
And as Lew has mentioned before, that if we don't get on with it, that other countries in the world certainly aren't going to hold back, and eventually we will lose the small head start that we have in overall renewable technology here in the U.S. So as far as the future, I don't know. I mean, certainly none of us can predict the future.
It doesn't look like the current Congress has any appetite to try to tackle it before the elections. I doubt seriously that it would be tackled between the elections and when the next Congress gets sworn in. So it's probably something that we will be looking at in 2011. Beyond that, there's really nothing else.
I think Lew has something to say.

They are moving forward on a whole host of regulations, some of which are directly dealing with carbon, but others will indirectly deal with carbon. And whether it's mercury, coal, ash, the (haps) or just what they are doing on carbon directly, there's still a lot of changes that are going to be impacting our industry, and frankly going to make certain plants in the country uneconomic.
So there's effectively going to be a price on carbon, and you might even argue it's a differential price by region, by plant, whatever, and there's clearly a lot more uncertainty. It's not where we would like things to be, and I don't think it's where most people in our industry would like things to be.
So there's still going to be pressure to do something, because this is clearly not the optimal way to be regulating emissions in our industry.

But could you delve a little bit further into what's going on, both in the pure sort of gas and power markets vis-√†-vis the drop in opportunities? Is that really because of sort of a diminishing liquidity as everyone kind of steps back to try to figure out these rules? And so sort of post-CFTC getting on with putting the details in front of us, should we see an increase in liquidity, and then an increase in profit-making opportunity in that business? That's my first question. Or am I making a false correlation there?
Second question is, on the retail side of the business in terms of the increase you've seen in opportunities, is that really just because of the spread between retail pricing and wholesale pricing? Is that because customers are becoming less sticky? Is there any particular market in which you've made inroads? So that's just two questions but I guess in 27 parts.

Folks that are in this business every day, and are buying and selling the commodity, not necessarily for physical delivery, love to see volatility in the markets, whether it's volatility on the way up or volatility on the way down. When you start limiting the amount of volatility, especially in the short-term, that tends to drive down the number of opportunities.
At least at this point, I don't think that it's uncertainty over the financial regulatory reform. Although some of our larger counterparties, which would be the banks, are clearly very concerned as to what this is going to mean from a capital allocation standpoint. But that might be something that plays out in the future, but at least what we've seen in the past, it's really just a lack of volatility in the commodity market, at least in the gas and power market.
Your second point about, because I did mention we are doing a little bit better on the full requirements front than what we expected to do at the beginning of the year, I don't know that you can attribute it to any one factor. I think the factors certainly that you pointed out, which have to deal with retail pricing and the spread there is one, but I think it's also the number of people that are in the market.
You know, we're seeing, especially in some of what I would call the larger transactions, we're not seeing as many people in the market as we were seeing before. That doesn't necessarily mean that there won't be. One of the larger players that, I won't mention who that is, but one of the larger players that seemed to have pulled out of the market last year is now back in very aggressively. So I think it changes, maybe as management focus changes as they perceive opportunities.
But at least for the rest of this year, we feel relatively comfortable that the small piece of business that we do there will continue to come to us.

So I guess if we sort of drill down there a little bit, is it fair to say we are seeing some glimmers of hope and it's getting a little easier, or is it just still equally as difficult as it was in the first quarter, and you all are just having successes for a myriad of reasons?

I don't know that I'd use the word 'easy' in any comment that I would make regarding the contracting market. I think I would say, and we've said before, that all other things held constant, as load picks up because the economy picks up, folks feel better; and by folks, I mean our potential customers. The large utilities feel better about taking on longer-term contracts to meet their own obligations, which is, as load decreased over the last couple of years that the amount of power that they were getting from renewable sources, hence increased. And as the economy gets better, as folks start feeling better, I do believe that the opportunities will continue to pick up for us.
The environment clearly is not as difficult as it was last year. But as I mentioned, both in the fourth quarter last year and in the first quarter this year, it's a number of factors; it's not just the reduction in load, it's really the uncertainty as to what's going on a Federal level regarding energy legislation. It's also the fact that production tax credits do not expire at the end of this year. I mean, it's a number of factors.
And so, although as a team we feel very good about having signed 784 megawatts of wind this year, and feel very good about 247 of that being for next year, we recognize that wind build across the U.S. is down. I don't think AWI has come out with their second quarter numbers yet, but I would expect that when they do come out, they are not going to be numbers that we can all kind of jump on the table and cheer about.
But in that environment, we continue to do I think very well; 600 to 850 this year, 700 to 1,000 next year, 784 signed this year. We feel better about what we are doing, we feel better about our development opportunities, but it's a really, really far cry as to what we were seeing back in 2007. I don't know that I can add any more color to that, Jay.

Sitting here today, I feel a little better than the comments that I made in the fourth quarter last year. But it takes two to tango, if you will.
There's been a number of transactions, as you know, that have been pulled from the market this year because folks didn't like the price that us and others kind of put on the table. Whether that changes or not, the rest of the year remains to be seen. We continue to be active, looking at a number of projects, but the price that we are willing to pay is a price that gives us a good return for our shareholders, and this is not the market that it was in 2006 and 2007, even 2008, when some of these folks first got into these projects, first started getting permits, first started getting their wind turbines ordered at a pretty high price.
So everybody has got to get comfortable with the ultimate transaction price. But the final thought that I would leave you with. is we are looking at a number of opportunities that we think would be great opportunities if they come to fruition.

When you look at it, the value of the long-term wind contract, relative to our customers' site plans or our customers' integrated resource plans, the value of wind remains very compelling on a long-term basis.
And so we feel very comfortable from that standpoint. There continues to be demand from a state RPS standpoint. We would all love to have a federal RPS. And none of us have given up on the fact that we may get one sometime in the future. But in the meantime, there remain significant pockets of demand. And to give you a sense, our view this year, I think we said at the earnings conference that this would be a 4000 to 6000 megawatt year build. I think some of us would say it's probably closer to 4000 or 5000 megawatt build in the U.S. this year. That's still what the build was in I think '06 or '07, and we did 1000 megawatts in '06 and '07.
So fundamentally, I continue to feel in the long term very bullish about wind, and particularly because it remains a tremendous value to our customers in the long term.

So a lot of the construction that we did in Texas in '05, '06 and '07, we never expected those to be long-term contracted. And we expected those to be hedged on a long-term basis.

But really everywhere else in the U.S., we always expected those to be long-term contracted. And I have talked before about the fact that some of our wind don't have long term contracts, but we continue to include them in contracted. What we did this quarter was just to change that a bit; we continue to put them in contracted because again that's our expectation that we will have long term contracts or wouldn't have built the projects in the first place.
But we changed the percentage hedged so that we no longer include in the gross margin hedged; we no longer include that margin that is not contracted. So I consider it a small change. We continue to feel comfortable. We have 7600 megawatts of wind, roughly 400 of that is uncontracted; roughly 16 to 1700 of that is hedged. So the 400 is a very small number in the overall scheme of things.
I just wanted to make the change in the gross margin table because I just kind of felt better about it actually.

Armando Pimentel will discuss the elements of the agreement in greater detail. For my part, I want to thank those who represent Florida‚Äôs electric consumers for working with us to craft an agreement that should provide financial stability for customers and the Company alike.
Our investments in Florida‚Äôs electrical infrastructure which this rate settlement will allow us to continue have provided significant benefits for our customers. Compared to the national average, our bills are 24% lower, our operating and maintenance cost are 34% lower, our reliability is 46% higher and our fleet is cleaner producing electricity with 35% fewer carbon dioxide emissions, 55% fewer sulfur dioxide emissions and 75% fewer nitrogen oxide emissions.
In other developments at FPL, we continue to make progress on our third combined cycle unit at the West County Energy Center which is expected to come online around the middle of 2011. When complete, the West County Energy Center will be one of the largest and cleanest fossil fuel facilities in the United States.
In addition, we have begun construction activities at our Cape Canaveral plant. The modernized Canaveral and Riviera Beach facilities which are scheduled to come online in 2013 and 2014 respectively are designed to have a heat rate below 6500 compared to a current industry average of more than 10,000. They are expected to be among the most efficient natural gas plants in the nation with significant customer benefits in terms of fuel and other savings.
Environmentally, the new units are expected to be far cleaner than the units they replace, reducing the rate of sulfur dioxide emissions by 98%, the rate of nitrogen oxide emissions by 93% and the rate of particulate emissions by 89%.
At Energy Resources we have added approximately 1260 megawatts of new win capacity since the end of the second quarter 2009, and expect that at year end 2010 we will continue to be the nation‚Äôs leader in wind energy generation.
Looking ahead, while we clearly see some uncertainty in the renewables development business, we continue to see profitable growth opportunities in both the wind and solar businesses. To that end, we are cautiously optimistic that in 2011 we will add approximately 700 to 1000 megawatts of wind assets to the portfolio.
Now also encouraging is the renewed interest we are seeing in differential membership transaction, otherwise known as tax equity deals which had all vanished during the recession.
During the quarter, we entered into an innovative transaction that will allow us to reduce the amount of production tax credit that we may have otherwise deferred on our balance sheet in the future.
On the solar front, our 250 megawatt Genesis solar project has now received the majority of the necessary permits and approvals including all required approvals from the State of California.
Genesis will be located in one of the best solar resource regions in the United States and we will deploy the same proven solar trough technology in use at our SEGS and Martin facilities,
On the national policy front, I wish I could say that everyone in Washington shared our commitment to expanding the renewable energy industry. But as we have seen in the summer and fall, the clean energy policy has been caught up by gridlock in Washington.
As long as this uncertainty hangs over the electric power industry, capital that would otherwise be usefully deployed will continue to sit on the sidelines. This will not only jeopardize the nation‚Äôs lead in renewable energy technologies that we helped planned here such as wind power, but it will cost the economy thousands of jobs at a time when we need them the most.
Of course even in the absence of new legislation, it appears that the Environmental Protection Agency will be putting a de facto price on carbon through the enforcement of regulations governing sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and coal ash.
At the time when analysts and others are predicting that the industry will retire tens of thousands of megawatts of coal-fired generation, NextEra remains in the enviable position of producing only 4% of its power from coal.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Armando Pimentel.

I‚Äôd like to share a couple of additional accomplishments before we get into the financial details of the quarter. During the quarter, we continued to execute well against our financing plan issuing a mixture of debt and equity securities from both international and domestic sources of capital.
As Lew mentioned, during the quarter, we completed another differential membership transaction relating to 309 megawatts of wind energy projects in North Dakota and Iowa.
This transaction represents a unique structure for Energy Resources in which a differential part membership investor makes an initial upfront payment and will make additional payments over time tide to the energy production of the wind projects. This structure allows us to raise tax equity for existing projects that have been previously financed with project debt.
We continue to seek opportunities to minimize the growth of deferred production tax credits or PTCs on our balance sheet and the availability of this structure would allow us to receive compensation for future PTCs before we would have otherwise been able to monetize them. We would consider using the structure again in the future.
In September, we sold 20-year FPL Group Capital senior notes with a principal amount of ¬•10 billion. At the same time, FTL Group Capital entered into swaps to hedge against currency movement and fix the interest rate associated with the notes. Net proceeds were US$120 million.
As we highlighted at the Investor Conference, we believe we are very well diversified in terms of primary markets and regions when it comes to raising debt. We will continue to seek credit globally and execute those transactions that we consider to be most favorable.
Also in September, we sold $402.5 million of equity units, which consist of a contract to purchase NextEra Energy common stock in the future and an interest in a five-year FPL Group capital debenture. We were pleased with the terms and note that this issuance is consistent with the equity plan we discussed with investors in May.
Lastly, in October, we entered into approximately $750 million forward starting interest rate swaps designed to lock in rates for future debt issuances which are expected to refinance scheduled maturities of FPL Group capital debentures in 2011 and 2013. Long-term interest rates are at historically low levels and we plan for these instruments to allow us to hedge a portion of our future debt refinancings.
Earlier this month, the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted our certificate of convenience and necessity or CCN for a 36 mile portion of the CREZ transmission project awarded to our subsidiary Lone Star Transmission. The CCN gives us assurance that we will get recovery on this portion of our investment and it clears the way for us to begin construction on this portion of the line.
We requested that this section be evaluated separately in the expectation that it would allow us to expedite the process for this portion of the line. We are optimistic that we will get the CCN for the balance of the 300 mile project by the end of this year.
In the third quarter of 2010, NextEra Energy‚Äôs GAAP net income was $720 million or $1.74 per share. NextEra Energy‚Äôs adjusted 2010 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $602 million and $1.45 per share. The difference between the GAAP results and the adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our non-qualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investments or OTTI.
For the third quarter, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $308 million or $0.74 per share. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I would like to spend a couple of minutes on the rate case settlement agreement.
As Lew mentioned, but the bears repeating, we strongly believe this agreement is positive for our customers and our investors alike. Under the terms of the agreement, retail base rates would remain frozen as specified in the agreement through the end of 2012 and the authorized regulatory ROE or return on equity would remain at 10% plus or minus 100 basis points.
FPL would be permitted to recover the base revenue requirement associated with West County Energy Center Unit 3 through the capacity clause up to the amount of the projective fuel savings attributable to the unit. This mechanism allows for current cash recovery without an expected increase in the customer‚Äôs total bill.
We currently estimate that the 2011 fuel savings will be roughly in line with but slight less than the revenue requirements for the plant based on current commodity prices and generation mix. This settlement would allow FPL the flexibility to vary the annual amortization of theoretical depreciation reserve surplus or depreciation credit to keep FPL‚Äôs earned regulatory ROE within the approved range of 9% to 11% subject to certain annual and total caps.
The $267 million annual cap on the depreciation credit applies to each year of the agreement but any unused amount in a given year could be carried forward and would be available for use in subsequent years. No more than $776 million of the depreciation credit could be taken during the term of the agreement. The agreement has the support of the Attorney General‚Äôs office, the Office of Public Counsel and the other principal parties in our rate case, as well as the recommended approval of the PSC staff.
Given all of this, we believe approval is the most probable outcome and this forms the basis for our accounting for the quarter. As such on a year-to-date basis and as a result of favorable weather, we have not recorded any depreciation credit in order to be in compliance with the regulatory ROE provisions of the settlement agreement.
The table shown here summarizes the earnings drivers for Florida Power & Light for the just completed quarter. In total, earnings decreased by $0.01 per share, the increase in base revenues related to West County Energy Center units 1 and 2, weather and the impact of our base rate increase will roughly offset by the increase in depreciation expense, not only as the result of the addition of the West County units but also due to the reduction of surplus depreciation amortization which increases net depreciation expense is consistent with the pending settlement agreement.
We are continuing to see some improvement as it relates to our customer metrics. The table in the upper left shows a change in retail kilowatt-hour sales versus last year‚Äôs comparable period.
Overall retail kilowatt-hour sales grew by 3% and improvement due primarily to higher weather related usage but also for modest growth in customers. Non-weather related or underlying usage growth mix and all other was essentially flat.
As depicted in the graph in the upper right hand corner, during the third quarter of 2010 we had approximately 27000 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2009. We continue to be cautiously optimistic that our customer growth is returning and we are encouraged that we continue to see modest increases in customer accounts.
The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low usage customers, which we believe depicts the level of empty homes in our service territory. Although inactive accounts are down relative to last year, they remained relatively flat as compared to the second quarter. Low usage accounts continued to decline during the third quarter.
The chart on the bottom right depicts the level of new housing starts for single-family homes in FPL service territory. Housing starts are fairly good leading indicator of certain additions to our customer base roughly a year out.
After experiencing rapid declines during the recession, the volume of housing starts appears to have stabilized. However, the current volume of permits remains low or about 12% of what it was at the height of the housing boom that preceded the recession.
We continue to see some improvements in many of our customer metrics and for longer term, believe Florida will continue to be a very attractive destination to which people will move. In fact, just this month Florida was selected as the second most popular state to which baby boomers would like to move according to a Harris Poll survey. However, in the short-term, we remain cautious about the strength of the economy.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources. Since the end of the second quarter of 2009, we‚Äôve added approximately 1,260 megawatts of new wind generation and continue to be the nation‚Äôs leading producer of wind power. In addition, we have continued to make progress on our solar development pipeline.
During the quarter, our Genesis solar thermal project received approvals from the California Public Utility Commission and the California Energy Commission. Genesis has also been selected by the Bureau of Land Management as a fast-track project and we are hopeful that the project will receive the BLM approval in the next couple of weeks.
These approvals are major milestones in the development of this roughly $1 billion project, which we expect to be brought online in 2013 and 2014. This project has been many years in the making and we are very encouraged to see state and federal agencies working together to bring the benefits of this clean energy project to the citizens of California.
Energy Resources reported third quarter 2010 GAAP earnings of $386 million or $0.93 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter, which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges and net OTTI were $267 million or $0.60 per share. As we mentioned in the first quarter, we have changed the methodology for allocating interest and shared cost to affiliates and the historical figures have been changed to reflect the change.
Energy Resources‚Äô third quarter adjusted EPS was up $0.05 relative to last year‚Äôs comparable quarter. New wind investments contribute $0.05 per share. Of this, roughly $0.03 reflects our ability to recognize a state investment tax credit on some our wind projects.
As always, we will continue to seek opportunities for enhanced economics in states with incremental incentives. We continue to estimate that we will elect to take convertible investment tax credits or as we call them CITCs on approximately 600 megawatts of new wind generation to be placed in service in 2010.
In aggregate, the existing portfolio contributed $0.05 relative to the prior year. Our existing wind assets contributed $0.04 driven primarily by a better wind resource. Performance from our existing merchant assets was down by $0.01 while contracted assets realized a $0.02 increase due to the commencement of long-term contracts on our Marcus Hook 750 and Blythe facilities.
During the third quarter evaluation of our shale gas well drilling program, we determined that we would not move forward on a subset of future drilling opportunities whose output we had previously hedged.
As we have previously communicated, upon approval of the well drilling program, we hedged the anticipated production from those wells in order to lock in a substantial amount of the wells economics. Our decision to not proceed on these specific wells resulted in a $0.04 after tax gain when we exited the hedged position.
Consistent with what we discussed at our investor conference earlier this year, we continue to be interested in natural gas infrastructure opportunities. The customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses were down by $0.04 relative to the prior year primarily due to lower contributions from power and gas trading.
As we have said before, opportunities in this part of the business fluctuate based on a number of factors. And while last year‚Äôs quarter was up $0.07 compared to $2008, this year‚Äôs third quarter did not have as many opportunities for us to pursue.
To be consistent with the information we provide to you on the gross margin hedged slides, (inaudible) is included in customer supplied businesses for presentation of comparable earnings. The customer supply businesses continue to do very well on a year-to-date basis. All other factors were negative $0.05 primarily due to higher interest expense.
Although our expected gross margin is very well hedged, the current commodity price backdrop has an impact on our business. This manifests itself in two ways; first, in the portion of our existing assets that is un-contracted and unhedged which is roughly 8% of our existing asset gross margin in 2011 and 17% in 2012. Secondly, as we have discussed before it is one of the several items that affects counterparty‚Äôs interest in signing long-term contracts for renewable generation.
This is a forecast we presented at the Investor Conference in May of this year, the ten year natural gas strip has declined 16% while the 2012 calendar strip has declined by 21%. In the near-term our open gross margin is relatively modest and as such there is not much of a significant direct effect on our gross margin as it relates to our existing assets but there is some impact.
Additionally, indirectly the lower power and gas prices affect our expectations around the currently un-contracted wind assets that we expect to contract under long-term power purchase agreements.
Let me discuss that in a little more detail as we turn to our hedging status for 2011 and 2012 and expect the equivalent gross margins. Over the last couple of years, we have increased the percentage of our business that is hedged in the near-term mainly as a result of what we believe would be a more uncertain commodity price environment. In addition, we continue to take steps to minimize the risk and improve the visibility of the earnings and cash flow profile for the portfolio.
As I mentioned earlier, contracts that were effective this year on appropriately 1,190 megawatts representing both Blythe and Marcus Hook 750 helped earnings for the quarter. Additionally, since the beginning of 2008 we have signed approximately 2,110 megawatts of wind PPAs and approximately 350 million megawatts of solar PPAs.
For 2011, we are 92% hedged on expected equivalent gross margin on our existing assets. Across all of the Energy Resources businesses, the midpoint to our total expected equivalent gross margin has decreased by approximately $155 million since the second quarter. I do not focus too much on this midpoint, but I know that many of you do, so I have chosen it here as a frame of reference.
The three main drivers of this decrease are in our new asset additions, in our existing wind assets and in our power and gas trading business. As we do every year at this time, we have moved the new assets expected to be in service by the end of 2010 up to the appropriate categories of existing assets and so what you see now in the new investment line are the expected results of the assets we expect to place in service in 2011.
For these 2011 asset additions, our gross margin estimate is down approximately $65 million since the second quarter due primarily to lower estimated CITC elections associated with reduced new build wind assumptions and solar assumptions.
Net of the positive impact of the 2010 asset additions that moved into existing assets, the contracted wind assets gross margin is down approximately $35 million, primarily due to the sustained lower power and natural gas prices on uncontracted assets that I spoke about just a minute ago.
Finally, the power and gas trading business is down roughly $55 million due to our expectation in the near term that the low volatility and low price environment will mean that there are less opportunities for this business.
Turning to the 2012 gross margin, we are 83% hedged on expected equivalent gross margin on our existing assets. Although there are many puts and takes when comparing 2011 to 2012, I wanted to highlight a few of the more significant items.
Please note that we did not include the impact of any new wind or solar generation that we expect to build in 2012. Although the operating earnings impact for the new investments put in place in 2012 could be modest as a result of the expected commissioning dates, we do expect to qualify for CITC on a good portion of our 2012 wind and solar development, but that margin is not included in this slide.
As we did last year, we will add 2012 new asset information as the year gets closer. In the new investment line, you will only see the full earnings impact from the new wind and solar assets we expect to build in 2011.
Our contracted wind segment is expected to be down roughly $20 million compared to 2011, which is roughly the difference between the expiration of PTCs and expected PPA pricing on new contracts for the currently uncontracted assets as well as PPA price increases embedded in our current PPAs.
Our contracted other segment is expected to be roughly flat due to the full year effect of the upgrade we expect to complete at our Point Beach nuclear facility in Wisconsin in 2011 net of the expiration of some power sales contract on two of our gas-fired facilities in the Northeast.
Our hedged wind and merchant Northeast other categories are expected to be down approximately $45 million each due to the roll-off of higher-priced hedges. Our gas infrastructure business reflects over shale gas drilling program and the majority of this margin is currently hedged. The targets for the customer supply business in power and gas trading reflect the modest increase over reduced 2011 expectations.
I would like to provide a brief update on our wind development plans for the remainder of 2010 and 2011. For 2010, we currently have approximately 680 megawatts of new wind already in service or under construction and likely to be commissioned although some megawatts may roll over to the first parts of 2011.
We are mindful that this is likely the toughest wind development market in some time. For 2011, we remain cautiously optimistic that we will add between 700 to 1000 megawatts of wind generation.
Although we have had some success this year in signing long-term PPAs, we continue to see some sluggishness as it relates to securing long-term PPAs. At the same time, we are seeing reductions in the cost to build new wind projects, so the average economic returns we are expecting are still attractive.
We would like to provide a little more clarity on 2010 and 2011 adjusted EPS guidance. Based on our assumption that the settlement agreement will be approved, for 2010 we expect adjusted earnings share to be within the lower half of our previous disclosed range of $4.25 to $4.65.
In the quarter, FPL lowered its surplus depreciation and amortization which has the effect of increasing net depreciation expense by approximately $0.12 of adjusted EPS. This reduction is consistent with the settlement agreement. Looking at the longer term picture though, the current reduction in earnings as a result of higher depreciation expense in 2010 provides us a bit more certainty regarding our 2012 earnings and returns at FPL.
If the settlement agreement is ultimately rejected, which we believe to be a low probability based on the support it is receiving from interveners, 2010 results could be at the high end of the original range due in large part to additional surplus depreciation and amortization which FPL would likely record.
Turning now to 2011, we last indicated that our 2011 adjusted earnings would be roughly in line with the 2010 range. Since then we have had a number of positive and negative developments that affect our adjusted earnings per share expectations.
On the positive side, the rate case settlement agreement would allow for substantial recovery of West County unit 3 in 2011 on a cash basis. However, at Energy Resources the factors that I just discussed related to 2011 gross margin have negatively affected the earnings outlook.
First, as we noted in the updated 2011 gross margin estimates, we are now expecting fewer CITC elections than we previously expected. This revision is a result of our view that the wind development market will continue to be challenging next year.
Second, based simply on the fact that we have some un-contracted wind assets and a declining commodity price environment, we need to reduce gross margin expectations.
In addition, the timing of expected PPAs has been slightly extended. And third, we think there should be reduced expectations related to our proprietary trading business in 2011.
As we have shown you before, these businesses go into the year largely unhedged unlike our existing assets and it makes sense for us to reduce expectations in this area based on what we perceive as the near-term opportunities in the market.
Incorporating all these factors, we now believe that we can narrow the range of our 2011 adjusted earnings per share estimate to between $4.25 and $4.55. We continue to feel comfortable with the 5% to 7% average annual increase in adjusted EPS through 2014 from a 2009 base, although we do not expect that average to necessarily be the actually increase in each year-to-year period.
We also continue to be open asset acquisitions that fit our portfolio and investment profile and there are quite a number of those opportunities at this time. While we look at most opportunities, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to capital deployment.
Over time, we have strived to be in a strong financial position, which enables us to take advantage of those opportunities that meet our criteria. As always, these potential opportunities are not reflected in the specific development targets we have provided to you.
To summarize the 2010 third quarter on an adjusted basis, FPL converted $0.74 per share, Energy Resources contributed $0.64 per share and corporate and other contributed $0.07 per share, primarily as a result of on adjustment related to the previously deferred taxes. That is a total of $1.45 per share compared to $1.38 per share in the 2009 third quarter or about a 5% increase year-over-year.
Thank you for listening. With that, I‚Äôll turn the call over to questions.

That has not changed. I talked about that a little bit before.
Many of our projects do not have a long-term power purchase agreement when we begin. In the past, many of them did have a power purchase agreement, where we expected to get a power purchase agreement by the time construction ended. But here in the last 12 to 18 months, the process has been a little slower. So, it doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre not going to deploy capital if we don‚Äôt have a long-term power purchase agreement in hand, but does mean we are going to be a little more cautious than we have in the past because it has taken a little longer in some cases to get an agreement than we originally believed.

If we‚Äôre under, and this is in the agreement, if we‚Äôre under the 11%, we would have to use amortization or the depreciation credit to get us up. That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that we have to get to 11%. If we are over 11%, we would not be able to use any depreciation credit to keep us over 11%.
And let me just go back on something I just said because as I said the last part of it I miss spoke on the first part. If we‚Äôre under 9% we‚Äôre required to use amortization credit to get us up to 9% and we‚Äôre over 11%, we can‚Äôt use any to keep us over 11%.

I was trying to answer another question that I thought Dan was trying to get to. I think a presumption by investors and the analysts that the midpoint of 10% was in our previous guidance, I think is appropriate. You‚Äôre trying to link that previous guidance in i.e. at 10% and also 2011 earnings.
Let me kind of explain it this way, and maybe it will be helpful to you and others on the call. The amount of gross margin reduction for what I‚Äôll call the lower build in 2011 for both wind and solar is roughly $0.10, and you can take the gross margin number you can tax affect it, it‚Äôs roughly $0.10 and again that would be a reduction.
The reduction in the lower commodity prices due to our own contract wind assets and slightly extending the term of the merchant time that those projects will be in a merchant state is roughly $0.07. The reduction in proprietary power and gas trading that I mentioned in 2011 is also $0.07. In this call I also said that the amount of fuel savings attributable to West County 3 are roughly in line with but slightly less than the revenue requirements were roughly $100 million.
If you add all that together, right, and again I am going just from revenue line, I‚Äôm not really focused on the bottom in, but if you add all that together you roughly get a net $0.10 deduction from whatever midpoint you started with. Right, if you add all that together. What we‚Äôve actually done is we brought the midpoint down of our 2011 guidance down $0.05 from 445 to 440. That‚Äôs the way I look at it.

It‚Äôs a little less than that. Last time I had mentioned that number, it was 400 megawatts. The amount that we would expect to have at the end of the year, i.e. because you‚Äôre referring to 680 megawatts, some of those 680 megawatts do not have current contracts. So unless and it could, but unless we get a contract by the end of the year on some of those projects, the end of the year we‚Äôll roughly have 700 megawatts of un-contracted wind plans that have been constructed, and that‚Äôs different and just to kind of add to that we have roughly 1,700 megawatts of un-contracted but hedged wind projects out in Texas.
Now when we build those, those weren‚Äôt ever expected to be contracted, so the $700 and I am talking about for the end of the year are those that we do expect to get contracts on but we do not have contracts on or we do not expect to have contracts on at the end of the year. Is that helpful?

So that‚Äôs why we‚Äôve gone back to it.

Let‚Äôs put that aside for a second. The very real issue for us, and we think that‚Äôd be winnable case for us, but putting that aside, if you go back to the rate case, you essentially would have to amortize $224 million on a pre-tax basis, so that‚Äôs a credit to depreciation expense for the entire year on a pre-tax basis, in addition to the favorable weather that we‚Äôve had at Florida Power & Light Company which is roughly $0.17, $0.18, $0.19 on a year-to-date basis.

In this particular circumstance, we had hedged the wells or we had hedged the expected production from the wells. As we looked at the economics in a declining natural gas environment, we believe that it made more sense for us to take the capital that we had allocated to those wells and put it to use in other places. So that meant that we were able to flattened out the hedges and when we fattened out the hedges at least internally we take all of our documentation pretty seriously.
These are non-qualifying hedges which may not mean a whole heck of a lot to you. But it‚Äôs sort of like internal hedge accounting and our documentation once we flattened out the hedges for these particular hedges required us to take the gain in this case. It would have required us to take the loss, if it was a loss. But it was a gain and we made the right economic decision and we moved on. It was $0.04 or so for the quarter, but it was a small subset of wells that we were dealing.
It‚Äôs a business that we continue to be very happy to be in and with the hedges that we have in place, we feel pretty good about the remaining investment. That‚Äôs not to say that in the future we may not change our mind on some of those. But it‚Äôs a business that we‚Äôve got heck of a lot of knowledge from as well as some pretty good returns on.

Thank you, Rebecca, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy continued to deliver solid results in the third quarter of 2010, increasing adjusted earnings per share by more than 5% over the prior year quarter from $1.38 to $1.45.
The most significant development during the quarter was the settlement agreement we reached with the principal parties involved in our rate case. We believe this agreement is in the best interest of all the parties involved, especially the approximately 8.7 million for radiance we serve. The FPL's typical residential customer bill is already the lowest of all 55 utilities in the state of Florida, and under the terms of this agreement which is awaiting approval by the Florida Public Service Commission, retail base rates would remain frozen through 2012. 
Armando Pimentel will discuss the elements of the agreement in greater detail. For my part, I want to thank those who represent Florida of electric consumers for working with us the craft and agreement that you provide financial stability for customers and the company alike.
Our investment in Florida electrical infrastructure which this rate settelement will allow us to continue have provided significant benefits for our customers. Compared to the national average, our bills are 24% lower, our operating maintenance costs are 34% lower, our reliability is 46% higher and our fleet is cleaner, producing electricity with 35% fewer carbon dioxide emissions, 55% fewer sulfur dioxide emissions and 75% fewer nitrogen oxide emissions.
In other development with FPL, we continue to make progress on our third combined cycle unit at the West County Energy Center, which is expected to come online around the middle of 2011. When complete, the West County Energy Center will be one of the largest and cleanest profitable fuel facilities in the United States. In addition, we have begun construction activities at our Cape Canaveral plant, the modernized canaveral and review of our beach facilities, which are scheduled to come online in 2013 and 2014, respectively, are designed to have a heat rate below 6,500 compared to a current industry average of more than 10,000. They're expected to be among the most efficient natural gas plants in the nation with significant customer benefits in terms of fuel and other savings. 
Environmentally, the new units are expected to be far cleaner than the units they replace, reducing the rate of sulfur dioxide emissions by 98%, the rate of nitrogen oxide emissions by 93% and the rate of particular emissions by 89%.
In energy resources, we have added approximately 1,260 megawatts of new wind capacities since the end of the second quarter of 2009 and expect that at year end 2010, we'll continue to be the nation's leader in wind energy generation. Looking ahead, while we clearly see some uncertainty in the Renewables Development business, we continue to see profitable growth opportunities in both the Wind and Solar businesses. To that end, we are cautiously optimistic that in 2011, we will add approximately 700 to 1,000 megawatts of wind assets to the portfolio. 
Now also encouraging is the renewed interest we're seeing in differential membership transaction otherwise known as tax equity deals which had all the vendors during the recession. During the quarter we entered into an innovative transaction that will allow us to reduce the amount of production tax credit that we may have otherwise deferred on our balance sheet in the future.
On the solar front, our 250-megawatt genesis solar project has now received the majority of the necessary permits and approvals, including all required approvals from the state of California. Genesis will be located in one of the best solar resource regions in the United States, and we will deploy the same proven solar trough technology in New Southern Stags [ph] and Martin facilities. 
On the national policy front, I wish I could say that everyone in Washington shared our commitment to expanding the renewable energy industry. But as we have seen the summer and fall, the clean energy policy has been caught up by gridlock in Washington. As long as there's uncertainty hangs over the electric power industry, capital that would otherwise be usually deployed will continue to sit on the sidelines. This will not only jeopardize nation's leading renewable energy technologies that we help plan year such as wind power, but it will cost the economy thousands of jobs at a time when we need them the most. Of course, even with the absence of new legislation, it appears that the environmental protection agency will be putting  de facto price on carbons for the enforcement of regulations governing sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury and cole ash. As time when analysts and others are predicting that the industry will retire tens of thousands of megawatt of coal-fired generation, NextEra Energy remains in the enviable position of producing only 4% of its power from coal.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Armando Pimentel."

I would like to share a couple of additional accomplishments before we get into the financial details of the quarter. During the quarter, we continue to execute well against our financing plan, issuing a mixture of debt and equity securities from both international and domestic sources of capital. As Lew mentioned, during the quarter, we completed another differential membership transaction relating to 309 megawatts of wind energy projects in North Dakota and Iowa. This transaction represents a unique structure for energy resources in which the differential part membership investor makes an initial upfront payment that will make additional payments overtime tied to the energy production of the wind projects. This structure allows us to raise tax equity for existing projects that have been previously financed with project debt.
We've continue to seek opportunities to minimize the growth of deferred production tax credits or PTCs on our balance sheet and the availability of this structure would allow us to receive compensation for future PTCs before we have otherwise been able to monetize them. We would consider using the structure again in the future. In September, we sold 20 year FPL capital senior notes with the principal amount of JPY  10 billion. At the same time, FPL Group capital entered into swaps that hedged against currency movements and fix the interest-rate associated with the Notes. Net proceeds were 120 million U.S. dollars. As we highlighted at the  investor conference, we believe we're very well diversified in terms of primary markets and regions when it comes to raising debt. We will continue to see credit globally and execute those transactions that we consider to be most favorable. 
Also in September, we sold $402.5 million of equity units, which consist of a contract to purchase NextEra energy common stock in the future and an interest in five-year FPL Group capital debenture. We were pleased with the terms and note that this issuance is consistent with the equity plan we discussed with investors in May. And lastly, in October, we entered into approximately $750 million of forward-starting interest rates swaps designed to lock in rates for future debt issuances, which are expected to refinance scheduled maturities of FPL Group capital debentures in 2011 and 2013. Long-term interest rates are historically low levels and we plan for these instruments to allow us to hedge a portion of our future debt refinancings.
Earlier this month, the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted our certificate of convenience and necessity or CCN for a 36-month portion of the CREZ of the transmission project awarded to our subsidiary loan start transmission. The CCN gives us assurance that we will get recovery on this portion of our investment and it clears the way for us to begin construction on this portion of the line. We requested that this section be evaluated separately in the expectation that it would allow us to expedite the process for this portion of the line. We are optimistic that we will get the CCN for the balance of the 300-mile project by the end of this year.
In the third quarter of 2010, NextEra energies GAAP net income was $720 million or $1.74 per share. NextEra Energy adjusted 2010 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $602 million and $1.45 per share. The difference between the GAAP results and the adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark and our non-qualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investment or OTTI.
For the third quarter, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $308 million or $0.74 per share. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I would like to spend a couple of minutes on the rate case settlement agreement. As Lew mentioned, but it bears repeating, we strongly believe this agreement is positive for our customers and our investors alike. Under the terms of the agreement, retail-base rates would remain frozen as specified in the agreement through the end of 2012 and the authorized regulatory ROE or return on equity would remain at 10% plus or minus 100 basis points. FDL would be permitted to recover the base revenue requirements associated with West County Energy Center unit three due to capacity cost up to the amount of the projected fuel savings attributable to the unit. This mechanism allows for current cash recovery without an expected increase in the customers total bill. 
We currently estimate that the 2011 fuel savings will be roughly in line with but slightly less than the revenue requirements for the plant based on current commodity prices and generation mix. The settlement would allow FPL the flexibility to vary the annual amortization of theoretical depreciation reserve surplus or depreciation credit to keep FPL's earned regulatory ROE within the approved range of 9% to 11% subject to certain annual and total caps.
The $267 million annual cap on the depreciation credit applies to each share of the agreement, but any unused amount in a given year to be carried forward and would be available for use in subsequent years. No more than $776 million of the depreciation credit could be taken during the term of the agreement. The agreement has a support of the Attorney General's office, the office of public counsel and the other principal parties in our rate case, as well as the recommended approval of the PSC staff. Given all of this, we believe approval is the most probable outcome and this forms the basis for our accounting for the quarter. As such, on a year-to-date basis, and as a result of favorable weather, we have not recorded any depreciation credit in order to be in compliance with the regulatory ROE provisions of the settlement agreement.
The table shown here summarizes the earnings drivers for Florida Power & Light for the just-completed quarter. In total, earnings decreased by $0.01 per share. The increase in base revenues related to West County Energy Center units one and two weather and the impact of our base rate increase were roughly offset by the increase in depreciation expense. Not only as a result of the addition of the West County units, but also due to the reduction of surplus depreciation amortization, which increases net depreciation expense consistent with the pending settlement agreement.
We are continuing to see some improvement as it relates to our customer metrics. The table in the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt-hour sales versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt-hour sales grew by 3%, an improvement due primarily to higher weather-related usage but also from modest growth in customers. Non-weather-related or underlying usage growth mix and all other was essentially flat. As depicted in the graph in the upper right-hand corner, during the third quarter of 2010, we had approximately 27,000 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2009. We continue to be cautiously optimistic that our customer growth is returning and we are encouraged that we continue to see modest increases in customer accounts.
The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low usage customers, which we believe depicts the level of empty homes in our service territory. Although inactive accounts are down relative to last year, they remained relatively flat as compared to the second quarter. Low usage accounts continue to decline during the third quarter. The chart on the bottom right depicts the  level of new housing starts for single-family homes and FPL service territory. Housing starts are fairly good leading indicator of certain additions to our customer base roughly a year out. After experiencing rapid declines during the recession, the volume of housing starts appears to have stabilized. However, the current volume of permits remains low or about 12% of what it was at the height of the housing room that preceded the recession. 
We continue to see some improvements in many of our customer metrics, and for the longer-term, believe Florida will continue to be a very attractive destination to which people will move. In fact, just this month, Florida was selected as the second most populous state for which baby boomers would like to move according to our hair's pulse survey [ph]. However, in the short term, we remain cautious about the strength of the economy.
Let me now turn to energy resources. Since the end of the second quarter of 2009, we have added approximately 1260 megawatts of new wind generation and continue to be the nations leading producer of wind of power. In addition, we have continued to make progress on our solar development pipeline. During the quarter, Genesis solar thermal project received approvals from the California Public Utilities Commission and the California Energy Commission. Genesis has also been selected by the Bureau of Land Management as a fast-track project, and we are hopeful that the project will receive BLM approval in the next couple of weeks. These approvals are major milestones in the development of this roughly $1 billion project, which we expect to be brought online in 2013 and 2014. This project has been many years in the making and we are very encouraged to see state and federal agencies working together to bring the benefits of these clean energy project for the citizens of California.
Energy resources reported third quarter 2010 GAAP earnings of $386 million or $0.93 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges and net OTTI were $267 million or $0.64 per share. As we mentioned in the first quarter, we have changed the methodology for allocating interest and shared costs to affiliates and this historical figures have been changed to reflect the change.
Energy resources third quarter adjusted EPS was up $0.05 relative to last year's comparable quarter. New wind investments contributed $0.05 per share of this, roughly $0.03 reflects our ability to recognize a state investment tax credit on some of our wind projects. As always, we will continue to seek opportunities for enhanced economics in states with incremental incentives. We continue to estimate that we will elect to take convertible investment tax credit or as we call them CITCs on approximately 600 megawatts of new wind generation to be placed in service in 2010. 
In aggregate, the existing portfolio contributed $0.05 relative to the prior year. Our existing wind assets contributed $0.04 driven primarily by a better wind resource. Performance from our existing merchant assets was down by $0.01 while contracted assets realized a $0.02 increase due to the commencement of long-term contracts on our markets hook 750 in blithe facilities.
During the third quarter, evaluation of our shaled gas well drilling program. We determined that we would not move forward on a subset of future drilling opportunities whose output we had previously hedged. As we have previously communicated, upon approval of a well drilling program, we hedge the anticipated production from those wells in order to lock in a substantial amount of the wells economics. Our decision to not proceed on these specific wells resulted in a $0.04 after tax gain when we exited the hedged position. Consistent with what we discussed in our investor conference earlier this year, we continue to be interested in natural gas infrastructure  opportunity.. 
The Customer Supply and Proprietary Power and Gas Trading businesses were down by $0.04 relative to the prior year, primarily due to lower contributions from power and gas trading. As we have said before, opportunities in this part of the business fluctuate based on a number of factors. And while last year's quarter was up $0.07 compared to 2008, this year's third quarter did not have as many opportunities for us to pursue. To be consistent with the information we provide to you on a gross margin hedged slide, 
Texas [ph] is included in customer supply businesses for presentation of comparable earnings. The customer supply businesses continue to do very well on a year-to-date basis.
Although the factors were negative 5%, $0.05 primarily due to higher interest expense. Although our expected gross margin is very well hedged, the current commodity price backdrop has an impact on our business. It's manifest itself in two ways. First in a portion of our existing assets that is on contract with the non-hedged, which is roughly 8% of our existing asset gross margin in 2011 and 17% in 2012. Secondly, as we have discussed before, it is one of several items that affects counterparty's interest in signing long-term contracts for renewable generation. The forecasts we presented at the investor conference in May of this year, the 10-year natural gas strip has declined 16% while a 2011 calendar strip has declined by 21%. In the near term, our open gross margin is relatively modest and as such, there's not much of a significant direct effect on our gross margin as it relates to our existing assets. But there is some impact. Additionally, indirectly, the lower power and gas prices affect our expectations around the currently on contracted wind assets that we expect to contract under long-term power purchase agreements.
Let me discuss that in a little more detail as we turn to our hedging status for 2011 and 2012 and expect that equivalent gross margins. Over the last couple of years, we have increased the percentage of our business that is hedged in the near term mainly as a result of what we believe would be more uncertain commodity price environment. In addition, we continue to take steps to minimize the risks and improve the visibility of the earnings and cash flow profile for the portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, contracts that were effective this year on approximately 1190 megawatts representing both light and markets of 750 helped earnings for the quarter. Additionally, since the beginning of 2008, we have signed approximately 2100 megawatts of wind PPAs and approximately 350 megawatts of solar PPAs. For 2011, we are 92% hedged on expected equivalent gross margin on our existing assets. 
Across all of the energy resources businesses, the midpoint of our total expected equivalent gross margin has decreased by approximately 155 million since the second quarter. I do not focus too much of this midpoint, but I know that many of you do, so I have chosen a tier as a frame of reference. The three main drivers of this decrease or in new asset additions and our existing wind assets and in our power and gas trading business. As we do every year at this time, we have moved the new assets expected to be in service by the end of 2010, up to the appropriate categories of existing assets and so what you see now in the new investment line are the expected results of the asset we expect to placed in service in 2011.
For these 2011 asset additions, our gross margin estimate is down approximately $65 million since the second quarter due primarily to lower estimated CITC elections associated with reduced new-build wind assumptions and solar assumptions. Net of the positive impact of the 2010 asset additions that moved into existing assets, the contracted wind assets gross margin is down approximately $35 million primarily due to the sustained lower power and natural gas prices on uncontracted assets that I spoke about just a minute ago. Finally, the power and gas trading business is down roughly $55 million due to our expectation in the near term that the volatility and low price environment will mean that there are less opportunities for this business.
Turning to the 2012 gross margin, we're 83% hedged and expected equivalent gross margin on our existing assets. Although there are many puts and takes when comparing 2011 to 2012, I wanted to highlight a few of the more significant items. Please note that we did not include the impact of any new wind or solar generation than we expect to build in 2012. Although the operating earnings impact for the new investments put in place in 2012 could be modest as a result of the expected commissioning dates, we do expect to qualify for CITC on a good portion of our 2012 wind and solar development, but that margin is not included in this slide.
As we did last year, we will add 2012 new asset information as the year gets closer. In the new investment line, you will only see the full earnings impact from the new wind and solar assets we expect to build in 2011. Our contracted wind segment is expected to be down roughly $20 million compared to 2011, which is roughly the difference between the expiration of PTCs and expected PPA price and a new contract for the currently uncontracted asset as well as PPA price increases embedded in our current PPAs.
Our contracted other segment is expected to be roughly flat due to the full year effect of the upgrade we expect to complete at our Point Beach nuclear facility in Wisconsin in 2011, net of the expiration of some power sales contracts on two of our gas product facilities in the north east. Our hedged wind and merchant northeast other categories are expected to be down approximately $45 million each due to the rolloff of higher-priced hedges. Our Gas Infrastructure business reflects our shaled gas drilling program and the majority of this margin is currently hedged. The targets for the customer supply business in power and gas trading reflect the modest increase over reduced 2011 expectations.
I would like to provide a brief update on our wind development plans for the remainder of 2010 and 2011. For 2010, we currently have approximately 680 megawatts of new wind already in service or under construction and likely to be commissioned although some megawatts may roll over to the first part of 2011. We are mindful that this is likely the toughest wind development market in some time. For 2011, we remain cautiously optimistic that we will add between 700 to 1000 megawatts of wind generation. Although we have had some success this year in signing long-term PPA, we continue to see some sluggishness as it relates to securing long-term PPAs. At the same time, we are seeing reductions in the cost of build of new wind projects so the average economic returns we are expecting are still attractive.
We would like to provide a little more clarity on 2010 and 2011 adjusted EPS guidance. Based on our assumption that the settlement agreement will be approved for 2010, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be within the lower half of our previous disclosed range of $4.25 to $4.65. In the quarter, FPL lowered its surplus depreciation and amortization, which has the effect of increasing net depreciation expense by approximately $0.12 of adjusted EPS. This reduction is consistent with the settlement agreement. Looking at the longer-term picture though, the current reduction in earnings as a result of higher depreciation expense in 2010 provide us a bit more certainty regarding our 2012 earnings and returns at FPL. If the settlement agreement is ultimately rejected, which we believe to be a low probability based on the support it is receiving from intervenors, 2010 results would be at the high end of the original range due in large part to additional surplus depreciation and amortization, which FPL would likely record.
Turning now to 2011. We last indicated that our 2011 adjusted earnings would be roughly in line with the 2010 range. Since then we've had a number of positive and negative developments that affect our adjusted earnings per share expectations. On the positive side, the rate case settlement agreement would allow for substantial recovery of West County unit 3 in 2011 on a cash basis. However, at energy resources, the factors that I've just discussed related to 2011 gross margin have negatively impacted the earnings outlook.
First, as we noted in the updated 2011 gross margin estimates, we are now expecting fewer CITC elections than we previously expected. This revision is a result of our view that the wind development market will continue to be challenging next year. Second, based simply on the fact that we have some on contracted wind assets in a declining commodity price environment, we need to reduce gross margin expectations. In addition, the timing of expected PPA has been slightly extended. And third, we think there should be reduced expectations related to our proprietary trading business in 2011 as we have shown you before, these businesses going to the year largely unhedged unlike our existing assets. And it makes sense for us to reduce expectations in this area based on what we perceive as the near-term opportunities in the market.
Incorporating all of these factors, we now believe that we can narrow the range of our 2011 adjusted earnings per share estimate to between $4.25 and $4.55. We continue to feel comfortable with the 5% to 7% average annual increase in adjusted EPS through 2014 from a 2009 base although we do not expect that average to necessarily be the actual increase in each year-to-year period. We also continue to be a open asset acquisitions that fit our portfolio and investment profile and there are quite a number of those opportunities at this time. While we look at most opportunities, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to capital deployment. Over time, we strive to be in a strong financial position which enables us to take advantage of those opportunities that meet our criteria. As always, these potential opportunities are not reflected in the specific development targets we have provided to you.
To summarize the 2010 third quarter on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.74 per share, Energy resources contributed $0.64 per share and Corporate and Other contributed $0.07 per share primarily as result of an adjustment related to previously deferred taxes. That is a total of $1.45 compared to $1.38 per share in the 2009 third quarter or about a 5% increase year-over-year. Thank you for listening. And with that, I'll turn the call over to questions."

But we try to do it in those areas where we think there's a high likelihood either before construction begins during construction or short time afterward that we will get a Power Purchase Agreement. That is not changed. I've talked about that a little bit before. Many of our projects do not have a long-term Power Purchase Agreement when we begin. In the past, many of them did have a Power Purchase Agreement while we expected to get a Power Purchase Agreement by the time construction ended. But here in the last 12 to 18 months, the process has been a little slower. So it doesn't mean we're not going to deploy capital if we don't have a long-term Power Purchase Agreement in hand. But it doesn't mean we're going to be a little bit more cautious than we have in the past because it has taken a little longer in some cases to get an agreement than we originally believed."

You're trying to link that previous guidance in, i.e. at 10% and also 2011 earnings. Let me kind of explained it this way and maybe it will be helpful to you and others on the call. The amount of gross margin reduction for what I'll call the lower build in 2011 for both wind and solar is roughly $0.10 and you can the take the gross margin number, you can tax affect it, it's roughly $0.10 and again that'd be a reduction. The reduction in the lower commodity prices from either or on contract wind assets and it's slightly extending the term of the merchant time that those projects will be in a merchant state is roughly $0.07. The reduction in trading power and gas trading proprietary power and gas trading that I mentioned in 2011 is also $0.07. In this call, I also said that the amount of fuel savings attributable to West County 3 are roughly in line with but slightly less than the revenue requirements, which is roughly a revenue requirements are roughly $100 million. If you add all that together, and again, I'm going just from the revenue line, I'm not really focused on the bottom end, but if you add all that together, you'll roughly to get a net $0.10 deduction from whatever midpoint you started with.

In addition to the favorable weather that we've had at Fort PowerLite company which is roughly $0.17, $0.18, $0.19 on a year-to-date basis.

In this particular circumstance, we had hedged the wells or we had hedged the expected production from the wells. And as we looked at the economics and then declining natural gas environment, we believe that it made more sense for us to take the capital that we had allocated to those wells and put it to use in other places and so that meant that we were able to flatten out the hedges and when we flattened out the hedges, at least internally, we take all of our documentation pretty seriously. These are non-qualifying hedges, which may not mean a whole heck of a lot to you, but sort of like internal hedge accounting and our documentation once we flattened out the hedges for these particular hedges required us to take the gain in this case. It would have required us to take the loss, so there was a loss, but it was a gain and we made the right economic decision and we moved on. This was a small -- it was $0.04 or so for the quarter but it was just the smallest subset of wells that we were dealing with. It's a business that we've continued to be very happy to be in and with the hedges that we have in place, we feel pretty good about the remaining investment that's not to say that in the future we may not change our mind on some of those.

Thank you, Rebecca, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy continued to deliver solid results in the third quarter of 2010, increasing adjusted earnings per share by more than 5% over the prior year quarter from $1.38 to $1.45.
The most significant development during the quarter was the settlement agreement we reached with the principal parties involved in our rate case. We believe this agreement is in the best interest of all the parties involved, especially the approximately 8.7 million Floridians we serve. The FPL's typical residential customer bill is already the lowest of all 55 utilities in the state of Florida, and under the terms of this agreement which is awaiting approval by the Florida Public Service Commission, retail base rates would remain frozen through 2012. 
Armando Pimentel will discuss the elements of the agreement in greater detail. For my part, I want to thank those who represent Florida‚Äôs electric consumers for working with us the craft and agreement that should provide financial stability for customers and the company alike.
Our investment in Florida electrical infrastructure which this rate settlement will allow us to continue have provided significant benefits for our customers. Compared to the national average, our bills are 24% lower, our operating maintenance costs are 34% lower, our reliability is 46% higher and our fleet is cleaner, producing electricity with 35% fewer carbon dioxide emissions, 55% fewer sulfur dioxide emissions and 75% fewer nitrogen oxide emissions.
In other development with FPL, we continue to make progress on our third combined cycle unit at the West County Energy Center, which is expected to come online around the middle of 2011. When complete, the West County Energy Center will be one of the largest and cleanest fossil fuel facilities in the United States. In addition, we have begun construction activities at our Cape Canaveral plant, the modernized Canaveral and review of our beach facilities, which are scheduled to come online in 2013 and 2014, respectively, are designed to have a heat rate below 6,500 compared to a current industry average of more than 10,000. They're expected to be among the most efficient natural gas plants in the nation with significant customer benefits in terms of fuel and other savings. 
Environmentally, the new units are expected to be far cleaner than the units they replace, reducing the rate of sulfur dioxide emissions by 98%, the rate of nitrogen oxide emissions by 93% and the rate of particular emissions by 89%.
At energy resources, we have added approximately 1,260 megawatts of new wind capacities since the end of the second quarter of 2009 and expect that at year end 2010, we'll continue to be the nation's leader in wind energy generation. Looking ahead, while we clearly see some uncertainty in the renewables Development business, we continue to see profitable growth opportunities in both the Wind and Solar businesses. To that end, we are cautiously optimistic that in 2011, we will add approximately 700 to 1,000 megawatts of wind assets to the portfolio. 
Now also encouraging is the renewed interest we're seeing in differential membership transaction otherwise known as tax equity deals which had all but vanished during the recession. During the quarter we entered into an innovative transaction that will allow us to reduce the amount of production tax credits that we may have otherwise deferred on our balance sheet in the future.
On the solar front, our 250-megawatt Genesis solar project has now received the majority of the necessary permits and approvals, including all required approvals from the state of California. Genesis will be located in one of the best solar resource regions in the United States, and we will deploy the same proven solar trough technology at use in our St. Martin facilities. 
On the national policy front, I wish I could say that everyone in Washington shared our commitment to expanding the renewable energy industry. But as we have seen the summer and fall, the clean energy policy has been caught up by gridlock in Washington. As long as there's uncertainty hangs over the electric power industry, capital that would otherwise be usefully deployed will continue to sit on the sidelines. This will not only jeopardize nation's lead renewable energy technologies that we help plan here such as wind power, but it will cost the economy thousands of jobs at a time when we need them the most. Of course, even with the absence of new legislation, it appears that the Environmental Protection Agency will be putting  de facto price on carbons for the enforcement of regulations governing sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury and coal ash. As time when analysts and others are predicting that the industry will retire tens of thousands of megawatt of coal-fired generation, NextEra Energy remains in the enviable position of producing only 4% of its power from coal.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Armando Pimentel."

I would like to share a couple of additional accomplishments before we get into the financial details of the quarter. During the quarter, we continue to execute well against our financing plan, issuing a mixture of debt and equity securities from both international and domestic sources of capital. As Lew mentioned, during the quarter, we completed another differential membership transaction relating to 309 megawatts of wind energy projects in North Dakota and Iowa. This transaction represents a unique structure for energy resources in which the differential part membership investor makes an initial upfront payment that will make additional payments overtime tied to the energy production of the wind projects. This structure allows us to raise tax equity for existing projects that have been previously financed with project debt.
We continue to seek opportunities to minimize the growth of deferred production tax credits or PTCs on our balance sheet and the availability of this structure would allow us to receive compensation for future PTCs before we have otherwise been able to monetize them. We would consider using the structure again in the future. In September, we sold 20 year FPL Group capital senior notes with the principal amount of JPY  10 billion. At the same time, FPL Group capital entered into swaps that hedged against currency movements and fixed the interest-rate associated with the Notes. Net proceeds were USD $120 million. As we highlighted at the Investor Conference, we believe we're very well diversified in terms of primary markets and regions when it comes to raising debt. We will continue to see credit globally and execute those transactions that we consider to be most favorable. 
Also in September, we sold $402.5 million of equity units, which consist of a contract to purchase NextEra energy common stock in the future and an interest in five-year FPL Group capital debenture. We were pleased with the terms and note that this issuance is consistent with the equity plan we discussed with investors in May. And lastly, in October, we entered into approximately $750 million of forward-starting interest rates swaps designed to lock in rates for future debt issuances, which are expected to refinance scheduled maturities of FPL Group capital debentures in 2011 and 2013. Long-term interest rates are at historically low levels and we plan for these instruments to allow us to hedge a portion of our future debt re-financings.
Earlier this month, the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted our certificate of convenience and necessity or CCN for a 36-month portion of the CREZ transmission project awarded to our subsidiary Lone Star transmission. The CCN gives us assurance that we will get recovery on this portion of our investment and it clears the way for us to begin construction on this portion of the line. We requested that this section be evaluated separately in the expectation that it would allow us to expedite the process for this portion of the line. We are optimistic that we will get the CCN for the balance of the 300-mile project by the end of this year.
In the third quarter of 2010, NextEra energies GAAP net income was $720 million or $1.74 per share. NextEra Energy adjusted 2010 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $602 million and $1.45 per share. The difference between the GAAP results and the adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our non-qualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investment or OTTI.
For the third quarter, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $308 million or $0.74 per share. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I would like to spend a couple of minutes on the rate case settlement agreement. As Lew mentioned, but it bears repeating, we strongly believe this agreement is positive for our customers and our investors alike. Under the terms of the agreement, retail-base rates would remain frozen as specified in the agreement through the end of 2012 and the authorized regulatory ROE or return on equity would remain at 10% plus or minus 100 basis points. FDL would be permitted to recover the base revenue requirements associated with West County Energy Center unit 3 through to capacity cost up to the amount of the projected fuel savings attributable to the unit. This mechanism allows for current cash recovery without an expected increase in the customers‚Äô total bill. 
We currently estimate that the 2011 fuel savings will be roughly in line with but slightly less than the revenue requirements for the plant based on current commodity prices and generation mix. The settlement would allow FPL the flexibility to vary the annual amortization of theoretical depreciation reserve surplus or depreciation credit to keep FPL's earned regulatory ROE within the approved range of 9% to 11% subject to certain annual and total caps.
The $267 million annual cap on the depreciation credit applies to each year of the agreement, but any unused amount in a given year to be carried forward and would be available for use in subsequent years. No more than $776 million of the depreciation credit could be taken during the term of the agreement. The agreement has a support of the Attorney General's office, the office of public counsel and the other principal parties in our rate case, as well as the recommended approval of the PFC staff. Given all of this, we believe approval is the most probable outcome and this forms the basis for our accounting for the quarter. As such, on a year-to-date basis, and as a result of favorable weather, we have not recorded any depreciation credit in order to be in compliance with the regulatory ROE provisions of the settlement agreement.
The table shown here summarizes the earnings drivers for Florida Power & Light for the just-completed quarter. In total, earnings decreased by $0.01 per share. The increase in base revenues related to West County Energy Center units 1 and 2, weather and the impact of our base rate increase were roughly offset by the increase in depreciation expense. Not only as a result of the addition of the West County units, but also due to the reduction of surplus depreciation amortization, which increases net depreciation expense consistent with the pending settlement agreement.
We are continuing to see some improvement as it relates to our customer metrics. The table in the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt-hour sales versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt-hour sales grew by 3%, an improvement due primarily to higher weather-related usage but also from modest growth in customers. Non-weather-related or underlying usage growth mix and all other was essentially flat. As depicted in the graph in the upper right-hand corner, during the third quarter of 2010, we had approximately 27,000 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2009. We continue to be cautiously optimistic that our customer growth is returning and we are encouraged that we continue to see modest increases in customer accounts.
The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low usage customers, which we believe depicts the level of empty homes in our service territory. Although inactive accounts are down relative to last year, they remained relatively flat as compared to the second quarter. Low usage accounts continue to decline during the third quarter. The chart on the bottom right depicts the level of new housing starts for single-family homes and FPL service territory. Housing starts are fairly good leading indicator of certain additions to our customer base roughly a year out. After experiencing rapid declines during the recession, the volume of housing starts appears to have stabilized. However, the current volume of permits remains low or about 12% of what it was at the height of the housing room that preceded the recession. 
We continue to see some improvements in many of our customer metrics, and for the longer-term, believe Florida will continue to be a very attractive destination to which people will move. In fact, just this month, Florida was selected as the second most popular state for which baby boomers would like to move according to our Harris Poll survey. However, in the short term, we remain cautious about the strength of the economy.
Let me now turn to energy resources. Since the end of the second quarter 2009, we have added approximately 1260 megawatts of new wind generation and continue to be the nation‚Äôs leading producer of wind of power. In addition, we have continued to make progress on our solar development pipeline. During the quarter, Genesis solar thermal project received approvals from the California Public Utilities Commission and the California Energy Commission. Genesis has also been selected by the Bureau of Land Management as a fast-track project, and we are hopeful that the project will receive BLM approval in the next couple of weeks. These approvals are major milestones in the development of this roughly $1 billion project, which we expect to be brought online in 2013 and 2014. This project has been many years in the making and we are very encouraged to see state and federal agencies working together to bring the benefits of these clean energy project for the citizens of California.
Energy resources reported third quarter 2010 GAAP earnings of $386 million or $0.93 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges and net OTTI were $267 million or $0.64 per share. As we mentioned in the first quarter, we have changed the methodology for allocating interest and shared costs to affiliates and this historical figures have been changed to reflect the change.
Energy resources third quarter adjusted EPS was up $0.05 relative to last year's comparable quarter. New wind investments contributed $0.05 per share, of this roughly $0.03 reflects our ability to recognize a state investment tax credit on some of our wind projects. As always, we will continue to seek opportunities for enhanced economics in states with incremental incentives. We continue to estimate that we will elect to take convertible investment tax credit or as we call them CITCs on approximately 600 megawatts of new wind generation to be placed in service in 2010. 
In aggregate, the existing portfolio contributed $0.05 relative to the prior year. Our existing wind assets contributed $0.04 driven primarily by a better wind resource. Performance from our existing merchant assets was down by $0.01 while contracted assets realized a $0.02 increase due to the commencement of long-term contracts on our markets hook 750 in blythe facilities.
During the third quarter, evaluation of our shale gas well drilling program. We determined that we would not move forward on a subset of future drilling opportunities whose output we had previously hedged. As we have previously communicated, upon approval of a well drilling program, we hedge the anticipated production from those wells in order to lock in a substantial amount of the wells economics. Our decision to not proceed on these specific wells resulted in a $0.04 after tax gain when we exited the hedged position. Consistent with what we discussed in our investor conference earlier this year, we continue to be interested in natural gas infrastructure opportunities.
The Customer Supply and Proprietary Power and Gas Trading businesses were down by $0.04 relative to the prior year, primarily due to lower contributions from power and gas trading. As we have said before, opportunities in this part of the business fluctuate based on a number of factors. And while last year's quarter was up $0.07 compared to 2008, this year's third quarter did not have as many opportunities for us to pursue. To be consistent with the information we provide to you on a gross margin hedged slide, GEXA is included in customer supply businesses for presentation of comparable earnings. The customer supply businesses continue to do very well on a year-to-date basis.
All other factors were negative 5%, $0.05 primarily due to higher interest expense. Although our expected gross margin is very well hedged, the current commodity price backdrop has an impact on our business. It's manifest itself in two ways. First in a portion of our existing assets that is un-contracted and un-hedged, which is roughly 8% of our existing asset gross margin in 2011 and 17% in 2012. Secondly, as we have discussed before, it is one of several items that affects counterparty's interest in signing long-term contracts for renewable generation. Since the forecasts we presented at the investor conference in May of this year, the 10-year natural gas strip has declined 16% while a 2011 calendar strip has declined by 21%. In the near term, our open gross margin is relatively modest and as such, there's not much of a significant direct effect on our gross margin as it relates to our existing assets. But there is some impact. Additionally, indirectly, the lower power and gas prices affect our expectations around the currently on un-contracted wind assets that we expect to contract under long-term power purchase agreements.
Let me discuss that in a little more detail as we turn to our hedging status for 2011 and 2012 and expect that equivalent gross margins. Over the last couple of years, we have increased the percentage of our business that is hedged in the near term mainly as a result of what we believe would be more uncertain commodity price environment. In addition, we continue to take steps to minimize the risks and improve the visibility of the earnings and cash flow profile for the portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, contracts that were effective this year on approximately 1190 megawatts representing both light and market sub- 750 helped earnings for the quarter. Additionally, since the beginning of 2008, we have signed approximately 2110 megawatts of wind PPAs and approximately 350 megawatts of solar PPAs. For 2011, we are 92% hedged on expected equivalent gross margin on our existing assets. 
Across all of the energy resources businesses, the midpoint of our total expected equivalent gross margin has decreased by approximately 155 million since the second quarter. I do not focus too much on this midpoint, but I know that many of you do, so I have chosen a tier as a frame of reference. The three main drivers of this decrease are in new asset additions and our existing wind assets and in our power and gas trading business. As we do every year at this time, we have moved the new assets expected to be in service by the end of 2010, up to the appropriate categories of existing assets and so what you see now in the new investment line are the expected results of the asset we expect to place in service in 2011.
For these 2011 asset additions, our gross margin estimate is down approximately $65 million since the second quarter due primarily to lower estimated CITC elections associated with reduced new-build wind assumptions and solar assumptions. Net of the positive impact of the 2010 asset additions that moved into existing assets, the contracted wind assets gross margin is down approximately $35 million primarily due to the sustained lower power and natural gas prices on un-contracted assets that I spoke about just a minute ago. Finally, the power and gas trading business is down roughly $55 million due to our expectation in the near term that the volatility and low price environment will mean that there are less opportunities for this business.
Turning to the 2012 gross margin, we're 83% hedged and expected equivalent gross margin on our existing assets. Although there are many puts and takes when comparing 2011 to 2012, I wanted to highlight a few of the more significant items. Please note that we did not include the impact of any new wind or solar generation than we expect to build in 2012. Although the operating earnings impact for the new investments put in place in 2012 could be modest as a result of the expected commissioning dates, we do expect to qualify for CITC on a good portion of our 2012 wind and solar development, but that margin is not included in this slide.
As we did last year, we will add 2012 new asset information as the year gets closer. In the new investment line, you will only see the full earnings impact from the new wind and solar assets we expect to build in 2011. Our contracted wind segment is expected to be down roughly $20 million compared to 2011, which is roughly the difference between the expiration of PTCs and expected PPA price and a new contract for the currently un-contracted asset as well as PPA price increases embedded in our current PPAs.
Our contracted other segment is expected to be roughly flat due to the full year effect of the upgrade we expect to complete at our Point Beach nuclear facility in Wisconsin in 2011, net of the expiration of some power sales contracts on two of our gas fire facilities in the north east. Our hedged wind and merchant northeast other categories are expected to be down approximately $45 million each due to the rolloff of higher-priced hedges. Our Gas Infrastructure business reflects our shale gas drilling program and the majority of this margin is currently hedged. The targets for the customer supply business in power and gas trading reflect the modest increase over reduced 2011 expectations.
I would like to provide a brief update on our wind development plans for the remainder of 2010 and 2011. For 2010, we currently have approximately 680 megawatts of new wind already in service or under construction and likely to be commissioned although some megawatts may roll over to the first part of 2011. We are mindful that this is likely the toughest wind development market in some time. For 2011, we remain cautiously optimistic that we will add between 700 to 1000 megawatts of wind generation. Although we have had some success this year in signing long-term PPAs, we continue to see some sluggishness as it relates to securing long-term PPAs. At the same time, we are seeing reductions in the cost of build of new wind projects so the average economic returns we are expecting are still attractive.
We would like to provide a little more clarity on 2010 and 2011 adjusted EPS guidance. Based on our assumption that the settlement agreement will be approved for 2010, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be within the lower half of our previous disclosed range of $4.25 to $4.65. In the quarter, FPL lowered its surplus depreciation amortization, which has the effect of increasing net depreciation expense by approximately $0.12 of adjusted EPS. This reduction is consistent with the settlement agreement. Looking at the longer-term picture though, the current reduction in earnings as a result of higher depreciation expense in 2010 provides us a bit more certainty regarding our 2012 earnings and returns at FPL. If the settlement agreement is ultimately rejected, which we believe to be a low probability based on the support it is receiving from interveners, 2010 results would be at the high end of the original range due in large part to additional surplus depreciation and amortization, which FPL would likely record.
Turning now to 2011. We last indicated that our 2011 adjusted earnings would be roughly in line with the 2010 range. Since then we've had a number of positive and negative developments that affect our adjusted earnings per share expectations. On the positive side, the rate case settlement agreement would allow for substantial recovery of West County unit 3 in 2011 on a cash basis. However, at energy resources, the factors that I've just discussed related to 2011 gross margin have negatively affected the earnings outlook.
First, as we noted in the updated 2011 gross margin estimates, we are now expecting fewer CITC elections than we previously expected. This revision is a result of our view that the wind development market will continue to be challenging next year. Second, based simply on the fact that we have some un-contracted wind assets in a declining commodity price environment, we need to reduce gross margin expectations. In addition, the timing of expected PPAs has been slightly extended. And third, we think there should be reduced expectations related to our proprietary trading business in 2011 as we have shown you before, these businesses go into the year largely un-hedged unlike our existing assets. And it makes sense for us to reduce expectations in this area based on what we perceive as the near-term opportunities in the market.
Incorporating all of these factors, we now believe that we can narrow the range of our 2011 adjusted earnings per share estimate to between $4.25 and $4.55. We continue to feel comfortable with the 5% to 7% average annual increase in adjusted EPS through 2014 from a 2009 base although we do not expect that average to necessarily be the actual increase in each year-to-year period. We also continue to be open to asset acquisitions that fit our portfolio and investment profile and there are quite a number of those opportunities at this time. While we look at most opportunities, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to capital deployment. Over time, we strive to be in a strong financial position which enables us to take advantage of those opportunities that meet our criteria. As always, these potential opportunities are not reflected in the specific development targets we have provided to you.
To summarize the 2010 third quarter on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.74 per share, Energy resources contributed $0.64 per share and Corporate and Other contributed $0.07 per share primarily as result of an adjustment related to previously deferred taxes. That is a total of $1.45 compared to $1.38 per share in the 2009 third quarter or about a 5% increase year-over-year. Thank you for listening. And with that, I'll turn the call over to questions."

But we try to do it in those areas where we think there's a high likelihood either before construction begins during construction or short time afterward that we will get a Power Purchase Agreement. That is not changed. I've talked about that a little bit before. Many of our projects do not have a long-term Power Purchase Agreement when we begin. In the past, many of them did have a Power Purchase Agreement where we expected to get a Power Purchase Agreement by the time construction ended. But here in the last 12 to 18 months, the process has been a little slower. So it doesn't mean we're not going to deploy capital if we don't have a long-term Power Purchase Agreement in hand. But it does mean we're going to be a little bit more cautious than we have in the past because it has taken a little longer in some cases to get an agreement than we originally believed."

I think a presumption by investors and analyst, the midpoint of 10% was in our previous guidance I think is appropriate. You're trying to link that previous guidance in, i.e. at 10% and also 2011 earnings. Let me kind of explain it this way and maybe it will be helpful to you and others on the call. The amount of gross margin reduction for what I'll call the lower build in 2011 for both wind and solar is roughly $0.10 and you can take the gross margin number, you can tax affect it, it's roughly $0.10 and again that'd be a reduction. The reduction in the lower commodity prices from due to our un-contract wind assets and it's slightly extending the term of the merchant time that those projects will be in a merchant state is roughly $0.07. The reduction in trading, power and gas trading proprietary power and gas trading that I mentioned in 2011 is also $0.07. In this call, I also said that the amount of fuel savings attributable to West County 3 are roughly in line with but slightly less than the revenue requirements, which is roughly--a revenue requirements are roughly $100 million. If you add all that together, and again, I'm going just from the revenue line, I'm not really focused on the bottom end, but if you add all that together, you'll roughly to get a net $0.10 deduction from whatever midpoint you started with. If you add all that together, what we've actually done is we brought the midpoint down of our 2011 guidance down $0.05 from $4.45 to $4.40. That's the way I look at it."

In addition to the favorable weather that we've had at Florida Power& Light company which is roughly $0.17, $0.18, $0.19 on a year-to-date basis.

In this particular circumstance, we had hedged the wells or we had hedged the expected production from the wells. And as we looked at the economics in a declining natural gas environment, we believe that it made more sense for us to take the capital that we had allocated to those wells and put it to use in other places and so that meant that we were able to flatten out the hedges and when we flattened out the hedges, at least internally, we take all of our documentation pretty seriously. These are non-qualifying hedges, which may not mean a whole heck of a lot to you, but sort of like internal hedge accounting and our documentation once we flattened out the hedges for these particular hedges required us to take the gain in this case. It would have required us to take the loss, so there was a loss, but it was a gain and we made the right economic decision and we moved on. This was a small -- it was $0.04 or so for the quarter but it was a small subset of wells that we were dealing with. It's a business that we've continue to be very happy to be in and with the hedges that we have in place, we feel pretty good about the remaining investment that's not to say that in the future we may not change our mind on some of those.

Thank you, Rebecca, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy continued to deliver solid results in the third quarter of 2010, increasing adjusted earnings per share by more than 5% over the prior year quarter from $1.38 to $1.45.
The most significant development during the quarter was the settlement agreement we reached with the principal parties involved in our rate case. We believe this agreement is in the best interest of all the parties involved, especially the approximately 8.7 million Floridians we serve. The FPL's typical residential customer bill is already the lowest of all 55 utilities in the state of Florida, and under the terms of this agreement which is awaiting approval by the Florida Public Service Commission, retail base rates would remain frozen through 2012. 
Armando Pimentel will discuss the elements of the agreement in greater detail. For my part, I want to thank those who represent Florida‚Äôs electric consumers for working with us the craft and agreement that should provide financial stability for customers and the company alike.
Our investment in Florida electrical infrastructure which this rate settlement will allow us to continue have provided significant benefits for our customers. Compared to the national average, our bills are 24% lower, our operating maintenance costs are 34% lower, our reliability is 46% higher and our fleet is cleaner, producing electricity with 35% fewer carbon dioxide emissions, 55% fewer sulfur dioxide emissions and 75% fewer nitrogen oxide emissions.
In other development with FPL, we continue to make progress on our third combined cycle unit at the West County Energy Center, which is expected to come online around the middle of 2011. When complete, the West County Energy Center will be one of the largest and cleanest fossil fuel facilities in the United States. In addition, we have begun construction activities at our Cape Canaveral plant, the modernized Canaveral and review of our beach facilities, which are scheduled to come online in 2013 and 2014, respectively, are designed to have a heat rate below 6,500 compared to a current industry average of more than 10,000. They're expected to be among the most efficient natural gas plants in the nation with significant customer benefits in terms of fuel and other savings. 
Environmentally, the new units are expected to be far cleaner than the units they replace, reducing the rate of sulfur dioxide emissions by 98%, the rate of nitrogen oxide emissions by 93% and the rate of particular emissions by 89%.
At energy resources, we have added approximately 1,260 megawatts of new wind capacities since the end of the second quarter of 2009 and expect that at year end 2010, we'll continue to be the nation's leader in wind energy generation. Looking ahead, while we clearly see some uncertainty in the renewables Development business, we continue to see profitable growth opportunities in both the Wind and Solar businesses. To that end, we are cautiously optimistic that in 2011, we will add approximately 700 to 1,000 megawatts of wind assets to the portfolio. 
Now also encouraging is the renewed interest we're seeing in differential membership transaction otherwise known as tax equity deals which had all but vanished during the recession. During the quarter we entered into an innovative transaction that will allow us to reduce the amount of production tax credits that we may have otherwise deferred on our balance sheet in the future.
On the solar front, our 250-megawatt Genesis solar project has now received the majority of the necessary permits and approvals, including all required approvals from the state of California. Genesis will be located in one of the best solar resource regions in the United States, and we will deploy the same proven solar trough technology at use in our St. Martin facilities. 
On the national policy front, I wish I could say that everyone in Washington shared our commitment to expanding the renewable energy industry. But as we have seen the summer and fall, the clean energy policy has been caught up by gridlock in Washington. As long as there's uncertainty hangs over the electric power industry, capital that would otherwise be usefully deployed will continue to sit on the sidelines. This will not only jeopardize nation's lead renewable energy technologies that we help plan here such as wind power, but it will cost the economy thousands of jobs at a time when we need them the most. Of course, even with the absence of new legislation, it appears that the Environmental Protection Agency will be putting  de facto price on carbons for the enforcement of regulations governing sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury and coal ash. As time when analysts and others are predicting that the industry will retire tens of thousands of megawatt of coal-fired generation, NextEra Energy remains in the enviable position of producing only 4% of its power from coal.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Armando Pimentel."

I would like to share a couple of additional accomplishments before we get into the financial details of the quarter. During the quarter, we continue to execute well against our financing plan, issuing a mixture of debt and equity securities from both international and domestic sources of capital. As Lew mentioned, during the quarter, we completed another differential membership transaction relating to 309 megawatts of wind energy projects in North Dakota and Iowa. This transaction represents a unique structure for energy resources in which the differential part membership investor makes an initial upfront payment that will make additional payments overtime tied to the energy production of the wind projects. This structure allows us to raise tax equity for existing projects that have been previously financed with project debt.
We continue to seek opportunities to minimize the growth of deferred production tax credits or PTCs on our balance sheet and the availability of this structure would allow us to receive compensation for future PTCs before we have otherwise been able to monetize them. We would consider using the structure again in the future. In September, we sold 20 year FPL Group capital senior notes with the principal amount of JPY  10 billion. At the same time, FPL Group capital entered into swaps that hedged against currency movements and fixed the interest-rate associated with the Notes. Net proceeds were USD $120 million. As we highlighted at the Investor Conference, we believe we're very well diversified in terms of primary markets and regions when it comes to raising debt. We will continue to see credit globally and execute those transactions that we consider to be most favorable. 
Also in September, we sold $402.5 million of equity units, which consist of a contract to purchase NextEra energy common stock in the future and an interest in five-year FPL Group capital debenture. We were pleased with the terms and note that this issuance is consistent with the equity plan we discussed with investors in May. And lastly, in October, we entered into approximately $750 million of forward-starting interest rates swaps designed to lock in rates for future debt issuances, which are expected to refinance scheduled maturities of FPL Group capital debentures in 2011 and 2013. Long-term interest rates are at historically low levels and we plan for these instruments to allow us to hedge a portion of our future debt re-financings.
Earlier this month, the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted our certificate of convenience and necessity or CCN for a 36-month portion of the CREZ transmission project awarded to our subsidiary Lone Star transmission. The CCN gives us assurance that we will get recovery on this portion of our investment and it clears the way for us to begin construction on this portion of the line. We requested that this section be evaluated separately in the expectation that it would allow us to expedite the process for this portion of the line. We are optimistic that we will get the CCN for the balance of the 300-mile project by the end of this year.
In the third quarter of 2010, NextEra energies GAAP net income was $720 million or $1.74 per share. NextEra Energy adjusted 2010 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $602 million and $1.45 per share. The difference between the GAAP results and the adjusted results is the exclusion of the mark in our non-qualifying hedge category and the exclusion of net other than temporary impairments on certain investment or OTTI.
For the third quarter, Florida Power & Light reported net income of $308 million or $0.74 per share. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I would like to spend a couple of minutes on the rate case settlement agreement. As Lew mentioned, but it bears repeating, we strongly believe this agreement is positive for our customers and our investors alike. Under the terms of the agreement, retail-base rates would remain frozen as specified in the agreement through the end of 2012 and the authorized regulatory ROE or return on equity would remain at 10% plus or minus 100 basis points. FDL would be permitted to recover the base revenue requirements associated with West County Energy Center unit 3 through to capacity cost up to the amount of the projected fuel savings attributable to the unit. This mechanism allows for current cash recovery without an expected increase in the customers‚Äô total bill. 
We currently estimate that the 2011 fuel savings will be roughly in line with but slightly less than the revenue requirements for the plant based on current commodity prices and generation mix. The settlement would allow FPL the flexibility to vary the annual amortization of theoretical depreciation reserve surplus or depreciation credit to keep FPL's earned regulatory ROE within the approved range of 9% to 11% subject to certain annual and total caps.
The $267 million annual cap on the depreciation credit applies to each year of the agreement, but any unused amount in a given year to be carried forward and would be available for use in subsequent years. No more than $776 million of the depreciation credit could be taken during the term of the agreement. The agreement has a support of the Attorney General's office, the office of public counsel and the other principal parties in our rate case, as well as the recommended approval of the PFC staff. Given all of this, we believe approval is the most probable outcome and this forms the basis for our accounting for the quarter. As such, on a year-to-date basis, and as a result of favorable weather, we have not recorded any depreciation credit in order to be in compliance with the regulatory ROE provisions of the settlement agreement.
The table shown here summarizes the earnings drivers for Florida Power & Light for the just-completed quarter. In total, earnings decreased by $0.01 per share. The increase in base revenues related to West County Energy Center units 1 and 2, weather and the impact of our base rate increase were roughly offset by the increase in depreciation expense. Not only as a result of the addition of the West County units, but also due to the reduction of surplus depreciation amortization, which increases net depreciation expense consistent with the pending settlement agreement.
We are continuing to see some improvement as it relates to our customer metrics. The table in the upper left shows the change in retail kilowatt-hour sales versus last year's comparable period. Overall, retail kilowatt-hour sales grew by 3%, an improvement due primarily to higher weather-related usage but also from modest growth in customers. Non-weather-related or underlying usage growth mix and all other was essentially flat. As depicted in the graph in the upper right-hand corner, during the third quarter of 2010, we had approximately 27,000 more customers than we did in the comparable period of 2009. We continue to be cautiously optimistic that our customer growth is returning and we are encouraged that we continue to see modest increases in customer accounts.
The graph on the bottom left of the page shows inactive and low usage customers, which we believe depicts the level of empty homes in our service territory. Although inactive accounts are down relative to last year, they remained relatively flat as compared to the second quarter. Low usage accounts continue to decline during the third quarter. The chart on the bottom right depicts the level of new housing starts for single-family homes and FPL service territory. Housing starts are fairly good leading indicator of certain additions to our customer base roughly a year out. After experiencing rapid declines during the recession, the volume of housing starts appears to have stabilized. However, the current volume of permits remains low or about 12% of what it was at the height of the housing room that preceded the recession. 
We continue to see some improvements in many of our customer metrics, and for the longer-term, believe Florida will continue to be a very attractive destination to which people will move. In fact, just this month, Florida was selected as the second most popular state for which baby boomers would like to move according to our Harris Poll survey. However, in the short term, we remain cautious about the strength of the economy.
Let me now turn to energy resources. Since the end of the second quarter 2009, we have added approximately 1260 megawatts of new wind generation and continue to be the nation‚Äôs leading producer of wind of power. In addition, we have continued to make progress on our solar development pipeline. During the quarter, Genesis solar thermal project received approvals from the California Public Utilities Commission and the California Energy Commission. Genesis has also been selected by the Bureau of Land Management as a fast-track project, and we are hopeful that the project will receive BLM approval in the next couple of weeks. These approvals are major milestones in the development of this roughly $1 billion project, which we expect to be brought online in 2013 and 2014. This project has been many years in the making and we are very encouraged to see state and federal agencies working together to bring the benefits of these clean energy project for the citizens of California.
Energy resources reported third quarter 2010 GAAP earnings of $386 million or $0.93 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter which exclude the effect of non-qualifying hedges and net OTTI were $267 million or $0.64 per share. As we mentioned in the first quarter, we have changed the methodology for allocating interest and shared costs to affiliates and this historical figures have been changed to reflect the change.
Energy resources third quarter adjusted EPS was up $0.05 relative to last year's comparable quarter. New wind investments contributed $0.05 per share, of this roughly $0.03 reflects our ability to recognize a state investment tax credit on some of our wind projects. As always, we will continue to seek opportunities for enhanced economics in states with incremental incentives. We continue to estimate that we will elect to take convertible investment tax credit or as we call them CITCs on approximately 600 megawatts of new wind generation to be placed in service in 2010. 
In aggregate, the existing portfolio contributed $0.05 relative to the prior year. Our existing wind assets contributed $0.04 driven primarily by a better wind resource. Performance from our existing merchant assets was down by $0.01 while contracted assets realized a $0.02 increase due to the commencement of long-term contracts on our markets hook 750 in blythe facilities.
During the third quarter, evaluation of our shale gas well drilling program. We determined that we would not move forward on a subset of future drilling opportunities whose output we had previously hedged. As we have previously communicated, upon approval of a well drilling program, we hedge the anticipated production from those wells in order to lock in a substantial amount of the wells economics. Our decision to not proceed on these specific wells resulted in a $0.04 after tax gain when we exited the hedged position. Consistent with what we discussed in our investor conference earlier this year, we continue to be interested in natural gas infrastructure opportunities.
The Customer Supply and Proprietary Power and Gas Trading businesses were down by $0.04 relative to the prior year, primarily due to lower contributions from power and gas trading. As we have said before, opportunities in this part of the business fluctuate based on a number of factors. And while last year's quarter was up $0.07 compared to 2008, this year's third quarter did not have as many opportunities for us to pursue. To be consistent with the information we provide to you on a gross margin hedged slide, GEXA is included in customer supply businesses for presentation of comparable earnings. The customer supply businesses continue to do very well on a year-to-date basis.
All other factors were negative 5%, $0.05 primarily due to higher interest expense. Although our expected gross margin is very well hedged, the current commodity price backdrop has an impact on our business. It's manifest itself in two ways. First in a portion of our existing assets that is un-contracted and un-hedged, which is roughly 8% of our existing asset gross margin in 2011 and 17% in 2012. Secondly, as we have discussed before, it is one of several items that affects counterparty's interest in signing long-term contracts for renewable generation. Since the forecasts we presented at the investor conference in May of this year, the 10-year natural gas strip has declined 16% while a 2011 calendar strip has declined by 21%. In the near term, our open gross margin is relatively modest and as such, there's not much of a significant direct effect on our gross margin as it relates to our existing assets. But there is some impact. Additionally, indirectly, the lower power and gas prices affect our expectations around the currently on un-contracted wind assets that we expect to contract under long-term power purchase agreements.
Let me discuss that in a little more detail as we turn to our hedging status for 2011 and 2012 and expect that equivalent gross margins. Over the last couple of years, we have increased the percentage of our business that is hedged in the near term mainly as a result of what we believe would be more uncertain commodity price environment. In addition, we continue to take steps to minimize the risks and improve the visibility of the earnings and cash flow profile for the portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, contracts that were effective this year on approximately 1190 megawatts representing both light and market sub- 750 helped earnings for the quarter. Additionally, since the beginning of 2008, we have signed approximately 2110 megawatts of wind PPAs and approximately 350 megawatts of solar PPAs. For 2011, we are 92% hedged on expected equivalent gross margin on our existing assets. 
Across all of the energy resources businesses, the midpoint of our total expected equivalent gross margin has decreased by approximately 155 million since the second quarter. I do not focus too much on this midpoint, but I know that many of you do, so I have chosen a tier as a frame of reference. The three main drivers of this decrease are in new asset additions and our existing wind assets and in our power and gas trading business. As we do every year at this time, we have moved the new assets expected to be in service by the end of 2010, up to the appropriate categories of existing assets and so what you see now in the new investment line are the expected results of the asset we expect to place in service in 2011.
For these 2011 asset additions, our gross margin estimate is down approximately $65 million since the second quarter due primarily to lower estimated CITC elections associated with reduced new-build wind assumptions and solar assumptions. Net of the positive impact of the 2010 asset additions that moved into existing assets, the contracted wind assets gross margin is down approximately $35 million primarily due to the sustained lower power and natural gas prices on un-contracted assets that I spoke about just a minute ago. Finally, the power and gas trading business is down roughly $55 million due to our expectation in the near term that the volatility and low price environment will mean that there are less opportunities for this business.
Turning to the 2012 gross margin, we're 83% hedged and expected equivalent gross margin on our existing assets. Although there are many puts and takes when comparing 2011 to 2012, I wanted to highlight a few of the more significant items. Please note that we did not include the impact of any new wind or solar generation than we expect to build in 2012. Although the operating earnings impact for the new investments put in place in 2012 could be modest as a result of the expected commissioning dates, we do expect to qualify for CITC on a good portion of our 2012 wind and solar development, but that margin is not included in this slide.
As we did last year, we will add 2012 new asset information as the year gets closer. In the new investment line, you will only see the full earnings impact from the new wind and solar assets we expect to build in 2011. Our contracted wind segment is expected to be down roughly $20 million compared to 2011, which is roughly the difference between the expiration of PTCs and expected PPA price and a new contract for the currently un-contracted asset as well as PPA price increases embedded in our current PPAs.
Our contracted other segment is expected to be roughly flat due to the full year effect of the upgrade we expect to complete at our Point Beach nuclear facility in Wisconsin in 2011, net of the expiration of some power sales contracts on two of our gas fire facilities in the north east. Our hedged wind and merchant northeast other categories are expected to be down approximately $45 million each due to the rolloff of higher-priced hedges. Our Gas Infrastructure business reflects our shale gas drilling program and the majority of this margin is currently hedged. The targets for the customer supply business in power and gas trading reflect the modest increase over reduced 2011 expectations.
I would like to provide a brief update on our wind development plans for the remainder of 2010 and 2011. For 2010, we currently have approximately 680 megawatts of new wind already in service or under construction and likely to be commissioned although some megawatts may roll over to the first part of 2011. We are mindful that this is likely the toughest wind development market in some time. For 2011, we remain cautiously optimistic that we will add between 700 to 1000 megawatts of wind generation. Although we have had some success this year in signing long-term PPAs, we continue to see some sluggishness as it relates to securing long-term PPAs. At the same time, we are seeing reductions in the cost of build of new wind projects so the average economic returns we are expecting are still attractive.
We would like to provide a little more clarity on 2010 and 2011 adjusted EPS guidance. Based on our assumption that the settlement agreement will be approved for 2010, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be within the lower half of our previous disclosed range of $4.25 to $4.65. In the quarter, FPL lowered its surplus depreciation amortization, which has the effect of increasing net depreciation expense by approximately $0.12 of adjusted EPS. This reduction is consistent with the settlement agreement. Looking at the longer-term picture though, the current reduction in earnings as a result of higher depreciation expense in 2010 provides us a bit more certainty regarding our 2012 earnings and returns at FPL. If the settlement agreement is ultimately rejected, which we believe to be a low probability based on the support it is receiving from interveners, 2010 results would be at the high end of the original range due in large part to additional surplus depreciation and amortization, which FPL would likely record.
Turning now to 2011. We last indicated that our 2011 adjusted earnings would be roughly in line with the 2010 range. Since then we've had a number of positive and negative developments that affect our adjusted earnings per share expectations. On the positive side, the rate case settlement agreement would allow for substantial recovery of West County unit 3 in 2011 on a cash basis. However, at energy resources, the factors that I've just discussed related to 2011 gross margin have negatively affected the earnings outlook.
First, as we noted in the updated 2011 gross margin estimates, we are now expecting fewer CITC elections than we previously expected. This revision is a result of our view that the wind development market will continue to be challenging next year. Second, based simply on the fact that we have some un-contracted wind assets in a declining commodity price environment, we need to reduce gross margin expectations. In addition, the timing of expected PPAs has been slightly extended. And third, we think there should be reduced expectations related to our proprietary trading business in 2011 as we have shown you before, these businesses go into the year largely un-hedged unlike our existing assets. And it makes sense for us to reduce expectations in this area based on what we perceive as the near-term opportunities in the market.
Incorporating all of these factors, we now believe that we can narrow the range of our 2011 adjusted earnings per share estimate to between $4.25 and $4.55. We continue to feel comfortable with the 5% to 7% average annual increase in adjusted EPS through 2014 from a 2009 base although we do not expect that average to necessarily be the actual increase in each year-to-year period. We also continue to be open to asset acquisitions that fit our portfolio and investment profile and there are quite a number of those opportunities at this time. While we look at most opportunities, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to capital deployment. Over time, we strive to be in a strong financial position which enables us to take advantage of those opportunities that meet our criteria. As always, these potential opportunities are not reflected in the specific development targets we have provided to you.
To summarize the 2010 third quarter on an adjusted basis, FPL contributed $0.74 per share, Energy resources contributed $0.64 per share and Corporate and Other contributed $0.07 per share primarily as result of an adjustment related to previously deferred taxes. That is a total of $1.45 compared to $1.38 per share in the 2009 third quarter or about a 5% increase year-over-year. Thank you for listening. And with that, I'll turn the call over to questions."

But we try to do it in those areas where we think there's a high likelihood either before construction begins during construction or short time afterward that we will get a Power Purchase Agreement. That is not changed. I've talked about that a little bit before. Many of our projects do not have a long-term Power Purchase Agreement when we begin. In the past, many of them did have a Power Purchase Agreement where we expected to get a Power Purchase Agreement by the time construction ended. But here in the last 12 to 18 months, the process has been a little slower. So it doesn't mean we're not going to deploy capital if we don't have a long-term Power Purchase Agreement in hand. But it does mean we're going to be a little bit more cautious than we have in the past because it has taken a little longer in some cases to get an agreement than we originally believed."

I think a presumption by investors and analyst, the midpoint of 10% was in our previous guidance I think is appropriate. You're trying to link that previous guidance in, i.e. at 10% and also 2011 earnings. Let me kind of explain it this way and maybe it will be helpful to you and others on the call. The amount of gross margin reduction for what I'll call the lower build in 2011 for both wind and solar is roughly $0.10 and you can take the gross margin number, you can tax affect it, it's roughly $0.10 and again that'd be a reduction. The reduction in the lower commodity prices from due to our un-contract wind assets and it's slightly extending the term of the merchant time that those projects will be in a merchant state is roughly $0.07. The reduction in trading, power and gas trading proprietary power and gas trading that I mentioned in 2011 is also $0.07. In this call, I also said that the amount of fuel savings attributable to West County 3 are roughly in line with but slightly less than the revenue requirements, which is roughly--a revenue requirements are roughly $100 million. If you add all that together, and again, I'm going just from the revenue line, I'm not really focused on the bottom end, but if you add all that together, you'll roughly to get a net $0.10 deduction from whatever midpoint you started with. If you add all that together, what we've actually done is we brought the midpoint down of our 2011 guidance down $0.05 from $4.45 to $4.40. That's the way I look at it."

In addition to the favorable weather that we've had at Florida Power& Light company which is roughly $0.17, $0.18, $0.19 on a year-to-date basis.

In this particular circumstance, we had hedged the wells or we had hedged the expected production from the wells. And as we looked at the economics in a declining natural gas environment, we believe that it made more sense for us to take the capital that we had allocated to those wells and put it to use in other places and so that meant that we were able to flatten out the hedges and when we flattened out the hedges, at least internally, we take all of our documentation pretty seriously. These are non-qualifying hedges, which may not mean a whole heck of a lot to you, but sort of like internal hedge accounting and our documentation once we flattened out the hedges for these particular hedges required us to take the gain in this case. It would have required us to take the loss, so there was a loss, but it was a gain and we made the right economic decision and we moved on. This was a small -- it was $0.04 or so for the quarter but it was a small subset of wells that we were dealing with. It's a business that we've continue to be very happy to be in and with the hedges that we have in place, we feel pretty good about the remaining investment that's not to say that in the future we may not change our mind on some of those. But it's a business that we've got heck of a lot of knowledge from as well as some pretty good returns on."
