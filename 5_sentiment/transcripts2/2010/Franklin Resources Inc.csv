I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. We are pleased to report another solid quarter, highlighted by record net new flows of $17.5 billion, led by a strong increase in",849,"Hello, and welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Commentary for 2010. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. We are pleased to report another solid quarter, highlighted by record net new flows of $17.5 billion, led by a strong increase in retail flows outside the U.S. and a recovery in institutional flows globally. International sales more than tripled from the year-ago quarter and were almost half of total sales this quarter. International assets increased to 28% of total assets under management as of March 31, driven by strong growth in our cross-border SICAV funds that exceeded $80 billion in assets under management at March 31. And most importantly, relative investment performance remains strong with at least 85% of assets in the top two Lipper quartiles for the three-, five- and 10-year periods. 
Turn to AUM. Assets under management ended the quarter at $587 billion, an increase of 6% from the prior quarter and more importantly, up 50% from the prior year. Simple monthly average AUM for the quarter was $551 billion or a 5% increase from the prior quarter. Assets under management via investment objectives shifted towards fixed income at 36% of ending assets under management. Equity is 45% and hybrid, 18%. 
Turning to flows. The increase in assets under management was due to market appreciation of $16.5 billion and an 18% increase in the long-term net new flows as a result of increased long-term sales, especially outside of the U.S. Seven of our 10 largest funds had inflows and 45 of our U.S. registered mutual funds had annualized pre-market organic growth of at least 10% this quarter. U.S. long-term sales and redemptions increased slightly from the prior quarter as we continue to benefit from the U.S. retail's investors' preference for fixed-income investments. 
The Templeton Global Bond fund was our best-selling U.S. fund with approximately $5 billion in net new flows. Following the free flows, the U.S. equity funds remain in redemption. Global equity flows have turned positive. However, our largest Templeton funds were still in outflows during the quarter, despite strong relative performance. Our U.S. institutional business continues to improve and March was our best month in more than two years. 
International was the big story for us this quarter with long-term sales increasing 20% from last quarter. Our cross-border SICAV funds had approximately $11 billion in net new flows, led by strong flows in Italy where we are now the second-largest foreign asset manager with assets over $10 billion. These flows tend to be a little bit more volatile over various market cycles. 
Non-U.S. investors have been less risk-aversed and we've seen positive equity flows, particularly in our regional equity strategy such as the Asian growth that had over $1 billion in net new flows. Fixed income though remains in favor and the SICAV version of the Templeton Global Bond funds had approximately $5 billion of net new flows, while our global total return and emerging market bond funds also had strong flows. 
Turning to flows by investment objective. Equity outflows improved from last quarter on increased sales and decreased redemptions. Global equity had the biggest improvement in net new flows as inflows across Europe and Asia were offset by outflows in the U.S. and Canada. Hybrid products had $1 billion of net new flows led by Franklin Income fund at $300 million in net inflows and its SICAV version at $170 million of net inflows, as well as continued high net worth inflows of $230 million. Fixed income products had another strong quarter with $17.3 billion in net new flows, an 11% increase from the prior quarter and looking at the Templeton Global Bond fund sales for the U.S. and SICAV, it represented approximately 27% of overall growth sales. Tax free also continues to be a good story for us with $1.3 billion in net new flows for the quarter and cash management had outflows of $400 million.
Turning to investment performance. The overall relative investment performance remains strong with at least 85% of assets in top two Lipper quartiles with three-, five- and 10-year prior periods. Our one-year numbers flipped a bit, but generally remain strong as short-term relative performance tends to bounce around a bit from period to period and we continue to focus on delivering strong, long-term performance because that's what our clients are looking for. 
The biggest change in performance rankings was Mutual Series where our three remaining funds slipped into the bottom two quartiles for the one-year period. Mutual Series' absolute one-year performance is a strong plus 30% to plus 50% for the funds. However, the overweight positions in cash, as we've mentioned on prior calls, has created drag on relative performance. Also, Mutual Series tends to lag momentum-type markets like we've seen over the last year. 
We also had a decrease in the one-year Templeton relative performance and most of that was through the Templeton World fund that represents about 20% of assets in the category and the Templeton World fund just slipped to the 51st percentile. I now turn it over to Ken for operating results."
28703,100485021,58234,"Franklin Resources Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Franklin Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Greg. Operating income for the quarter was at $461 million, a slight decrease from last quarter due to seasonal factors such as two less days in the quarter. Net income was $356.7 million and earnings per share was $1.55. As a reminder, last qua",740,"Thanks, Greg. Operating income for the quarter was at $461 million, a slight decrease from last quarter due to seasonal factors such as two less days in the quarter. 
Net income was $356.7 million and earnings per share was $1.55. As a reminder, last quarter, we adopted a dual share class method of calculating earnings per share that effectively reduces net income by approximately 0.5% to 0.75% of 1% or approximately $0.01 of diluted EPS this quarter. 
On Slide 17, investment management fees increased 4%, slightly less than the increase in simple monthly average assets under management, due primarily to two less days in the quarter and $3.7 million less in performance fees. The effective fee rate for the quarter was 60.3 basis points, excluding performance fees and adjusting for the number of days in the quarter, and that compares with 59.4 basis points last quarter. 
Underwriting and distribution fees increased 2%. While underwriting and distribution expenses increased 4%. Impacting the change from prior quarter was, as previously noted, a non-recurring gain of approximately $3 million included in the first quarter fees. While the impact of net underwriting and distribution fees on operating income was de minimis, several factors impact these lines, as they're primarily based on average net assets and commissionable growth sales. 
To complicate matters further, some of the asset-based revenue is computed on a daily basis NAV basis, while the expenses paid to dealers are paid on a monthly basis. So the short quarter had an impact on the margin as well. Shareholder service fees increased by $2 million and that's consistent with the increase in billable accounts. And other net revenue was $8.3 million and included a non-recurring decrease in revenue of $1.4 million. 
Slide 18 shows that operating expenses increased 5% from the prior quarter, due primarily to the usual seasonal increases, as well as increased variable expenses in strategic investments, due to improving business conditions. Compensation and benefits increased 7% due to seasonal impact of merit increases awarded in December and increased payroll taxes. Also contributing to the change was increased variable compensation, including the first full quarter impact of performance share awards. This looks like a pretty good run rate for the rest of the fiscal year. 
Advertising and promotion expenses increased 9% due to equal increases in marketing support and advertising expenses that were partially offset by lower other expenses. In the first quarter, we launched a new television commercial as part of our Reflections ad campaign that was named Ad Campaign of the Year by Fund Action. I would expect this quarterly amount to increase significantly over the latter half of the fiscal year, possibly approaching levels last seen in 2008. 
Amortization and deferred sales commissions was pretty much flat from the prior quarter, due to increases in A and C share classes that were offset by lower B share amortization. And this too looks like a pretty good run rate for next quarter, but I would expect that this line to taper off slightly beginning in the fourth quarter as the B share amortization runs off. Other expenses increased only slightly due to increased consulting and other professional fees.
Turning to Slide 19. Other income net was flat from the prior quarter at $47 million. Consolidated sponsored investment products income was $5.6 million, representing the mark-to-market increase of the securities held by those sponsored products, classified as trading on our balance sheet. Investment in Other income net was $42 million, an increase of $9.5 million from the prior quarter and that was due mostly to increased earnings from equity method, investees and realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains that were partially offset by lower gains on the sale of investments. 
Full details will be in our filings as usual. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.5%, due to the decrease in the fiscal year-to-date effective tax rate of 30.3%, which is slightly below the range we were estimating last quarter. 
The operating margin on Slide 20 was 32.6% for the quarter. And regarding capital management, we repurchased 1.1 million shares this quarter, decreasing ending shares outstanding to 227.4 million shares. The trailing 12-month payout ratio was 104%. That was elevated slightly, due to the $3 special cash dividend paid in December. In total, cash and investments were approximately $5.7 billion versus $5.4 billion at December 31, 2009. So that concludes my comments, I'll turn it back to Greg."

I mean flows have certainly looked better. And our goal, just like when things were going gangbusters on the equity side, we were pushing hard on a fixed income campaign. And for the last three to six months, we've been, while we’re doing extremely well on the fixed income side, we've been out there talking about equities. We have a 20/20 Vision campaign, which has been received extremely well, and despite headwinds, we're going to continue to talk about equities because we think that retail turn will happen and obviously, we want to be well-positioned. And I think we feel that we have a very strong line-up. And it's a matter of just again getting the attention on that line-up, and despite the record flows for the quarter, we still are making sure that the distribution is focused on getting that equity story out there. And I'm not sure when it will turn. I think we've all been frustrated that it's taken a bit longer. I think investor sentiment here in the United States for a lot of reasons continues to be a little bit shaky. We're not seeing that in other parts of the globe, we're not seeing that in Europe and Asia and I've seen a tremendous rebound in our sales, like the Asian growth fund that had $1.2 billion in net inflows for the quarter. So there are funds that are doing very well on equity side, but like most in the U.S., we still remain frustrated that the investors are not moving back."

And we've done that in the past and -- so that's something we're very aware of. But I think that the general statement regarding flows and where we had $10 billion of net inflows was into a global government bond fund. And a government bond fund, obviously, you have tremendous capacity and growing capacity. And then also currency is the other area. So the liquidity of derivatives around currency forwards and things that you have to use in funds like that, again, it’s one of the most liquid in large markets. So while we have a large share of a new class of flows, it is dwarfed by the overall size of that market. So there's really very little concern. If you have that much going in emerging markets debt that may be a different discussion on liquidity to consider having to close. I think the question around buyers is an interesting one because I think part of this growth is the recognition, certainly on the retail side, of a new asset class that is less correlated in a way to typical fixed income to equities. It had a very strong overall performance number and obviously, active management is the only way to really play that market. And trying to get currencies right, obviously, is very challenging as well. But we've had a team that has been successful in doing that. And I think looking at the average retail investor, they're more open to putting a portion of their assets in that. So I think that's part of what you're seeing in that class and it's still a very relatively small number of the typical retail investor's portfolio. So I think that's a good trend that bodes well for continued new investors in that category. And then finally on rates, I think you're a little bit less sensitive to rates and we do -- I mean, obviously, it’s fixed income. Currencies are going to be a big driver, but we also look at the duration and are very focused then because it's not as much of an income-oriented fund. We can go a little bit shorter on duration then our typical longer-term maturity fixed income fund. So that helps a little bit. But the bottom line is that it's very challenging to manage in this space. And there are going to be times when you're going to be out of favor and wrong. To us, we're trying to build that into the selling process that, that should be part of your expectation. You're never going to call every move in currencies but I think we feel like we've got one of the best teams out there."

And in some cases, you're going to have these kinds of periods where they underperform. But again, if you look at the longer-term numbers and how strong they are, I think that's really more important than the one-year number. And you look at something like the Franklin Income fund, for example, that we had short-term challenges. They’ve had sufficiently higher weightings in financial services. And during the period when financial service banks were in a lot of trouble, that fund underperformed. But quickly, it's really more uplift now in the numbers. And it's back to being a top performer for the one-year period and that kind of smoothes out over the three and five. And we've seen the quick rebound in flows there.

I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. We are pleased to report another solid quarter, highlighted by record net new flows of $17.5 billion, led by a strong increase in retail flows outside the U.S. and a recovery in institutional flows globally. International sales more than tripled from the year-ago quarter and were almost half of total sales this quarter. International assets increased to 28% of total assets under management as of March 31, driven by strong growth in our cross-border SICAV funds that exceeded $80 billion in assets under management at March 31. And most importantly, relative investment performance remains strong with at least 85% of assets in the top two Lipper quartiles for the three-, five- and 10-year periods. 
Turn to AUM. Assets under management ended the quarter at $587 billion, an increase of 6% from the prior quarter and more importantly, up 50% from the prior year. Simple monthly average AUM for the quarter was $551 billion or a 5% increase from the prior quarter. Assets under management via investment objectives shifted towards fixed income at 36% of ending assets under management. Equity is 45% and hybrid, 18%. 
Turning to flows. The increase in assets under management was due to market appreciation of $16.5 billion and an 18% increase in the long-term net new flows as a result of increased long-term sales, especially outside of the U.S. Seven of our 10 largest funds had inflows and 45 of our U.S. registered mutual funds had annualized pre-market organic growth of at least 10% this quarter. U.S. long-term sales and redemptions increased slightly from the prior quarter as we continue to benefit from the U.S. retail's investors' preference for fixed-income investments. 
The Templeton Global Bond fund was our best-selling U.S. fund with approximately $5 billion in net new flows. Following the free flows, the U.S. equity funds remain in redemption. Global equity flows have turned positive. However, our largest Templeton funds were still in outflows during the quarter, despite strong relative performance. Our U.S. institutional business continues to improve and March was our best month in more than two years. 
International was the big story for us this quarter with long-term sales increasing 20% from last quarter. Our cross-border SICAV funds had approximately $11 billion in net new flows, led by strong flows in Italy where we are now the second-largest foreign asset manager with assets over $10 billion. These flows tend to be a little bit more volatile over various market cycles. 
Non-U.S. investors have been less risk-aversed and we've seen positive equity flows, particularly in our regional equity strategy such as the Asian growth that had over $1 billion in net new flows. Fixed income though remains in favor and the SICAV version of the Templeton Global Bond funds had approximately $5 billion of net new flows, while our global total return and emerging market bond funds also had strong flows. 
Turning to flows by investment objective. Equity outflows improved from last quarter on increased sales and decreased redemptions. Global equity had the biggest improvement in net new flows as inflows across Europe and Asia were offset by outflows in the U.S. and Canada. Hybrid products had $1 billion of net new flows led by Franklin Income fund at $300 million in net inflows and its SICAV version at $170 million of net inflows, as well as continued high net worth inflows of $230 million. Fixed income products had another strong quarter with $17.3 billion in net new flows, an 11% increase from the prior quarter and looking at the Templeton Global Bond fund sales for the U.S. and SICAV, it represented approximately 27% of overall growth sales. Tax free also continues to be a good story for us with $1.3 billion in net new flows for the quarter and cash management had outflows of $400 million.
Turning to investment performance. The overall relative investment performance remains strong with at least 85% of assets in top two Lipper quartiles with three-, five- and 10-year prior periods. Our one-year numbers flipped a bit, but generally remain strong as short-term relative performance tends to bounce around a bit from period to period and we continue to focus on delivering strong, long-term performance because that's what our clients are looking for. 
The biggest change in performance rankings was Mutual Series where our three remaining funds slipped into the bottom two quartiles for the one-year period. Mutual Series' absolute one-year performance is a strong plus 30% to plus 50% for the funds. However, the overweight positions in cash, as we've mentioned on prior calls, has created drag on relative performance. Also, Mutual Series tends to lag momentum-type markets like we've seen over the last year. 
We also had a decrease in the one-year Templeton relative performance and most of that was through the Templeton World fund that represents about 20% of assets in the category and the Templeton World fund just slipped to the 51st percentile. I now turn it over to Ken for operating results."

Operating income for the quarter was at $461 million, a slight decrease from last quarter due to seasonal factors such as two less days in the quarter. Net income was $356.7 million and earnings per share was $1.55. As a reminder, last qua",740,"Thanks, Greg. Operating income for the quarter was at $461 million, a slight decrease from last quarter due to seasonal factors such as two less days in the quarter. 
Net income was $356.7 million and earnings per share was $1.55. As a reminder, last quarter, we adopted a dual share class method of calculating earnings per share that effectively reduces net income by approximately 0.5% to 0.75% of 1% or approximately $0.01 of diluted EPS this quarter. 
On Slide 17, investment management fees increased 4%, slightly less than the increase in simple monthly average assets under management, due primarily to two less days in the quarter and $3.7 million less in performance fees. The effective fee rate for the quarter was 60.3 basis points, excluding performance fees and adjusting for the number of days in the quarter, and that compares with 59.4 basis points last quarter. 
Underwriting and distribution fees increased 2%. While underwriting and distribution expenses increased 4%. Impacting the change from prior quarter was, as previously noted, a non-recurring gain of approximately $3 million included in the first quarter fees. While the impact of net underwriting and distribution fees on operating income was de minimis, several factors impact these lines, as they're primarily based on average net assets and commissionable growth sales. 
To complicate matters further, some of the asset-based revenue is computed on a daily basis NAV basis, while the expenses paid to dealers are paid on a monthly basis. So the short quarter had an impact on the margin as well. Shareholder service fees increased by $2 million and that's consistent with the increase in billable accounts. And other net revenue was $8.3 million and included a non-recurring decrease in revenue of $1.4 million. 
Slide 18 shows that operating expenses increased 5% from the prior quarter, due primarily to the usual seasonal increases, as well as increased variable expenses in strategic investments, due to improving business conditions. Compensation and benefits increased 7% due to seasonal impact of merit increases awarded in December and increased payroll taxes. Also contributing to the change was increased variable compensation, including the first full quarter impact of performance share awards. This looks like a pretty good run rate for the rest of the fiscal year. 
Advertising and promotion expenses increased 9% due to equal increases in marketing support and advertising expenses that were partially offset by lower other expenses. In the first quarter, we launched a new television commercial as part of our Reflections ad campaign that was named Ad Campaign of the Year by Fund Action. I would expect this quarterly amount to increase significantly over the latter half of the fiscal year, possibly approaching levels last seen in 2008. 
Amortization and deferred sales commissions was pretty much flat from the prior quarter, due to increases in A and C share classes that were offset by lower B share amortization. And this too looks like a pretty good run rate for next quarter, but I would expect that this line to taper off slightly beginning in the fourth quarter as the B share amortization runs off. Other expenses increased only slightly due to increased consulting and other professional fees.
Turning to Slide 19. Other income net was flat from the prior quarter at $47 million. Consolidated sponsored investment products income was $5.6 million, representing the mark-to-market increase of the securities held by those sponsored products, classified as trading on our balance sheet. Investment in Other income net was $42 million, an increase of $9.5 million from the prior quarter and that was due mostly to increased earnings from equity method, investees and realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains that were partially offset by lower gains on the sale of investments. 
Full details will be in our filings as usual. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.5%, due to the decrease in the fiscal year-to-date effective tax rate of 30.3%, which is slightly below the range we were estimating last quarter. 
The operating margin on Slide 20 was 32.6% for the quarter. And regarding capital management, we repurchased 1.1 million shares this quarter, decreasing ending shares outstanding to 227.4 million shares. The trailing 12-month payout ratio was 104%.

Because of our strong financial position, we were able to continue to invest in growth opportunities during the market downturn and those efforts are paying off in countries such as Italy, Chile and Malaysia. 
During the quarter, we were also appointed Investment Manager of the Romanian Property Fund. Assets valued at around EUR 2.4 billion or $3.3 billion U.S. However, this mandate is not expected to fund until early July so it is not in this quarter's numbers.

I mean flows have certainly looked better. And our goal, just like when things were going gangbusters on the equity side, we were pushing hard on a fixed income campaign. And for the last three to six months, we've been, while we’re doing extremely well on the fixed income side, we've been out there talking about equities. We have a 20/20 Vision campaign, which has been received extremely well, and despite headwinds we're going to continue to talk about equities because we think that retail turn will happen and obviously, we want to be well-positioned. And I think we feel that we have a very strong lineup. And it's a matter of just again getting the attention on that lineup, and despite the record flows for the quarter, we still are making sure that the distribution is focused on getting that equity story out there. And I'm not sure when it will turn. I think we've all been frustrated that it's taken a bit longer. I think investor sentiment here in the United States for a lot of reasons continues to be a little bit shaky. We're not seeing that in other parts of the globe, we're not seeing that in Europe and Asia and I've seen a tremendous rebound in our sales, like the Asian Growth Fund that had $1.2 billion in net inflows for the quarter. So there are funds that are doing very well on the equity side, but like most in the U.S., we still remain frustrated that the investors are not moving back."

And we've done that in the past, so that's something we're very aware of. But I think that the general statement regarding flows and where we had $10 billion of net inflows was into a global government bond fund. And a government bond fund, obviously, you have tremendous capacity and growing capacity. And then also currency is the other area. So the liquidity of derivatives around currency forwards and things that you have to use in a fund like that, again, it’s one of the most liquid in large markets. So while we have a large share of a new class of flows, it is dwarfed by the overall size of that market. So there's really very little concern. If you had that much going in Emerging Markets Debt, that may be a different discussion on liquidity to consider having to close. I think the question around buyers is an interesting one because I think part of this growth is the recognition, certainly on the retail side, of a new asset class that is less correlated in a way to typical fixed income to equities. It had a very strong overall performance number and obviously, active management is the only way to really play that market. And trying to get currencies right, obviously, is very challenging as well. But we've had a team that has been successful in doing that. And I think looking at the average retail investor, they're more open to putting a portion of their assets in that. So I think that's part of what you're seeing in that class, and it's still a very relatively small number of the typical retail investor's portfolio. So I think that's a good trend that bodes well for continued new investors in that category. And then finally on rates, I think you're a little bit less sensitive to rates and we do -- I mean, obviously, it’s fixed income. Currencies are going to be a big driver, but we also look at duration and are very focused then because it's not as much of an income-oriented fund. We can go a little bit shorter on duration than our typical longer-term maturity fixed income fund. So that helps a little bit. But the bottom line is that it's very challenging to manage in this space. And there are going to be times when you're going to be out of favor and wrong. To us, we're trying to build that into the selling process that, that should be part of your expectation. You're never going to call every move in currencies, but I think we feel like we've got one of the best teams out there."

And I think we've got a long ways to go before we get too worried about what impact it may or may not have. But I think the bottom line is we feel even in the worst-case scenario that we could restructure the business and not have a big impact to get it from a different structure away from the Fed structure.

They're down in the teens and low teens in most cases so you won't have the kind of drag that you had before. And hopefully for us, it's just how historically that group has run money. And in some cases, you're going to have these kinds of periods where they underperform. But again, if you look at the longer-term numbers and how strong they are, I think that's really more important than the one-year number. And you look at something like the Franklin Income fund, for example, that we had short-term challenges. They’ve had sufficiently higher weightings in financial services. And during the period when financial service banks were in a lot of trouble, that fund underperformed. But quickly, it's really more uplift now in the numbers. And it's back to being a top performer for the one-year period and that kind of smoothes out over the three and five. And we've seen the quick rebound in flows there. And that was probably one of the most important funds for us as far as flows and continues to be very important to us going forward. But it shows you how quickly things can turn around on the short-term basis and not really hurt your long-term numbers when you have those little blips."

I’d like to recap a few of the highlights. This was another very strong quarter despite some challenging global markets and most importantly, investment performance remained strong with over 80% of our assets ranked in the top half of their peer groups for the three-year, five-year and 10-year periods. Long-term net inflows of $18.2 billion, which was a new record for us and through three quarters of our fiscal year, we’ve had three quarters of our four best quarters ever.

I think our feeling is that once it works its way through the process, which could take a while, many studies to be done, many new rules to come out, will get some clarity around the issue.
I think as far as the issue of seeding funds, while that may look like that could be a problem, we don’t anticipate that it should be a problem, but that risk is certainly out there. I think again with our status of a holding company, it’s something that we could change by stop offering some non-core services, but there is also a risk of being deemed a systemically important non-bank company. So that hangs out there as well. So, we really just need a bit of time to get some clarity around these before we really can determine exactly how it will affect us.

As well as the Emerging Markets Fund, and also even within fixed income many different types of bond funds, we had the Asian Bond Fund which had over a billion in net sales, has really started to accelerate its growth.
So, as far as organic growth rates, I mean those are hard to forecast, but I think it has been a usual period with respect to the growth of Global Bonds. But I think we are getting the benefit of somewhat of the halo effect when you have something as strong as a Global Bonds category that that’s really helping our other funds as well as our equity funds. For next quarter, I mean we talked about the one large account that should fund.

We want to make sure that the people recognize the risks there and are looking to equities. I think the timing has been good with that campaign, because we’ve seen our Franklin Equity Group continue to perform very well. I think 75% of its assets were in the top quartile for the last year.

For us, we diversified away from the flagship Templeton Growth Fund in that market and have been very successful with more of an allocation story up there and that continues to do very well. The other issue was the concentration of distribution. There is more distribution happening through banks and captive sales forces. I think that’s something that any outside manager needs to look at in the future, but it’s just been harder and harder for the independent manager, and I think that goes against the trend we see in the rest of the world.

That hasn’t been so much the case now, but something we are to open to doing with the emerging managers in the alternative space rather than just going in and acquiring in outright but taking minority stake, working with them and increasing that stake from there. So I think that’s just recognition of it. It’s a little bit different business for us and doesn’t necessarily fit in, in the more traditional acquisition of a mutual fund company for more activity there.

We also think it’s going to take a few years. The SEC has got a very full plate, so it could be years before any of this is resolved.
I think the real questions aren’t so much around the economics. I think those look reasonable from certainly our viewpoint. It’s really some of the operational challenges that we have to work through around, conversions and setting up new share classes with 25 basis point fees, the question around retirement shares. There are some open issues, but ones that we think we can work effectively with and hopefully through this comment period and come to a reasonable solution. I think, at the end of the day, the transparency for the investors settling just to 25, I think all of this is a positive for the future of the industry.

So that just means the advisor at that point moves from a higher ongoing fee to a 25 basis point fee, so that could shift how A shares are sold against C. There is also the maximum charge, and a lot of that remains to be seen how that’s going to work versus the more traditional pay as you go. But again, the net effect is more around having conversion periods; if you’re a 30 basis points class share, that gets added to the front-end sales charge against the maximum charge, so at year 18 or whatever the breakeven point is that would have to convert to a 25 basis points new class.
So that’s where it gets I think a little bit confusing for a very small percentage of investors and where the industry needs to think about and quantify the impact versus the benefit. I think, overall, from an economic standpoint these are all pass-through numbers for us. It’s not really an income statement impact. It would lower the 12b number, but would also lower the expense side as well. So the net-net wouldn’t change.

We are pleased to report another very strong quarter despite challenging global markets. Overall, relative investment performance remains strong with over 80% of U.S. long-term assets ranked in the top two quartiles for three, five and 10-year periods. We're also pleased to see that short-term performance has strengthened in several areas. The combination of strong performance and the breadth of our product offerings translated into another record quarter for long-term net new flows of $18.2 billion.
International markets continued to be a key part of our growth story. In this quarter, we are recognized for selling our cross-border funds in more countries than any other asset manager. Additionally, as of May 31, we are the number one cross-border fund manager by long-term assets under management. All of this has helped produce three of our best quarters ever for flow, resulting in fiscal year-to-date increase in assets under management of $47.1 billion, despite $1.4 billion of net market depreciation.
Assets under management ended the quarter at $570.5 billion, a decrease of 3% from the prior quarter, primarily related to the sell-off in Global Equity Markets during the quarter, and that was partially offset by strong flows. 
Simple monthly average AUM increased 4% for the quarter to $583 billion. As a result, assets under management by investment objectives shifted towards Fixed Income at 40% of ending assets under management, Equity was 41% and Hybrid was 18% and our overall mix remains well balanced. 
The percentage of assets by sales region did not change much this quarter, but the quarter-over-quarter change in AUM by region illustrates the benefits of diversification as decreased assets from the United States and Canada were partially offset by increased assets from Europe and the Asia-Pacific regions.
$34.5 billion of market depreciation was the primary driver of the decrease in assets under management this quarter as equity markets posted double-digit decline. That was partially offset by another strong quarter of flows. Total net new flows were $18.8 billion, however, that includes $600 million of flows from cash management that were primarily related to FRI balance sheet activity, including the net issuance of debt. 
Total long-term net new flows, which excludes cash management, were $18.2 billion. U.S. long-term sales increased 2% to $25 billion, while redemptions increased 14%. Investor interest remains focused on fixed income, and the Templeton Global Bond Fund was our bestselling U.S. mutual fund, once again, attracting net new flows of $3.6 billion. While the Global Bond Fund continues to do exceptionally well, we're also seeing strong demand for our U.S. Government, our total return, our Tax Free Fixed Income Fund, as well as equity funds such as gold and precious metals and rising dividends.
In May, insurance companies typically make modifications to their fund lineup as part of their annual perspective changes. And this year, we are net beneficiaries on the order of $500 million this quarter as a result.
International long-term sales increased 18% to $26 billion and redemptions increased 16%. Net inflows to our cross-border SICAV range also remained strong with almost $13 billion of net new flows this quarter. The Templeton Global Bond Fund was our bestselling fund with over $6 billion in net new flows, but our Global Total Return, Emerging Market Bond, Asian Bond and Asian Growth Funds also saw a very strong flow.
Europe continues to be our top-selling region, led by Italy where we have been the number one selling asset manager in 2010. 
Turning to flows by investment objectives, equity flows turned positive due to the rebound of domestic equity that was primarily related to the insurance company flows I mentioned previously. Global equities saw a slight improvement in outflows, as the increase net redemptions we experienced in May were partially offset by a rebound in net new flows in June. Hybrid net new flows flowed to $100 million due to increased redemption. We're pleased to see our High Net Worth business continues to attract inflows, posting another strong quarter with over $200 million of net new flows.
Fixed income products, as I've already mentioned, had another strong quarter with $18 billion of net new flows, a modest increase from the last quarter. Cash management net inflows is $600 million, again as I previously mentioned were primarily due to FRI balance sheet activity.
Overall, long-term relative performance remained strong across the board. Equity one-year performance saw the most notable improvement highlighted by a rebound of Mutual Series and strengthening Franklin equity performance. 100% of Mutual Series assets were once again ranked in the top two quartile for the three, five and 10-year periods, and short-term performance improved with 38% of assets ranked in the top two quartile for the one-year period.
On the Fixed Income side, long-term performance remained strong as well, but we did see a decrease in the one-year ranking due to the Federal tax refund that slipped into the third quartile or 53rd percentile. 
I'll now turn it over to Ken for operating results."

Happy to report another strong quarter of operating results for the company due to record net inflows and continued prudent expense management. Operating income for the quarter was $521.6 million, which was a 13% increase from the prior qu",685,"Thanks, Greg. Happy to report another strong quarter of operating results for the company due to record net inflows and continued prudent expense management. 
Operating income for the quarter was $521.6 million, which was a 13% increase from the prior quarter. And net income was $360.5 million and earnings per share was $1.58. 
Slide 17 shows that investment management fees increased 10%, due to increased average assets under management, increased performance fees and carried interests as well as one additional day in the quarter. The effective fee rate for the quarter increased slightly to 60.7 basis points, excluding performance fees and carried interest of $33.5 million. Both underwriting distribution fees and expenses increased 7%, due to increased assets under management and commissionable growth sales. Shareholders servicing fees was $73 million, a 2% increase from the prior quarter, due to increased shareholder accounts.
During the quarter, Canada purged approximately 230,000 accounts as part of its annual cycle, and following quarter end, our U.S. transfer agent purged  approximately 3.2 million closed accounts. Other net revenue was $14.4 million, including a $3.1 million gain on residual interest in auto loan securitization.
Operating expenses increased 6% from the prior quarter, but there are a number of items worthy of additional explanation included in the expenses this quarter. Compensation and benefits increased 3% to $280 million, but included in this line is approximately $12.5 million of variable compensation related to the performance fees and carried interest earned during the quarter. 
Information system, technology and occupancy expenses increased 9% to $76 million and include a non-recurring charge of $6 million from the upfront loss on a sublease agreement.  And advertising and promotion was flat as increased advertising was offset by a decrease in promotional expenses.  We expect a seasonal uptick in advertising and promotion next quarter. 
Amortization of deferred sales commission increased to $50 million. The increase was primarily due to a non-recurring impairment of certain assets of $3.4 million. And other expenses increased $8.6 million, but included in this line are $7.4 million related to the carried interest earned this quarter as well as a $5 million charge from a legal settlement. 
With that said, some of the expenses are driven by the market on this line item. So it's reasonable to expect a slight increase in the run rate next quarter.
Excluding the increase in underwriting distribution expenses and the highlighted items, expenses were essentially flat from the quarter prior. Other expenses were $26.8 million, a decrease of $74 million from the prior quarter. Consolidated sponsored investment product losses were $14.7 million, representing the mark-to-market decrease of the securities held by those sponsored products and classified as trading on our balance sheet. The decrease is reasonable given the composition of our investments and the market declines during the quarter. Investment and other losses were $7.3 million, a decrease of $50 million from the prior quarter, due primarily to a change in net gains to net losses from equity method investments as well as lower mark-to-market gains and trading investments. Full details will be available in our Form 10-Q.
Interest expense increased to $4.8 million in the quarter as a result of the notes we issued in May. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.3%, due to a favorable tax ruling outside the U.S. We expect the tax rate for the full year to be between 29% and 30%, which implies a higher rate next quarter.  The operating margin for the quarter was 34% on a GAAP basis. 
On capital management, we repurchased 2.1 million shares this quarter, almost double last quarter's activity, decreasing ending shares outstanding to $225.4 million. The trailing 12-month payout issue was 107%, including the $3 special dividend paid in December, and we continue to manage our balance sheet opportunistically with respect to potential acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends declared by our Board of Directors.
Total cash and investments were approximately $6.6 billion versus $5.7 billion on March 31, with a net increase primarily attributable to the increase in net debt during the quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Greg."

Before we wrap up, I'd like to quickly touch on some business highlights. In India, we were awarded Best On Shore Fund Manager by Asian Investor and the IACC's Indo-American Corporate Excellence Award for the Best U.S. Company in the Financial Sector. 
In Poland, we became the largest foreign asset manager. In Malaysia, we were appointed to manage our first Shariah equity mandate. And in Romania, we now expect to take over management of the almost $4 billion Romania Property Fund in this quarter. 
Last week the financial reform bill was signed into law, and while asset managers were not the focus, as a bank holding company, we are evaluating it's potential impact on our business. We're also evaluating those non-core banking services we provide to some of our high network of clients that cause us to be a bank holding company.
We have been closely following the SEC's dialog on reforms for the 12b-1 rule, including it's most recent proposal. Our principal objective is to ensure that our fund shareholders will continue to receive professional advice and service in an efficient and cost-effective manner. We believe clarity and transparency around the use of 12b-1 fees is essential. And although the fees currently are fully disclosed, we will support efforts to help shareholders better understand our view. We do not currently expect these reforms to have a material impact.

I'd like to recap a few of the highlights. This was another very strong quarter despite challenging  global market, and most importantly, investment performance remains strong with over 80% of our assets ranked in the top half of their peer groups for the three, five and 10-year period.
Long-term net inflows of $18.2 billion, which was a new record for us. And through three quarters of our fiscal year, we've had three of our four best quarters ever.

But I think as far as the issue of seeding funds, while that may look like that could be a problem, we don't anticipate that it should be a problem. But that risk is certainly out there. And I think, again, with our status, a holding company is something that we could change by stop offering  some non-core services.

I mean, I think you had some unusual events, and certainly we talked about the euro and how that actually accelerated some of the Global Bond sales throughout Europe as people diversified away from the euro. So we were the net beneficiary. And I don't think that's a long-term sustainable trend. I do -- I think it's important to point out that we have seen very significant flows in other categories, in SICAV. Our Asian growth funds has been one of our top sellers there, as well as the Emerging Markets Fund. And also even within fixed income, many different types of bond funds. We had the Asian bond fund, which had over $1 billion in net sales, and it's really started to accelerate its growth. So as far as organic growth rates, those are hard to forecast. But I think it has been an unusual period with respect to the growth of Global Bonds. But I think we are getting the benefit of somewhat of the halo effect, when you have something as strong as the Global Bond category, that that's really helping our other funds as well as our equity funds. And for next quarter, I mean, we talked about the one large account that should fund. So, I mean,  obviously that's going to help when you just look at offshore organic growth rates.

But if you looked at our marketing efforts today, certainly on the retail side with our 2020 Vision campaign, that's very much focused on trying to get investors to look at equities, because we think especially on the retail side, that probably too much money is moving into fixed income at these lower yields. We want to make sure that people recognize the risks there and are looking to equity.

The Canadian market's been very strong as you'd expect with the strength in commodities. That willing drives that market, so most of the monies are going into domestic mandates. For us, we diversified away from the flagship Templeton Growth Fund in that market and have been very successful with a more of an allocation story up there, and that continues to do very well. And the other issue was the concentration and distribution. There's more distribution happening through banks and captive sales forces, and I think that's something that any outside manager needs to look at in the future. But it's just been harder and harder for the independent manager. And I think that goes against the trend we see in the rest of the world."

And I think the general sense is that you guys have started to kind of loosen the reigns a little bit on investment spend, I mean, not dramatically, but kind of starting to spend a little bit more money on new initiatives than maybe you had in the year or so prior. Given where we were and what the markets did the last quarter and where we are right now, how do you -- what's kind of your current view from an expense perspective? Is there kind of a backlog of projects you need to get to? And with your pretty strong volumes, is that kind of keeping the pressure on having to spend on infrastructure?"

So we clearly want to leverage the success that we have and the opportunities that we're seeing from those successes, and we're committed to do that. I think a lot of the bulk of the expense requests are to invest in operations outside the U.S. in portfolio and distribution. And when we get those requests, they usually come with at least some objective of generating revenue. So if your question is about margin compression  or expansion, I think we try to take a balanced approach, and we just prioritize the investments based on what we think the potential payback is."

So we are very aware of that. And as we stated before, we have to fit in an alternatives manager that makes sense within our given structure, and also with the right kind of economic incentives to maintain a transition, whether it's an acquisition or a partial ownership. And something that we are doing today that's a little bit different than what we've done in the past is to take minority stakes.  That hasn't been so much the case now, but something we're open to doing with emerging managers in the alternative space rather than just going in and acquiring it outright, but taking minority stake,  working with them and increasing that stake from there. So I think that's just a recognition of it.  It's a little bit different business for us, and it doesn't necessarily fit in, in the more traditional acquisition of a mutual fund company. We have more activity there."

So that just means the advisor at that point moves from a higher ongoing fee to a 25 basis point fee. So that could shift how his shares are sold against fee. But there's also the maximum charge, and a lot of that remains to be seen how that's going to work versus the more traditional pay as you go. But again, the net effect is more around having conversion periods. If you have a 30 basis point class share, that gets added to the front end sales charge against the maximum charge. So at year 18, or whatever the breakeven point is, that would have to convert to a 25 basis point new class. So that's where it gets, I think, a little bit confusing for a very small percentage of investors, and where the industry needs to think about and quantify the impact versus the benefit. But I think overall from an economic standpoint, these are all pass-through numbers for us. It's not really an income statement impact. It would lower the 12b number, but it would also lower the expense side as well. So the net-net wouldn't change."

In this environment, we saw an opportunity to give us a more financial flexibility and we took that. And we did -- some of the proceeds we used to term out our commercial paper.

We are pleased to report another very strong quarter despite challenging global markets. Overall, relative investment performance remains strong with over 80% of U.S. long-term assets ranked in the top two quartiles for three, five and 10-year periods. We're also pleased to see that short-term performance has strengthened in several areas. The combination of strong performance and the breadth of our product offerings translated into another record quarter for long-term net new flows of $18.2 billion.
International markets continued to be a key part of our growth story. In this quarter, we are recognized for selling our cross-border funds in more countries than any other asset manager. Additionally, as of May 31, we are the number one cross-border fund manager by long-term assets under management. All of this has helped produce three of our best quarters ever for flow, resulting in fiscal year-to-date increase in assets under management of $47.1 billion, despite $1.4 billion of net market depreciation.
Assets under management ended the quarter at $570.5 billion, a decrease of 3% from the prior quarter, primarily related to the sell-off in Global Equity Markets during the quarter, and that was partially offset by strong flows. 
Simple monthly average AUM increased 4% for the quarter to $583 billion. As a result, assets under management by investment objectives shifted towards Fixed Income at 40% of ending assets under management, Equity was 41% and Hybrid was 18% and our overall mix remains well balanced. 
The percentage of assets by sales region did not change much this quarter, but the quarter-over-quarter change in AUM by region illustrates the benefits of diversification as decreased assets from the United States and Canada were partially offset by increased assets from Europe and the Asia-Pacific regions.
$34.5 billion of market depreciation was the primary driver of the decrease in assets under management this quarter as equity markets posted double-digit decline. That was partially offset by another strong quarter of flows. Total net new flows were $18.8 billion, however, that includes $600 million of flows from cash management that were primarily related to FRI balance sheet activity, including the net issuance of debt. 
Total long-term net new flows, which excludes cash management, were $18.2 billion. U.S. long-term sales increased 2% to $25 billion, while redemptions increased 14%. Investor interest remains focused on fixed income, and the Templeton Global Bond Fund was our bestselling U.S. mutual fund, once again, attracting net new flows of $3.6 billion. While the Global Bond Fund continues to do exceptionally well, we're also seeing strong demand for our U.S. Government, our total return, our Tax Free Fixed Income Fund, as well as equity funds such as gold and precious metals and rising dividends.
In May, insurance companies typically make modifications to their fund lineup as part of their annual perspective changes. And this year, we are net beneficiaries on the order of $500 million this quarter as a result.
International long-term sales increased 18% to $26 billion and redemptions increased 16%. Net inflows to our cross-border SICAV range also remained strong with almost $13 billion of net new flows this quarter. The Templeton Global Bond Fund was our bestselling fund with over $6 billion in net new flows, but our Global Total Return, Emerging Market Bond, Asian Bond and Asian Growth Funds also saw a very strong flow.
Europe continues to be our top-selling region, led by Italy where we have been the number one selling asset manager in 2010. 
Turning to flows by investment objectives, equity flows turned positive due to the rebound of domestic equity that was primarily related to the insurance company flows I mentioned previously. Global equities saw a slight improvement in outflows, as the increase net redemptions we experienced in May were partially offset by a rebound in net new flows in June. Hybrid net new flows flowed to $100 million due to increased redemption. We're pleased to see our High Net Worth business continues to attract inflows, posting another strong quarter with over $200 million of net new flows.
Fixed income products, as I've already mentioned, had another strong quarter with $18 billion of net new flows, a modest increase from the last quarter. Cash management net inflows is $600 million, again as I previously mentioned were primarily due to FRI balance sheet activity.
Overall, long-term relative performance remained strong across the board. Equity one-year performance saw the most notable improvement, highlighted by a rebound of Mutual Series and strengthening Franklin Equity performance. 100% of Mutual Series assets were once again ranked in the top two quartile for the three, five and 10-year periods, and short-term performance improved with 38% of assets ranked in the top two quartile for the one-year period.
On the Fixed Income side, long-term performance remained strong as well, but we did see a decrease in the one-year ranking due to the federal tax-free fund that slipped into the third quartile or 53rd percentile. 
I'll now turn it over to Ken for operating results."

Happy to report another strong quarter of operating results for the company due to record net inflows and continued prudent expense management.  Operating income for the quarter was $521.6 million, which was a 13% increase from the prior quarter. And net income was $360.5 million and earnings per share was $1.58. 
Slide 17 shows that investment management fees increased 10%, due to increased average assets under management, increased performance fees and carried interests as well as one additional day in the quarter. The effective fee rate for the quarter increased slightly to 60.7 basis points, excluding performance fees and carried interest of $33.5 million. Both underwriting distribution fees and expenses increased 7%, due to increased assets under management and commissionable growth sales. Shareholders servicing fees was $73 million, a 2% increase from the prior quarter, due to increased shareholder accounts.
During the quarter, Canada purged approximately 230,000 accounts as part of its annual cycle, and following quarter end, our U.S. transfer agent purged  approximately 3.2 million closed accounts. Other net revenue was $14.4 million, including a $3.1 million gain on residual interest in auto loan securitization.
Operating expenses increased 6% from the prior quarter, but there are a number of items worthy of additional explanation included in the expenses this quarter. Compensation and benefits increased 3% to $280 million, but included in this line is approximately $12.5 million of variable compensation related to the performance fees and carried interest earned during the quarter. 
Information system, technology and occupancy expenses increased 9% to $76 million and include a non-recurring charge of $6 million from the upfront loss on a sublease agreement.  And advertising and promotion was flat as increased advertising was offset by a decrease in promotional expenses.  We expect a seasonal uptick in advertising and promotion next quarter. 
Amortization of deferred sales commission increased to $50 million. The increase was primarily due to a non-recurring impairment of certain assets of $3.4 million. And other expenses increased $8.6 million, but included in this line are $7.4 million related to the carried interest earned this quarter as well as a $5 million charge from a legal settlement. 
With that said, some of the expenses are driven by the market on this line item. So it's reasonable to expect a slight increase in the run rate next quarter.
Excluding the increase in underwriting distribution expenses and the highlighted items, expenses were essentially flat from the quarter prior. Other expenses were $26.8 million, a decrease of $74 million from the prior quarter. Consolidated sponsored investment product losses were $14.7 million, representing the mark-to-market decrease of the securities held by those sponsored products and classified as trading on our balance sheet. The decrease is reasonable given the composition of our investments and the market declines during the quarter. Investment and other losses were $7.3 million, a decrease of $50 million from the prior quarter, due primarily to a change in net gains to net losses from equity method investments as well as lower mark-to-market gains and trading investments. Full details will be available in our Form 10-Q.
Interest expense increased to $4.8 million in the quarter as a result of the notes we issued in May. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.3%, due to a favorable tax ruling outside the U.S. We expect the tax rate for the full year to be between 29% and 30%, which implies a higher rate next quarter.  The operating margin for the quarter was 34% on a GAAP basis. 
On capital management, we repurchased 2.1 million shares this quarter, almost double last quarter's activity, decreasing ending shares outstanding to $225.4 million. The trailing 12-month payout issue was 107%, including the $3 special dividend paid in December, and we continue to manage our balance sheet opportunistically with respect to potential acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends declared by our Board of Directors.
Total cash and investments were approximately $6.6 billion versus $5.7 billion on March 31, with a net increase primarily attributable to the increase in net debt during the quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Greg."

In Poland, we became the largest foreign asset manager. In Malaysia, we were appointed to manage our first Shariah equity mandate. And in Romania, we now expect to take over management of the almost $4 billion Romania Property Fund in this quarter. 
Last week the financial reform bill was signed into law, and while asset managers were not the focus, as a bank holding company, we are evaluating it's potential impact on our business. We're also evaluating those non-core banking services we provide to some of our high network of clients that cause us to be a bank holding company.
We have been closely following the SEC's dialogue on reforms for the 12b-1 rule, including it's most recent proposal. Our principal objective is to ensure that our fund shareholders will continue to receive professional advice and service in an efficient and cost-effective manner. We believe clarity and transparency around the use of 12b-1 fees is essential. And although the fees currently are fully disclosed, we will support efforts to help shareholders better understand our view. We do not currently expect these reforms to have a material impact.
As always, thank you for taking time to listen to this commentary. If you have any questions about the release or our comments, be sure to contact Investor Relations before the live call later today."

I'd like to recap a few of the highlights. This was another very strong quarter despite challenging  global market, and most importantly, investment performance remains strong with over 80% of our assets ranked in the top half of their peer groups for the three, five and 10-year period.
Long-term net inflows of $18.2 billion, which was a new record for us. And through three quarters of our fiscal year, we've had three of our four best quarters ever. 
I would now like to open it up for your questions. Thank you."

And I think, again, with our status, a holding company is something that we could change by stop offering  some non-core services.

I mean, I think you had some unusual events, and certainly we talked about the euro and how that actually accelerated some of the Global Bond sales throughout Europe as people diversified away from the euro. So we were the net beneficiary. And I don't think that's a long-term sustainable trend. I do -- I think it's important to point out that we have seen very significant flows in other categories, in SICAV. Our Asian growth funds has been one of our top sellers there, as well as the Emerging Markets Fund. And also even within fixed income, many different types of bond funds. We had the Asian bond fund, which had over $1 billion in net sales, and it's really started to accelerate its growth. So as far as organic growth rates, I mean, those are hard to forecast. But I think it has been an unusual period with respect to the growth of Global Bonds. But I think we are getting the benefit of somewhat of the halo effect, when you have something as strong as the Global Bond category, that that's really helping our other funds as well as our equity funds. And for next quarter, I mean, we talked about the one large account that should fund. So, I mean,  obviously that's going to help when you just look at offshore organic growth rates.

We want to make sure that people recognize the risks there and are looking to equity.

There's more distribution happening through banks and captive sales forces, and I think that's something that any outside manager needs to look at in the future.

So if your question is about margin compression  or expansion, I think we try to take a balanced approach, and we just prioritize the investments based on what we think the potential payback is."

So we are very aware of that. And as we stated before, we have to fit in an alternatives manager that makes sense within our given structure, and also with the right kind of economic incentives to maintain a transition, whether it's an acquisition or a partial ownership. And something that we are doing today that's a little bit different than what we've done in the past is to take minority stakes.  That hasn't been so much the case now, but something we're open to doing with emerging managers in the alternative space rather than just going in and acquiring it outright, but taking minority stake,  working with them and increasing that stake from there. So I think that's just a recognition of it.  It's a little bit different business for us, and it doesn't necessarily fit in, in the more traditional acquisition of a mutual fund company. We have more activity there."

Interest rates -- we liked the interest rates at that time. We had a strong balance sheet. We were able to do that. In this environment, we saw an opportunity to give us a more financial flexibility and we took that. And we did -- some of the proceeds we used to term out our commercial paper. And in addition to that, we had a back stop facility that was up for renewal in June, and we just felt like the terms of that were uneconomical.

Long-term net flows of $19 billion are primarily",788,"Hello, and welcome to the fourth quarter earnings commentary for 2010. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO, along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. We're pleased to report another solid quarter highlighted again by record growth. Long-term net flows of $19 billion are primarily driven by retail fixed income, but also included notable contribution from other products, such as the recent addition of the management and administration of the $4.6 billion remaining in restitution fund mandate.
The fourth quarter capped off a record year for us, as strong global sales led to a long-term net new flows of $70 billion. This, combined with continued strong investment performance and the rebound in equity market, increased assets under management to $645 billion, nearly matching 2007 fiscal year ending AUM.
Operating results have also returned to near-record levels, as operating income for the fiscal year was $2 billion. Importantly, our balance sheet remains stronger than ever after returning over $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and repurchases over the past year.
Turning to Slide 6. As I already highlighted, assets under management increased 13% in the prior quarter to $645 billion. Average assets under management increased 4% to $605 billion.
Assets under management by investment objectives shifted slightly toward equity at 43% of ending assets under management. Fixed income was 39%; and Hybrid, 17%. Assets under management by sales region continue to shift towards Europe and Asia, where we're experiencing strong growth highlighted by our SICAV funds across $100 billion in AUM for the first time.
Market appreciation added $56 billion to assets under management this quarter, as global equity indices posted strong gains. Long-term sales of $49 billion were a slight decrease in the prior quarter, but overall remained very strong. This decrease is more than offset by a decrease in redemption, resulting in another record quarter for net new flows.
Turning to flows by sales region on Slide 10. U.S. long-term sales decreased 8% to $23 billion, while redemptions decreased 11% to $16 billion. Our top-selling fund remains Templeton Global Bond Fund, which realized net new flows of $3.8 billion this quarter.  Investors remain focused on fixed income products, and our tax refund also had another strong quarter with net new flows of $1.5 billion.
Equity funds remain out of favor with retail investors across the industry, and our flows generally reflect that. However, we've seen some traction with some of our focused funds from our equity campaign, such as the Rising Dividend Fund.
On the institutional side, we continue to see interest from pension funds for our global equity and fixed income capabilities.
International long-term sales and redemptions were flat, compared to the prior quarter. And as I already mentioned, the highlight of the quarter was the on-boarding of the $4.6 billion restitution fund mandate from the Romanian government. Our SICAV umbrella of funds continue to see strong flows, with net new flows exceeding $8 billion this quarter, highlighted again by flows to Global Bond, as well as our other global fixed income products, such as Global Total Return, Emerging Markets Bond and Asian Bond. We also continue to see positive equity flows to our SICAV funds, especially the Asian Growth Fund that doubled its assets this year by almost $14 billion.
Looking at flows by investment objective. Net new flows were positive across all categories except domestic equity. Total equity net new flows increased to $4.5 billion, due primarily to increased global equity sales, including the Romanian fund, which more than offset lower domestic equity sale. Hybrid net new flows improved to $500 million, due mostly to an overall decrease in redemption. 
The Franklin income fund was our best-selling Hybrid fund, and we continue to see positive high-network flows. It's worth noting that we now expect the redemption of a very low flat fee advisory account quarter. But currently, it represents $11 billion of assets included in the Hybrid category.
Fixed Income had another strong quarter with net new flows of $14 billion as previously discussed.
Turning to investment performance. Overall, long-term relative performance for the three-, five- and 10-year periods remains quite strong and improved slightly by several measures. However, the percent of assets in the top two quartiles for the one-year period decreased modestly to 58%, due mostly to our tax-free income funds, which we've seen our holdings and higher-quality bonds underperform certain competitors that used leverage will have a lower credit profile, while the higher-risk sectors have continued to outperform all of our funds during the top two quartiles for income return, which is our focus in this area.
Overall, equity performance remains solid, and we continue to see improved one-year relative performance from Mutual Series. I'll now turn it over to Ken for the operating results."
28703,114467020,82637,"Franklin Resources Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Franklin Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Greg, and hello, everybody.

As you know, September 30 marked the end of our fiscal year, and our operating results have rebounded nicely
Since the beginning of the global financial crisis to near pre-crisis levels due to strong growth in assets under management, as Greg just highlighted, as well as continued focus on expense management.
Total revenue of $5.9 billion was a 40% increase from 2009, and operating income increased 63% to $2 billion near record levels.  Net income increased 61% to over $1.4 billion in earnings per share with $6.33, a 64% increase from 2009.
Turning to Slide 16 of the presentation in the fourth quarter. Operating income was $509 million, a slight decrease from the prior quarter due to a number of factors. Net income was $373 million, and included approximately $25 million of net negative accounting adjustments recorded in the quarter.  I'll explain this further, as I discuss the details of our results, and earnings per share was $1.65.
We recently completed an analysis of our accounting model for our investments in consolidated sponsored investment products or consolidated SIP, as we refer to them. Based on that review, we concluded that a number of our international funds should be recharacterized and reclassified. The impact of the current quarter was a reduction of pretax income of approximately $15 million, which was mostly reflected in non-operating income and approximately $9 million after-tax and controlling interest.  These adjustments reversed gains recognized in prior periods. What this means for future reporting periods is that the number of SIPs requiring consolidation will be greatly reduced.
Investment management fees increased slightly from last quarter and by less than one might expect, given the 4% increase in average assets under management. There were uncommon items in both this quarter and the prior quarter.
Normalizing both quarters by excluding these items, results in an effective fee rate of 61 basis points compared with the 60.7 basis points rate in the prior quarter, and a change of revenue that is more in line with the change in average assets under management.
As you may recall last quarter, we reported $33.5 million of performance fees and carried interest. This quarter, we changed that estimate downward by $12.9 million and also adjusted the related expenses in the compensation and benefits and the other expense lines.  There was also one additional calendar day in this quarter.
Looking forward, the expected loss of the institutional advisory mandate that Greg mentioned earlier should only have about an annualized $2 million impact on run-rate revenue. Underwriting distribution fees were essentially flat, as an increase in distribution income was offset by a decrease in commissions from growth sales.
Underwriting and distribution expense increased by 2%, which was more than the change in revenue. There was no change in the percentage of underwriting a distribution revenue retained on U.S. assets. However, quarterly average International assets under management increased over 10% during the period, and International now represents about 30% of assets under management. 
These factors, along with the fact that International asset-based distribution fee rate tend to be higher than U.S. rates, increased the expense more than the revenue line, as the offset or increased International asset-based distribution fees is included in the Investment Management Fee line.
Shareholders servicing fees decreased 4% due to the decrease in billable shareholder count, as we completed our annual purge of U.S. closed accounts in July, as I highlighted last quarter.
Other net revenue, which now includes consolidated sponsored investment product income was $9.5 million. This was a decrease from the prior quarter due to a $2 million decrease the mark-to-market gains on certain residual interest in auto securitizations, as well as a $2.9 million onetime adjustment related to the deconsolidation of certain SIPs mentioned earlier.
Turning to expenses. Compensation and benefits was $275 million, a 2% decrease from the prior quarter. However, included in this line is a $4.4 million benefit from reversing the carried interest accrual that I mentioned a moment ago. Excluding the impact of performance fees and carried interest, compensation increased from the prior quarter due to higher variable compensation.
IT and occupancy expenses increased to $81 million due to increased rent and occupancy costs, as well as increased technology spending foreshadowed on recent earnings calls. Some of the 7% increase relates to increased business activities and some of it is seasonal or related to unique and non-recurring projects.
Advertising and promotion increased to $47.5 million, with about 60% of the increase coming from advertising, and the balance from sales and promotional expenses that vary with assets under management and sales. Part of the increase in advertising is seasonal, and we usually see decreased advertising spend in the first quarter of our fiscal year. That said, seasonality trends may be changing, as we increase our advertising in international locations, for example, in Germany, Hong Kong and Canada.
Amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased to $46 million. As you may recall, the prior quarter included an impairment loss of $3.4 million, and other expense was about $40 million, including a $3.6 million benefit from a reversal of the carried interest-related expense reported last quarter. Excluding that, increased professional fees this quarter were partially offset fees from the legal charge and other carried interest expenses included last quarter. Again, there's  a component of this line item that is driven by increases in assets under management.
Other income and expenses was $43 million, an improvement of $70 million from the prior quarter. Consolidated sponsored investment product gains was $2.4 million, representing the mark-to-market increase of the securities held by those sponsored products that are classified as trading under balance sheet.
Included in this line is a $17.4 million onetime adjustment for certain SIPs that were deconsolidated this quarter. Investment and other income losses was $51 million, an improvement over the prior quarter due primarily to a switch from losses to gains on equity method investments, driven by the rise in global stock market.  Also included is an almost $4 million increase from the change in accounting from investments in SIPs.
Interest and dividend income was $13 million for the quarter. Interest expense increased to $10 million, reflecting the first full quarter of interest expense related to the debt offering we completed in May.
And the effective tax rate was 32% for the quarter and 29.9% for the fiscal year, including some non-recurring items. While circumstances may change, our current expectation for tax rate in 2011 is that it will be between 29% and 30%. Even though market volatility in the adoption of new accounting rules over the past two years have increased quarterly rate volatility, the annual tax rate has ranged between 29% and 30% since 2008. The operating margin for the quarter was 33.3% on a GAAP basis, and we repurchased more than 1.7 million shares this quarter, decreasing ending share outstanding to 224 million. And the Board declared a $0.22 regular dividend.  Total cash and investments ended the fiscal year at $6.8 billion.
If I can call your attention to the chart on the bottom left of Slide 20. Over the past four years, total debt is essentially unchanged, while cash and investments have increased by approximately $1.6 billion. And at the same time, shares outstanding have decreased 12%. So a common stockholders at September 30, 2006, now owns 13% more of this company for every share retained.
All told, we further strengthened our balance sheet while returning over $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and repurchases, including $1.5 billion this year.

Long-term net flows of $19 billion are primarily",791,"Hello, and welcome to the fourth quarter earnings commentary for 2010. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO, along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. We're pleased to report another solid quarter highlighted again by record growth. Long-term net flows of $19 billion are primarily driven by retail fixed income, but also included notable contributions from other products, such as the recent addition of the management and administration of the $4.6 billion remaining in restitution fund mandate.
The fourth quarter capped off a record year for us, as strong global sales led to a long-term net new flows of $70 billion. This, combined with continued strong investment performance and the rebound in equity markets, increased assets under management to $645 billion, nearly matching 2007 fiscal year ending AUM.
Operating results have also returned to near-record levels, as operating income for the fiscal year was $2 billion. Importantly, our balance sheet remains stronger than ever after returning over $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and repurchases over the past year.
Turning to Slide 6. As I already highlighted, assets under management increased 13% in the prior quarter to $645 billion. Average assets under management increased 4% to $605 billion.
Assets under management by investment objectives shifted slightly toward equity at 43% of ending assets under management. Fixed income was 39%; and Hybrid, 17%. Assets under management by sales region continue to shift towards Europe and Asia, where we're experiencing strong growth highlighted by our SICAV funds that crossed $100 billion in AUM for the first time.
Market appreciation added $56 billion to assets under management this quarter, as global equity indices posted strong gains. Long-term sales of $49 billion were a slight decrease in the prior quarter, but overall remained very strong. This decrease is more than offset by a decrease in redemption, resulting in another record quarter for net new flows.
Turning to flows by sales region on Slide 10. U.S. long-term sales decreased 8% to $23 billion, while redemptions decreased 11% to $16 billion. Our top-selling fund remains the Templeton Global Bond Fund, which realized net new flows of $3.8 billion this quarter. Investors remain focused on fixed income products, and our tax refunds also had another strong quarter with net new flows of $1.5 billion.
Equity funds remain out of favor with retail investors across the industry, and our flows generally reflect that. However, we've seen some traction with some of our focused funds from our equity campaign, such as the Rising Dividend Fund.
On the institutional side, we continue to see interest from pension funds for our global equity and fixed income capabilities.
International long-term sales and redemptions were flat, compared to the prior quarter. And as I already mentioned, the highlight of the quarter was the on-boarding of the $4.6 billion restitution fund mandate from the Romanian government. 
Our SICAV umbrella of funds continue to see strong flows, with net new flows exceeding $8 billion this quarter, highlighted again by flows to Global Bond, as well as our other global fixed income products, such as Global Total Return, Emerging Market Bond and Asian Bond. We also continue to see positive equity flows to our SICAV funds, especially the Asian Growth Fund that doubled its assets this year by almost $14 billion.
Looking at flows by investment objective. Net new flows were positive across all categories except domestic equity. Total equity net new flows increased to $4.5 billion, due primarily to increased global equity sales, including the Romanian fund, which more than offset lower domestic equity sale. Hybrid net new flows improved to $500 million, due mostly to an overall decrease in redemptions. 
The Franklin income fund was our best-selling Hybrid fund, and we continue to see positive high-network flows. It's worth noting that we now expect the redemption of a very low flat fee advisory account next quarter, which currently represents $11 billion of assets included in the Hybrid category.
Fixed income had another strong quarter with net new flows of $14 billion as previously discussed.
Turning to investment performance. Overall, long-term relative performance for the three-, five- and 10-year periods remains quite strong and improved slightly by several measures. However, the percent of assets in the top two quartiles for the one-year period decreased modestly to 58%, due mostly to our tax-free income funds, which we've seen our holdings and higher-quality bonds underperform certain competitors that use leverage will have a lower credit profile, while the higher-risk sectors have continued to outperform. All of our funds are in the top two quartiles for income return, which is our focus in this area.
Overall, equity performance remains solid, and we continued to see improved one-year relative performance from Mutual Series. 
I'll now turn it over to Ken for the operating results."
28703,114467020,82721,"Franklin Resources Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Franklin Resources, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, Greg, and hello, everybody. As you know, September 30 marked the end of our fiscal year, and our operating results have rebounded nicely since the beginning of the global financial crisis to near pre-crisis levels due to strong growth in",1301,"Okay. Thank you, Greg, and hello, everybody. As you know, September 30 marked the end of our fiscal year, and our operating results have rebounded nicely since the beginning of the global financial crisis to near pre-crisis levels due to strong growth in assets under management, as Greg just highlighted, as well as continued focus on expense management.
Total revenue of $5.9 billion was a 40% increase from 2009, and operating income increased 63% to $2 billion, near record levels. Net income increased 61% to over $1.4 billion and earnings per share was $6.33, a 64% increase from 2009.
Turning to Slide 16 of the presentation and the fourth quarter. Operating income was $509 million, a slight decrease from the prior quarter due to a number of factors. Net income was $373 million and included approximately $25 million of net negative accounting adjustments recorded in the quarter. I'll explain this further as I discuss the details of our results, and earnings per share was $1.65.
We recently completed an analysis of our accounting model for our investments in consolidated sponsored investment products or consolidated SIP, as we refer to them. Based on that review, we’ve concluded that a number of our international funds should be re-characterized and reclassified. The impact of the current quarter was a reduction of pretax income of approximately $15 million, which was mostly reflected in non-operating income and approximately $9 million after tax and controlling interest. These adjustments reversed gains recognized in prior periods. What this means for future reporting periods is that the number of SIPs requiring consolidation will be greatly reduced.
Investment management fees increased slightly from last quarter and by less than one might expect, given the 4% increase in average assets under management. There were uncommon items in both this quarter and the prior quarter.
Normalizing both quarters by excluding these items, results in an effective fee rate of 61 basis points compared with the 60.7 basis points rate in the prior quarter and a change in revenue that is more in line with the change in average assets under management.
As you may recall last quarter, we reported $33.5 million of performance fees and carried interest. This quarter, we changed that estimate downward by $12.9 million and also adjusted the related expenses in the compensation and benefits and the other expense lines. There was also one additional calendar day in this quarter.
Looking forward, the expected loss of the institutional advisory mandate that Greg mentioned earlier should only have about an annualized $2 million impact on run rate revenue. 
Underwriting and distribution fees were essentially flat, as an increase in distribution income was offset by a decrease in commissions from growth sales.
Underwriting and distribution expense increased by 2%, which was more than the change in revenue. There was no change in the percentage of underwriting and distribution revenue retained on U.S. assets. However, quarterly average International assets under management increased over 10% during the period, and International now represents about 30% of assets under management. 
These factors, along with the fact that International asset-based distribution fee rate tend to be higher than U.S. rates, increased the expense more than the revenue line, as the offset or increased International asset-based distribution fees is included in the Investment Management Fee line.
Shareholders servicing fees decreased 4% due to the decrease in billable shareholder count, as we completed our annual purge of U.S. closed accounts in July, as I highlighted last quarter.
Other net revenue, which now includes consolidated sponsored investment product income was $9.5 million. This was a decrease from the prior quarter due to a $2 million decrease the mark-to-market gains on certain residual interest in auto securitizations, as well as a $2.9 million onetime adjustment related to the deconsolidation of certain SIPs mentioned earlier.
Turning to expenses. Compensation and benefits was $275 million, a 2% decrease from the prior quarter. However, included in this line is a $4.4 million benefit from reversing the carried interest accrual that I mentioned a moment ago. Excluding the impact of performance fees and carried interest, compensation increased from the prior quarter due to higher variable compensation.
IT and occupancy expenses increased to $81 million due to increased rent and occupancy costs, as well as increased technology spending foreshadowed on recent earnings calls. Some of the 7% increase relates to increased business activities and some of it is seasonal or related to unique and non-recurring projects.
Advertising and promotion increased to $47.5 million, with about 60% of the increase coming from advertising and the balance from sales and promotional expenses that vary with assets under management and sales. Part of the increase in advertising is seasonal, and we usually see decreased advertising spend in the first quarter of our fiscal year. That said, seasonality trends may be changing, as we increase our advertising in international locations, for example, in Germany, Hong Kong and Canada.
Amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased to $46 million. As you may recall, the prior quarter included an impairment loss of $3.4 million. And other expense was about $40 million, including a $3.6 million benefit from a reversal of the carried interest-related expense reported last quarter. Excluding that, increased professional fees this quarter partially offset fees from the legal charge and other carried interest expenses included last quarter. Again, there's a component of this line item that is driven by increases in assets under management.
Other income and expenses was $43 million, an improvement of $70 million from the prior quarter. Consolidated sponsored investment product gains was $2.4 million, representing the mark-to-market increase of the securities held by those sponsored products that are classified as trading on our balance sheet.
Included in this line is a $17.4 million onetime adjustment for certain SIPs that were deconsolidated this quarter. Investment and other income losses was $51 million, an improvement over the prior quarter due primarily to a switch from losses to gains on equity method investments, driven by the rise in global stock market. Also included is an almost $4 million increase from the change in accounting from investments in SIPs.
Interest and dividend income was $13 million for the quarter. Interest expense increased to $10 million, reflecting the first full quarter of interest expense related to the debt offering we completed in May.
And the effective tax rate was 32% for the quarter and 29.9% for the fiscal year, including some non-recurring items. While circumstances may change, our current expectation for that tax rate in 2011 is that it will be between 29% and 30%. Even though market volatility and the adoption of new accounting rules over the past few years have increased quarterly rate volatility, the annual tax rate has ranged between 29% and 30% since 2008. The operating margin for the quarter was 33.3% on a GAAP basis, and we repurchased more than 1.7 million shares this quarter, decreasing ending share outstanding to 224 million. And the Board declared a $0.22 regular dividend. Total cash and investments ended the fiscal year at $6.8 billion.
If I can call your attention to the chart on the bottom left of Slide 20. Over the past four years, total debt is essentially unchanged, while cash and investments have increased by approximately $1.6 billion. And at the same time, shares outstanding have decreased 12%. So a common stockholder at September 30, 2006, now owns 13% more of this company for every share retained.
All told, we further strengthened our balance sheet while returning over $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and repurchases, including $1.5 billion this year.

And as you've said or stated, we do have pockets what would be categorized as alternatives within the firm. And we think we will have more of those type pockets in the future. We've had lot of discussions with a lot of different type of alternative managers and are continuing to do that. And we expect in the next year or so, that we would see some additions to the firm. I think one of our concerns has always been that we want to make sure that, especially whether it's hedge funds or people-intensive businesses, that it's something that has a process that is transferable all and that we can make sure that we're locking up the value that created those returns. So we have been somewhat careful there. And I think another area we've had a lot of conversations around is our strategy has always been generally to own more than 50%. And I think we've recognized that maybe a stepped approach makes more sense when looking at some of the newer alternative managers. So we are looking for minority stakes to build towards majority over time. Another area that we're building out and where you'd hear a lot in the business is around solutions. And to me, it's also in with what we're doing with alternatives. And we have added resources there, and whether it's building more outcome-oriented products, more tactical asset allocation funds, those are all the kind of things that we're building, as well as inflation hedge-type products, where we can bring commodities and have a place to go if rates move up.

But this year, as far as net flows within the non-proprietary channel, we were the top seller on a net basis. And I think number two, on a gross basis. And in terms of distribution outside of the U.S. across the border sales, we were number 1 both on gross and net. So you're not number 1 with everyone of your distributors. But again looking at the entire universe of distribution, we're probably 1 or 2 in most of the nature distributors out there. So I would say that we are extremely well positioned. And not only really gross and net, but we were fortunate to increase market share in fixed income. So it really wasn't just having the right funds and having the big wave come with it. We actually, significantly increased our share in the fixed income space, again, both in the U.S. and offshore and equity as well. And if you look at -- I mentioned rising dividends with Franklin growth bond, which is in the top quartile for the 1, 3, 5 and 10. For us, it really addresses what has been a significant deficiency. As far as our asset concentration, that's gaining market share. So that's positive as well."

I think how we think about it is that we recognize that we need more shelf space on the equity front, and that's something we've been the big pushing very hard over the last two years. And we've debated long and hard about going out and acquiring a firm to fill that. But I think what we realize is that we have it all in-house. And the performance record in Franklin Equity in the last year, 80% of the assets were in the top quartile. That's on top of a very strong long-term performance. So those funds are getting recognition now. And again, we mentioned the 20-20 vision campaign. So we've been out talking about equities in the decade ahead despite the headwinds that we're facing right now. So that's really our strategy is just like it was when equities were selling and fixed income was not doing a lot in inflows. We were out there telling the fixed-income story. So we think it's a great opportunity for us I mean, the distribution, they're not just paid on selling the global bond fund, they're incentives really work around talking about equities and even if it's incremental gains and just getting on a 401(k) platform. That's the goal right now. And really, I mean, in terms of defining that in numbers, I mean, I think that's hard to do but I can tell you, it's been a major priority for distribution to make sure that we're well positioned when it does move. I just don't think it's moving right now."

And as you've said or stated, we do have pockets what would be categorized as alternatives within the firm. And we think we will have more of those type pockets in the future. We've had lot of discussions with a lot of different type of alternative managers and are continuing to do that. And we expect in the next year or so, that we would see some additions to the firm. I think one of our concerns has always been that we want to make sure that, especially whether it's hedge funds or people-intensive businesses, that it's something that has a process that is transferable all and that we can make sure that we're locking up the value that created those returns. So we have been somewhat careful there. And I think another area we've had a lot of conversations around is our strategy has always been generally to own more than 50%. And I think we've recognized that maybe a stepped approach makes more sense when looking at some of the newer alternative managers. So we are looking for minority stakes to build towards majority over time. Another area that we're building out and where you'd hear a lot in the business is around solutions. And to me, it's also in with what we're doing with alternatives. And we have added resources there, and whether it's building more outcome-oriented products, more tactical asset allocation funds, those are all the kind of things that we're building, as well as inflation hedge-type products, where we can bring commodities and have a place to go if rates move up. So that, I think as far as an area that we're the most active in, it would be certainly, in building out that solutions capability. And then within that, bringing in alternative managers to complement that.

And obviously, it's having the right mix and we think is a pretty good marketing and distribution effort behind it. But this year, as far as net flows within the non-proprietary channel, we were the top seller on a net basis. And I think number two, on a gross basis. And in terms of distribution outside of the U.S. across the border sales, we were number 1 both on gross and net. So you're not number 1 with everyone of your distributors. But again looking at the entire universe of distribution, we're probably 1 or 2 in most of the nature distributors out there. So I would say that we are extremely well positioned. And not only really gross and net, but we were fortunate to increase market share in fixed income. So it really wasn't just having the right funds and having the big wave come with it. We actually, significantly increased our share in the fixed income space, again, both in the U.S. and offshore and equity as well. And if you look at -- I mentioned rising dividends with Franklin growth bond, which is in the top quartile for the 1, 3, 5 and 10. For us, it really addresses what has been a significant deficiency. As far as our asset concentration, that's gaining market share. So that's positive as well.

I think how we think about it is that we recognize that we need more shelf space on the equity front, and that's something we've been the big pushing very hard over the last two years. And we've debated long and hard about going out and acquiring a firm to fill that. But I think what we realize is that we have it all in-house. And the performance record in Franklin Equity in the last year, 80% of the assets were in the top quartile. That's on top of a very strong long-term performance. So those funds are getting recognition now. And again, we mentioned the 20-20 vision campaign. So we've been out talking about equities in the decade ahead despite the headwinds that we're facing right now. So that's really our strategy is just like it was when equities were selling and fixed income was not doing a lot in inflows. We were out there telling the fixed-income story. So we think it's a great opportunity for us I mean, the distribution, they're not just paid on selling the global bond fund, they're incentives really work around talking about equities and even if it's incremental gains and just getting on a 401(k) platform. That's the goal right now. And really, I mean, in terms of defining that in numbers, I mean, I think that's hard to do but I can tell you, it's been a major priority for distribution to make sure that we're well positioned when it does move. I just don't think it's moving right now.

We've had a lot of discussions with a lot of different type of alternative managers and are continuing to do that. And we expect in the next year or so, that we would see some additions to the firm. I think one of our concerns has always been that we want to make sure that, especially whether it's hedge funds or people-intensive businesses, that it's something that has a process that is transferable and that we can make sure that we're locking up the value that created those returns. So we have been somewhat careful there. And I think another area we've had a lot of conversations around is our strategy has always been generally to own more than 50%. And I think we've recognized that maybe a stepped approach makes more sense when looking at some of the newer alternative managers. So we are looking for minority stakes to build towards majority over time. Another area that we're building out and it’s a word you hear a lot in the business is around solutions. And to me, it fits also in with what we're doing with alternatives. And we have added resources there, and whether it's building more outcome-oriented products, more tactical asset allocation funds, those are all the kind of things that we're building, as well as inflation hedge-type products, where we can bring commodities and have a place to go if rates move up.

As far as trends, quarter-over-quarter, I mean, I think, I would, other than global bonds, in some case declining outside of the U.S., really looking at global equities in every other category between retail and institutional, I'd say it was very stable as far as the mix. And looking at again, the backlog, in searches, in the pipeline, in the wins and losses, there was nothing really significant over the quarter. A lot of 200, 300 -- $200 million accounts that were funded during the quarter and some that went out as well and both of them in the global equity category, as well as the global ag. And we continue to see a lot of searches, especially in fixed income outside of the United States. We expect to fund some of those in the quarter ahead that we won over this quarter. And it's really the same trends that we've been talking about, I think, over the last probably three or four quarters with regard to the institutional pipeline."

We've had a lot of discussions with a lot of different type of alternative managers and are continuing to do that. And we expect in the next year or so, that we would see some additions to the firm. I think one of our concerns has always been that we want to make sure that, especially whether it's hedge funds or people-intensive businesses, that it's something that has a process that is transferable and that we can make sure that we're locking up the value that created those returns. So we have been somewhat careful there. And I think another area we've had a lot of conversations around is our strategy has always been generally to own more than 50%. And I think we've recognized that maybe a stepped approach makes more sense when looking at some of the newer alternative managers. So we are looking for minority stakes to build towards majority over time. Another area that we're building out and it’s a word you hear a lot in the business is around solutions. And to me, it fits also in with what we're doing with alternatives. And we have added resources there, and whether it's building more outcome-oriented products, more tactical asset allocation funds, those are all the kind of things that we're building, as well as inflation hedge-type products, where we can bring commodities and have a place to go if rates move up. So that, I think as far as an area that we're the most active in, it would be certainly, in building out that solutions capability.

The Asia growth fund is now our top-selling fund on the equity side. And that's run by Dr. Mobius of the Emerging Markets group and has had excellent performance. So really, I don't have the breakdown in front of me between how much of that is coming from Europe versus Asia. But I think the real big movers for us have been in Europe this year as far as net inflows and in Taiwan as well.

I think as we've stated before, we believe it's going to be an important in growing area in our business. It's a natural complement to what we do. And as you've said or stated, we do have pockets what would be categorized as alternatives within the firm. And we think we will have more of those type pockets in the future. We've had lot of discussions with a lot of different type of alternative managers and are continuing to do that. And we expect in the next year or so, that we would see some additions to the firm. I think one of our concerns has always been that we want to make sure that, especially whether it's hedge funds or people-intensive businesses, that it's something that has a process that is transferable all and that we can make sure that we're locking up the value that created those returns. So we have been somewhat careful there. And I think another area we've had a lot of conversations around is our strategy has always been generally to own more than 50%. And I think we've recognized that maybe a stepped approach makes more sense when looking at some of the newer alternative managers. So we are looking for minority stakes to build towards majority over time. Another area that we're building out and where you'd hear a lot in the business is around solutions. And to me, it's also in with what we're doing with alternatives. And we have added resources there, and whether it's building more outcome-oriented products, more tactical asset allocation funds, those are all the kind of things that we're building, as well as inflation hedge-type products, where we can bring commodities and have a place to go if rates move up. So that, I think as far as an area that we're the most active in, it would be certainly, in building out that solutions capability. And then within that, bringing in alternative managers to complement that.

And obviously, it's having the right mix and we think is a pretty good marketing and distribution effort behind it. But this year, as far as net flows within the non-proprietary channel, we were the top seller on a net basis. And I think number two, on a gross basis. And in terms of distribution outside of the U.S. across the border sales, we were number 1 both on gross and net. So you're not number 1 with everyone of your distributors. But again looking at the entire universe of distribution, we're probably 1 or 2 in most of the nature distributors out there. So I would say that we are extremely well positioned. And not only really gross and net, but we were fortunate to increase market share in fixed income. So it really wasn't just having the right funds and having the big wave come with it. We actually, significantly increased our share in the fixed income space, again, both in the U.S. and offshore and equity as well. And if you look at -- I mentioned rising dividends with Franklin growth bond, which is in the top quartile for the 1, 3, 5 and 10. For us, it really addresses what has been a significant deficiency. As far as our asset concentration, that's gaining market share. So that's positive as well.

I think how we think about it is that we recognize that we need more shelf space on the equity front, and that's something we've been the big pushing very hard over the last two years. And we've debated long and hard about going out and acquiring a firm to fill that. But I think what we realize is that we have it all in-house. And the performance record in Franklin Equity in the last year, 80% of the assets were in the top quartile. That's on top of a very strong long-term performance. So those funds are getting recognition now. And again, we mentioned the 20-20 vision campaign. So we've been out talking about equities in the decade ahead despite the headwinds that we're facing right now. So that's really our strategy is just like it was when equities were selling and fixed income was not doing a lot in inflows. We were out there telling the fixed-income story. So we think it's a great opportunity for us I mean, the distribution, they're not just paid on selling the global bond fund, they're incentives really work around talking about equities and even if it's incremental gains and just getting on a 401(k) platform. That's the goal right now. And really, I mean, in terms of defining that in numbers, I mean, I think that's hard to do but I can tell you, it's been a major priority for distribution to make sure that we're well positioned when it does move. I just don't think it's moving right now.

I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. We are pleased to report another solid quarter, highlighted by record net new flows of $17.5 billion, led by a strong increase in",849,"Hello, and welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Commentary for 2010. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. We are pleased to report another solid quarter, highlighted by record net new flows of $17.5 billion, led by a strong increase in retail flows outside the U.S. and a recovery in institutional flows globally. International sales more than tripled from the year-ago quarter and were almost half of total sales this quarter. International assets increased to 28% of total assets under management as of March 31, driven by strong growth in our cross-border SICAV funds that exceeded $80 billion in assets under management at March 31. And most importantly, relative investment performance remains strong with at least 85% of assets in the top 2 Lipper quartiles for the 3-, 5- and 10-year periods.
Turn to AUM. Assets under management ended the quarter at $587 billion, an increase of 6% from the prior quarter and more importantly, up 50% from the prior year. Simple monthly average AUM for the quarter was $551 billion or a 5% increase from the prior quarter. Assets under management via investment objectives shifted towards fixed income at 36% of ending assets under management. Equity is 45% and hybrid, 18%.
Turning to flows. The increase in assets under management was due to market appreciation of $16.5 billion and an 18% increase in the long-term net new flows as a result of increased long-term sales, especially outside of the U.S. 7 of our 10 largest funds had inflows and 45 of our U.S. registered mutual funds had annualized pre-market organic growth of at least 10% this quarter. U.S. long-term sales and redemptions increased slightly from the prior quarter as we continue to benefit from the U.S. retail's investors' preference for fixed-income investments.
The Templeton Global Bond fund was our best-selling U.S. fund with approximately $5 billion in net new flows. Following the free flows, the U.S. equity funds remain in redemption. Global equity flows have turned positive. However, our largest Templeton funds were still in outflows during the quarter, despite strong relative performance. Our U.S. institutional business continues to improve and March was our best month in more than 2 years.
International was the big story for us this quarter with long-term sales increasing 20% from last quarter. Our cross-border SICAV funds had approximately $11 billion in net new flows, led by strong flows in Italy where we are now the second-largest foreign asset manager with assets over $10 billion. These flows tend to be a little bit more volatile over various market cycles.
Non-U.S. investors have been less risk-aversed and we've seen positive equity flows, particularly in our regional equity strategy such as the Asian growth that had over $1 billion in net new flows. Fixed income though remains in favor and the SICAV version of the Templeton Global Bond funds had approximately $5 billion of net new flows, while our global total return and emerging market bond funds also had strong flows.
Turning to flows by investment objective. Equity outflows improved from last quarter on increased sales and decreased redemptions. Global equity had the biggest improvement in net new flows as inflows across Europe and Asia were offset by outflows in the U.S. and Canada. Hybrid products had $1 billion of net new flows led by Franklin Income fund at $300 million in net inflows and its SICAV version at $170 million of net inflows, as well as continued high net worth inflows of $230 million. Fixed income products had another strong quarter with $17.3 billion in net new flows, an 11% increase from the prior quarter and looking at the Templeton Global Bond fund sales for the U.S. and SICAV, it represented approximately 27% of overall growth sales. Tax free also continues to be a good story for us with $1.3 billion in net new flows for the quarter and cash management had outflows of $400 million.
Turning to investment performance. The overall relative investment performance remains strong with at least 85% of assets in top 2 Lipper quartiles with 3-, 5- and 10-year prior periods. Our 1-year numbers flipped a bit, but generally remain strong as short-term relative performance tends to bounce around a bit from period to period and we continue to focus on delivering strong, long-term performance because that's what our clients are looking for.
The biggest change in performance rankings was Mutual Series where our 3 remaining funds slipped into the bottom 2 quartiles for the 1-year period. Mutual Series' absolute 1-year performance is a strong plus 30% to plus 50% for the funds. However, the overweight positions in cash, as we've mentioned on prior calls, has created drag on relative performance. Also, Mutual Series tends to lag momentum-type markets like we've seen over the last year.
We also had a decrease in the 1-year Templeton relative performance and most of that was through the Templeton World fund that represents about 20% of assets in the category and the Templeton World fund just slipped to the 51st percentile. I now turn it over to Ken for operating results."

As a reminder, last quarte",740,"Thanks, Greg. Operating income for the quarter was at $461 million, a slight decrease from last quarter due to seasonal factors such as 2 less days in the quarter.
Net income was $356.7 million and earnings per share was $1.55. As a reminder, last quarter, we adopted a dual share class method of calculating earnings per share that effectively reduces net income by approximately 0.5% to 0.75% of 1% or approximately $0.01 of diluted EPS this quarter.
On Slide 17, investment management fees increased 4%, slightly less than the increase in simple monthly average assets under management, due primarily to 2 less days in the quarter and $3.7 million less in performance fees. The effective fee rate for the quarter was 60.3 basis points, excluding performance fees and adjusting for the number of days in the quarter, and that compares with 59.4 basis points last quarter.
Underwriting and distribution fees increased 2%. While underwriting and distribution expenses increased 4%. Impacting the change from prior quarter was, as previously noted, a non-recurring gain of approximately $3 million included in the first quarter fees. While the impact of net underwriting and distribution fees on operating income was de minimis, several factors impact these lines, as they're primarily based on average net assets and commissionable growth sales.
To complicate matters further, some of the asset-based revenue is computed on a daily basis NAV basis, while the expenses paid to dealers are paid on a monthly basis. So the short quarter had an impact on the margin as well. Shareholder service fees increased by $2 million and that's consistent with the increase in billable accounts. And other net revenue was $8.3 million and included a non-recurring decrease in revenue of $1.4 million.
Slide 18 shows that operating expenses increased 5% from the prior quarter, due primarily to the usual seasonal increases, as well as increased variable expenses in strategic investments, due to improving business conditions. Compensation and benefits increased 7% due to seasonal impact of merit increases awarded in December and increased payroll taxes. Also contributing to the change was increased variable compensation, including the first full quarter impact of performance share awards. This looks like a pretty good run rate for the rest of the fiscal year.
Advertising and promotion expenses increased 9% due to equal increases in marketing support and advertising expenses that were partially offset by lower other expenses. In the first quarter, we launched a new television commercial as part of our Reflections ad campaign that was named Ad Campaign of the Year by Fund Action. I would expect this quarterly amount to increase significantly over the latter half of the fiscal year, possibly approaching levels last seen in 2008.
Amortization and deferred sales commissions was pretty much flat from the prior quarter, due to increases in A and C share classes that were offset by lower B share amortization. And this too looks like a pretty good run rate for next quarter, but I would expect that this line to taper off slightly beginning in the fourth quarter as the B share amortization runs off. Other expenses increased only slightly due to increased consulting and other professional fees.
Turning to Slide 19. Other income net was flat from the prior quarter at $47 million. Consolidated sponsored investment products income was $5.6 million, representing the mark-to-market increase of the securities held by those sponsored products, classified as trading on our balance sheet. Investment in Other income net was $42 million, an increase of $9.5 million from the prior quarter and that was due mostly to increased earnings from equity method, investees and realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains that were partially offset by lower gains on the sale of investments.
Full details will be in our filings as usual. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.5%, due to the decrease in the fiscal year-to-date effective tax rate of 30.3%, which is slightly below the range we were estimating last quarter.
The operating margin on Slide 20 was 32.6% for the quarter. And regarding capital management, we repurchased 1.1 million shares this quarter, decreasing ending shares outstanding to 227.4 million shares. The trailing 12-month payout ratio was 104%. That was elevated slightly, due to the $3 special cash dividend paid in December. In total, cash and investments were approximately $5.7 billion versus $5.4 billion at December 31, 2009. So that concludes my comments, I'll turn it back to Greg."

During the quarter, we were also appointed Investment Manager of the Romanian Property Fund. Assets valued at around EUR 2.4 billion or USD 3.3 billion. However, this mandate is not expected to fund until early July so it is not in this quarter's numbers. As always, thank you for taking time to listen to this commentary.

We have a 20/20 Vision campaign, which has been received extremely well, and despite headwinds we're going to continue to talk about equities because we think that retail turn will happen and obviously, we want to be well-positioned. And I think we feel that we have a very strong lineup. And it's a matter of just again getting the attention on that lineup, and despite the record flows for the quarter, we still are making sure that the distribution is focused on getting that equity story out there. And I'm not sure when it will turn. I think we've all been frustrated that it's taken a bit longer. I think investor sentiment here in the United States for a lot of reasons continues to be a little bit shaky. We're not seeing that in other parts of the globe, we're not seeing that in Europe and Asia and I've seen a tremendous rebound in our sales, like the Asian Growth Fund that had $1.2 billion in net inflows for the quarter. So there are funds that are doing very well on the equity side, but like most in the U.S., we still remain frustrated that the investors are not moving back."

And we've done that in the past, so that's something we're very aware of. But I think that the general statement regarding flows and where we had $10 billion of net inflows was into a global government bond fund. And a government bond fund, obviously, you have tremendous capacity and growing capacity. And then also currency is the other area. So the liquidity of derivatives around currency forwards and things that you have to use in a fund like that, again, it’s one of the most liquid in large markets. So while we have a large share of a new class of flows, it is dwarfed by the overall size of that market. So there's really very little concern. If you had that much going in Emerging Markets Debt, that may be a different discussion on liquidity to consider having to close. I think the question around buyers is an interesting one because I think part of this growth is the recognition, certainly on the retail side, of a new asset class that is less correlated in a way to typical fixed income to equities. It had a very strong overall performance number and obviously, active management is the only way to really play that market. And trying to get currencies right, obviously, is very challenging as well. But we've had a team that has been successful in doing that. And I think looking at the average retail investor, they're more open to putting a portion of their assets in that. So I think that's part of what you're seeing in that class, and it's still a very relatively small number of the typical retail investor's portfolio. So I think that's a good trend that bodes well for continued new investors in that category. And then finally on rates, I think you're a little bit less sensitive to rates and we do -- I mean, obviously, it’s fixed income. Currencies are going to be a big driver, but we also look at duration and are very focused then because it's not as much of an income-oriented fund. We can go a little bit shorter on duration than our typical longer-term maturity fixed income fund. So that helps a little bit. But the bottom line is that it's very challenging to manage in this space. And there are going to be times when you're going to be out of favor and wrong. To us, we're trying to build that into the selling process that, that should be part of your expectation. You're never going to call every move in currencies, but I think we feel like we've got one of the best teams out there."

It's just on a relative basis compared to everything else, it's dwarfed. But the numbers are positive and they are growing. I think just overall from the retail, in terms of general statements, Mutual Series in the U.S. has had outflows. So that's put a little bit of drag on just looking at the U.S. equity numbers.

They're down in the teens and low teens in most cases so you won't have the kind of drag that you had before. And hopefully for us, it's just how historically that group has run money. And in some cases, you're going to have these kinds of periods where they underperform. But again, if you look at the longer-term numbers and how strong they are, I think that's really more important than the 1-year number. And you look at something like the Franklin Income fund, for example, that we had short-term challenges. They’ve had sufficiently higher weightings in financial services. And during the period when financial service banks were in a lot of trouble, that fund underperformed. But quickly, it's really more uplift now in the numbers. And it's back to being a top performer for the 1-year period and that kind of smoothes out over the 3 and 5. And we've seen the quick rebound in flows there. And that was probably one of the most important funds for us as far as flows and continues to be very important to us going forward.

I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. We are pleased to report another solid quarter, highlighted by record net new flows of $17.5 billion, led by a strong increase in",849,"Hello, and welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Commentary for 2010. I'm Greg Johnson, CEO; along with Ken Lewis, our CFO. We are pleased to report another solid quarter, highlighted by record net new flows of $17.5 billion, led by a strong increase in retail flows outside the U.S. and a recovery in institutional flows globally. International sales more than tripled from the year-ago quarter and were almost half of total sales this quarter. International assets increased to 28% of total assets under management as of March 31, driven by strong growth in our cross-border SICAV funds that exceeded $80 billion in assets under management at March 31. And most importantly, relative investment performance remains strong with at least 85% of assets in the top 2 Lipper quartiles for the 3-, 5- and 10-year periods.
Turn to AUM. Assets under management ended the quarter at $587 billion, an increase of 6% from the prior quarter and more importantly, up 50% from the prior year. Simple monthly average AUM for the quarter was $551 billion or a 5% increase from the prior quarter. Assets under management via investment objectives shifted towards fixed income at 36% of ending assets under management. Equity is 45% and hybrid, 18%.
Turning to flows. The increase in assets under management was due to market appreciation of $16.5 billion and an 18% increase in the long-term net new flows as a result of increased long-term sales, especially outside of the U.S. 7 of our 10 largest funds had inflows and 45 of our U.S. registered mutual funds had annualized pre-market organic growth of at least 10% this quarter. U.S. long-term sales and redemptions increased slightly from the prior quarter as we continue to benefit from the U.S. retail's investors' preference for fixed-income investments.
The Templeton Global Bond fund was our best-selling U.S. fund with approximately $5 billion in net new flows. Following the free flows, the U.S. equity funds remain in redemption. Global equity flows have turned positive. However, our largest Templeton funds were still in outflows during the quarter, despite strong relative performance. Our U.S. institutional business continues to improve and March was our best month in more than 2 years.
International was the big story for us this quarter with long-term sales increasing 20% from last quarter. Our cross-border SICAV funds had approximately $11 billion in net new flows, led by strong flows in Italy where we are now the second-largest foreign asset manager with assets over $10 billion. These flows tend to be a little bit more volatile over various market cycles.
Non-U.S. investors have been less risk-aversed and we've seen positive equity flows, particularly in our regional equity strategy such as the Asian growth that had over $1 billion in net new flows. Fixed income though remains in favor and the SICAV version of the Templeton Global Bond funds had approximately $5 billion of net new flows, while our global total return and emerging market bond funds also had strong flows.
Turning to flows by investment objective. Equity outflows improved from last quarter on increased sales and decreased redemptions. Global equity had the biggest improvement in net new flows as inflows across Europe and Asia were offset by outflows in the U.S. and Canada. Hybrid products had $1 billion of net new flows led by Franklin Income fund at $300 million in net inflows and its SICAV version at $170 million of net inflows, as well as continued high net worth inflows of $230 million. Fixed income products had another strong quarter with $17.3 billion in net new flows, an 11% increase from the prior quarter and looking at the Templeton Global Bond fund sales for the U.S. and SICAV, it represented approximately 27% of overall growth sales. Tax free also continues to be a good story for us with $1.3 billion in net new flows for the quarter and cash management had outflows of $400 million.
Turning to investment performance. The overall relative investment performance remains strong with at least 85% of assets in top 2 Lipper quartiles with 3-, 5- and 10-year prior periods. Our 1-year numbers flipped a bit, but generally remain strong as short-term relative performance tends to bounce around a bit from period to period and we continue to focus on delivering strong, long-term performance because that's what our clients are looking for.
The biggest change in performance rankings was Mutual Series where our 3 remaining funds slipped into the bottom 2 quartiles for the 1-year period. Mutual Series' absolute 1-year performance is a strong plus 30% to plus 50% for the funds. However, the overweight positions in cash, as we've mentioned on prior calls, has created drag on relative performance. Also, Mutual Series tends to lag momentum-type markets like we've seen over the last year.
We also had a decrease in the 1-year Templeton relative performance and most of that was through the Templeton World fund that represents about 20% of assets in the category and the Templeton World fund just slipped to the 51st percentile. I now turn it over to Ken for operating results."

Operating income for the quarter was at $461 million, a slight decrease from last quarter due to seasonal factors such as 2 less days in the quarter.Net income was $356.7 million and earnings per share was $1.55. As a reminder, last quarte",740,"Thanks, Greg. Operating income for the quarter was at $461 million, a slight decrease from last quarter due to seasonal factors such as 2 less days in the quarter.
Net income was $356.7 million and earnings per share was $1.55. As a reminder, last quarter, we adopted a dual share class method of calculating earnings per share that effectively reduces net income by approximately 0.5% to 0.75% of 1% or approximately $0.01 of diluted EPS this quarter.
On Slide 17, investment management fees increased 4%, slightly less than the increase in simple monthly average assets under management, due primarily to 2 less days in the quarter and $3.7 million less in performance fees. The effective fee rate for the quarter was 60.3 basis points, excluding performance fees and adjusting for the number of days in the quarter, and that compares with 59.4 basis points last quarter.
Underwriting and distribution fees increased 2%. While underwriting and distribution expenses increased 4%. Impacting the change from prior quarter was, as previously noted, a non-recurring gain of approximately $3 million included in the first quarter fees. While the impact of net underwriting and distribution fees on operating income was de minimis, several factors impact these lines, as they're primarily based on average net assets and commissionable growth sales.
To complicate matters further, some of the asset-based revenue is computed on a daily basis NAV basis, while the expenses paid to dealers are paid on a monthly basis. So the short quarter had an impact on the margin as well. Shareholder service fees increased by $2 million and that's consistent with the increase in billable accounts. And other net revenue was $8.3 million and included a non-recurring decrease in revenue of $1.4 million.
Slide 18 shows that operating expenses increased 5% from the prior quarter, due primarily to the usual seasonal increases, as well as increased variable expenses in strategic investments, due to improving business conditions. Compensation and benefits increased 7% due to seasonal impact of merit increases awarded in December and increased payroll taxes. Also contributing to the change was increased variable compensation, including the first full quarter impact of performance share awards. This looks like a pretty good run rate for the rest of the fiscal year.
Advertising and promotion expenses increased 9% due to equal increases in marketing support and advertising expenses that were partially offset by lower other expenses. In the first quarter, we launched a new television commercial as part of our Reflections ad campaign that was named Ad Campaign of the Year by Fund Action. I would expect this quarterly amount to increase significantly over the latter half of the fiscal year, possibly approaching levels last seen in 2008.
Amortization and deferred sales commissions was pretty much flat from the prior quarter, due to increases in A and C share classes that were offset by lower B share amortization. And this too looks like a pretty good run rate for next quarter, but I would expect that this line to taper off slightly beginning in the fourth quarter as the B share amortization runs off. Other expenses increased only slightly due to increased consulting and other professional fees.
Turning to Slide 19. Other income net was flat from the prior quarter at $47 million. Consolidated sponsored investment products income was $5.6 million, representing the mark-to-market increase of the securities held by those sponsored products, classified as trading on our balance sheet. Investment in Other income net was $42 million, an increase of $9.5 million from the prior quarter and that was due mostly to increased earnings from equity method, investees and realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains that were partially offset by lower gains on the sale of investments.
Full details will be in our filings as usual. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.5%, due to the decrease in the fiscal year-to-date effective tax rate of 30.3%, which is slightly below the range we were estimating last quarter.
The operating margin on Slide 20 was 32.6% for the quarter. And regarding capital management, we repurchased 1.1 million shares this quarter, decreasing ending shares outstanding to 227.4 million shares. The trailing 12-month payout ratio was 104%. That was elevated slightly, due to the $3 special cash dividend paid in December. In total, cash and investments were approximately $5.7 billion versus $5.4 billion at December 31, 2009. So that concludes my comments, I'll turn it back to Greg."

As always, we thank you for taking the time to join us today and we hope you've had a chance to listen to our prepared remarks which were available before the exchange opened this morning.
In short, we were pleased to report another solid quarter, highlighted by continued strong relative investment performance and record net new flows, including strong growth in gross sales across our broad range of offerings, particularly in our international products as momentum continues to build in many countries around the globe. I'd like to now open it up to your questions."

And for the last 3 to 6 months, we've been, while we’re doing extremely well on the fixed income side, we've been out there talking about equities. We have a 20/20 Vision campaign, which has been received extremely well, and despite headwinds we're going to continue to talk about equities because we think that retail turn will happen and obviously, we want to be well-positioned. And I think we feel that we have a very strong lineup. And it's a matter of just again getting the attention on that lineup, and despite the record flows for the quarter, we still are making sure that the distribution is focused on getting that equity story out there. And I'm not sure when it will turn. I think we've all been frustrated that it's taken a bit longer. I think investor sentiment here in the United States for a lot of reasons continues to be a little bit shaky. We're not seeing that in other parts of the globe, we're not seeing that in Europe and Asia and I've seen a tremendous rebound in our sales, like the Asian Growth Fund that had $1.2 billion in net inflows for the quarter. So there are funds that are doing very well on the equity side, but like most in the U.S., we still remain frustrated that the investors are not moving back."

And we've done that in the past, so that's something we're very aware of. But I think that the general statement regarding flows and where we had $10 billion of net inflows was into a global government bond fund. And a government bond fund, obviously, you have tremendous capacity and growing capacity. And then also currency is the other area. So the liquidity of derivatives around currency forwards and things that you have to use in a fund like that, again, it’s one of the most liquid in large markets. So while we have a large share of a new class of flows, it is dwarfed by the overall size of that market. So there's really very little concern. If you had that much going in Emerging Markets Debt, that may be a different discussion on liquidity to consider having to close. I think the question around buyers is an interesting one because I think part of this growth is the recognition, certainly on the retail side, of a new asset class that is less correlated in a way to typical fixed income to equities. It had a very strong overall performance number and obviously, active management is the only way to really play that market. And trying to get currencies right, obviously, is very challenging as well. But we've had a team that has been successful in doing that. And I think looking at the average retail investor, they're more open to putting a portion of their assets in that. So I think that's part of what you're seeing in that class, and it's still a very relatively small number of the typical retail investor's portfolio. So I think that's a good trend that bodes well for continued new investors in that category. And then finally on rates, I think you're a little bit less sensitive to rates and we do -- I mean, obviously, it’s fixed income. Currencies are going to be a big driver, but we also look at duration and are very focused then because it's not as much of an income-oriented fund. We can go a little bit shorter on duration than our typical longer-term maturity fixed income fund. So that helps a little bit. But the bottom line is that it's very challenging to manage in this space. And there are going to be times when you're going to be out of favor and wrong. To us, we're trying to build that into the selling process that, that should be part of your expectation. You're never going to call every move in currencies, but I think we feel like we've got one of the best teams out there."

I think just overall from the retail, in terms of general statements, Mutual Series in the U.S. has had outflows. So that's put a little bit of drag on just looking at the U.S. equity numbers.

Can you possibly just give us some ranges as to how much of that AUM, $97 billion, I believe is institutional-based? And correspondingly, how much of the flows generally come from institutions versus retails? And then just for the follow-up on that, you did a really good job discussing sort of retail, highlighting that it's sort of a new asset class and therefore, the potential is probably better than people think.

I can tell you that the majority, $10 billion of the net flows going into global bond funds split between the U.S. and international sales, obviously, make up the majority of the overall flows. We did have some separate account wins, and I don't have the aggregate number, but there were some at $300 million, $200 million and maybe we can help you further with the Investor Relations group. But I just don't have it broken out in front of me other than to give you the sense that within that category, it clearly is retail that is driving probably 80%, 90% of those flows and that's a guesstimate, but that's probably close."

And you're never going to -- again, you're never going to find that right in the short-term. And that's why we spend a lot of time talking about building 3- and 5- and 10-year track records. And I think people somewhat -- they expect that, but there always is a short-term orientation on results. And I think with the Mutual Series funds, the cash levels are down. They're down in the teens and low teens in most cases so you won't have the kind of drag that you had before. And hopefully for us, it's just how historically that group has run money. And in some cases, you're going to have these kinds of periods where they underperform. But again, if you look at the longer-term numbers and how strong they are, I think that's really more important than the 1-year number. And you look at something like the Franklin Income fund, for example, that we had short-term challenges. They’ve had sufficiently higher weightings in financial services. And during the period when financial service banks were in a lot of trouble, that fund underperformed. But quickly, it's really more uplift now in the numbers. And it's back to being a top performer for the 1-year period and that kind of smoothes out over the 3 and 5. And we've seen the quick rebound in flows there. And that was probably one of the most important funds for us as far as flows and continues to be very important to us going forward. But it shows you how quickly things can turn around on the short-term basis and not really hurt your long-term numbers when you have those little blips."

And I think some of that in this world, having gone through this cycle and risk management and how that becomes more important to the investor to be part of a larger organization. I think does create more smaller situations. And we've had a lot of conversations where that's been an important focus to them, the distribution side.
