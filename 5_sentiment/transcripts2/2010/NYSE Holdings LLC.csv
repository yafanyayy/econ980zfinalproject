Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining yet another quarterly earnings call for NYSE Euronext. I'm going to start on Slide 3, I'm going to cover Slide 3 through to 6, and then I'm going to turn it over Mike for the rest of the presentation, and then will be sure to leave time at the end for your questions.Let me start by saying the following. I think you can see from the results of which we're very proud. It was a solid fourth quarter for us in our full-year '09 results show a trend of improving financial performance, which we think gives a strong momentum going into 2010. You'll see that we're going our Derivative business. We're stabilizing our Cash Equities business and we're providing innovative technology solutions. As we look ahead to 2010 and beyond, we have four core business objectives. Number one, we want to operate the most important set of capital markets in the world. Number two, we want to be innovating across geographies and products with a focus on the customer. Number three, we want to use our infrastructure to build an open platform. And number four, we want to apply technology where possible to lower clients' infrastructure and capital raising costs. I will review our future goals a bit later, but let me first review some highlights from the fourth quarter.In the fourth quarter, we recorded non-GAAP EPS of $0.58 on net revenue of $640 million, reflecting growing earnings power from our new businesses, the benefit of our technology harmonization and our cost-savings initiatives. Fixed cost of $432 million in Q4 including NYFIX were down 9%. Staffing levels declined 14% year-over-year, excluding the edition of NYFIX in December. While NYC Euronext has historically been regarded as an equities exchange, our business has evolved. And today, our technology and Derivatives business make up 48% of net revenues.Let me now touch on a few select business highlights for the quarter. First, our Global Derivatives businesses has performed particularly well in the fourth quarter, registering a 21% increase in net revenue, and 2010 is promising as well with the full year addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing, the semi-mutualization of NYSE Liffe U.S., our AMEX Options business and more favorable macroeconomic conditions for European derivatives. In our European Derivatives business specifically, we experienced very strong January volume levels in our store [ph] complex, volumes we haven't seen since the first quarter of 2008.One of our significant 2009 achievements was the completion of the NYSE Liffe Clearing project that gave us the opportunity to verticalized our Derivatives business as our competitors have done. It has already been a meaningful contributor to the P&L with a full quarter's impact in Q4 '09, and is poised to be a very meaningful contributor to the P&L in 2010. At the end of the year, we closed the deal for semi-mutualized NYSE Liffe U.S. with the sale of a significant minority stake. We are in track to launch interest rate futures coincident with the launch of our joint venture, NYPC, which is pending regulatory approval but we expect to close during the summer. Challenging and incumbent is certainly difficult but with our new partners, we feel we are well positioned to compete. The U.S. Options businesses is another great story. Many of you will remember at the time we bought the Amex in October of 2008, our Arca and Amex options platforms had combined market share of 17% to 18%. The definitive agreement to semi-mutualized, our Amex business is now signed by our partners and is awaiting regulatory approval. We were pleased to achieve almost 25% market share in options at the end of 2009, and we ended January with nearly 28%, the biggest share of U.S. single stock equity options.Second, we have continued to focus on profitability and stabilization of the U.S. business. We plan to begin trading Tape C stocks in NYSE Amex and modernize our floor to better reflect our high-tech, high-touch approach in that market. On the European cash side, market share continues to be stable and we are focused on positioning our business to capture the long-term growth potential of the overall market while diversifying our product and service offering. Clearly, on both fronts, regulatory issues are taking a front-row seat and I'll provide our perspective on these issues on a later slide.Turning to listings, we're very pleased with the efforts of our listings team. We continue to expand our service offering to list of clients and we have taken a leadership role on terms of issuer advocacy. The fourth quarter was the strongest quarter of the year and we are looking to build on that momentum in 2010. Lastly, on the technology solutions side, we closed our acquisition of NYFIX, which gives us another source of revenue that is both stable and sticky. It gives us several hundred buy side connections to integrate into our already-strong global cell site network. The NYFIX integration is going extremely well with most of the headcount reductions coming off in January. Over the next six months, we'll be focused on integrating the NYFIX network into the SFTI network. The conclusion of the NYFIX network and SFTI integration should coincide with the lighting up of our data centers in Mahwah and Basildon. We also just recently crossed the 10,006 channel milestone.Additionally, on the technology side, we recently received word from the Board of the Qatar Exchange that we have the mandate to develop the technology for their derivatives exchange, on top of the work we are already doing for their equity's platform.Please turn to Slide 4. On Slide 4, I'd like to address a few of the regulatory issues that are currently under discussion and also comment on our issuer advocacy efforts. On the slide, you'll see a number of issues, where we are tackling different issues. Participating in important discussions and demonstrating leadership. I will not go through each of these bullets individually this morning, but let me highlight a few important ones. With regard to market structure issue, we believe we have been pragmatic in our approach. While regulators have a number of topics that they're wrestling with, we are focused on having a level playing field between ourselves and other pools of liquidity in terms of the pace of innovation, the rule-making process and the cost of regulation to name a few. The SEC is currently engaged in a market structure review and we are hopeful that any changes they enact will help even out the playing field and raise the regulatory bar for less-regulated trading venues, which we would believe would be to the benefit of investors.In Europe, regulators are embarking on a review of MiFID two years after its implementation. I believe that the regulators in Europe will learn some important lessons from the market fragmentation that resulted from the U.S. deregulation. And as we endeavor to continue to keep our European business stabilized, I am hopeful that the landscape there is not going to turn into something like we have witnessed here in the United States. I am also confident that the debate around critical market structure issues will resonate across the U.S. and Europe. With regard to advocacy, our efforts to advocate for our issuers and be an influence through [ph] our public policy continues to be an important effort of ours. You have undoubtedly seen the political rhetoric coming out of Washington recently, which has unsettled the markets a bit, to say the least. Most of these proposals do not directly affect our business but they do impact our clients. Our view is that we should not let politics and emotions get in the way of good policy. It is critically important that we learn the lessons of the past few years and close the gaps in financial regulation, but at the same time, we cannot let our policy makers get distracted by other issues that were not central to the crisis. And for any of you who listen to me from Davos, that was one of my key messages from there.One specific proposal we have been aggressively leading from the front on is to approach the idea of a stock-transaction tax. We believe this would be harmful to average investors, who would ultimately bear the cost of the tax and we've been sharing that view with anyone who will listen on Capitol Hill.Please turn to Slide 5. On Slide 5, we highlight our 2009 areas of focus and our results. This was accomplishment is tremendous and I would like to thank all of my colleagues for their dedication and hard work that made it possible for us to hit all of these milestones. There are two multi-year technology initiatives in particular that I would like to focus on because of their importance to establishing our seamless, world-class technology infrastructure. These are the migration to UTP and the build out of our two new data centers, which we've talked about with all of you for much of the last two to three years.First on UTP. You will recall that just over two years ago, we had multiple trading systems layered upon systems that could not talk to each other and required prolonged and intensive efforts to implement new functionality. The launch of UTP allowed us to create a single global architecture that will enable us to evolve, adapt, scale and remain competitive. For the first time in our history, we will have a single global platform. This saves us money, improves performance and will allow us to integrate new platforms and functionalities quickly and efficiently. In our European Cash business in Q4 of last year, we successfully migrated SmartPool to UTP and the legacy access infrastructure for customer gateways and market data was decommissioned on December 31. So our European business is complete now with internal matching engine latency as low as 40 microseconds on NYSE Arca Europe. More importantly, all of our European platforms are now on the new technology infrastructure. On the U.S. side, the UTP rollout to NYSE Arca was completed in mid-January and the migration of NYSE Classic, which began in Q3 will continue in early 2010 to further reduce client latency and optimize the trading infrastructure. On the derivative side, development is well underway in order to minimize -- and in order to minimize client disruption and insure a smooth migration to the new data centers, client migration will begin in Q3. Arca options and Amex options, UTP rollout will be complete in Q2. So by the end of 2010, all of our products will either be on the UTP infrastructure or about to be on the UTP infrastructure, and we will enter 2011 for the first time as a company with one single trading infrastructure.Now let's turn to our data centers for a minute. Our data center build out that we undertook last year was not optional. Our objective was not just to replace our existing data centers but also to create the new trading platforms of the future that allow us to provide and develop state-of-the-art technology services and adjacent products. So this is why we've developed our data centers. In the U.S., we will begin the client migration project in June, and to ensure the smoothest process, we will work through the remainder of 2010. In September, we will begin to close down our two other New York area data centers. In Europe, we expect to begin the migration of clients in April with our European derivatives and Cash businesses migrating beginning in September. In summary, 2009 was a transition year in which we established new revenue streams and moved closer to creating a single global platform supported by state-of-the-art data centers. And now that we've achieved this point in our development, we have established the path for the future. Last but not the least for me, please turn to Slide 6. On Slide 6, we highlight our Global business and the key areas of focus for 2010. Each of our three Global businesses, Derivatives, Cash Trading and Listings and Technology and Information Solution, has an important role to play in 2010 helping us deliver against these objectives. While we continue to defend and grow our core franchises in each of these business lines, revenue diversification will also be an important part of our story for 2010. In fact, I believe that we are at an inflection point where we evolve from an expense story to a revenue story, but rest assure we remain keenly focused on increasing operating efficiency and margins. This story will be told through initiatives like NYSE Liffe Clearing, NYFIX, NYC Amex options, NYC Liffe U.S. and new revenue streams coming off our data centers such as co-location. These revenue streams didn't exist for us as recently as two years ago. And we are a long, long way for what this company look like as recently as 2005 when the majority of its revenues came from U.S. cash trading and listings. To help you understand this better, we will be changing our segments with our first quarter 2010 results and we will introduce these new segments on our investor day on March 3, which I think will go a long way towards illustrating the intense evolution in our business model from a traditional equities exchange to a full spectrum trading community. Cash trading remains an important piece of the puzzle but is now less than a quarter of our total revenue. In 2010, you will see us execute on a focused list of deliverables. In derivatives, we will expand our clearing efforts, we will grow our U.S. future's platform and we will continue our leadership position in the U.S. equity single option space. In cash trading and listings, we will enhance our global listings franchise, capture market growth in Europe and increase the profitability of our U.S. Cash business. And in technology and information solutions, we will launch the new data centers, which will service the liquidity hubs of the 21st century, and we will extend our connectivity network while delivering world-class proprietary data solutions. We will provide more details at our Investor Day but in short, everything we have accomplished over the past few years, and which will largely be complete by the end of this year, will allow us to shift attention to growth and give us a platform that we can leverage to provide a full range of services throughout the trade flow process to our customers. We have developed new businesses which will drive revenue growth. we have taken a lot of costs out of the company already but the challenge for us in '10 remains to re-engineer our processes and operations and turn things upside down if we have to in order to find more efficient ways of operating. This will lead to margin expansion and increased operating leverage in the model. We are confident in all of these efforts will translate into increased shareholder value and we look forward to providing you with more clarity into our longer-term strategy at Investor Day on March 3. With that, I'll turn it over to Mike."

GAAP EPS for Q4 was $0.66 versus a loss of $5.06 per share in the year-ago period. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we reported a non-cash pretax goodwill impairment charge of $1.6 billion, primarily related to the merger of NYSE Group and Euronext. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter 2009 was $151 million or $0.58 per share compared to net income of $137 million or $0.52 per share, the fourth quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter of 2009 exclude pretax merger and exit cost and the favorable impact of reversing certain discrete tax reserves, which reached their statute of limitations. Non-GAAP net income for the full-year 2009 was $533 million or $2.04 per share compared to non-GAAP net income of $763 million or $2.87 per share for the full-year of 2008.We have built 2009 as a transitional year when we executed on new initiatives, implemented our technology platforms, lowered our cost base and repositioned the company for growth. We are pleased to report EPS growth as early as this quarter. Our earnings momentum has been building throughout the year. 2010, we continue to look at ways re-engineer our cost base in order to achieve maximum efficiencies. We'll provide more formal fixed cost guidance at our 2010 Investor Day on March 3.Slide 14 details our cash and debt position as of year end. For Q4 2009, our gross debt declined to $119 million to $2.8 billion. This reduction occurred despite the disbursement of $144 million in the quarter to acquire NYFIX. Cash and other financial investments totaled $500 million. $2.8 billion of debt, included $2.2 billion long-term debt at weighted average cost of 5.3%. The remaining $600 million short-term debt consist of commercial paper at an average cost of 0.5%. For the full year, capital purchases and software development were $481 million in which $288 million for building out our data centers.December, the board adopted a quarterly dividend policy. On December 3, we declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the first quarter of 2010, which is payable on March 31. We are currently rated AA by S&P and A2 by Moody's. Our A2 ratings with Moody's is under review since November, and we expert Moody's to revert with the outcome of their review shortly. We are committed to managing our balance sheet and ensuring we have appropriate liquidity and flexibility. In the near term, we are focused on paying down debt with free cash flow generation and monetizing on our [ph] core investments. In Q4 2009, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio declined to 2.6x. As a result of a combination of increased in EBITDA, a reduction in CapEx, we expect to continue to reduce leverage in the coming months.Slide 15 highlights some preliminary guidance on our outlook for 2010. On the whole, we anticipate the momentum we have created in 2009 to continue in 2010, as we return to business to top and bottom line growth. We'll provide greater guidance at our Investor Day when we roll out our new business segments. For now, we offer the following considerations. As noted earlier, January volumes were better than December in all transaction categories and we saw some weakness in U.S. cash when compared to January 2009. All the extreme volatility that we saw this time last year during the height of the crisis anticipated, the regulatory environment remains fluid creating a level of uncertainty in the market.  While we expect pricing to remain competitive, we believe that for the most part, we've seen our core business stabilize both in terms of market share and revenue [indiscernible]. Foreign exchange remains a critical key performance indicator, given the size and scope of our European operations. The recent trend in the euro is something to watch closely. We continue to make good progress with our new initiatives and expect these to generate incremental revenue for the company. We expect 2010 revenue growth to be driven from NYSE Liffe Clearing, NYFIX, Qatar managed services, SFTI [ph] Europe, NYSE Amex Options and NYC Liffe U.S. In 2010, we expect to migrate to our new world-class data centers in Mahwah and Basildon during Q3. As we prepare for the transition, we expect to incur between $40 million and $50 million in incremental expenses in 2010, for duplicate and parallel processing and one-time integration costs. Once the new data centers are up and running, we'll be in a position to close some of the legacy data centers, eliminate the one-time integration costs and report incremental collocation revenues. On a net cost [indiscernible] basis, we expect 2011 costs to be considerably below 2009 net expenses. As for other fixed costs, we expect to realize the full year effect on 2009 staff reductions and have initiated a series of other efforts to re-engineer our workforce and streamline operations. I like to turn it back to Duncan for some closing remarks, and then we'll take your questions."

So in closing, folks, our strong financial results in Q4 and improving results over the course of the year set us up well for 2010. To me, no less important is the fact that we have done everything we said we would do on all of these calls, in 2008 and 2009. I know there were times when many of you thought we had too many initiatives and we're trying to tackle it once. But I would like to think that since we've delivered on everything we outlined that we said we would do, we'd begin to get credit for having change the culture here to one that is focused on delivering and on the customer. After those couple of years of pretty hard work and a number of initiatives, I think you're now hearing that we're within a couple of quarters of completing several of these initiatives that we've been talking about for a long time, namely UTP and the data centers. So the light is clearly at the end of the tunnel. And I think as many of you are aware and in other businesses, anytime you tackle a series of two- to three-year projects, the risk of failing to execute is very high in the beginning and goes down throughout the life of the project. And I think we're now beyond the point of it, it's clearly win.  I think we always believe that at now we think most of you should believe it too, we are very near the end of the road here. We're also redefining what this company is all about, which we hope you can begin to more fully appreciate through our new segment reporting structure. We're not just a cash exchange, we're a multi-asset global exchange with a world-class derivatives exchange, a premier global trading and listings franchise and a world-class commercial technology solutions business. I think the new segments will make it abundantly clear that we are a diversified exchange, and we hope the added transparency will give investors the tools they need to properly assess our performance and the value of each of these businesses. At our core, we are a world-class technology solutions provider using our technology expertise to run markets and to provide services across the tradings spectrum to our clients. It is therefore not by accident that our new deputy CEO, Dominique Cerutti is a Senior Executive from IBM. He's been with us for almost two months, and is already adding tremendous value. I look forward to introducing Dominique and sharing more about the future of our company at the much talked about Investor Day on March 3.

I genuinely believe the European regulators two years post-MiFID are already doing what we really didn't do here, which was re-examined what had happened, what did they anticipate, what did they not anticipate. So I think that alone is fairly healthy. Secondly, in our meetings with them, they're quite aware that -- and it's their firm belief that an outcome like we've had in the U.S. is not what they're looking for. Now part of the reason for that, remember, is there are nationalistic tendencies, I think. Unlike the markets here, where the SEC can decide to regulate the relatively unregulated pools more or less or the same. And whatever they do, they have the ability to bring it all back under their regulatory umbrella. As I think you're aware, the European landscape is quite different. And when the volume migrates away to some of the MTFs, sometimes it also migrates out of that local regulators jurisdiction, which I think has got them very uneasy, particularly in the wake of the crisis. Our belief is that the minimum that will happen is that the playing field will get level. And, for example, it is a little bit confusing to us why we continue to be told that to operate in the markets we want to operate in, we must have a footprint and some infrastructure in each underlying market, yet some of the people with whom we compete don't have that same requirement. So I think consistent with what you've heard us argue for in the U.S., I think we're expecting that the regulators will even out the regulatory burdens that everybody has. I think make it a little more of a fair competition, if you will. And I think because of the regional/national issues in Europe, it's a different ballgame than here. So I think that all leads us to be a lot more optimistic about what the regulators might do upon further review. We're not under any illusion that exchanges are going to be given back there, their monopoly rights. I think that's never going to happen, but I do think it's going to be much easier for us to compete there than it has been in the U.S."

We saw our maintenance capital expenditures, and we've indicated in the past of sort of sub-$200 million. We think it could be even lower than that. It'll probably be 2011 before we get to that level because in 2010, there'll be of a finalization of the data centers cost. So in our guidance, we'll talked a little about CapEx at our Investor Day.

What's a proprietary trade, what's a principal trade, what's a facilitation trade, et cetera. So I think a lot of the banks' activity and a lot of, I believe, the source of profitability comes from the fixed income and currency businesses, not to regulate at equity markets. I actually think for the big banks, the own-account trading for a big bank in the equity markets is actually quite low. And having spent most of my career on that side of the business, the overwhelming majority of the business was in the customer facilitation category. Almost all the principal trading you did was on back of a customer inquiry. So my point was twofold, really. One, it's really hard to separate it. And two, what does it necessarily accomplish if we separate the small fraction of equity volume that these banks do for their own account. I don't really think that it had anything to do with the crisis that we just lived through. So part of my not-so-subtle message is an encouragement of the policymakers to focus on solutions that get at the root cause of the crisis. And I just don't think this is one of them. But to answer the more important part of your question, I think this is a de minimis part of equity trading volume that we get."

Obviously, you can never really predict the pace of regulatory approvals. And because of the nature of this effort, we do have to get approval from the Fed, the SEC and the CFTC. And there's varying degrees of ease or difficulty with each of those hurdles we have to clear. I think the customers are quite supportive of us doing it for obvious reasons because not only does it create competition, but it's also a more capitally efficient clearing model. I think because it's new , as you would expect, it takes a little longer to outline it for the regulators. The technology work that we're collaborating on with DTC is already well underway. We're in the process of searching for a CEO for that enterprise, so we've embarked on a search to do that. So we're working behind the scenes.

Remember our primary product is the short end of the rate curve in Europe, and I think you're correct. The combination of -- we're off to deleveraging lows of a year ago, during the crisis, and the combination of some of the other event-driven stuff that's been going on in Europe specific to some of the jurisdictions you mentioned, has certainly been a factor. But our equity businesses has been strong, and our much smaller commodity business has also been strong. So I think we're benefiting from having the right kind of portfolio right now. The NYSE Liffe U.S. business, on the gold and silver side and the index side, is also contributing a little bit, and that volume continues to grow. I wouldn't say it's moving the needle hugely yet, but those volumes are certainly giving us reason to think that we're on to something there, especially if we can add an interest complex over here. I also think the other thing that's happened is, due to the good efforts of our team, our client base has gotten more diversified and more global in the last year. I think we've gotten better at recognizing that the client opportunities are really around the world. And as we've learned in the equities business, they may not -- your big volume providers and your big customers may not look like they look like five or 10 years ago. And I think that the derivatives team here deserves a lot of credit for having traveled to Asia and other parts of Europe and Latin America and around the U.S. to make sure that we're making our products available to more and more clients around the world. So I think that's also helped us. On the clearing side, part of it is this is the first year that we're going to have the clearing revenues from NYSE Liffe Clearing for the whole year. So that in and of itself, is quite an uptick for us. To go back to Howard's question, we're pretty optimistic that at least in the second half of this year, we're going to be clearing some instruments in the jointly-owned clearing house with DTC. And we've got two or three other conversations going on about other potential clearing initiatives. Some with other clearing venues, some with other partners, et cetera. So I think its anyone's guess as to where that leads, but I think that's going to be a pretty important focus for us going forward. Obviously, the CDS opportunity for us did not turn out to be successful. I don't think we had the right value chain set up. And I don't think we had the right partnership, call it, the organizational construct set up. So I think we've learned from that. And we have a couple of other conversations going on that make me believe that NYSE Liffe Clearing is sort of a growth opportunity in and of itself. But I think we can extend that in NYPC and to other realms as well. So that was what that comment was really alluding to."

There's still some room for growth, obviously, both in terms of overall market volume and in terms of high-frequency trading as a percentage of the market. To be honest, some of the MTFs have been entirely unsuccessful with getting the foothold. There've been a couple of them that have done a good job, partly against us. But to be honest, a lot of it has been against some of the weaker competitors who were in more the same shape as we were in New York two years ago, when our technology platform wasn't up to competitive standards, when we weren't as responsive on the pricing front and so on, that allowed more incursion into their markets. Nonetheless, we're not complacent. It's a developing story, and we're in constant contact with our customers.

Yes, we really like our competitive position. We've got lots of companies in the pipeline. And we're very confident that, although it's a competitive environment, we're going to win more than our fair share. I think the recent record kind of displaced that pretty clearly. I think whether those IPOs are coming from the U.S., whether there's some of the private equity deals that are coming back to market, the ones that were taken private a few years ago, whether they're coming from places like China or Latin America, we're very well positioned in all of those arenas.

So that's all good news. I like the momentum. But you have to remember that -- and Mike can correct me if I'm wrong on this because I don't understand it, but the good news when you get a lot of new IPOs is, obviously, they trade, you get more volume. And that's the revenue that accrues to you immediately. All the other fees from a new IPO that are around the listing are amortized over a fairly lengthy period of time. So even though we'll have a more normal IPO market in '10 than I think we had in all of '08 and the first half of '09, it's not like that you'll notice that in the listings numbers right away.

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining yet another quarterly earnings call for NYSE Euronext. I'm going to start on Slide 3, I'm going to cover Slides 3 through to 6, and then I'm going to turn it over Mike for the rest of the presentation, and then we’ll be sure to leave time at the end for your questions.Let me start by saying the following. I think you can see from the results of which we're very proud, it was a solid fourth quarter for us and our full year '09 results show a trend of improving financial performance, which we think gives us strong momentum going into 2010. You'll see that we're growing our Derivatives business, we're stabilizing our Cash Equities business and we're providing innovative technology solutions. As we look ahead to 2010 and beyond, we have four core business objectives. Number one, we want to operate the most important set of capital markets in the world. Number two, we want to be innovating across geographies and products with a focus on the customer. Number three, we want to use our infrastructure to build an open platform. And number four, we want to apply technology where possible to lower clients' infrastructure and capital raising costs. I will review our future goals a bit later, but let me first review some highlights from the fourth quarter.In the fourth quarter, we recorded non-GAAP EPS of $0.58 on net revenue of $640 million, reflecting growing earnings power from our new businesses, the benefit of our technology harmonization and our cost-savings initiatives. Fixed costs of $432 million in Q4 including NYFIX were down 9%. Staffing levels declined 14% year-over-year, excluding the edition of NYFIX in December. While NYSE Euronext has historically been regarded as an equities exchange, our business has evolved. And today, our technology and Derivatives business make up 48% of net revenues.Let me now touch on a few select business highlights for the quarter. First, our Global Derivatives business has performed particularly well in the fourth quarter, registering a 21% increase in net revenue, and 2010 is promising as well with the full year addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing, the semi-mutualization of NYSE Liffe U.S., our AMEX Options business and more favorable macroeconomic conditions for European derivatives. In our European Derivatives business specifically, we experienced very strong January volume levels in our STIR complex, volumes we haven't seen since the first quarter of 2008.One of our significant 2009 achievements was the completion of the NYSE Liffe Clearing project that gave us the opportunity to verticalized our Derivatives business as our competitors have done. It has already been a meaningful contributor to the P&L with a full quarter's impact in Q4 '09, and is poised to be a very meaningful contributor to the P&L in 2010. At the end of the year, we closed the deal for semi-mutualized NYSE Liffe U.S. with the sale of a significant minority stake. We are in track to launch interest rate futures coincident with the launch of our joint venture, NYPC, which is pending regulatory approval but we expect to close during the summer. Challenging and incumbent is certainly difficult but with our new partners, we feel we are well positioned to compete. The U.S. Options businesses is another great story. Many of you will remember at the time we bought the Amex in October of 2008, our Arca and Amex options platforms had combined market share of 17% to 18%. The definitive agreement to semi-mutualized, our Amex business is now signed by our partners and is awaiting regulatory approval. We were pleased to achieve almost 25% market share in options at the end of 2009, and we ended January with nearly 28%, the biggest share of U.S. single stock equity options.Second, we have continued to focus on profitability and stabilization of the U.S. business. We plan to begin trading Tape C stocks in NYSE Amex and modernize our floor to better reflect our high-tech, high-touch approach in that market. On the European cash side, market share continues to be stable and we are focused on positioning our business to capture the long-term growth potential of the overall market while diversifying our product and service offering. Clearly, on both fronts, regulatory issues are taking a front-row seat and I'll provide our perspective on these issues on a later slide.Turning to listings, we're very pleased with the efforts of our listings team. We continue to expand our service offering to list of clients and we have taken a leadership role on terms of issuer advocacy. The fourth quarter was the strongest quarter of the year and we are looking to build on that momentum in 2010. Lastly, on the technology solutions side, we closed our acquisition of NYFIX, which gives us another source of revenue that is both stable and sticky. It gives us several hundred buy side connections to integrate into our already-strong global cell site network. The NYFIX integration is going extremely well with most of the headcount reductions coming off in January. Over the next six months, we'll be focused on integrating the NYFIX network into the SFTI network. The conclusion of the NYFIX network and SFTI integration should coincide with the lighting up of our data centers in Mahwah and Basildon. We also just recently crossed the 10,006 channel milestone.Additionally, on the technology side, we recently received word from the Board of the Qatar Exchange that we have the mandate to develop the technology for their derivatives exchange, on top of the work we are already doing for their equity's platform.Please turn to Slide 4. On Slide 4, I'd like to address a few of the regulatory issues that are currently under discussion and also comment on our issuer advocacy efforts. On the slide, you'll see a number of issues, where we are tackling different issues. Participating in important discussions and demonstrating leadership. I will not go through each of these bullets individually this morning, but let me highlight a few important ones. With regard to market structure issue, we believe we have been pragmatic in our approach. While regulators have a number of topics that they're wrestling with, we are focused on having a level playing field between ourselves and other pools of liquidity in terms of the pace of innovation, the rule-making process and the cost of regulation to name a few. The SEC is currently engaged in a market structure review and we are hopeful that any changes they enact will help even out the playing field and raise the regulatory bar for less-regulated trading venues, which we would believe would be to the benefit of investors.In Europe, regulators are embarking on a review of MiFID two years after its implementation. I believe that the regulators in Europe will learn some important lessons from the market fragmentation that resulted from the U.S. deregulation. And as we endeavor to continue to keep our European business stabilized, I am hopeful that the landscape there is not going to turn into something like we have witnessed here in the United States. I am also confident that the debate around critical market structure issues will resonate across the U.S. and Europe. With regard to advocacy, our efforts to advocate for our issuers and be an influence through [ph] our public policy continues to be an important effort of ours. You have undoubtedly seen the political rhetoric coming out of Washington recently, which has unsettled the markets a bit, to say the least. Most of these proposals do not directly affect our business but they do impact our clients. Our view is that we should not let politics and emotions get in the way of good policy. It is critically important that we learn the lessons of the past few years and close the gaps in financial regulation, but at the same time, we cannot let our policy makers get distracted by other issues that were not central to the crisis. And for any of you who listen to me from Davos, that was one of my key messages from there.One specific proposal we have been aggressively leading from the front on is to approach the idea of a stock-transaction tax. We believe this would be harmful to average investors, who would ultimately bear the cost of the tax and we've been sharing that view with anyone who will listen on Capitol Hill.Please turn to Slide 5. On Slide 5, we highlight our 2009 areas of focus and our results. This was accomplishment is tremendous and I would like to thank all of my colleagues for their dedication and hard work that made it possible for us to hit all of these milestones. There are two multi-year technology initiatives in particular that I would like to focus on because of their importance to establishing our seamless, world-class technology infrastructure. These are the migration to UTP and the build out of our two new data centers, which we've talked about with all of you for much of the last two to three years.First on UTP. You will recall that just over two years ago, we had multiple trading systems layered upon systems that could not talk to each other and required prolonged and intensive efforts to implement new functionality. The launch of UTP allowed us to create a single global architecture that will enable us to evolve, adapt, scale and remain competitive. For the first time in our history, we will have a single global platform. This saves us money, improves performance and will allow us to integrate new platforms and functionalities quickly and efficiently. In our European Cash business in Q4 of last year, we successfully migrated SmartPool to UTP and the legacy access infrastructure for customer gateways and market data was decommissioned on December 31. So our European business is complete now with internal matching engine latency as low as 40 microseconds on NYSE Arca Europe. More importantly, all of our European platforms are now on the new technology infrastructure. On the U.S. side, the UTP rollout to NYSE Arca was completed in mid-January and the migration of NYSE Classic, which began in Q3 will continue in early 2010 to further reduce client latency and optimize the trading infrastructure. On the derivative side, development is well underway in order to minimize -- and in order to minimize client disruption and insure a smooth migration to the new data centers, client migration will begin in Q3. Arca options and Amex options, UTP rollout will be complete in Q2. So by the end of 2010, all of our products will either be on the UTP infrastructure or about to be on the UTP infrastructure, and we will enter 2011 for the first time as a company with one single trading infrastructure.Now let's turn to our data centers for a minute. Our data center build out that we undertook last year was not optional. Our objective was not just to replace our existing data centers but also to create the new trading platforms of the future that allow us to provide and develop state-of-the-art technology services and adjacent products. So this is why we've developed our data centers. In the U.S., we will begin the client migration project in June, and to ensure the smoothest process, we will work through the remainder of 2010. In September, we will begin to close down our two other New York area data centers. In Europe, we expect to begin the migration of clients in April with our European derivatives and Cash businesses migrating beginning in September. In summary, 2009 was a transition year in which we established new revenue streams and moved closer to creating a single global platform supported by state-of-the-art data centers. And now that we've achieved this point in our development, we have established the path for the future. Last but not the least for me, please turn to Slide 6. On Slide 6, we highlight our Global business and the key areas of focus for 2010. Each of our three Global businesses, Derivatives, Cash Trading and Listings and Technology and Information Solution, has an important role to play in 2010 helping us deliver against these objectives. While we continue to defend and grow our core franchises in each of these business lines, revenue diversification will also be an important part of our story for 2010. In fact, I believe that we are at an inflection point where we evolve from an expense story to a revenue story, but rest assure we remain keenly focused on increasing operating efficiency and margins. This story will be told through initiatives like NYSE Liffe Clearing, NYFIX, NYC Amex options, NYC Liffe U.S. and new revenue streams coming off our data centers such as co-location. These revenue streams didn't exist for us as recently as two years ago. And we are a long, long way for what this company look like as recently as 2005 when the majority of its revenues came from U.S. cash trading and listings. To help you understand this better, we will be changing our segments with our first quarter 2010 results and we will introduce these new segments on our investor day on March 3, which I think will go a long way towards illustrating the intense evolution in our business model from a traditional equities exchange to a full spectrum trading community. Cash trading remains an important piece of the puzzle but is now less than a quarter of our total revenue. In 2010, you will see us execute on a focused list of deliverables. In derivatives, we will expand our clearing efforts, we will grow our U.S. future's platform and we will continue our leadership position in the U.S. equity single option space. In cash trading and listings, we will enhance our global listings franchise, capture market growth in Europe and increase the profitability of our U.S. Cash business. And in technology and information solutions, we will launch the new data centers, which will service the liquidity hubs of the 21st century, and we will extend our connectivity network while delivering world-class proprietary data solutions. We will provide more details at our Investor Day but in short, everything we have accomplished over the past few years, and which will largely be complete by the end of this year, will allow us to shift attention to growth and give us a platform that we can leverage to provide a full range of services throughout the trade flow process to our customers. We have developed new businesses which will drive revenue growth. we have taken a lot of costs out of the company already but the challenge for us in '10 remains to re-engineer our processes and operations and turn things upside down if we have to in order to find more efficient ways of operating. This will lead to margin expansion and increased operating leverage in the model. We are confident in all of these efforts will translate into increased shareholder value and we look forward to providing you with more clarity into our longer-term strategy at Investor Day on March 3. With that, I'll turn it over to Mike."

GAAP EPS for Q4 was $0.66 versus a loss of $5.06 per share in the year-ago period. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we reported a non-cash pretax goodwill impairment charge of $1.6 billion, primarily related to the merger of NYSE Group and Euronext. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter 2009 was $151 million or $0.58 per share compared to net income of $137 million or $0.52 per share, the fourth quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter of 2009 exclude pretax merger and exit cost and the favorable impact of reversing certain discrete tax reserves, which reached their statute of limitations. Non-GAAP net income for the full-year 2009 was $533 million or $2.04 per share compared to non-GAAP net income of $763 million or $2.87 per share for the full-year of 2008.We have built 2009 as a transitional year when we executed on new initiatives, implemented our technology platforms, lowered our cost base and repositioned the company for growth. We are pleased to report EPS growth as early as this quarter. Our earnings momentum has been building throughout the year. 2010, we continue to look at ways re-engineer our cost base in order to achieve maximum efficiencies. We'll provide more formal fixed cost guidance at our 2010 Investor Day on March 3.Slide 14 details our cash and debt position as of year end. For Q4 2009, our gross debt declined to $119 million to $2.8 billion. This reduction occurred despite the disbursement of $144 million in the quarter to acquire NYFIX. Cash and other financial investments totaled $500 million. $2.8 billion of debt, included $2.2 billion long-term debt at weighted average cost of 5.3%. The remaining $600 million short-term debt consist of commercial paper at an average cost of 0.5%. For the full year, capital purchases and software development were $481 million in which $288 million for building out our data centers.December, the board adopted a quarterly dividend policy. On December 3, we declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the first quarter of 2010, which is payable on March 31. We are currently rated AA by S&P and A2 by Moody's. Our A2 ratings with Moody's is under review since November, and we expert Moody's to revert with the outcome of their review shortly. We are committed to managing our balance sheet and ensuring we have appropriate liquidity and flexibility. In the near term, we are focused on paying down debt with free cash flow generation and monetizing non-core investments. In Q4 2009, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio declined to 2.6x. As a result of a combination of increase in EBITDA and reduction in CapEx, we expect to continue to reduce leverage in the coming months.Slide 15 highlights some preliminary guidance on our outlook for 2010. On the whole, we anticipate the momentum we have created in 2009 to continue in 2010, as we return the business to top and bottom line growth. We'll provide greater guidance at our Investor Day when we roll out our new business segments. For now, we offer the following considerations. As noted earlier, January volumes were better than December in all transaction categories and we saw some weakness in U.S. cash when compared to January 2009. While the extreme volatility that we saw this time last year during the height of the crisis has dissipated, the regulatory environment remains fluid creating a level of uncertainty in the market.  While we expect pricing to remain competitive, we believe that for the most part, we've seen our core businesses stabilize both in terms of market share and revenue [indiscernible]. Foreign exchange remains a critical key performance indicator, given the size and scope of our European operations. The recent trend in the euro is something to watch closely. We continue to make good progress with our new initiatives and expect these to generate incremental revenue for the company. We expect 2010 revenue growth to be driven from NYSE Liffe Clearing, NYFIX, Qatar managed services, SFTI Europe, NYSE Amex Options and NYC Liffe U.S. In 2010, we expect to migrate to our new world-class data centers in Mahwah and Basildon during Q3. As we prepare for the transition, we expect to incur between $40 million and $50 million in incremental expenses in 2010, for duplicate and parallel processing and one-time integration costs. Once the new data centers are up and running, we'll be in a position to close some of the legacy data centers, eliminate the one-time integration costs and report incremental collocation revenues. On a net cost [indiscernible] basis, we expect 2011 costs to be considerably below 2009 net expenses. As for other fixed costs, we expect to realize the full year effect on 2009 staff reductions and have initiated a series of other efforts to re-engineer our workforce and streamline operations. I’d like to turn it back to Duncan for some closing remarks, and then we'll take your questions."

So in closing, folks, our strong financial results in Q4 and improving results over the course of the year set us up well for 2010. To me, no less important is the fact that we have done everything we said we would do on all of these calls, in 2008 and 2009. I know there were times when many of you thought we had too many initiatives we were trying to tackle at once. But I would like to think that since we've delivered on everything we outlined that we said we would do, we'd begin to get credit for having changed the culture here to one that is focused on delivering and on the customer. After those couple of years of pretty hard work and a number of initiatives, I think you're now hearing that we're within a couple of quarters of completing several of these initiatives that we've been talking about for a long time, namely UTP and the data centers. So the light is clearly at the end of the tunnel. And I think as many of you are aware, in other businesses anytime you tackle a series of two- to three-year projects, the risk of failure to execute is pretty high in the beginning and goes down throughout the life of the project. And I think we're now beyond the point of if, it's clearly when.  I think we always believe in it; now we think most of you should believe it too, we are very near the end of the road here. And we're also redefining what this company is all about, which we hope you can begin to more fully appreciate through our new segment reporting structure. We're not just a cash exchange, we're a multi-asset global exchange with a world-class derivatives exchange, a premier global trading and listings franchise and a world-class commercial technology solutions business. I think the new segments will make it abundantly clear that we are a diversified exchange, and we hope the added transparency will give investors the tools they need to properly assess our performance and the value of each of these businesses. At our core, we are a world-class technology solutions provider using our technology expertise to run markets and to provide services across the tradings spectrum to our clients. It is therefore not by accident that our new deputy CEO, Dominique Cerutti is a Senior Executive from IBM. He's been with us for almost two months, and is already adding tremendous value. I look forward to introducing Dominique and sharing more about the future of our company at the much talked about Investor Day on March 3. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now open the line to all of you for your questions. Thank you for listening."

I genuinely believe the European regulators two years post-MiFID are already doing what we really didn't do here, which was re-examined what had happened, what did they anticipate, what did they not anticipate. So I think that alone is fairly healthy. Secondly, in our meetings with them, they're quite aware that -- and it's their firm belief that an outcome like we've had in the U.S. is not what they're looking for. Now part of the reason for that, remember, is there are nationalistic tendencies, I think. Unlike the markets here, where the SEC can decide to regulate the relatively unregulated pools more or less or the same. And whatever they do, they have the ability to bring it all back under their regulatory umbrella. As I think you're aware, the European landscape is quite different. And when the volume migrates away to some of the MTFs, sometimes it also migrates out of that local regulators jurisdiction, which I think has got them very uneasy, particularly in the wake of the crisis. Our belief is that the minimum that will happen is that the playing field will get level. And, for example, it is a little bit confusing to us why we continue to be told that to operate in the markets we want to operate in, we must have a footprint and some infrastructure in each underlying market, yet some of the people with whom we compete don't have that same requirement. So I think consistent with what you've heard us argue for in the U.S., I think we're expecting that the regulators will even out the regulatory burdens that everybody has. I think make it a little more of a fair competition, if you will. And I think because of the regional/national issues in Europe, it's a different ballgame than here. So I think that all leads us to be a lot more optimistic about what the regulators might do upon further review. We're not under any illusion that exchanges are going to be given back there, their monopoly rights. I think that's never going to happen, but I do think it's going to be much easier for us to compete there than it has been in the U.S."

There's probably $100 million to $150 million of that cash that is sort of conservative levels of cash balances. So we do it as an exchange, need to keep a certain amount of cash on hand. And so we're getting closer to that level. In terms of capital expenditures, I mean, really the story was that we were trying to communicate that we have this discrete initiative of building these two data centers. We saw our maintenance capital expenditures, and we've indicated in the past of sort of sub-$200 million. We think it could be even lower than that. It'll probably be 2011 before we get to that level because in 2010, there'll be of a finalization of the data centers cost. So in our guidance, we'll talked a little about CapEx at our Investor Day. CapEx will certainly be considerably lower in 2010 than 2009, but we won't be at a maintenance level until 2011."

What's a proprietary trade, what's a principal trade, what's a facilitation trade, et cetera. So I think a lot of the banks' activity and a lot of, I believe, the source of profitability comes from the fixed income and currency businesses, not to regulate at equity markets. I actually think for the big banks, the own-account trading for a big bank in the equity markets is actually quite low. And having spent most of my career on that side of the business, the overwhelming majority of the business was in the customer facilitation category. Almost all the principal trading you did was on back of a customer inquiry. So my point was twofold, really. One, it's really hard to separate it. And two, what does it necessarily accomplish if we separate the small fraction of equity volume that these banks do for their own account. I don't really think that it had anything to do with the crisis that we just lived through. So part of my not-so-subtle message is an encouragement of the policymakers to focus on solutions that get at the root cause of the crisis. And I just don't think this is one of them. But to answer the more important part of your question, I think this is a de minimis part of equity trading volume that we get."

Obviously, you can never really predict the pace of regulatory approvals. And because of the nature of this effort, we do have to get approval from the Fed, the SEC and the CFTC. And there's varying degrees of ease or difficulty with each of those hurdles we have to clear. I think the customers are quite supportive of us doing it for obvious reasons because not only does it create competition, but it's also a more capitally efficient clearing model. I think because it's new , as you would expect, it takes a little longer to outline it for the regulators. The technology work that we're collaborating on with DTC is already well underway. We're in the process of searching for a CEO for that enterprise, so we've embarked on a search to do that. So we're working behind the scenes.

Remember our primary product is the short end of the rate curve in Europe, and I think you're correct. The combination of -- we're off to deleveraging lows of a year ago, during the crisis, and the combination of some of the other event-driven stuff that's been going on in Europe specific to some of the jurisdictions you mentioned, has certainly been a factor. But our equity businesses has been strong, and our much smaller commodity business has also been strong. So I think we're benefiting from having the right kind of portfolio right now. The NYSE Liffe U.S. business, on the gold and silver side and the index side, is also contributing a little bit, and that volume continues to grow. I wouldn't say it's moving the needle hugely yet, but those volumes are certainly giving us reason to think that we're on to something there, especially if we can add an interest complex over here. I also think the other thing that's happened is, due to the good efforts of our team, our client base has gotten more diversified and more global in the last year. I think we've gotten better at recognizing that the client opportunities are really around the world. And as we've learned in the equities business, they may not -- your big volume providers and your big customers may not look like they look like five or 10 years ago. And I think that the derivatives team here deserves a lot of credit for having traveled to Asia and other parts of Europe and Latin America and around the U.S. to make sure that we're making our products available to more and more clients around the world. So I think that's also helped us. On the clearing side, part of it is this is the first year that we're going to have the clearing revenues from NYSE Liffe Clearing for the whole year. So that in and of itself, is quite an uptick for us. To go back to Howard's question, we're pretty optimistic that at least in the second half of this year, we're going to be clearing some instruments in the jointly-owned clearing house with DTC. And we've got two or three other conversations going on about other potential clearing initiatives. Some with other clearing venues, some with other partners, et cetera. So I think its anyone's guess as to where that leads, but I think that's going to be a pretty important focus for us going forward. Obviously, the CDS opportunity for us did not turn out to be successful. I don't think we had the right value chain set up. And I don't think we had the right partnership, call it, the organizational construct set up. So I think we've learned from that. And we have a couple of other conversations going on that make me believe that NYSE Liffe Clearing is sort of a growth opportunity in and of itself. But I think we can extend that in NYPC and to other realms as well. So that was what that comment was really alluding to."

There's still some room for growth, obviously, both in terms of overall market volume and in terms of high-frequency trading as a percentage of the market. To be honest, some of the MTFs have been entirely unsuccessful with getting the foothold. There've been a couple of them that have done a good job, partly against us. But to be honest, a lot of it has been against some of the weaker competitors who were in more the same shape as we were in New York two years ago, when our technology platform wasn't up to competitive standards, when we weren't as responsive on the pricing front and so on, that allowed more incursion into their markets. Nonetheless, we're not complacent. It's a developing story, and we're in constant contact with our customers.

Yes, we really like our competitive position. We've got lots of companies in the pipeline. And we're very confident that, although it's a competitive environment, we're going to win more than our fair share. I think the recent record kind of displaced that pretty clearly. I think whether those IPOs are coming from the U.S., whether there's some of the private equity deals that are coming back to market, the ones that were taken private a few years ago, whether they're coming from places like China or Latin America, we're very well positioned in all of those arenas.

So that's all good news. I like the momentum. But you have to remember that -- and Mike can correct me if I'm wrong on this because I don't understand it, but the good news when you get a lot of new IPOs is, obviously, they trade, you get more volume. And that's the revenue that accrues to you immediately. All the other fees from a new IPO that are around the listing are amortized over a fairly lengthy period of time. So even though we'll have a more normal IPO market in '10 than I think we had in all of '08 and the first half of '09, it's not like that you'll notice that in the listings numbers right away.

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining yet another quarterly earnings call for NYSE Euronext. I'm going to start on Slide 3.

Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining yet another quarterly earnings call for NYSE Euronext. I'm going to start on Slide 3. I'm going to cover Slides 3 through to 6, and then I'm going to turn it over Mike for the rest of the presentation, and then we’ll be sure to leave time at the end for your questions.Let me start by saying the following. I think you can see from the results of which we're very proud, it was a solid fourth quarter for us and our full year '09 results show a trend of improving financial performance, which we think gives us strong momentum going into 2010. You'll see that we're growing our Derivatives business, we're stabilizing our Cash Equities business and we're providing innovative technology solutions. As we look ahead to 2010 and beyond, we have four core business objectives: Number one, we want to operate the most important set of capital markets in the world; number two, we want to be innovating across geographies and products with a focus on the customer; number three, we want to use our infrastructure to build an open platform; and number four, we want to apply technology where possible to lower clients' infrastructure and capital raising costs. I will review our future goals a bit later, but let me first review some highlights from the fourth quarter.In the fourth quarter, we recorded non-GAAP EPS of $0.58 on net revenue of $640 million, reflecting growing earnings power from our new businesses, the benefit of our technology harmonization and our cost-savings initiatives. Fixed cost of $432 million in Q4, including NYFIX, were down 9%. Staffing levels declined 14% year-over-year, excluding the edition of NYFIX in December. While NYSE Euronext has historically been regarded as an equities exchange, our business has evolved. And today, our technology and Derivatives business make up 48% of net revenues.Let me now touch on a few select business highlights for the quarter. First, our Global Derivatives business has performed particularly well in the fourth quarter, registering a 21% increase in net revenue, and 2010 is promising as well with the full year addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing, the semi-mutualization of NYSE Liffe U.S., our A Options business and more favorable macroeconomic conditions for European derivatives. In our European Derivatives business specifically, we experienced very strong January volume levels in our STIR complex, volumes we haven't seen since the first quarter of 2008.One of our significant 2009 achievements was the completion of the NYSE Liffe Clearing project that gave us the opportunity to verticalize our Derivatives business as our competitors have done. It has already been a meaningful contributor to the P&L, with a full quarter's impact in Q4 '09 and is poised to be a very meaningful contributor to the P&L in 2010. At the end of the year, we closed the deal for semi-mutualized NYSE Liffe U.S. with the sale of a significant minority stake. We are in track to launch interest rate futures coincident with the launch of our joint venture, NYPC, which is pending regulatory approval but we expect to close during the summer. Challenging and incumbent is certainly difficult, but with our new partners, we feel we are well-positioned to compete. The U.S. Options businesses is another great story. Many of you will remember at the time we bought the Amex in October of 2008, our Arca and Amex options platforms had combined market share of 17% to 18%. The definitive agreement to semi-mutualize our Amex business is now signed by our partners and is awaiting regulatory approval. We were pleased to achieve almost 25% market share in options at the end of 2009, and we ended January with nearly 28%, the biggest share of U.S. single stock equity options.Second, we have continued to focus on profitability and stabilization of the U.S. business. We plan to begin trading Tape C stocks in NYSE Amex and modernize our floor to better reflect our high-tech, high-touch approach in that market. On the European cash side, market share continues to be stable and we are focused on positioning our business to capture the long-term growth potential of the overall market while diversifying our product and service offering. Clearly, on both fronts, regulatory issues are taking a front-row seat and I'll provide our perspective on these issues on a later slide.Turning to listings, we're very pleased with the efforts of our listings team. We continue to expand our service offering to a list of clients and we have taken a leadership role on terms of issuer advocacy. The fourth quarter was the strongest quarter of the year and we are looking to build on that momentum in 2010. Lastly, on the technology solutions side, we closed our acquisition of NYFIX, which gives us another source of revenue that is both stable and sticky. It gives us several hundred buy side connections to integrate into our already-strong global cell site network. The NYFIX integration is going extremely well, with most of the headcount reductions coming off in January. Over the next six months, we'll be focused on integrating the NYFIX network into the SFTI network. The conclusion of the NYFIX network and SFTI integration should coincide with the lighting up of our data centers in Mahwah and Basildon. We also just recently crossed the 10,006 channel milestone.Additionally, on the technology side, we recently received word from the Board of the Qatar Exchange that we have the mandate to develop the technology for their derivatives exchange on top of the work we are already doing for their equities platform.Please turn to Slide 4. On Slide 4, I'd like to address a few of the regulatory issues that are currently under discussion, and also comment on our issuer advocacy efforts. On the slide, you'll see a number of issues where we are tackling different issues, participating in important discussions and demonstrating leadership. I will not go through each of these bullets individually this morning, but let me highlight a few important ones. With regard to market structure issue, we believe we have been pragmatic in our approach. While regulators have a number of topics that they're wrestling with, we are focused on having a level playing field between ourselves and other pools of liquidity in terms of the pace of innovation, the rule-making process and the cost of regulation to name a few. The SEC is currently engaged in a market structure review and we are hopeful that any changes they enact will help even out the playing field and raise the regulatory bar for less-regulated trading venues, which we would believe would be to the benefit of investors.In Europe, regulators are embarking on a review of MiFID two years after its implementation. I believe that the regulators in Europe will learn some important lessons from the market fragmentation that resulted from the U.S. deregulation. And as we endeavor to continue to keep our European business stabilized, I am hopeful that the landscape there is not going to turn into something like we have witnessed here in the United States. I am also confident that the debate around critical market structure issues will resonate across the U.S. and Europe. With regard to advocacy, our efforts to advocate for our issuers and be an influence through our public policy continues to be an important effort of ours. You have undoubtedly seen the political rhetoric coming out of Washington recently, which has unsettled the markets a bit to say the least. Most of these proposals do not directly affect our business but they do impact our clients. Our view is that we should not let politics and emotions get in the way of good policy. It is critically important that we learn the lessons of the past few years and close the gaps in financial regulation, but at the same time, we cannot let our policy makers get distracted by other issues that were not central to the crisis. And for any of you who listen to me from Davos, that was one of my key messages from there.One specific proposal we have been aggressively leading from the front on is to approach the idea of a stock-transaction tax. We believe this would be harmful to average investors who would ultimately bear the cost of the tax, and we've been sharing that view with anyone who will listen on Capitol Hill.Please turn to Slide 5. On Slide 5, we highlight our 2009 areas of focus and our results. This accomplishment is tremendous and I would like to thank all of my colleagues for their dedication and hard work that made it possible for us to hit all of these milestones. There are two multi-year technology initiatives in particular that I would like to focus on because of their importance to establishing our seamless, world-class technology infrastructure. These are the migration to UTP and the build out of our two new data centers, which we've talked about with all of you for much of the last two to three years.First, on UTP. You will recall that just over two years ago, we had multiple trading systems layered upon systems that could not talk to each other and required prolonged and intensive efforts to implement new functionality. The launch of UTP allowed us to create a single global architecture that will enable us to evolve, adapt, scale and remain competitive. For the first time in our history, we will have a single global platform. This saves us money, improves performance and will allow us to integrate new platforms and functionalities quickly and efficiently. In our European Cash business in Q4 of last year, we successfully migrated SmartPool to UTP, and the legacy access infrastructure for customer gateways and market data was decommissioned on December 31. So our European business is complete now, with internal matching engine latency as low as 40 microseconds on NYSE Arca Europe. More importantly, all of our European platforms are now on the new technology infrastructure. On the U.S. side, the UTP rollout to NYSE Arca was completed in mid-January, and the migration of NYSE Classic which began in Q3 will continue in early 2010 to further reduce client latency and optimize the trading infrastructure. On the derivatives side, development is well underway in order to minimize -- and in order to minimize client disruption and insure a smooth migration to the new data centers, client migration will begin in Q3. Arca Options and Amex Options, UTP rollout will be complete in Q2. So by the end of 2010, all of our products will either be on the UTP infrastructure or about to be on the UTP infrastructure, and we will enter 2011 for the first time as a company with one single trading infrastructure.Now let's turn to our data centers for a minute. Our data center buildout that we undertook last year was not optional. Our objective was not just to replace our existing data centers but also to create the new trading platforms of the future that allow us to provide and develop state-of-the-art technology services and adjacent products. So this is why we've developed our data centers. In the U.S., we will begin the client migration project in June, and to ensure the smoothest process, we will work through the remainder of 2010. In September, we will begin to close down our two other New York area data centers. In Europe, we expect to begin the migration of clients in April with our European Derivatives and Cash businesses migrating beginning in September. In summary, 2009 was a transition year in which we established new revenue streams and moved closer to creating a single global platform supported by state-of-the-art data centers. And now that we've achieved this point in our development, we have established the path for the future. Last but not the least for me, please turn to Slide 6. On Slide 6, we highlight our Global business and the key areas of focus for 2010. Each of our three Global businesses, Derivatives, Cash Trading and Listings and Technology and Information Solutions, has an important role to play in 2010, helping us deliver against these objectives. While we continue to defend and grow our core franchises in each of these business lines, revenue diversification will also be an important part of our story for 2010. In fact, I believe that we are at an inflection point where we evolve from an expense story to a revenue story, but rest assure we remain keenly focused on increasing operating efficiency and margins. This story will be told through initiatives like NYSE Liffe Clearing, NYFIX, NYSE Amex Options, NYSE Liffe U.S. and new revenue streams coming off our data center such as co-location. These revenue streams didn't exist for us as recently as two years ago, and we are a long, long way for what this company look like as recently as 2005, when the majority of its revenues came from U.S. cash trading and listings. To help you understand this better, we will be changing our segments with our first quarter 2010 results and we will introduce these new segments at our Investor Day on March 3, which I think will go a long way towards illustrating the intense evolution in our business model from a traditional equities exchange to a full spectrum trading community. Cash trading remains an important piece of the puzzle but is now less than a quarter of our total revenue. In 2010, you will see us execute on a focused list of deliverables. In derivatives, we will expand our clearing efforts, we will grow our U.S. future's platform and we will continue our leadership position in the U.S. equity single option space. In cash trading and listings, we will enhance our global listings franchise, capture market growth in Europe and increase the profitability of our U.S. Cash business. And in technology and information solutions, we will launch the new data centers, which will service the liquidity hubs of the 21st century, and we will extend our connectivity network while delivering world-class proprietary data solutions. We will provide more details at our Investor Day, but in short, everything we have accomplished over the past few years, and which will largely be complete by the end of this year, will allow us to shift attention to growth and give us a platform that we can leverage to provide a full range of services throughout the trade flow process to our customers. We have developed new businesses which will drive revenue growth. We have taken a lot of costs out of the company already, but the challenge for us in '10 remains to re-engineer our processes and operations and turn things upside down if we have to in order to find more efficient ways of operating. This will lead to margin expansion and increased operating leverage in the model. We are confident that all of these efforts will translate into increased shareholder value, and we look forward to providing you with more clarity into our longer-term strategy at Investor Day on March 3. With that, I'll turn it over to Mike."

Slide 8 provides our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year. GAAP EPS for Q4 was $0.66 versus a loss of $5.06 per share in the year-ago period. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we reported a",2353,"Thank you, Duncan, and good morning, everyone. Slide 8 provides our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year. GAAP EPS for Q4 was $0.66 versus a loss of $5.06 per share in the year-ago period. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we reported a non-cash pretax goodwill impairment charge of $1.6 billion, primarily related to the merger of NYSE Group and Euronext. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter of 2009 was $151 million or $0.58 per share compared to the net income of $137 million or $0.52 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter of 2009 exclude pretax merger and exit cost and the favorable impact of reversing certain discrete tax reserves, which reached their statute of limitations. Non-GAAP net income for the full-year 2009 was $533 million or $2.04 per share compared to non-GAAP net income of $763 million or $2.87 per share for the full-year of 2008.We have built 2009 as a transitional year where we executed on new initiatives, implemented our technology platforms, lowered our cost base and repositioned the company for growth. We are pleased to report EPS growth as early as this quarter. Our earnings momentum has been building throughout the year.  The fourth quarter of 2009 marked the third consecutive quarterly increase in both net revenues and earnings per share for the company.On a non-GAAP basis, gross revenues were $1 billion, down 14% versus Q4 of 2008, and down 3% versus Q3 2009. Gross revenues were negatively impacted by a decline in global cash equity volume, most notably versus October of last year when the financial crisis resulted in record volume, but also from pricing changes across our European and U.S. Cash businesses. Net revenues for the quarter declined 6% compared to Q4 2008, but were 3% versus Q3 2009. The increase in net revenue versus the third quarter of 2009 was driven by NYSE Liffe Clearing's contribution of $23 million in it's first full quarter of operations, increased software and technology sales and the $8 million in revenue recognized from one month of operations from NYFIX, which is acquired in November 30. This was partially offset by the decline in cash equities and lower market data revenue.Fixed operating costs were $432 million for the quarter, down 9% versus the year-ago period and up $1 million on the prior quarter. The increase versus the third quarter of 2009 was attributable to $6 million of incremental expenses from the NYFIX acquisition and the incremental $5 million of cost related to the first full quarter of NYSE Liffe Clearing. This was partially offset by a $9 million reduction in compensation and benefits as we continue to make progress on the European social plan and U.S. VRIP.The decline in expenses versus the fourth quarter of 2008 was due to increased efficiencies and synergies related to the Amex acquisition and a 14% year-over-year reduction in staffing, excluding NYFIX, resulting in $29 million of lower compensation expense. Operating income for the quarter was $210 million, flat with the fourth quarter of 2008 and up $13 million versus Q3 2009. Non-operating income was favorable as a result of an $8 million special dividend from LCH.Clearnet and the impact of the sale of a minority stake in Liffe U.S. This long-negotiated transaction was effective as of January 2009, which resulted in the sharing of 2009 full-year investment losses with our new partners. This amount is included in the non-controlling interest line on the income statement. On Slide 9, we show our fourth quarter revenue by both product line and geography. The company continued to diversify its revenues. 50% of our net revenues came from trading activities in the fourth quarter. This compares to 55% in Q4 2008. Net revenues are above Q3, driven primarily by new initiatives and growth in listing revenues. When compared to Q4 2008, net trading revenues were negatively impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar, lower net capture rates for the European cash markets and lower cash volumes.Global Derivative trading was 28% of the company's net revenue for the quarter and continues to be the largest net revenue contributor by business activity. Software and technology revenues were up versus last year due to the acquisition of NYFIX, higher software sales in the quarter and contribution of SFTI Europe where we now have over 100 companies connected. The increase in other revenues year-over-year is attributable primarily to BlueNext, our Carbon Emission Trading business and treasury income earned in connection with the in sourcing of the NYSE Liffe Clearing business. On a geographical perspective, our European operations continue to represent the majority of our net revenue base, generating 53% of our net revenues for Q4 2009. This is down slightly versus Q3 2009 and Q4 prior year. At our Investor Day on March 3 and for each quarter beginning with Q1 2010, we'll be reporting our revenues in the three global business segments. Slide 10 shows the quarterly volume trends for our major trading operations. Q4 volumes were higher than prior quarter with Derivatives, U.S. Options and European cash, while declining for U.S. cash. Versus prior year, volumes rose across our derivative platforms and declined in our cash market, mostly attributed to the record volumes reported in the prior-year fourth quarter amidst the financial crisis. The NYSE Liffe Derivative business was up 11% versus Q4 2008 and 7% versus Q3 2009. The increase has resulted from growth in both the LIFFE CONNECT platform as well Bclear. Each are broken out separately for you in the chart. While Bclear is offered at lower price levels and subject to price cap, we now realize clearing revenue on these volumes as well. Volume growth for U.S. derivatives year-over-year was fueled by the announcement to semi-mutualized our Amex Options business and the expansion of the Penny Pilot program at Arca Options. Since we acquired Amex in Q4 2008, our market share has grown from 6% at deal closing to 10% in the fourth quarter of 2009. NYSE Group's U.S. options exchange accounted for 24.9% of the total consolidated equity options trading at December 2009, up from 17.4% in December 2008. Figure rose to nearly 28% in January 2010, representing the fifth consecutive monthly increase in market share for our U.S. options exchanges, and positioned us as number one in the U.S. equity option market for that period.Volumes in the U.S. Cash business declined year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. However, market share on NYSE Classic has increased to 26% in the fourth quarter, above the 23% recorded in Q3 2009. This has been aided by the increased Supplemental Liquidity Provider's participation on the platform. SLP participation was nearly 11% in the fourth quarter, the highest quarter since the inception of the program. Although ADV was up slightly this quarter in our European cash market, market share remains stable at around 75%. We remain optimistic for market volume growth over time as new participants enter the market. Yesterday, we issued our volume statistics for January 2010. On the whole, the year is off to a solid start, with January volumes exceeding Q4 ADV levels for all four venues. U.S. cash volumes remain sluggish versus prior-year level. However, U.S. and European derivatives were up 32% and 102%, respectively.Slide 11 shows the annual volume trends for our major trading operation. We experienced year-over-year growth on our derivative platforms, but saw a sequential decline in both U.S. and European cash. However, it's important to reiterate that 2008 was the year of extreme volatility and many asset classes around the globe experienced record-trading volumes. We believe we've done a good job during the year stabilizing our cash equity franchises and our natural beneficiaries from an increasing overall market volumes.Slide 12 provides the split of liquidity, routing and clearing fees and revenue capture between our U.S. and European businesses. For European net revenues, the chart also shows comparative currency neutral trading results. Despite lower volumes, U.S. net revenue increased in the fourth quarter as a result of increased higher net pricing. Steadily improving revenue captured throughout 2009 has stabilized U.S. cash equities' net trading revenues. U.S. derivatives revenues increased $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, and increased $4 million from the third quarter of 2009 due to the increase in market share, which rose 670 and 460 basis points, respectively. This increase in market share is derived from both our Amex and Arca Options businesses. Net revenue for European derivatives is down 4% versus prior quarter and up 23% versus Q4 2008. In the fourth quarter, European derivatives net revenues benefited from a full quarter's worth of NYSE Liffe Clearing revenue totaling $23 million. Compared to the third quarter of 2009, net revenues were down due to higher liquidity came in the fourth quarter. European cash revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009 was significantly below fourth quarter 2008 levels due to volumes that were up of 17%, as well as revenue capture that declined 32% due to pricing changes that we made during the past year. Versus Q3 2009, European cash net revenues were flat and volumes that were down 1%, with the average rate per trade holding steady at $0.93 for the past three quarters.Slide 13 provides a harmonized view of operating expenses. This chart reconciles our operating expenses, segregating the effects of foreign currency variations, portfolio changes and one-time IT integration costs. This is consistent with our 2009 expense guidance and synergy projections. On an adjusted basis, underlying fixed costs continue to decline throughout 2009. Q4 reported expenses declined $41 million versus last year. After adjusting for foreign exchange variations, incremental spending for new business initiatives, like NYSE Liffe Clearing and NYFIX, duplicate data center expenditures, fixed operating expenses, declined $74 million or 16% versus the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year, adjusted fixed operating costs were lowered by $195 million or 11% compared to the prior-year period. Since the Euronext merger in 2007, on a constant portfolio constant exchange rate basis, we've achieved over $490 million in aggregate cost savings. We are pleased with the progress we've made on the cost front in 2009. We came in below the full-year 2008 level of $1.74 billion, and also outperformed our fixed cost guidance provided earlier this year of $1.728 billion. 2010, we continue to look at ways re-engineer our cost base in order to achieve maximum efficiencies. We'll provide more formal fixed cost guidance at our 2010 Investor Day on March 3.Slide 14 details our cash and debt position as of year end. For Q4 2009, our gross debt declined to $119 million to $2.8 billion. This reduction occurred despite the disbursement of $144 million in the quarter to acquire NYFIX. Cash and other financial investments totaled $500 million. $2.8 billion of debt, included $2.2 billion long-term debt at weighted average cost of 5.3%. The remaining $600 million short-term debt consist of commercial paper at an average cost of 0.5%. For the full year, capital purchases and software development were $481 million in which $288 million for building out our data centers.December, the board adopted a quarterly dividend policy. On December 3, we declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the first quarter of 2010, which is payable on March 31. We are currently rated AA by S&P and A2 by Moody's. Our A2 ratings with Moody's is under review since November, and we expert Moody's to revert with the outcome of their review shortly. We are committed to managing our balance sheet and ensuring we have appropriate liquidity and flexibility. In the near term, we are focused on paying down debt with free cash flow generation and monetizing non-core investments. In Q4 2009, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio declined to 2.6x. As a result of a combination of increase in EBITDA and reduction in CapEx, we expect to continue to reduce leverage in the coming months.Slide 15 highlights some preliminary guidance on our outlook for 2010. On the whole, we anticipate the momentum we have created in 2009 to continue in 2010, as we return the business to top and bottom line growth. We'll provide greater guidance at our Investor Day when we roll out our new business segments. For now, we offer the following considerations. As noted earlier, January volumes were better than December in all transaction categories and we saw some weakness in U.S. cash when compared to January 2009. While the extreme volatility that we saw this time last year during the height of the crisis has dissipated, the regulatory environment remains fluid creating a level of uncertainty in the market.  While we expect pricing to remain competitive, we believe that for the most part, we've seen our core businesses stabilize both in terms of market share and revenue [indiscernible]. Foreign exchange remains a critical key performance indicator, given the size and scope of our European operations. The recent trend in the euro is something to watch closely. We continue to make good progress with our new initiatives and expect these to generate incremental revenue for the company. We expect 2010 revenue growth to be driven from NYSE Liffe Clearing, NYFIX, Qatar managed services, SFTI Europe, NYSE Amex Options and NYC Liffe U.S. In 2010, we expect to migrate to our new world-class data centers in Mahwah and Basildon during Q3. As we prepare for the transition, we expect to incur between $40 million and $50 million in incremental expenses in 2010, for duplicate and parallel processing and one-time integration costs. Once the new data centers are up and running, we'll be in a position to close some of the legacy data centers, eliminate the one-time integration costs and report incremental collocation revenues. On a net cost [indiscernible] basis, we expect 2011 costs to be considerably below 2009 net expenses. As for other fixed costs, we expect to realize the full year effect on 2009 staff reductions and have initiated a series of other efforts to re-engineer our workforce and streamline operations. I’d like to turn it back to Duncan for some closing remarks, and then we'll take your questions."

So in closing, folks, our strong financial results in Q4 and improving results over the course of the year set us up well for 2010. To me, no less important is the fact that we have done everything we said we would do on all of these calls, in 2008 and 2009. I know there were times when many of you thought we had too many initiatives we were trying to tackle at once. But I would like to think that since we've delivered on everything we outlined that we said we would do, we'd begin to get credit for having changed the culture here to one that is focused on delivering and on the customer. After those couple of years of pretty hard work and a number of initiatives, I think you're now hearing that we're within a couple of quarters of completing several of these initiatives that we've been talking about for a long time, namely UTP and the data centers. So the light is clearly at the end of the tunnel. And I think as many of you are aware, in other businesses anytime you tackle a series of two- to three-year projects, the risk of failure to execute is pretty high in the beginning and goes down throughout the life of the project. And I think we're now beyond the point of if, it's clearly when.  I think we always believe in it; now we think most of you should believe it too, we are very near the end of the road here. And we're also redefining what this company is all about, which we hope you can begin to more fully appreciate through our new segment reporting structure. We're not just a cash exchange, we're a multi-asset global exchange with a world-class derivatives exchange, a premier global trading and listings franchise and a world-class commercial technology solutions business. I think the new segments will make it abundantly clear that we are a diversified exchange, and we hope the added transparency will give investors the tools they need to properly assess our performance and the value of each of these businesses. At our core, we are a world-class technology solutions provider using our technology expertise to run markets and to provide services across the tradings spectrum to our clients. It is therefore not by accident that our new deputy CEO, Dominique Cerutti is a Senior Executive from IBM. He's been with us for almost two months, and is already adding tremendous value. I look forward to introducing Dominique and sharing more about the future of our company at the much talked about Investor Day on March 3. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now open the line to all of you for your questions. Thank you for listening."

I genuinely believe the European regulators two years post-MiFID are already doing what we really didn't do here, which was re-examined what had happened, what did they anticipate, what did they not anticipate. So I think that alone is fairly healthy. Secondly, in our meetings with them, they're quite aware that -- and it's their firm belief that an outcome like we've had in the U.S. is not what they're looking for. Now part of the reason for that, remember, is there are nationalistic tendencies, I think. Unlike the markets here, where the SEC can decide to regulate the relatively unregulated pools more or less or the same. And whatever they do, they have the ability to bring it all back under their regulatory umbrella. As I think you're aware, the European landscape is quite different. And when the volume migrates away to some of the MTFs, sometimes it also migrates out of that local regulators jurisdiction, which I think has got them very uneasy, particularly in the wake of the crisis. Our belief is that the minimum that will happen is that the playing field will get level. And, for example, it is a little bit confusing to us why we continue to be told that to operate in the markets we want to operate in, we must have a footprint and some infrastructure in each underlying market, yet some of the people with whom we compete don't have that same requirement. So I think consistent with what you've heard us argue for in the U.S., I think we're expecting that the regulators will even out the regulatory burdens that everybody has. I think make it a little more of a fair competition, if you will. And I think because of the regional/national issues in Europe, it's a different ballgame than here. So I think that all leads us to be a lot more optimistic about what the regulators might do upon further review. We're not under any illusion that exchanges are going to be given back there, their monopoly rights. I think that's never going to happen, but I do think it's going to be much easier for us to compete there than it has been in the U.S."

What's a proprietary trade, what's a principal trade, what's a facilitation trade, et cetera. So I think a lot of the banks' activity and a lot of, I believe, the source of profitability comes from the fixed income and currency businesses, not to regulate at equity markets. I actually think for the big banks, the own-account trading for a big bank in the equity markets is actually quite low. And having spent most of my career on that side of the business, the overwhelming majority of the business was in the customer facilitation category. Almost all the principal trading you did was on back of a customer inquiry. So my point was twofold, really. One, it's really hard to separate it. And two, what does it necessarily accomplish if we separate the small fraction of equity volume that these banks do for their own account. I don't really think that it had anything to do with the crisis that we just lived through. So part of my not-so-subtle message is an encouragement of the policymakers to focus on solutions that get at the root cause of the crisis. And I just don't think this is one of them.

Obviously, you can never really predict the pace of regulatory approvals. And because of the nature of this effort, we do have to get approval from the Fed, the SEC and the CFTC. And there's varying degrees of ease or difficulty with each of those hurdles we have to clear. I think the customers are quite supportive of us doing it for obvious reasons because not only does it create competition, but it's also a more capitally efficient clearing model. I think because it's new , as you would expect, it takes a little longer to outline it for the regulators. The technology work that we're collaborating on with DTC is already well underway.

Remember our primary product is the short end of the rate curve in Europe, and I think you're correct. The combination of -- we're off to deleveraging lows of a year ago, during the crisis, and the combination of some of the other event-driven stuff that's been going on in Europe specific to some of the jurisdictions you mentioned, has certainly been a factor. But our equity businesses has been strong, and our much smaller commodity business has also been strong. So I think we're benefiting from having the right kind of portfolio right now. The NYSE Liffe U.S. business, on the gold and silver side and the index side, is also contributing a little bit, and that volume continues to grow. I wouldn't say it's moving the needle hugely yet, but those volumes are certainly giving us reason to think that we're on to something there, especially if we can add an interest complex over here. I also think the other thing that's happened is, due to the good efforts of our team, our client base has gotten more diversified and more global in the last year. I think we've gotten better at recognizing that the client opportunities are really around the world. And as we've learned in the equities business, they may not -- your big volume providers and your big customers may not look like they look like five or 10 years ago. And I think that the derivatives team here deserves a lot of credit for having traveled to Asia and other parts of Europe and Latin America and around the U.S. to make sure that we're making our products available to more and more clients around the world. So I think that's also helped us. On the clearing side, part of it is this is the first year that we're going to have the clearing revenues from NYSE Liffe Clearing for the whole year. So that in and of itself, is quite an uptick for us. To go back to Howard's question, we're pretty optimistic that at least in the second half of this year, we're going to be clearing some instruments in the jointly-owned clearing house with DTC. And we've got two or three other conversations going on about other potential clearing initiatives. Some with other clearing venues, some with other partners, et cetera. So I think its anyone's guess as to where that leads, but I think that's going to be a pretty important focus for us going forward. Obviously, the CDS opportunity for us did not turn out to be successful. I don't think we had the right value chain set up. And I don't think we had the right partnership, call it, the organizational construct set up. So I think we've learned from that. And we have a couple of other conversations going on that make me believe that NYSE Liffe Clearing is sort of a growth opportunity in and of itself. But I think we can extend that in NYPC and to other realms as well. So that was what that comment was really alluding to."

So that's all good news. I like the momentum. But you have to remember that -- and Mike can correct me if I'm wrong on this because I don't understand it, but the good news when you get a lot of new IPOs is, obviously, they trade, you get more volume. And that's the revenue that accrues to you immediately. All the other fees from a new IPO that are around the listing are amortized over a fairly lengthy period of time. So even though we'll have a more normal IPO market in '10 than I think we had in all of '08 and the first half of '09, it's not like that you'll notice that in the listings numbers right away. Where you might see it is in an uptick in some of the transaction revenues, because it does create volume obviously. So what did I leave out there, Mike?"

We had a strong start to the year and are very excited about the future of this company. The market have responded well to our segment reporting, and the marketplace is beginning to recognize the progress we are making in transforming the company. We remain very focused on implementing our medium to long-term strategy. Our goal, as you know, is to apply technology and market knowledge to operate the leading global capital markets community. As you will see when we go through the deck, our businesses are gaining momentum and poised for future growth.
On Slide 3, you can see that we had a solid first quarter financial results. We recorded a 26% increase in EPS to $0.54 per share on a 7% increase in net revenue, our fourth consecutive quarterly increase in net revenue. The increase in net revenue is reflective of the growing earnings power from our new businesses with our Derivative segment posting a 44% increase in net revenue, and our Information Services and Technology Solutions segments posting a 33% increase in net revenue.
Our Derivative segment benefited from strong trading volumes, in both our NYSE Liffe and U.S. Options businesses, as well as the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing. Our Technology business benefited from a full quarter impact of NYFIX and improved software sales. Strong results in these two segments helped offset the negative impact of a significant Q1 volume decline in the overall U.S. cash markets and lower revenue capture in Europe. 
And as our new businesses come online and drive revenue growth, we are maintaining strong expense discipline. Our fixed operating costs on a constant dollar constant portfolio basis in the first quarter of 2010 were down $42 million or 10% from the prior-year period.
Let me now touch on a few select business highlights for the quarter. Within our Derivatives business, we made headway in establishing a U.S. futures platform. We closed the sale of a significant stake in our NYSE Liffe U.S. business, the six key future market participant, including DRW, that will help to create liquidity on our platform. We plan to launch a full suite of interest rate contracts in the third quarter, coinciding with the launch of our joint venture NYPC. In the first quarter, NYSE Euronext was the largest U.S. options exchange operator, and we our continuing to move forward with the requisite approvals for our semi-mutualization of the NYSE Amex Options business.
In our Cash and Listings business, improved profitability and stabilization of U.S. and European cash trading continue to be our focus. And we are seeing increased momentum in our Listings business. We're winning a majority of the qualified IPOs coming to market. 
Consistent with our ongoing drive to create a level playing field and improve investor protection, earlier this morning, we announced that we have entered into agreement with FINRA. That FINRA will assume responsibility performing the market surveillance and enforcement function, currently conducted by NYSE Regulation. This agreement is subject to regulatory approval.
On our Technology side, we benefited from the first full quarter of NYFIX. And the data center migration is underway in the U.S. and will begin for Europe in the next few weeks. 
Lastly, as part of our reference to continue to delever, subsequent to the close of the quarter, we concluded the sale of our 5% stake in the National Stock Exchange of India for gross proceeds of $175 million. We will use these proceeds to pay down our debt, which combined with favorable trends in EBITDA, to continue to trend downward for our debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
Slide 4. Slide 4 highlights the key priorities for our three segments that we introduced at Investor Day in March. 2009 was a transition year for NYSE Euronext. And now in 2010, we are shifting from a cross story to a cross and revenue story, powered by an expanding Derivative portfolio, our stable Cash Trading and Listings franchise and our emerging Information Services and Technology Solutions business. With increased transparency into these three distinct business, we are highlighting the strength and diversification of the global franchise and showcasing the true value of these segments. 
The center of the company and support of our three segments is UTP, a globally integrated and scalable trading platform, an unrivaled global connectivity network in customer gateway and two brand new world-class data centers. This core enables us to leverage our assets and support our customers across asset classes in a manner that is unparalleled in the industry.
Slide 5 provides our financial results for the first quarter. GAAP EPS for Q1 was $0.50 versus $0.40 per share in the year-ago period. Through the merger expenses and exit cost, of $13 million and $423 million respectively, net income for the first quarter of 2010 was $140 million or $0.54 per diluted share compared to net income of $112 million or $0.43 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2009. Our only GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling item is merger expenses and exit costs. 
As we complete the integration and transformation of the NYSE Euronext merger, we continue to incur cost related to the timing of severance, consolidation of real estate and retirement of systems and platforms. The latter two are generally non-cash charges. My review of our financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs just referenced.
Total revenue less transaction-based expenses, or net revenues, for the quarter increased 7% compared to Q1 2009 and were up slightly versus Q4 of 2009. The increase in net revenue versus the first quarter of 2009 was primarily driven by the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearings revenue, $27 million, strong volume growth across our derivative market, an increased software and technology sales bolstered by the first full quarter contribution from NYFIX. 
First quarter 2010 net revenue also included the favorable currency impact of $21 million. This was partially offset by the declines in cash equities and lower market data revenues. Operating income for the quarter was $218 million, up 19% versus the first quarter of 2009 and up 4% versus the fourth quarter. 
In summary, our first quarter results reflect the inherent leverage in our business model. This 7% increase in net revenue, coupled with only a 1% increase in fixed operating expenses, drove a 26% increase in earnings per share. Incremental margin was 88% in the first quarter.
On Slide 6, we show our first quarter revenue by both business activity and segment. The company continues to maintain a diversified revenue base. 50% of our net revenues came from transaction and clearing fees in the first quarter. Net revenues are above Q4, driven primarily by the contribution from NYFIX. Compared to Q1 2009, net trading revenues were up 8%, driven primarily by the addition of Liffe Clearing and stronger derivative volumes.
Turning to our segments. Cash Trading and Listings makes up 48% of our net revenue. But the Derivative segment is the fastest-growing segment, contributing 35% of our net revenues in the first quarter, up from 26% in the first quarter of 2009 and 31% in the fourth quarter. Information Services and Technology Solutions segment is also showing growth on a relative contribution basis. This segment represents 17% of our net revenues in the first quarter, up from 14% in the last year's first quarter and 16% in the fourth quarter. Growth in revenue is largely attributed to the acquisition of NYFIX, higher software sales in the quarter and continued contribution from SFTI Europe.
Slide 7 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. [Audio Gap] reconciles our operating expenses segregating the effects of foreign currency variations, portfolio changes and one-time IT integration costs. This is consistent with our 2010 expense guidance and synergy projections. 
Q1 reported expenses were up $5 million versus last year. After adjusting for foreign exchange variation, incremental spending for new business initiatives, like NYSE Liffe Clearing, the acquisition of NYFIX and duplicate data center expenditures, fixed operating expenses declined $42 million or 10% versus the first quarter of 2009. On a sequential basis, reported fixed expenses were down $4 million versus the fourth quarter of last year. 
Despite lower fixed operating expenses in the fourth quarter, we are reiterating our full year 2010 fixed cost guidance of $1.723 billion to $1.768 billion.  As we move through the second half of the year and our new data centers come online, duplicate data center costs will increase in these levels, we'll have some additional investment to the launch of interest rate futures. 
Let me be clear that these expenses are included in the guidance provided and we're not seeing the full impact yet due to timing.  We are making significant progress in the reengineering front and also reiterate our indicative full year 2011 fixed cost guidance of expenses less than $1.65 billion.
Slide 8 shows the quarterly volume and revenue capture trends for our Derivative businesses. The NYSE Liffe business, the chart also shows comparative currency neutral trading results.  Toward delving into numbers, I like to point out that revenue capture numbers that appear on the chart may vary from prior periods that we presented in the past, due to reclassification based on a new segment recording. 
Now taking a closer look at the Liffe business. Q1 volumes were higher than both the past [Audio Gap] quarter levels. Q1 2010 ADV for Liffe was up 20% versus the fourth quarter and 28% versus the first quarter of 2009. We saw particular strength in our short-term interest rate product this quarter, which was up 38% versus the prior year, and continued growth in Bclear volumes.
The recent events in Greece and the Euro-zone, in general, we have seen significant volatility and a surge in the already strong NYSE Liffe volumes in 2010. This last week, we posted record volumes on our NYSE Liffe platform of 12.4 million contract executed on a single day. And we saw particular strength in our Euribor and Short Sterling futures contracts. Open interest for our fixed income products in July 2007 to December 2009 was averaging 25 million contracts per month. Year-to-date through April 2010, we're average averaging 31.5 million fixed income contracts in open interest, a 25% increase.
Turning to our U.S. Options business, we saw a 63% growth in ADV year-over-year, with gains reported in our Amex and Arca Options unit. This growth was driven by overall increases in market volume, the extension of the Penny Pilot program and technology improvements in Arca Options. ADV was up 20% versus the fourth quarter, showing continued momentum in our options exchange. 
Since we acquired Amex in Q4 2008, our market share has grown from 6% at deal closing to 12% in the first quarter. NYSE Euronext's U.S. option exchanges accounted for 26.6% of the total consolidated equity options trading during the first quarter, up from 17% in the first quarter of 2009 and 24% in the fourth quarter. For the first quarter of 2010, NYSE Euronext was the number one exchange operator in the U.S. equity options market, in terms of market share. 
Rate per contract in the U.S. Options business was up slightly for the fourth quarter of 2009, but down versus the first quarter of 2009 due to an increase in the Penny Pilot program and Amex pricing changes when we migrated Amex Options to the new floor. These and pricing changes that we made to both the Amex and Arca platform, effective April 1, are expected to have a neutral, slightly positive effect to the blended RPC going forward.
Slide 9 shows you the financial performance for our Derivative segment. As displayed on the chart, the Derivative franchise continue to grow very nicely on a year-over-year and sequential-quarter basis. Net revenues for the Derivatives were up 44% compared to the first quarter of 2009 and 12% versus Q4 2009. As noted on the previous slide, strong year-over-year volume growth across our Derivative platform has doubled operating income versus the first quarter of 2009. Operating income is also up 29% versus the fourth quarter. 
Derivatives business demonstrates tremendous operating leverage and finished the quarter of 2010 with a 58% operating margin, up from 41% and 51% in Q1 and Q4 2009 respectively. Derivatives now represents 51% of the company's operating income.
We continue to make progress in our strategic initiatives in the Derivatives business, most notably, completing the sale of a significant minority stake through group of six leading market participants with NYSE Liffe U.S. and our plans to remutualization the Amex Options business. We also announced plans to offer a full suite of interest rate futures beginning in the third quarter, with the expected launch of NYPC, our joint venture with DTCC. The launch of NYPC and the remutualization of Amex Options is pending regulatory approval.
Slide 10 shows the quarterly volume and revenue capture trends for our Cash Trading and Listings segments. The European Cash business, the chart also shows some power to currency neutral trading results. Again as noted on the Derivatives chart, I like to point out that the revenue capture numbers that appear in the chart may vary from prior periods that we presented in the past due to reclassification based on our new segment reporting. 
The European Cash products net transaction revenue of $69 million decreased $28 million or 29% from $97 million in the first quarter of 2009. Decline in European Cash net revenue transaction were primarily driven by 2009 pricing changes, which reduced the average fee per transaction from $1.12 in the first quarter of 2009 to $0.80 per transaction in the first quarter of 2010, including the impact of currency fluctuations. In the first quarter of 2010, European Cash trading ADV of 1.4 million transactions is only 0.5% below prior-year levels. Market share in the first quarter held steady at approximately 73%, and we continue to be optimistic for market volume growth in the Euro-zone as new participants enter the market. 
Turning to the U.S. Cash business, volumes declined 37% year-over-year and were flat compared to the fourth quarter. Like the large reduction in ADV, net revenues were only down $4 million year-over-year due to a higher revenue capture. We expect pricing to hover around the current level. 
Market share for NYSE Classic was 24% in the first quarter, down 200 basis points from both the first and fourth quarter of 2009. Decline in market share was due to increased activity on the TRF. DMM participation was 8.6% in the first quarter 2010, consistent with the fourth quarter. But SLP participation was 11.5% in the quarter, its highest level since inception of the program. 
One final comment on Cash volumes. With the recent increase in volatility, global Cash volumes in April were stronger.
Slide 11 shows you the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings net revenues was $312 million in the first quarter of 2010, down 15% in the first quarter of 2009 and down 7% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Decrease in net revenue compared to the first quarter of 2009, primarily driven by a 21% decline in net transaction and clearing fees and a 29% decline in other revenue. Decline in net trading and clearing fees was principally due to pricing reductions in European Cash Trading and lower trading volume at U.S. Cash Trading. Decline in other revenues were principally due to a decrease in volumes on BlueNext, our environmental trading exchange. 
Operating income for the quarter was $106 million, resulting in a 34% margin. The margin was down versus prior-year period but in line with the fourth quarter of 2009. Cash and Listings segment represents 42% of the company's operating income. 
Regarding our European Cash business, we continue to make progress with the migration of the Mahwah data center, and we recently announced the U.S. stocks will be tradable on NYSE Arca Europe. Both SmartPool, our European dark pool, and Arca Europe have reported large increases in market share this quarter.
Turning to the U.S. business. During the quarter, GETCO joined the NYSE and NYSE Amex as a designated market maker, building on their existing role as a supplemental liquidity provider on NYSE and a lead market maker on NYSE Arca. 
Slide 12 shows you the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information Services and Technology Solutions net revenue was $110 million in the first quarter of 2010, an increase of $27 million or 33% from $83 million in the first quarter of 2009 and up 7% from the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase in net revenue compared to the first quarter of 2009, primarily driven by the first full quarter impact of NYFIX. 
Operating income excluding merger expenses and exit costs in the first quarter of 2010 was $17 million, a 55% increase compared to $11 million in the first quarter of 2009 and 11% decline from the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating margins was 15% compared to 13% in the first quarter of 2009 and 18% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 23% compared to 20% in the first quarter and 24% in the fourth quarter. Advanced cabinet reservations for both our new U.S. and U.K. data centers continue to be strong, with both data centers nearly fully subscribed for cabinet space.
Slide 13 details our cash and debt position as of March 31, 2010. During Q1, our gross debt declined $103 million to $2.7 billion. Cash and our other financial instrument totaled $400 million at the end of March. $2.7 billion of debt included $2.2 billion long-term debt at a weighted average cost of 5.3%. The remaining $500 million short-term debt consisted of commercial paper at an average cost of 0.5%. The first quarter of 2010 capital purchases and software development were $92 million, of which $46 million is for the building of our data centers. 
We're currently rated AA by S&P and A3 by Moody's. We are committed to effectively managing our balance sheet ensuring we have appropriate liquidity and flexibility. 
At March 31, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.4x, down from 2.6x at year end and 2.7x at the high point in the third quarter of 2009. Yesterday's sale of our 5% stake in NSE were $175 million gross proceeds. This proceeds will be used to repay debt. We expect the debt-to-EBITDA ratio to continue to improve in Q2 2010. Finally, last week, on April 29, 2010, the board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the second quarter of 2010, which is payable on June 30. 
I'll now turn it over to Dominique for a more detailed review of our NYSE Technologies business."
189274,99876979,59420,"NYSE Euronext, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 04, 2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","NYSE Holdings LLC","Executives","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Slide 14. By the way, we have a typo in Slide 14 which I want to correct before talking. On Line 2, we mentioning second half '09 for data center launch, actually, it's second half of '10. And it will be of cou",1086,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Slide 14. By the way, we have a typo in Slide 14 which I want to correct before talking. On Line 2, we mentioning second half '09 for data center launch, actually, it's second half of '10. And it will be of course corrected when we file. 
So Slide 14 is a slow up on the $1 billion in annual revenue target by the end of 2015 that we committed to at Investor Day. Our trajectory toward this target can be simplified into three basic stages, and I'm committed to updating you each quarter on our progress. So with $362 million in annual revenue as a starting point, right off the gate, 2010 will benefit from the full year effect of NYSE's marketplace network. 
So in the first stage, we will be leveraging the existing portfolio of businesses. Now at the end of 2010, our new data centers will be online, and we will begin to build for co-location services. The way to think about co-location services is it is the initial sale, which brings our buy side and sell side clients into our data centers and building the community. 
So from that initial sale, we are able to cross-sell a whole host of services ranging from Gateways to SuperFeed handlers. And irrespective of whether you trade on our market or not, with an ever-growing community in our data center, we are the technology provider of choice and the network effect begins to kick in. As the network effect takes hold, we start to see a virtual cycle where we'll be able to create new products, many of which will be generated from the ever-increasing activity within our data center in an extremely low-latency environment. 
So that takes us through the ancillary product and service growth stage to the next and final stage, as you can see on the chart of a growth, managed services, new product development and potential M&A to fill any gaps or eliminate non-core products and services that do not meet the needs of the changing landscape. 
And by the way, our dialogue with many of the largest broker-dealers has evolved. So we are now heading this vision at the highest levels of technology leadership, and we are no longer talking about one of technology sales. Rather, we are talking about enterprise deals for bigger plans, market data distribution, market access gateways. 
And as a result of this decision, we are now assessing opportunities to end all the trading infrastructures of several market participants. And those are very large dollar, multi-year contracts, that not just anyone can win because you're not about to outsource your critical and trading infrastructure to anyone. And that is where the NYSE Euronext brand and expertise come in. And by the way, we just completed two important deals with major banks for more than $2 million each.
Moving to Slide 15, we provide you with the better sense of the quality of the revenue stream that we have created with NYSE Technologies. Our quarterly recurring revenue stream makes up, on average, 77% of our revenue. Recurring revenue is defined as fees generated by SFTI, co-location, FIX marketplace and market data. And this revenue stream is subscription-like in nature providing a strong entity stream of revenue. 
Non-recurring revenue, which makes up, on average, 23% of the total revenue, is defined as one-off software sales or technology consulting sales. And our goal, of course, will be to continue to maintain a strong percentage of high-quality recurring revenue for the business.
Moving to Slide 16. We provide you with an update on the data center migration in both the U.S. and Europe. So in the U.S., an important milestone for our data center is the first NYSE application that went live in April for Broker system. And we are on track for the NYSE market migration in third quarter of this year. 
In Europe, our liquidity data center is now open, with the first stage of customer in selling equipment in readiness for the migration of matching engines, which will take place in the fourth quarter of this year. Of course, as you can guess, migrating entire markets and clients is very complicated with many moving parts, but you can be sure of one thing, our technology team is focused like laser executing on these programs. 
And as I said, we are on track for the opening of Mahwah in the third quarter and of Basildon in the fourth quarter. And as we move through the migration process in the second half of 2010, we will be in position to decommission data center, as you can see in this chart, and achieve the targeted savings.
Moving to Slide 17. So Larry and I will now address the two regulatory issues that are currently under discussion and also comment on our issue as I look at the initiative. On this slide, you can see a number of current issues where we had to win our best to demonstrate leadership. We are not going to go through each of the point this morning, it would be too long, but we will just highlight two important one.
Let's start with Europe. In Europe, regulators are embarking on a series of legislative initiative. For example, market structure. You may know that two years after MiFID implementation, Europe and policymakers are now working on the comprehensive review of the directive. Also, we do not expect firm proposal until early next year. But we are hopeful that officials in Europe will learn some important lesson from the market fragmentation that have occurred in the U.S. and will avoid heading down the same path. 
Derivatives regulation is also a key issue in Europe and as it is in the U.S. And we believe that there is a strong momentum beyond clearing of derivatives products, although it's still unclear this stage whether the European Commission that locating for more central trading.
NYSE Euronext is connecting strong advocacy for legislators and regulators to take advantage of the broad legislative review.

With regard to market structure issues, we believe we've taken a pragmatic approach. While regulators have a number of topics on their minds, we're trying to focus our attention on two important issues: consistent standards of transparency between ourselves and other pose of liquidity and a level-playing field into the pace of innovation, rule-making procedures and the cost of regulation. The SEC is currently engaged in a wide-reaching market structure review. We applaud the SEC for taking their thoughtful approach and has submitted a common letter on several of these topics. 
We're strongly in favor of innovation and competition, but with a framework that assures adequate oversight and investor protection. The FINRA announcement made earlier today is consistent with these goals and will improve investor protection, strength in market regulation by consolidating surveillance and enforcing responsibilities across multiple markets into one regulator. The agreement furthers the consolidation of the regulatory services under FINRA that began with the consolidation of NASP and NYSE's member-firm regulation that created FINRA in 2007. 
With regard to the broader financial regulatory reform debate, we're monitoring all the moving pieces very closely and are as involved as appropriate. While most of the proposals do not directly affect our business, it has brought support for more clearing, reporting and trading of overly accounted derivative products, which we believe will help improve market transparency and mitigate systemic risks. Our overarching view of the legislation that we should not let politics and emotions get in the way of good policy. It is critically important that we learn the lessons of the past few years and close the gaps in financial regulation.
With regard to advocacy, our efforts to speak on behalf of our issuers and be an influencer of public policy, continues to be an important part of our value proposition. We're working hard to represent our list of companies on issues like corporate governance, Sarbanes-Oxley reform and imposing a tax on stock transactions to ensure investor interest are protected.
Turning to Slide 18, our Listings. I'd like to talk to you a bit about the strong momentum in our Listings franchise. Year-to-date, there have been 288 global IPOs that raised $54.7 billion, up from 69 IPOs raised in $2.0 billion in the same time period last year. So the IPO markets in general are showing signs of life. NYSE saw 113 total Listings in the first quarter of 2010 versus 61 in the first quarter last year. We also saw six companies from China list with the NYSE during the quarter. 
NYSE continues to be the leading U.S. exchange for raising capital. Year-to-date, there were a total of 21 IPOs on the NYSE, with total proceeds of $4.4 billion. Our nearest competitor has 15 IPOs for $1.5 billion. Three largest operating companies to go public in the first quarter all chose to list on the NYSE. And the largest IPO on file, JBS USA, has committed to list on the NYSE. 
NYSE has also captured the momentum for tech IPOs. We've had three major tech IPOs this year, MaxLinear, Calix Networks and Sensata. Sensata Technologies was the largest tech deal year-to-date and also the largest overall IPO year-to-date. In addition, we currently have 10 technology deals in the pipeline, which represent 71% of the technology deals on file that have filed with exchange language.
We've also seen strong momentum on the transfer side of the Listings business. With six companies totaling $28 billion in market cap moving to NYSE through quarter one 2010 versus four for all 2009 and non-transferring away from NYSE and only one transferring away from NYSE Amex. Some of these names include Targa Resources, Charles Schwab, Inergy, Paragon Shipping and Kapstone Paper and Packaging. The pipeline remains strong and we're well-positioned to continue growing the Listings franchise in the coming quarters, market conditions permitting. 
That concludes our prepared remarks this morning. We want to thank you for your patience, and we'd like to now open the line for questions."

So not to say that in the coming years, we won't have pricing margins. But we are quite careful in targeting the segment where we believe we will resist to price pressure. Now the second part of your question if I catch it correctly is, of course, competition will move. Industry is quite competitive. But we believe that the concept is not to go compete head-to-head. It's to attract by co-location, clients in our data centers. And once we have clients there, if we do a good job in services and evolving our portfolio of services, there is no reason why we would not be able to scale and expand our services. So we have a model, we're quite confident that we can make it. By the way, we're quite careful on margins. The revenue side, optimistic on that. The focus is to keep the margin.

But in all seriousness, options is in a different place compared to the equities markets, right? In terms of their evolution. Decimalization is still rolling out. The SEC is really starting to take a broader look at it, in the same way that the Reg NMS look at the equities, market interconnects, competitive issues, linkage and fee caps back in 2007 when Reg NMS went into play. So I think that it is actually a healthy time for the SEC to take a look at this. The fee cap doesn't really affect profitability so much, right, because your rebate is scaled according to your fee, right? And it just -- what it really does is it limits rebate competition to a certain point. If you remember back to the equities debate, I mean, the challenge was that brokers were saying, ""We are forced by vast [ph] execution requirements to take liquidity we don't really have control over it, and yet people are gouging us on access fees."" So I think the SEC is really just taking the standard and in fact, just on a coincidence that they limited. This access fee catalyst proposed, is the same place that's limited in equities. And I think they're going to consider it, they're going to listen to all the sides and we're all participating in the debate. But all this saying is, ""Why should a broker accessing liquidity, be subject to an unlimited fee that they don't really have a choice."" It's not as part of the price, it's encompassed in it. So it is part of the natural evolution. Does it change some of the competition going forward, of course it does. But it probably changes some of the unfair competition. If you remember back to the ECN days, where we had some easy ends, literally charging $0.90 for access. That resulted in some unfair practices."

People do stupid things in their pricing to try to win market share. But I actually think we've reached at least a temporary stabilization within a couple of percentage points of market here vis-à-vis exchange competitors. Now as you've seen in the first quarter, most of the major exchanges and almost every exchange, lost a little bit of market share to TRF [trade reporting facility], which is a combination of internalization and our polls together. I think part of that is -- that's caused by a change in the mix of volume in the first quarter, relatively was low, not a lot of natural volume coming out there. And so, the mix was different than it has been. In addition, I think over the last several years, we've seen a steady increase in the sophistication of broker internalization and order routing in an effort to get volume away from exchanges. That's the secular trend in a less regulatory changes would change that. And it's going to just continue that way. But I think that we're all looking for tweaks at the margin and half of us, shore up or improved market share on the margin, or shore up and improve our profitability on the margin. But at the complicated mix, I don't think that any of us are viewing this as major changes in market share, nor major changes in profitability. I think on the DMM side, you're absolutely right that GETCO voted with defeat [ph]. And to be honest, we had a lot of demand for -- we still have a lot demand for people who want to be DMMs. Is that because they think that it is a huge source of profitability? I don't know that I would go there. I think if you compare the New York model compared to every other model in the U.S., including Arca, obviously, those are all non-differentiated models. They scale their rebate and they scale their access fees by volume. There are no obligations to the market, and there is no other way to gain differential rebates other than provide more volume. The New York model is distinct and that, not only in providing a parity of difference, but also it's the only model where the rebate is scaled according to the obligations you have for the model. We think that that's really good for investors. We think it's really good for issuers. But it also creates a difference. And that difference is what attracts a GETCO or someone else, because they want to be able to play in that arena as well, as in all the other arenas. And it's the only way for them to get that differential rebate on New York. They and many others like them, have participated in the SLP model. They like that model as well. And so this is just one other avenue for them to take advantage of a higher rebate. I wouldn't say that we are looking at this point, you know, the drastic change in our DMM pricing. And in fact, we just changed the model a little bit in NYSE and made the increase, the SLP pricing. So we like that model. We think it's working really well. And we think it also has the dual advantage of not just incenting liquidity to the marketplace, which is what all maker-taker models of any sort do. But also enhancing liquidity providers who have an obligation to the market, which we think is a very important selling point and differentiator."

We still have really oversight for that responsibility even though we are outsourcing activities to FINRA. In terms of the $80 million of expenses and the impact of that, I mean, that was for all of our regulatory compliance works. Some of that business is staying with us, the listing compliance is an example. But we do believe as FINRA develops GAAP, there is opportunities for increased efficiency to come from these announcements. So I would say as parts of our overall focus on re-engineering and thinking outside the box and thinking about how we can run our business more efficiently, I would certainly put FINRA in that, right. But to be really clear, FINRA and the decision to move outsourcing is really not principally a cross effort. And it is because we believe that's the best way for the market to be surveilled. We think it helps level the playing field and we totally support others moving in that direction. With regards to the derivative data center, when we've launched Liffe U.S., we did lease some small data center space in Chicago and we continue to use that space.

It's conveniently close to where many of our clients are situated. And it's not a significant expense to the operation. It has three or four more years left on the lease."

So look for us to do the third quarter earnings review from there. The good news for all of you is we won't be doing it at 8:00 a.m. Paris time. We'll probably continue to do it at 8:00 a.m. New York time. 
I'm going to start with Slide 3 in the deck, and just hit a few highlights on that slide. I think you can see from the slide and from the press release this morning, we had a very strong second quarter. We're growing our Derivatives business. We're stabilizing our Cash Equities business, and we're providing innovative technologies solutions in that business. Our results, which reflect the continued trend of improving financial performance, were driven by stronger trading volumes, increased revenue generation from our new initiatives and continued cost discipline. 
We recorded a 25% increase in EPS to $0.64 per share and a 15% increase in operating income on a 7% increase in net revenue, with incremental margins of 76%. These results reflect the growing earnings power from our three primary businesses and the inherent operating leverage in the model. Firstly, our Derivatives segment benefited from record trading volumes as well as the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing. During the month of May, we executed an average of 13 million contracts per day across our Global Derivatives businesses, driving a 34% increase in net revenue with an increase in our operating margin to 62%, up from 42% the prior year. We were the largest U.S. equities options exchange for the second consecutive quarter.
Turning to Cash and Listings in the first half of 2010, we continue to use see strong demand for our listing venues, both in terms of transfers and new listings. On the execution side, we are continuing to focus on stability and profitability of this business. In the U.S., our market share in Tape A is at 37%, up from 35% in the first quarter. And our share in Europe is holding steady at 74%. 
Additionally, on July 13, we launched trading on Tape C stocks on an unlisted trading privilege basis over the NYSE Amex platform. Trading began with 10 issues and now has expanded to approximately 675 NASDAQ listed issues. And we've seen some positive market share developments. 
Lastly, our Technology business benefited from the addition of NYFIX and improved software sales, driving a 29% increase in revenue and an increase in operating margin to 19%. I will walk you through the profiles of several deals that we’ve signed in the past few months later in the presentation. They are representative of the enterprise level dialogues that we are having with market participants, encouraging them to leverage our technology to help them run their businesses more efficiently.
As we invest in our future growth and drive our revenue generation, we are maintaining strong expense discipline as well. Our fixed operating expenses in the second quarter on a constant-dollar basis were down $29 million or 7% from the prior year period. 
Before I move to Slide 4, let me touch briefly on a few select business highlights for the quarter. Building upon our success with the launch of NYSE Liffe Clearing last July, we have announced our intention to build two new clearinghouses in London and Paris for our European Derivatives and Cash businesses. The economics for clearing are very favorable. And it is our intention to have the new clearinghouses live by mid-to-late '12. We continue to await regulatory approval of our NYSE Amex options and NYPC semi-mutualizations. 
In terms of NYPC, we now have a full management team in place. The intensive regulatory review and approval process for NYPC continues to make progress. And we appreciate all the regulatory agencies for their substantial resources they are committing to thoroughly analyze this innovative new clearing model. Given the recent focus on clearinghouses and risk in the newly enacted Financial Regulatory Reform bill, regulators are being appropriately diligent in their analysis. And we are still hoping for regulatory approvals later in the fall.
Our agreement with FINRA, under which they assume responsibility for performing the market surveillance and enforcement functions previously conducted by NYSE Regulation is affective and we believe this agreement is an important step towards consolidated market surveillance, the need for which was highlighted in the events of May 6. 
I am pleased to report that our data center migration is on track. We are establishing the liquidity hubs of the future. And Mike will address the timing of the incremental depreciation and amortization for the second half of 2010.  
Lastly, as we committed to on our last quarter's call, we have continued to de-lever, and year-to-date we have reduced our outstanding debt by more than $500 million. 
In summary, while we are pleased with our strong results for the quarter, driven by higher volumes across most of our venues and a growing base of recurring Technology Services revenue, we still have much to do. We are focused on executing against our long-term strategy of operating the most meaningful capital markets, creating even broader and deeper networks of productivity, and delivering innovative products to our expanding client base. We have, and will, continue to redefine what an exchange is in the 21st century.
Now please turn to Slide 4. The priorities on this slide highlight our goal of creating a community premium, using our scale and scope to benefit not only our own business but our customers' businesses as well. We can achieve this through initiatives and offerings like co-location, co-branding, advocacy and our global distribution network. At the center of the company and in support of our three businesses is UTP, our global integrated and scalable trading platform, an unrivaled global connectivity network and customer gateway; our focus on clearing, which will take on an greater importance in '11 and '12; and two brand-new world-class data centers, set for launch in September and October of this year.
Turning to Slide 5. We have several recent NYSE technology wins, which reflect the growing interest in our full-managed solutions capabilities. The Technology business, as I alluded to earlier, has performed well to date. And approximately 80% of the revenues in this business are recurring. On the exchange partnership side of the business, we continue to land large client deals. As you will recall, last year we signed a partnership with the Qatar Exchange to build their cash and derivatives platforms. And just a few weeks ago, we signed a multi-year eight-figure deal with the Warsaw Stock Exchange to migrate WSE's cash and derivatives markets to NYSE Technologies Universal Trading Platform. In addition, we plan to collaborate with the WSE on other mutually beneficial business initiatives. 
Regarding the more traditional client side, you will note on the chart a few examples of deals that we’ve recently signed. Despite reports of slowing technology spend, we are seeing strong interest from the broker-dealer community, investing in leading-edge trading technology. This is a welcome sign, especially after a slow 2009 that saw a decent pullback in technology spend. Our customers are working to leverage our full solution set. We believe the deals shown on this slide represent just the beginning of our ability to deliver innovative products. And these opportunities will only get larger as we deliver.  
Supporting many of these deals are our data centers. There is a lot of customer focus on the upcoming Mahwah and Basildon go live dates set for later this year.
On Slide 6, we've included a simple strategy statement to help you better understand where we're going. Our aspiration is to lead our industry and redefine what it means to be an exchange in the 21st century. To achieve this, our mission will be simply to empower the world's capital markets community to innovate and collaborate. To achieve this, our core objectives will be to operate the most important capital markets; connect the members of the community through our ever-growing network; deliver innovative products to our continually expanding client base; and to enable customers to run their businesses more profitably by using our technology and scale that UTP and the data centers deliver. 
We have already gone a long way towards redefining what an exchange is. And we’ve moved from being just an operator of markets to much more. As many companies in other industries have done, we are moving across the value chain to improve our competitive position. The more customers and partners we have, the greater the network effect, which further validates the relevance of our community. In short, it is about getting more customers for our products and services, and more products and services for our customers. From our perspective, we think the sum of the parts is being undervalued, because we believe that our unique collection of assets and global reach offers us great revenue and cost synergies, which will ultimately yield the community premium that I mentioned earlier. 
Finally for me, on Slide 7, you will see a number of current issues where we are doing our best to demonstrate leadership. We will not go through each of these bullets individually this morning, but we'll highlight a few important ones.  
While Congress considered financial regulatory reform legislation, we were very active in advocating for ourselves, and more importantly on behalf of our list of companies. We believe that the Dodd-Frank Act will solidify and bolster our opportunities for future growth, particularly in derivatives. Going forward, the Act mandates hundreds of agency rule-makings. And we are already analyzing and prioritizing these rules and expect to play an active advocacy role on behalf of our clients, but also are committed to be an active participant with the regulators who are going to have to write all these rules. 
In terms of market structure, the events of May 6 put a spotlight on the need for improvements to our equity markets. This has created opportunities for us to demonstrate the benefits that the NYSE model brings to issuers, investors and the markets. We testified twice before Congress on market structure matters. And we spent considerable time with the SEC, the CFTC and the Joint Advisory Committee. We believe these opportunities have enhanced our standing with legislative and regulatory policy makers. 
More broadly, our efforts to advocate on behalf of our issuers and to be an influencer of public policy continue to be an important part of our value proposition. We’re working hard to represent our list of companies on issues like corporate governance, proxy access and Sarbanes-Oxley reform. As well as our continued opposition on a tax on transactions to ensure that investors’ interests are protected as well.
Turning to Europe, regulators are also embarking on a plethora of legislative initiatives on both market structure and financial regulation. Two years after its implementation, European policy makers are working on a comprehensive review of MiFID, although we don't expect firm proposals until early next year. We are hopeful that officials in Europe will learn some important lessons from the market fragmentation that has occurred in the U.S. and will avoid heading down the same path. We will also be working with European legislators to ensure an adequate assessment of the increasingly high level of non-transparent trading. We believe that a proper analysis of this issue calls for priority to be given to a more transparent price formation process and increased investor protection. 
Derivative regulation is also a key issue in Europe, as has been the case in the U.S. The European Commission will publish legislative proposals in September in keeping with the G-20 commitments, before central clearing of OTC derivative trades. It is our understanding that the Commission will present proposals next year as part of a MiFID revision to bring more OTC derivatives onto central lit platforms. 
That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn it over to Mike for a review of our quarter’s financial results. Mike?"
189274,107640780,71881,"NYSE Euronext, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","NYSE Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Duncan. Slide 8 provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter. Total revenues were flat year-over-year and up 15% versus the first quarter. Net revenue profits and diluted EPS are all up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The $0.7",2420,"Thanks, Duncan. Slide 8 provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter. Total revenues were flat year-over-year and up 15% versus the first quarter. Net revenue profits and diluted EPS are all up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The $0.70 EPS posted in the second quarter was the company's highest quarterly EPS since Q3 2008. 
Unless otherwise noted, all of our financials are presented in accordance with GAAP. As we progress through the latter stages of the post-merger integration, staff reduction and system harmonization efforts, we continue to incur high levels of severance charges, asset write-offs and real estate disposition costs. These discreet items are reported in merger and exit costs. Once we move into the new data centers and exit our legacy premises, we expect the occurrence of these costs to decline significantly.
This quarter, we reported a $32 million charge in merger and exit costs. This consisted of $14 million in cash charges, primarily for severance related to the FINRA transaction, reengineering the structure of local offices, and the U.S. VRIP. The remainder is related to real estate lease cancellations and disposal of legacy system applications. Last year's merger costs of $442 million was principally for the NYSE Liffe Clearing payment, which drove the GAAP loss for the quarter. In the quarter, we reported a $54 million gain from asset disposals, primarily related to the sale of our 5% stake in the National Stock Exchange of India. 
Now I'll review our financial results. From this point forward, we'll exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs just referenced, as well as the gains from disposal activities during the quarter.  
Slide 9 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the second quarter. Including merger and exit costs in the asset sales, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.64, up 25% on prior year's $0.51. Year-to-date EPS of $1.18 is up 26%. Q2 earnings performance was driven by a 7% increase in net revenue, and another quarter of solid expense management. 
Operating income was $247 million, up 15% compared to the second quarter of 2009. Operating margin rose to 38% this quarter and is 36% year-to-date. This compares to the full year operating margin of 32% for 2009. 
Our focus for 2010 is revenue growth and margin expansion. We are pleased with our progress on both fronts. We continue to grow EBITDA margin as well, posting a 48% mark for the quarter. The relatively fixed expense base, we have significant operating leverage on our incremental revenue and volume growth.
Slide 10 provides our segment results on a currency-neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened in this quarter versus both the euro and British pound. For the quarter, 48% of our net revenue was denominated in either euros or pounds. Currency impact was unfavorable, $19 million versus prior year and $22 million versus prior quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, second quarter net revenues grew 10% and operating income 20% versus Q2 of prior year. 
Operationally, our Derivative segment grew 38% and the Technology segment grew 33% versus Q2 prior year. Cash Trading and Listings revenue declined by 8%, attributed to lower revenues from BlueNext, our carbon trading venture, and lower U.S. volumes, and revenue capture in Europe. Our Derivatives and Technology profits nearly doubled versus Q2 prior year.
On Slide 11, we show our 2010 year-to-date net revenue split by business activity and segment, with comparison for the first half of 2009. The company continues to benefit from a diversified revenue base. 51% of our net revenues were generated by transaction and clearing fees in the first half of 2010. This is slightly higher than last year because of the strong Q2 volume in 2010 and the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing. We saw the contribution from Technology Services to show the most meaningful increase during the first half of 2010, the specific gains stemming from NYFIX, growth in our SFTI Europe network, and recent software and infrastructure sales.
Turning to our segments. Cash Trading and Listings comprised 48% of our net revenues in the first half of 2010; while the Derivative segment continued to be the fastest-growing segment, contributing 35% of our net revenues, up from 27% in the first half of 2009; followed by the Technology segment, which grew from 14% to 17% of revenue. Again, this is consistent with our revenue guidance and where we have invested in new initiatives.
Slide 12 and 13 detail the financial performance for our Global Derivatives segment. I'm not going to go through these slides in great detail but simply touch upon a few points. The Global Derivatives franchise continues to grow. Net revenues were $226 million in the second quarter, an increase of $57 million or 34% versus Q2 prior year, and are up 38% year-to-date. The increase is primarily driven by a $51 million increase in trading and clearing revenues due to strong volume growth in European Derivatives and U.S. Options, increased market share for U.S. Options, and the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing. 
Both our European Derivatives and U.S. Option venues experienced record volume days in the second quarter. For the quarter, volumes rose 38% and 57% respectively versus Q2 prior year. For one day in May, we handled over 16 million derivative contracts globally. NYSE Euronext was the largest U.S. equity options exchange operator in the marketplace for the second consecutive quarter, with a market share of 26%. 
The revenue capture for European derivatives, ex Bclear, was $0.64 per contract in the second quarter. This was up versus the second quarter of last year due to the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing, but down slightly versus the first quarter because of the stronger dollar. 
Rate per contract in the U.S. options was $0.17 per contract in the second quarter. This is down versus both the prior year and prior quarter. The reason for the decrease is largely attributable to an increase in Penny Pilot issues traded on NYSE Arca and minor pricing changes which are offset by market share gains.
Our Global Derivatives segment increased its margins to 62% in Q2, as we were able to leverage volume and revenue growth on a lower cost base. For the first half of 2010, this segment accounted for 50% of our operating income. 
Similarly, Slide 14 and 15 show you the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings net revenue was $321 million in the second quarter of 2010, down versus last year but up sequentially versus the first quarter. The year-over-year decrease was driven by a $21 million decline in net transaction revenue and a $14 million decline in other revenue. 
Decline in net transaction revenue was attributed to pricing reductions in European cash in 2009 and lower trading volumes in U.S. cash. This was somewhat mitigated by an 18% increase in European volumes during the quarter. Decline in other revenue is principally due to a decrease in volumes on BlueNext, our environmental trading exchange. However, we are actively looking at opportunity to build upon our BlueNext franchise and bolster our carbon trading operations.
Market share in the Euronext primary market was up slightly to 74% in the second quarter, but below the 79% in the second quarter of 2009. Revenue capture for U.S. cash was $0.03 per 100 shares, in line with expectations and recent trends. Revenue capture for European cash was $0.65 per transaction versus $0.90 in the prior year. The decline was attributed to the stronger dollar and a less favorable mix in part due to higher volumes.
NYSE Euronext global listing franchise gathered momentum in the first half of 2010. A total of nine companies with a combined market capital of over $30 billion have transferred from other exchanges to NYSE. Some of these companies include Knight Capital Group, Charles Schwab and Paragon Shipping. Furthermore, a total of 55 IPOs, with total proceeds of $13 billion, listed on our markets during the first six months of the year. 
Operating margin for the Cash Trading and Listings segment was 39% in the second quarter, up from 34% in Q1, and virtually flat with the second quarter of 2009.
Slide 16 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information Services and Technology Solutions net revenue was $107 million in the second quarter, an increase of $24 million or 29% from Q2 prior year. The increase is primarily driven by the NYFIX acquisition, growth in SFTI clients, and some large software and infrastructure sales. Revenues were slightly behind Q1, but on a currency-neutral basis grew 2%. 
Operating income was $20 million, a 67% increase from the prior year, and an 18% increase from the first quarter of 2010. Operating margin was 19% compared to 14% in the second quarter of '09 and 15% in Q1. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26%. 
Advanced cabinet reservations for our new U.S. and U.K. data centers continue to be strong, with both data centers nearly fully subscribed for cabinet space. Co-location revenues will begin to accelerate in the fourth quarter, and reach their annualized level in Q2 2011 once we complete the application migrations to the data centers. The data centers are set to go live in Mahwah in September and Basildon in October.
Slide 17 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. We continue to make excellent progress in lowering our cost base in real terms, while funding incremental investment to grow the business. Q2 expenses were $20 million below the first quarter. After adjusting for favorable impact of the stronger dollar and for incremental data center integration spending, fixed costs were $15 million below Q1 on an apples-to-apples basis. Second quarter operating expenses were up $10 million versus last year on a reported basis. 
Q2 2009 included a onetime $10 million benefit curtailment related to changes made to our retiree benefit plan. After adjusting for this, FX and the impact of acquisitions such as NYSE Liffe Clearing and MiFID, fixed operating costs were down $29 million or 7% from the second quarter of 2009. 
Looking at the first half of 2010 on a constant-dollar constant-portfolio basis, our underlying fixed expenses were down $71 million or 9% compared to the first half of 2009. We continue to make good progress and are focused on efficiency and productivity improvement that will further reduce operating expenses for NYSE Euronext.
Slide 18 provides an update to our annual expense guidance. In March, when we provided fixed expense guidance for 2010, we indicated that this guidance was predicated on the average FX rates for 2009. These were $1.39 for the euro and $1.57 for the pound. Given the direction of rates in the first half, we felt it appropriate to adjust our full year guidance to reflect a scenario more in line with current currency trends. Applying the rate of $1.30 for the euro and $1.50 for the pound, our revised fixed cost range is now between $1.685 million to $1.729 million. Likewise, should these rates be applicable for 2011, our prior guidance of cost to be below $1.650 million will be adjusted accordingly. 
In the second quarter, 60% of our operating expenses were denominated in dollars, 20% in euros and 20% in pounds. Although we've adjusted the cost range solely for currency, our first half expense performance of $834 million coupled with efficiency initiatives in the pipeline provides us increasing comfort that we will achieve our cost guidance for 2010. 
Our staffing level as of June 30 is 2,993 full-time positions, which is 374 positions or 11% below year end levels. Roughly 165 of these reductions relate to the recent outsourcing of certain regulatory activities to FINRA. Approximately $11 million per quarter in compensation expense related to this headcount transfer will now be reflected in the professional services line. For the most part, the social plan and U.S. VRIP programs have now been fully executed and are compete. We will continue to pursue a number of process efficiency improvements which will further reduce expenses into 2011.
That said, we do expect cost to rise somewhat in the second half attributable to migration into our new data centers, investment in our new European clearinghouses, and launching of interest rate futures in the U.S. In addition to the integration and transition costs, we expect to begin depreciating the new data centers as we go live in the latter part of the third quarter, adding incremental depreciation costs of approximately $15 million dollars in the second half. Over time, this will be mitigated as we exit some legacy data centers.
Slide 19 details our cash and debt position as of June 30, 2010. After investing a significant amount of capital for building two state-of-the-art data centers, in-sourcing Liffe Clearing, restructuring operations and investing in other avenues of growth, we indicated late last year that our focus will be on de-levering our balance sheet. In just six months, we've made significant progress towards these goals and are now operating well within our long-term target leverage levels. Our debt leverage this quarter has declined to slightly below 1.9x debt to EBITDA versus 2.6x at year end 2009. This improvement is the result of double-digit growth in EBITDA, coupled with significant debt repayment. 
During the second quarter, our gross debt declined $434 million to $2.2 billion. Proceeds from the disposition of NSE, coupled with strong operating cash flows, enabled a sizable repayment of short-term debt. 
Cash and other financial instruments was $419 million at the end of June 2010. That compares favorably to our short-term debt, which is now below $300 million. For the second quarter of 2010, capital expenditures were $70 million, of which $26 million was for building out for our data centers. 
Having reached our comfort zone with regards to leverage, we are revisiting how best to allocate capital going forward, besides just paying down debt. This will entail investing for growth and possibly returning excess cash flows to our shareholders. We’re comfortable with the dividend at current levels, as the payout ratio remains above pre-crisis levels, while we still have an outstanding share buyback authorization. We are currently rated AA- by S&P and A3 by Moody's. The S&P rating is under credit watch, which we expect will be addressed shortly.
And finally, last week the Board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the third quarter of 2010, which is payable on September 30. With that, let me turn the call back to Duncan for some closing remarks, and then you take your questions."

So just to recap, we're obviously very pleased with our results for the quarter.

I think we also continued to show cost discipline during the quarter. And we remained focused on proceeding with our company-wide efficiency efforts that will address globalizing our operations, reducing process complexity and streamlining organizational contracts. 
We are on the cusp of concluding a multi-year project with the lighting up of our new data centers which we expect will serve as a cornerstone of our Technology Services growth story. We are signing more major client deals and establishing more commercial exchange partnerships than ever before, based on the superior quality and breadth of technology assets that we have brought together with our organic development and acquisitions the past couple of years. 
And we have several other new initiatives that are in the wings that will drive our future growth, including NYPC and our European clearing initiatives set for later on in '11, '12. With these initiatives, we are indeed redefining what it means to be an exchange in the 21st century. So with that, we’ll wrap it up, and we’d like to open the line for your questions.

What happened was NASDAQ declared self-help against Arca, which lasted 20 minutes. We believe that was due to a server latency on about 20 symbols that lasted five minutes in Tape C. The other exchanges didn’t -- that’s declared self-help for about seven minutes, and that was due to the fact that some of the prices they were sending us violated our price bands. And when we spoke to them on the phone, they cleared that up relatively quickly. Our direct feeds did not experience latency, as far as we know, in terms of market data. There were some issues potentially on the SIP, meaning the consolidated feed, but probably about 85% or 90% of our volume actually comes from direct feeds. That's another misinformation that’s generally in the market, which is that, in general, consolidated feeds go to retail customers and people who are viewing it with their eyeballs. Most volume is actually generated from direct feeds. That said, on that period, we experienced a tripling of quotes in trades during that burst of about five minutes. When the May 6 event occurred, those were record volumes of message traffic. And I think that we always keep an eye on capacity, and have made -- we're actually in the process of some capacity expansion on the May 6 date that has subsequently been completed. I think it's something that we're always careful about. Volumes are down a bit again after the second quarter, I think everybody’s seen July. But that's partly seasonally. But I think it’s something that we’re just always cognizant of and always reviewing."

And likewise get pushed into a lower tier if volumes explode. And tried to sort of mitigate some of that, and we’ve implemented that. In addition the -- by the way it’s evolved over time, the European pricing model is overly complex. Because we have this whole agency principal, designation, it's a very complicated system. And we’re working right now with our clients on a way to make that simpler. Because it will make them -- it’s easier for them to make their routing decisions and figure out how they’re going to run their business.

What we kind of note, particularly in the U.S., is while July was down versus the previous month as we've seen, on one hand June is always a very seasonably busy quarter because of Russell and other things, and July for 2010 was higher than July of 2009.

We have a slide that went through both our revenue growth outlook for our three segments as well as our margin expansion for those three. And we used the word medium to extrapolate that medium, although we didn't say 40%, people have been calculating that it's about 40% of 2011. As I mentioned, we are at 36% year-to-date for this year. We're definitely focused on growing revenues and reducing costs, which would certainly help your margins. And we're at 38% this quarter. So I wouldn’t say we’re changing that outlook, I mean you’re going to have quarters where the volumes are strong and the margins are going to be that much stronger. I wouldn’t extrapolate the second quarter as being our run rate, because we did have pretty strong volumes. But with 36% year-to-date, I think we're on track to higher margins that we had last year, and certainly moving in the direction of our guidance."

I don't know how near-term it's going to be, because I think it's going to take a while for all of this to be codified. But also I continue to be able to believe that there's opportunities in clearing and market data before there are opportunities in trading. So I think there might be some kind of a data opportunity for us. But I don't know how much there’s -- of an opportunity there’s going to be for listing these various products. So I don't think they’re going to be that actively traded in the near-term. Lastly, you're absolutely right, I think our view is to be a force in OTC derivative clearing, you need to own the assets. I think we're on our way to owning potential assets with the clearinghouse build-outs in Europe and the NYPC build-out here in the U.S. But we said publicly before, short of actually owning those assets, it's difficult to play a role if you don't have the clearinghouse assets. So as you would correctly expect, that’s part of the reason behind us trying to build out some of these clearing assets because it's then limitless, the products we can clear in those houses."

I could see it going down a little bit from here. I wouldn't expect much movement the balance of this year because, remember, as we finish the UTP migration and we’re lighting up the new data centers, which then puts us in position to decommission the older data centers, I wouldn't expect too much change in that, in the status quo on our headcount now for the balance of this year. I think there is a possibility that when UTP is done and when all the data center migration and decommissioning is done, you could see another leg down. But I don't think we want to anticipate that. Because at the same time, we've got a Technology Services business that is growing. And those require a different kind of potentially consultative sales force, so you could see us add some people there. So I would say in the near-term, those trends kind of offset. Now a lot of the operational efficiency gains that were talked -- that I referenced earlier in my remarks, I think could lead to some headcount changes on the margin.

I think that we will be going down further as the data center is finished, as UTP finalizes and as we -- we’re globalizing operations, remember, we’d have the Belfast initiative. A lot of that is going to hit the consultant headcount where so the mix of employees versus consultants will probably change a bit, swinging a little bit more towards the employees. But we're constantly looking for, and it will be in the realm of process reengineering, simplification and globalization towards reducing headcount. If not our primary goal -- our primary goal is cost. And the heads that are coming out as this year progresses and as we hit the end of the data center projects, et cetera, we are really built into Mike's cost guidance. So that while we haven't given a headcount guidance, that was kind of where we were headed for cost, and to be honest, not all those are headcount either. That’s not really our primary focus.

We'll probably continue to do it at 8:00 a.m. New York time. 
I'm going to start with Slide 3 in the deck, and just hit a few highlights on that slide. I think you can see from the slide and from the press release this morning, we had a very strong second quarter. We're growing our Derivatives business. We're stabilizing our Cash Equities business, and we're providing innovative technologies solutions in that business. Our results, which reflect the continued trend of improving financial performance, were driven by stronger trading volumes, increased revenue generation from our new initiatives and continued cost discipline. 
We recorded a 25% increase in EPS to $0.64 per share and a 15% increase in operating income on a 7% increase in net revenue, with incremental margins of 76%. These results reflect the growing earnings power from our three primary businesses and the inherent operating leverage in the model. Firstly, our Derivatives segment benefited from record trading volumes as well as the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing. During the month of May, we executed an average of 13 million contracts per day across our Global Derivatives businesses, driving a 34% increase in net revenue with an increase in our operating margin to 62%, up from 42% the prior year. We were the largest U.S. equities options exchange for the second consecutive quarter.
Turning to Cash and Listings in the first half of 2010, we continue to use see strong demand for our listing venues, both in terms of transfers and new listings. On the execution side, we are continuing to focus on stability and profitability of this business. In the U.S., our market share in Tape A is at 37%, up from 35% in the first quarter. And our share in Europe is holding steady at 74%. 
Additionally, on July 13, we launched trading on Tape C stocks on an unlisted trading privilege basis over the NYSE Amex platform. Trading began with 10 issues and now has expanded to approximately 675 NASDAQ listed issues. And we've seen some positive market share developments. 
Lastly, our Technology business benefited from the addition of NYFIX and improved software sales, driving a 29% increase in revenue and an increase in operating margin to 19%. I will walk you through the profiles of several deals that we’ve signed in the past few months later in the presentation. They are representative of the enterprise level dialogues that we are having with market participants, encouraging them to leverage our technology to help them run their businesses more efficiently.
As we invest in our future growth and drive our revenue generation, we are maintaining strong expense discipline as well. Our fixed operating expenses in the second quarter on a constant-dollar basis were down $29 million or 7% from the prior year period. 
Before I move to Slide 4, let me touch briefly on a few select business highlights for the quarter. Building upon our success with the launch of NYSE Liffe Clearing last July, we have announced our intention to build two new clearinghouses in London and Paris for our European Derivatives and Cash businesses. The economics for clearing are very favorable. And it is our intention to have the new clearinghouses live by mid-to-late '12. We continue to await regulatory approval of our NYSE Amex options and NYPC semi-mutualizations. 
In terms of NYPC, we now have a full management team in place. The intensive regulatory review and approval process for NYPC continues to make progress. And we appreciate all the regulatory agencies for their substantial resources they are committing to thoroughly analyze this innovative new clearing model. Given the recent focus on clearinghouses and risk in the newly enacted Financial Regulatory Reform bill, regulators are being appropriately diligent in their analysis. And we are still hoping for regulatory approvals later in the fall.
Our agreement with FINRA, under which they assume responsibility for performing the market surveillance and enforcement functions previously conducted by NYSE Regulation is affective and we believe this agreement is an important step towards consolidated market surveillance, the need for which was highlighted in the events of May 6. 
I am pleased to report that our data center migration is on track. We are establishing the liquidity hubs of the future. And Mike will address the timing of the incremental depreciation and amortization for the second half of 2010.  
Lastly, as we committed to on our last quarter's call, we have continued to de-lever, and year-to-date we have reduced our outstanding debt by more than $500 million. 
In summary, while we are pleased with our strong results for the quarter, driven by higher volumes across most of our venues and a growing base of recurring Technology Services revenue, we still have much to do. We are focused on executing against our long-term strategy of operating the most meaningful capital markets, creating even broader and deeper networks of productivity, and delivering innovative products to our expanding client base. We have, and will, continue to redefine what an exchange is in the 21st century.
Now please turn to Slide 4. The priorities on this slide highlight our goal of creating a community premium, using our scale and scope to benefit not only our own business but our customers' businesses as well. We can achieve this through initiatives and offerings like co-location, co-branding, advocacy and our global distribution network. At the center of the company and in support of our three businesses is UTP, our global integrated and scalable trading platform, an unrivaled global connectivity network and customer gateway; our focus on clearing, which will take on an greater importance in '11 and '12; and two brand-new world-class data centers, set for launch in September and October of this year.
Turning to Slide 5. We have several recent NYSE technology wins, which reflect the growing interest in our full-managed solutions capabilities. The Technology business, as I alluded to earlier, has performed well to date. And approximately 80% of the revenues in this business are recurring. On the exchange partnership side of the business, we continue to land large client deals. As you will recall, last year we signed a partnership with the Qatar Exchange to build their cash and derivatives platforms. And just a few weeks ago, we signed a multi-year eight-figure deal with the Warsaw Stock Exchange to migrate WSE's cash and derivatives markets to NYSE Technologies Universal Trading Platform. In addition, we plan to collaborate with the WSE on other mutually beneficial business initiatives. 
Regarding the more traditional client side, you will note on the chart a few examples of deals that we’ve recently signed. Despite reports of slowing technology spend, we are seeing strong interest from the broker-dealer community, investing in leading-edge trading technology. This is a welcome sign, especially after a slow 2009 that saw a decent pullback in technology spend. Our customers are working to leverage our full solution set. We believe the deals shown on this slide represent just the beginning of our ability to deliver innovative products. And these opportunities will only get larger as we deliver.  
Supporting many of these deals are our data centers. There is a lot of customer focus on the upcoming Mahwah and Basildon go live dates set for later this year.
On Slide 6, we've included a simple strategy statement to help you better understand where we're going. Our aspiration is to lead our industry and redefine what it means to be an exchange in the 21st century. To achieve this, our mission will be simply to empower the world's capital markets community to innovate and collaborate. To achieve this, our core objectives will be to operate the most important capital markets; connect the members of the community through our ever-growing network; deliver innovative products to our continually expanding client base; and to enable customers to run their businesses more profitably by using our technology and scale that UTP and the data centers deliver. 
We have already gone a long way towards redefining what an exchange is. And we’ve moved from being just an operator of markets to much more. As many companies in other industries have done, we are moving across the value chain to improve our competitive position. The more customers and partners we have, the greater the network effect, which further validates the relevance of our community. In short, it is about getting more customers for our products and services, and more products and services for our customers. From our perspective, we think the sum of the parts is being undervalued, because we believe that our unique collection of assets and global reach offers us great revenue and cost synergies, which will ultimately yield the community premium that I mentioned earlier. 
Finally for me, on Slide 7, you will see a number of current issues where we are doing our best to demonstrate leadership. We will not go through each of these bullets individually this morning, but we'll highlight a few important ones.  
While Congress considered financial regulatory reform legislation, we were very active in advocating for ourselves, and more importantly on behalf of our list of companies. We believe that the Dodd-Frank Act will solidify and bolster our opportunities for future growth, particularly in derivatives. Going forward, the Act mandates hundreds of agency rule-makings. And we are already analyzing and prioritizing these rules and expect to play an active advocacy role on behalf of our clients, but also are committed to be an active participant with the regulators who are going to have to write all these rules. 
In terms of market structure, the events of May 6 put a spotlight on the need for improvements to our equity markets. This has created opportunities for us to demonstrate the benefits that the NYSE model brings to issuers, investors and the markets. We testified twice before Congress on market structure matters. And we spent considerable time with the SEC, the CFTC and the Joint Advisory Committee. We believe these opportunities have enhanced our standing with legislative and regulatory policy makers. 
More broadly, our efforts to advocate on behalf of our issuers and to be an influencer of public policy continue to be an important part of our value proposition. We’re working hard to represent our list of companies on issues like corporate governance, proxy access and Sarbanes-Oxley reform. As well as our continued opposition on a tax on transactions to ensure that investors’ interests are protected as well.
Turning to Europe, regulators are also embarking on a plethora of legislative initiatives on both market structure and financial regulation. Two years after its implementation, European policy makers are working on a comprehensive review of MiFID, although we don't expect firm proposals until early next year. We are hopeful that officials in Europe will learn some important lessons from the market fragmentation that has occurred in the U.S. and will avoid heading down the same path. We will also be working with European legislators to ensure an adequate assessment of the increasingly high level of non-transparent trading. We believe that a proper analysis of this issue calls for priority to be given to a more transparent price formation process and increased investor protection. 
Derivative regulation is also a key issue in Europe, as has been the case in the U.S. The European Commission will publish legislative proposals in September in keeping with the G-20 commitments, before central clearing of OTC derivative trades. It is our understanding that the Commission will present proposals next year as part of a MiFID revision to bring more OTC derivatives onto central lit platforms. 
That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn it over to Mike for a review of our quarter’s financial results. Mike?

Slide 8 provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter. Total revenues were flat year-over-year and up 15% versus the first quarter. Net revenue profits and diluted EPS are all up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The $0.7",2420,"Thanks, Duncan. Slide 8 provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter. Total revenues were flat year-over-year and up 15% versus the first quarter. Net revenue profits and diluted EPS are all up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The $0.70 EPS posted in the second quarter was the company's highest quarterly EPS since Q3 2008. 
Unless otherwise noted, all of our financials are presented in accordance with GAAP. As we progress through the latter stages of the post-merger integration, staff reduction and system harmonization efforts, we continue to incur high levels of severance charges, asset write-offs and real estate disposition costs. These discreet items are reported in merger and exit costs. Once we move into the new data centers and exit our legacy premises, we expect the occurrence of these costs to decline significantly.
This quarter, we reported a $32 million charge in merger and exit costs. This consisted of $14 million in cash charges, primarily for severance related to the FINRA transaction, reengineering the structure of local offices, and the U.S. VRIP. The remainder is related to real estate lease cancellations and disposal of legacy system applications. Last year's merger costs of $442 million was principally for the NYSE Liffe Clearing payment, which drove the GAAP loss for the quarter. In the quarter, we reported a $54 million gain from asset disposals, primarily related to the sale of our 5% stake in the National Stock Exchange of India. 
Now I'll review our financial results. From this point forward, we'll exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs just referenced, as well as the gains from disposal activities during the quarter.  
Slide 9 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the second quarter. Including merger and exit costs in the asset sales, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.64, up 25% on prior year's $0.51. Year-to-date EPS of $1.18 is up 26%. Q2 earnings performance was driven by a 7% increase in net revenue, and another quarter of solid expense management. 
Operating income was $247 million, up 15% compared to the second quarter of 2009. Operating margin rose to 38% this quarter and is 36% year-to-date. This compares to the full year operating margin of 32% for 2009. 
Our focus for 2010 is revenue growth and margin expansion. We are pleased with our progress on both fronts. We continue to grow EBITDA margin as well, posting a 48% mark for the quarter. The relatively fixed expense base, we have significant operating leverage on our incremental revenue and volume growth.
Slide 10 provides our segment results on a currency-neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened in this quarter versus both the euro and British pound. For the quarter, 48% of our net revenue was denominated in either euros or pounds. Currency impact was unfavorable, $19 million versus prior year and $22 million versus prior quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, second quarter net revenues grew 10% and operating income 20% versus Q2 of prior year. 
Operationally, our Derivative segment grew 38% and the Technology segment grew 33% versus Q2 prior year. Cash Trading and Listings revenue declined by 8%, attributed to lower revenues from BlueNext, our carbon trading venture, and lower U.S. volumes, and revenue capture in Europe. Our Derivatives and Technology profits nearly doubled versus Q2 prior year.
On Slide 11, we show our 2010 year-to-date net revenue split by business activity and segment, with comparison for the first half of 2009. The company continues to benefit from a diversified revenue base. 51% of our net revenues were generated by transaction and clearing fees in the first half of 2010. This is slightly higher than last year because of the strong Q2 volume in 2010 and the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing. We saw the contribution from Technology Services to show the most meaningful increase during the first half of 2010, the specific gains stemming from NYFIX, growth in our SFTI Europe network, and recent software and infrastructure sales.
Turning to our segments. Cash Trading and Listings comprised 48% of our net revenues in the first half of 2010; while the Derivative segment continued to be the fastest-growing segment, contributing 35% of our net revenues, up from 27% in the first half of 2009; followed by the Technology segment, which grew from 14% to 17% of revenue. Again, this is consistent with our revenue guidance and where we have invested in new initiatives.
Slide 12 and 13 detail the financial performance for our Global Derivatives segment. I'm not going to go through these slides in great detail but simply touch upon a few points. The Global Derivatives franchise continues to grow. Net revenues were $226 million in the second quarter, an increase of $57 million or 34% versus Q2 prior year, and are up 38% year-to-date. The increase is primarily driven by a $51 million increase in trading and clearing revenues due to strong volume growth in European Derivatives and U.S. Options, increased market share for U.S. Options, and the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing. 
Both our European Derivatives and U.S. Option venues experienced record volume days in the second quarter. For the quarter, volumes rose 38% and 57% respectively versus Q2 prior year. For one day in May, we handled over 16 million derivative contracts globally. NYSE Euronext was the largest U.S. equity options exchange operator in the marketplace for the second consecutive quarter, with a market share of 26%. 
The revenue capture for European derivatives, ex Bclear, was $0.64 per contract in the second quarter. This was up versus the second quarter of last year due to the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing, but down slightly versus the first quarter because of the stronger dollar. 
Rate per contract in the U.S. options was $0.17 per contract in the second quarter. This is down versus both the prior year and prior quarter. The reason for the decrease is largely attributable to an increase in Penny Pilot issues traded on NYSE Arca and minor pricing changes which are offset by market share gains.
Our Global Derivatives segment increased its margins to 62% in Q2, as we were able to leverage volume and revenue growth on a lower cost base. For the first half of 2010, this segment accounted for 50% of our operating income. 
Similarly, Slide 14 and 15 show you the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings net revenue was $321 million in the second quarter of 2010, down versus last year but up sequentially versus the first quarter. The year-over-year decrease was driven by a $21 million decline in net transaction revenue and a $14 million decline in other revenue. 
Decline in net transaction revenue was attributed to pricing reductions in European cash in 2009 and lower trading volumes in U.S. cash. This was somewhat mitigated by an 18% increase in European volumes during the quarter. Decline in other revenue is principally due to a decrease in volumes on BlueNext, our environmental trading exchange. However, we are actively looking at opportunity to build upon our BlueNext franchise and bolster our carbon trading operations.
Market share in the Euronext primary market was up slightly to 74% in the second quarter, but below the 79% in the second quarter of 2009. Revenue capture for U.S. cash was $0.03 per 100 shares, in line with expectations and recent trends. Revenue capture for European cash was $0.65 per transaction versus $0.90 in the prior year. The decline was attributed to the stronger dollar and a less favorable mix in part due to higher volumes.
NYSE Euronext global listing franchise gathered momentum in the first half of 2010. A total of nine companies with a combined market capital of over $30 billion have transferred from other exchanges to NYSE. Some of these companies include Knight Capital Group, Charles Schwab and Paragon Shipping. Furthermore, a total of 55 IPOs, with total proceeds of $13 billion, listed on our markets during the first six months of the year. 
Operating margin for the Cash Trading and Listings segment was 39% in the second quarter, up from 34% in Q1, and virtually flat with the second quarter of 2009.
Slide 16 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information Services and Technology Solutions net revenue was $107 million in the second quarter, an increase of $24 million or 29% from Q2 prior year. The increase is primarily driven by the NYFIX acquisition, growth in SFTI clients, and some large software and infrastructure sales. Revenues were slightly behind Q1, but on a currency-neutral basis grew 2%. 
Operating income was $20 million, a 67% increase from the prior year, and an 18% increase from the first quarter of 2010. Operating margin was 19% compared to 14% in the second quarter of '09 and 15% in Q1. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26%. 
Advanced cabinet reservations for our new U.S. and U.K. data centers continue to be strong, with both data centers nearly fully subscribed for cabinet space. Co-location revenues will begin to accelerate in the fourth quarter, and reach their annualized level in Q2 2011 once we complete the application migrations to the data centers. The data centers are set to go live in Mahwah in September and Basildon in October.
Slide 17 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. We continue to make excellent progress in lowering our cost base in real terms, while funding incremental investment to grow the business. Q2 expenses were $20 million below the first quarter. After adjusting for favorable impact of the stronger dollar and for incremental data center integration spending, fixed costs were $15 million below Q1 on an apples-to-apples basis. Second quarter operating expenses were up $10 million versus last year on a reported basis. 
Q2 2009 included a onetime $10 million benefit curtailment related to changes made to our retiree benefit plan. After adjusting for this, FX and the impact of acquisitions such as NYSE Liffe Clearing and MiFID, fixed operating costs were down $29 million or 7% from the second quarter of 2009. 
Looking at the first half of 2010 on a constant-dollar constant-portfolio basis, our underlying fixed expenses were down $71 million or 9% compared to the first half of 2009. We continue to make good progress and are focused on efficiency and productivity improvement that will further reduce operating expenses for NYSE Euronext.
Slide 18 provides an update to our annual expense guidance. In March, when we provided fixed expense guidance for 2010, we indicated that this guidance was predicated on the average FX rates for 2009. These were $1.39 for the euro and $1.57 for the pound. Given the direction of rates in the first half, we felt it appropriate to adjust our full year guidance to reflect a scenario more in line with current currency trends. Applying the rate of $1.30 for the euro and $1.50 for the pound, our revised fixed cost range is now between $1.685 million to $1.729 million. Likewise, should these rates be applicable for 2011, our prior guidance of cost to be below $1.650 million will be adjusted accordingly. 
In the second quarter, 60% of our operating expenses were denominated in dollars, 20% in euros and 20% in pounds. Although we've adjusted the cost range solely for currency, our first half expense performance of $834 million coupled with efficiency initiatives in the pipeline provides us increasing comfort that we will achieve our cost guidance for 2010. 
Our staffing level as of June 30 is 2,993 full-time positions, which is 374 positions or 11% below year end levels. Roughly 165 of these reductions relate to the recent outsourcing of certain regulatory activities to FINRA. Approximately $11 million per quarter in compensation expense related to this headcount transfer will now be reflected in the professional services line. For the most part, the social plan and U.S. VRIP programs have now been fully executed and are compete. We will continue to pursue a number of process efficiency improvements which will further reduce expenses into 2011.
That said, we do expect cost to rise somewhat in the second half attributable to migration into our new data centers, investment in our new European clearinghouses, and launching of interest rate futures in the U.S. In addition to the integration and transition costs, we expect to begin depreciating the new data centers as we go live in the latter part of the third quarter, adding incremental depreciation costs of approximately $15 million dollars in the second half. Over time, this will be mitigated as we exit some legacy data centers.
Slide 19 details our cash and debt position as of June 30, 2010. After investing a significant amount of capital for building two state-of-the-art data centers, in-sourcing Liffe Clearing, restructuring operations and investing in other avenues of growth, we indicated late last year that our focus will be on de-levering our balance sheet. In just six months, we've made significant progress towards these goals and are now operating well within our long-term target leverage levels. Our debt leverage this quarter has declined to slightly below 1.9x debt to EBITDA versus 2.6x at year end 2009. This improvement is the result of double-digit growth in EBITDA, coupled with significant debt repayment. 
During the second quarter, our gross debt declined $434 million to $2.2 billion. Proceeds from the disposition of NSE, coupled with strong operating cash flows, enabled a sizable repayment of short-term debt. 
Cash and other financial instruments was $419 million at the end of June 2010. That compares favorably to our short-term debt, which is now below $300 million. For the second quarter of 2010, capital expenditures were $70 million, of which $26 million was for building out for our data centers. 
Having reached our comfort zone with regards to leverage, we are revisiting how best to allocate capital going forward, besides just paying down debt. This will entail investing for growth and possibly returning excess cash flows to our shareholders. We’re comfortable with the dividend at current levels, as the payout ratio remains above pre-crisis levels, while we still have an outstanding share buyback authorization. We are currently rated AA- by S&P and A3 by Moody's. The S&P rating is under credit watch, which we expect will be addressed shortly.
And finally, last week the Board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the third quarter of 2010, which is payable on September 30. With that, let me turn the call back to Duncan for some closing remarks, and then you take your questions.

So just to recap, we're obviously very pleased with our results for the quarter. I think they were strong, driven by record trading volumes, our derivatives franchise, and year-over-year growth in Technology Services revenue from NYFIX. I think we also continued to show cost discipline during the quarter. And we remained focused on proceeding with our company-wide efficiency efforts that will address globalizing our operations, reducing process complexity and streamlining organizational contracts. 
We are on the cusp of concluding a multi-year project with the lighting up of our new data centers which we expect will serve as a cornerstone of our Technology Services growth story. We are signing more major client deals and establishing more commercial exchange partnerships than ever before, based on the superior quality and breadth of technology assets that we have brought together with our organic development and acquisitions the past couple of years. 
And we have several other new initiatives that are in the wings that will drive our future growth, including NYPC and our European clearing initiatives set for later on in '11, '12. With these initiatives, we are indeed redefining what it means to be an exchange in the 21st century. So with that, we’ll wrap it up, and we’d like to open the line for your questions.

What happened was NASDAQ declared self-help against Arca, which lasted 20 minutes. We believe that was due to a server latency on about 20 symbols that lasted five minutes in Tape C. The other exchanges didn’t -- that’s declared self-help for about seven minutes, and that was due to the fact that some of the prices they were sending us violated our price bands. And when we spoke to them on the phone, they cleared that up relatively quickly. Our direct feeds did not experience latency, as far as we know, in terms of market data. There were some issues potentially on the SIP, meaning the consolidated feed, but probably about 85% or 90% of our volume actually comes from direct feeds. That's another misinformation that’s generally in the market, which is that, in general, consolidated feeds go to retail customers and people who are viewing it with their eyeballs. Most volume is actually generated from direct feeds. That said, on that period, we experienced a tripling of quotes in trades during that burst of about five minutes. When the May 6 event occurred, those were record volumes of message traffic. And I think that we always keep an eye on capacity, and have made -- we're actually in the process of some capacity expansion on the May 6 date that has subsequently been completed. I think it's something that we're always careful about. Volumes are down a bit again after the second quarter, I think everybody’s seen July. But that's partly seasonally. But I think it’s something that we’re just always cognizant of and always reviewing.

One is obviously the technology build that had to be done. That's been going apace. That's ahead of schedule, now that the regulatory approval’s been a little bit slower than we would have anticipated a few months ago. So the technology work for this is well underway, and will be delivered I would say now comfortably ahead of any approval we would get. Just remember the comment period will be roughly 90 days. So assuming that there's no glitches there, which we don't anticipate, and that the clients we want connected, or who are already in the process of connecting are connecting, we'd be able to turn this on very, very quickly after approval. Realistically, I think we have to start thinking about this in our own minds as a January of 2011 events. Because even if we went out for comment this month and got all the requisite approvals by the end of this year, I wouldn't anticipate that we would launch something like this the first or second week of December. I think we’d probably get advice from our clients that would say, let's come out of the gate after the new year, ready to go. So we would suggest that, other than the kind of calendar stuff I just talked about, the technology and connectivity, which would be the other two things you would want to have ready, will be absolutely ready by the time we get the approval.

And that’s always a challenge. I think what we’re trying to do, both in Europe and particularly in the U.S. going forward, is have our tiering float more appropriately with market volume to try to insulate, both us and our clients to be honest, from getting stuck in a higher tier if volumes drop off. And likewise get pushed into a lower tier if volumes explode. And tried to sort of mitigate some of that, and we’ve implemented that. In addition the -- by the way it’s evolved over time, the European pricing model is overly complex. Because we have this whole agency principal, designation, it's a very complicated system. And we’re working right now with our clients on a way to make that simpler. Because it will make them -- it’s easier for them to make their routing decisions and figure out how they’re going to run their business. Because the reality is what they want is to be able to understand what their rates are going to be and not have them just come out in a certain place based on either volumes or mixes of business or likewise. In terms of volumes, obviously, we don’t -- we can’t do any forecasting there. Your guess is as good as ours. What we kind of note, particularly in the U.S., is while July was down versus the previous month as we've seen, on one hand June is always a very seasonably busy quarter because of Russell and other things, and July for 2010 was higher than July of 2009. So what conclusions you can draw from there are beyond me.

So I wouldn’t say we’re changing that outlook, I mean you’re going to have quarters where the volumes are strong and the margins are going to be that much stronger. I wouldn’t extrapolate the second quarter as being our run rate, because we did have pretty strong volumes. But with 36% year-to-date, I think we're on track to higher margins that we had last year, and certainly moving in the direction of our guidance.

I don't know how near-term it's going to be, because I think it's going to take a while for all of this to be codified.

So I think there might be some kind of a data opportunity for us. But I don't know how much there’s -- of an opportunity there’s going to be for listing these various products. So I don't think they’re going to be that actively traded in the near-term. Lastly, you're absolutely right, I think our view is to be a force in OTC derivative clearing, you need to own the assets. I think we're on our way to owning potential assets with the clearinghouse build-outs in Europe and the NYPC build-out here in the U.S. But we said publicly before, short of actually owning those assets, it's difficult to play a role if you don't have the clearinghouse assets. So as you would correctly expect, that’s part of the reason behind us trying to build out some of these clearing assets because it's then limitless, the products we can clear in those houses.

I could see it going down a little bit from here. I wouldn't expect much movement the balance of this year because, remember, as we finish the UTP migration and we’re lighting up the new data centers, which then puts us in position to decommission the older data centers, I wouldn't expect too much change in that, in the status quo on our headcount now for the balance of this year. I think there is a possibility that when UTP is done and when all the data center migration and decommissioning is done, you could see another leg down. But I don't think we want to anticipate that. Because at the same time, we've got a Technology Services business that is growing. And those require a different kind of potentially consultative sales force, so you could see us add some people there. So I would say in the near-term, those trends kind of offset. Now a lot of the operational efficiency gains that were talked -- that I referenced earlier in my remarks, I think could lead to some headcount changes on the margin.

I think that we will be going down further as the data center is finished, as UTP finalizes and as we -- we’re globalizing operations, remember, we’d have the Belfast initiative. A lot of that is going to hit the consultant headcount where so the mix of employees versus consultants will probably change a bit, swinging a little bit more towards the employees. But we're constantly looking for, and it will be in the realm of process reengineering, simplification and globalization towards reducing headcount. If not our primary goal -- our primary goal is cost. And the heads that are coming out as this year progresses and as we hit the end of the data center projects, et cetera, we are really built into Mike's cost guidance. So that while we haven't given a headcount guidance, that was kind of where we were headed for cost, and to be honest, not all those are headcount either. That’s not really our primary focus. But clearly, as you simplify systems, that's a natural result.

We'll probably continue to do it at 8:00 a.m. New York time. 
I'm going to start with Slide 3 in the deck, and just hit a few highlights on that slide. I think you can see from the slide and from the press release this morning, we had a very strong second quarter. We're growing our Derivatives business. We're stabilizing our Cash Equities business, and we're providing innovative technologies solutions in that business. Our results, which reflect the continued trend of improving financial performance, were driven by stronger trading volumes, increased revenue generation from our new initiatives and continued cost discipline. 
We recorded a 25% increase in EPS to $0.64 per share and a 15% increase in operating income on a 7% increase in net revenue, with incremental margins of 76%. These results reflect the growing earnings power from our three primary businesses and the inherent operating leverage in the model. Firstly, our Derivatives segment benefited from record trading volumes as well as the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing. During the month of May, we executed an average of 13 million contracts per day across our Global Derivatives businesses, driving a 34% increase in net revenue with an increase in our operating margin to 62%, up from 42% the prior year. We were the largest U.S. equities options exchange for the second consecutive quarter.
Turning to Cash and Listings in the first half of 2010, we continue to use see strong demand for our listing venues, both in terms of transfers and new listings. On the execution side, we are continuing to focus on stability and profitability of this business. In the U.S., our market share in Tape A is at 37%, up from 35% in the first quarter. And our share in Europe is holding steady at 74%. 
Additionally, on July 13, we launched trading on Tape C stocks on an unlisted trading privilege basis over the NYSE Amex platform. Trading began with 10 issues and now has expanded to approximately 675 NASDAQ listed issues. And we've seen some positive market share developments. 
Lastly, our Technology business benefited from the addition of NYFIX and improved software sales, driving a 29% increase in revenue and an increase in operating margin to 19%. I will walk you through the profiles of several deals that we’ve signed in the past few months later in the presentation. They are representative of the enterprise level dialogues that we are having with market participants, encouraging them to leverage our technology to help them run their businesses more efficiently.
As we invest in our future growth and drive our revenue generation, we are maintaining strong expense discipline as well. Our fixed operating expenses in the second quarter on a constant-dollar basis were down $29 million or 7% from the prior year period. 
Before I move to Slide 4, let me touch briefly on a few select business highlights for the quarter. Building upon our success with the launch of NYSE Liffe Clearing last July, we have announced our intention to build two new clearinghouses in London and Paris for our European Derivatives and Cash businesses. The economics for clearing are very favorable. And it is our intention to have the new clearinghouses live by mid-to-late '12. We continue to await regulatory approval of our NYSE Amex options and NYPC semi-mutualizations. 
In terms of NYPC, we now have a full management team in place. The intensive regulatory review and approval process for NYPC continues to make progress. And we appreciate all the regulatory agencies for their substantial resources they are committing to thoroughly analyze this innovative new clearing model. Given the recent focus on clearinghouses and risk in the newly enacted Financial Regulatory Reform bill, regulators are being appropriately diligent in their analysis. And we are still hoping for regulatory approvals later in the fall.
Our agreement with FINRA, under which they assume responsibility for performing the market surveillance and enforcement functions previously conducted by NYSE Regulation is affective and we believe this agreement is an important step towards consolidated market surveillance, the need for which was highlighted in the events of May 6. 
I am pleased to report that our data center migration is on track. We are establishing the liquidity hubs of the future. And Mike will address the timing of the incremental depreciation and amortization for the second half of 2010.  
Lastly, as we committed to on our last quarter's call, we have continued to de-lever, and year-to-date we have reduced our outstanding debt by more than $500 million. 
In summary, while we are pleased with our strong results for the quarter, driven by higher volumes across most of our venues and a growing base of recurring Technology Services revenue, we still have much to do. We are focused on executing against our long-term strategy of operating the most meaningful capital markets, creating even broader and deeper networks of productivity, and delivering innovative products to our expanding client base. We have, and will, continue to redefine what an exchange is in the 21st century.
Now please turn to Slide 4. The priorities on this slide highlight our goal of creating a community premium, using our scale and scope to benefit not only our own business but our customers' businesses as well. We can achieve this through initiatives and offerings like co-location, co-branding, advocacy and our global distribution network. At the center of the company and in support of our three businesses is UTP, our global integrated and scalable trading platform, an unrivaled global connectivity network and customer gateway; our focus on clearing, which will take on an greater importance in '11 and '12; and two brand-new world-class data centers, set for launch in September and October of this year.
Turning to Slide 5. We have several recent NYSE technology wins, which reflect the growing interest in our full-managed solutions capabilities. The Technology business, as I alluded to earlier, has performed well to date. And approximately 80% of the revenues in this business are recurring. On the exchange partnership side of the business, we continue to land large client deals. As you will recall, last year we signed a partnership with the Qatar Exchange to build their cash and derivatives platforms. And just a few weeks ago, we signed a multi-year eight-figure deal with the Warsaw Stock Exchange to migrate WSE's cash and derivatives markets to NYSE Technologies Universal Trading Platform. In addition, we plan to collaborate with the WSE on other mutually beneficial business initiatives. 
Regarding the more traditional client side, you will note on the chart a few examples of deals that we’ve recently signed. Despite reports of slowing technology spend, we are seeing strong interest from the broker-dealer community, investing in leading-edge trading technology. This is a welcome sign, especially after a slow 2009 that saw a decent pullback in technology spend. Our customers are working to leverage our full solution set. We believe the deals shown on this slide represent just the beginning of our ability to deliver innovative products. And these opportunities will only get larger as we deliver.  
Supporting many of these deals are our data centers. There is a lot of customer focus on the upcoming Mahwah and Basildon go live dates set for later this year.
On Slide 6, we've included a simple strategy statement to help you better understand where we're going. Our aspiration is to lead our industry and redefine what it means to be an exchange in the 21st century. To achieve this, our mission will be simply to empower the world's capital markets community to innovate and collaborate. To achieve this, our core objectives will be to operate the most important capital markets; connect the members of the community through our ever-growing network; deliver innovative products to our continually expanding client base; and to enable customers to run their businesses more profitably by using our technology and scale that UTP and the data centers deliver. 
We have already gone a long way towards redefining what an exchange is. And we’ve moved from being just an operator of markets to much more. As many companies in other industries have done, we are moving across the value chain to improve our competitive position. The more customers and partners we have, the greater the network effect, which further validates the relevance of our community. In short, it is about getting more customers for our products and services, and more products and services for our customers. From our perspective, we think the sum of the parts is being undervalued, because we believe that our unique collection of assets and global reach offers us great revenue and cost synergies, which will ultimately yield the community premium that I mentioned earlier. 
Finally for me, on Slide 7, you will see a number of current issues where we are doing our best to demonstrate leadership. We will not go through each of these bullets individually this morning, but we'll highlight a few important ones.  
While Congress considered financial regulatory reform legislation, we were very active in advocating for ourselves, and more importantly on behalf of our list of companies. We believe that the Dodd-Frank Act will solidify and bolster our opportunities for future growth, particularly in derivatives. Going forward, the Act mandates hundreds of agency rule-makings. And we are already analyzing and prioritizing these rules and expect to play an active advocacy role on behalf of our clients, but also are committed to be an active participant with the regulators who are going to have to write all these rules. 
In terms of market structure, the events of May 6 put a spotlight on the need for improvements to our equity markets. This has created opportunities for us to demonstrate the benefits that the NYSE model brings to issuers, investors and the markets. We testified twice before Congress on market structure matters. And we spent considerable time with the SEC, the CFTC and the Joint Advisory Committee. We believe these opportunities have enhanced our standing with legislative and regulatory policy makers. 
More broadly, our efforts to advocate on behalf of our issuers and to be an influencer of public policy continue to be an important part of our value proposition. We’re working hard to represent our list of companies on issues like corporate governance, proxy access and Sarbanes-Oxley reform. As well as our continued opposition on a tax on transactions to ensure that investors’ interests are protected as well.
Turning to Europe, regulators are also embarking on a plethora of legislative initiatives on both market structure and financial regulation. Two years after its implementation, European policy makers are working on a comprehensive review of MiFID, although we don't expect firm proposals until early next year. We are hopeful that officials in Europe will learn some important lessons from the market fragmentation that has occurred in the U.S. and will avoid heading down the same path. We will also be working with European legislators to ensure an adequate assessment of the increasingly high level of non-transparent trading. We believe that a proper analysis of this issue calls for priority to be given to a more transparent price formation process and increased investor protection. 
Derivative regulation is also a key issue in Europe, as has been the case in the U.S. The European Commission will publish legislative proposals in September in keeping with the G-20 commitments, before central clearing of OTC derivative trades. It is our understanding that the Commission will present proposals next year as part of a MiFID revision to bring more OTC derivatives onto central lit platforms. 
That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn it over to Mike for a review of our quarter’s financial results. Mike?"

Slide 8 provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter. Total revenues were flat year-over-year and up 15% versus the first quarter. Net revenue profits and diluted EPS are all up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The $0.7",2420,"Thanks, Duncan. Slide 8 provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter. Total revenues were flat year-over-year and up 15% versus the first quarter. Net revenue profits and diluted EPS are all up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The $0.70 EPS posted in the second quarter was the company's highest quarterly EPS since Q3 2008. 
Unless otherwise noted, all of our financials are presented in accordance with GAAP. As we progress through the latter stages of the post-merger integration, staff reduction and system harmonization efforts, we continue to incur high levels of severance charges, asset write-offs and real estate disposition costs. These discreet items are reported in merger and exit costs. Once we move into the new data centers and exit our legacy premises, we expect the occurrence of these costs to decline significantly.
This quarter, we reported a $32 million charge in merger and exit costs. This consisted of $14 million in cash charges, primarily for severance related to the FINRA transaction, reengineering the structure of local offices, and the U.S. VRIP. The remainder is related to real estate lease cancellations and disposal of legacy system applications. Last year's merger costs of $442 million was principally for the NYSE Liffe Clearing payment, which drove the GAAP loss for the quarter. In the quarter, we reported a $54 million gain from asset disposals, primarily related to the sale of our 5% stake in the National Stock Exchange of India. 
Now I'll review our financial results. From this point forward, we'll exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs just referenced, as well as the gains from disposal activities during the quarter.  
Slide 9 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the second quarter. Including merger and exit costs in the asset sales, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.64, up 25% on prior year's $0.51. Year-to-date EPS of $1.18 is up 26%. Q2 earnings performance was driven by a 7% increase in net revenue, and another quarter of solid expense management. 
Operating income was $247 million, up 15% compared to the second quarter of 2009. Operating margin rose to 38% this quarter and is 36% year-to-date. This compares to the full year operating margin of 32% for 2009. 
Our focus for 2010 is revenue growth and margin expansion. We are pleased with our progress on both fronts. We continue to grow EBITDA margin as well, posting a 48% mark for the quarter. The relatively fixed expense base, we have significant operating leverage on our incremental revenue and volume growth.
Slide 10 provides our segment results on a currency-neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened in this quarter versus both the euro and British pound. For the quarter, 48% of our net revenue was denominated in either euros or pounds. Currency impact was unfavorable, $19 million versus prior year and $22 million versus prior quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, second quarter net revenues grew 10% and operating income 20% versus Q2 of prior year. 
Operationally, our Derivative segment grew 38% and the Technology segment grew 33% versus Q2 prior year. Cash Trading and Listings revenue declined by 8%, attributed to lower revenues from BlueNext, our carbon trading venture, and lower U.S. volumes, and revenue capture in Europe. Our Derivatives and Technology profits nearly doubled versus Q2 prior year.
On Slide 11, we show our 2010 year-to-date net revenue split by business activity and segment, with comparison for the first half of 2009. The company continues to benefit from a diversified revenue base. 51% of our net revenues were generated by transaction and clearing fees in the first half of 2010. This is slightly higher than last year because of the strong Q2 volume in 2010 and the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing. We saw the contribution from Technology Services to show the most meaningful increase during the first half of 2010, the specific gains stemming from NYFIX, growth in our SFTI Europe network, and recent software and infrastructure sales.
Turning to our segments. Cash Trading and Listings comprised 48% of our net revenues in the first half of 2010; while the Derivative segment continued to be the fastest-growing segment, contributing 35% of our net revenues, up from 27% in the first half of 2009; followed by the Technology segment, which grew from 14% to 17% of revenue. Again, this is consistent with our revenue guidance and where we have invested in new initiatives.
Slide 12 and 13 detail the financial performance for our Global Derivatives segment. I'm not going to go through these slides in great detail but simply touch upon a few points. The Global Derivatives franchise continues to grow. Net revenues were $226 million in the second quarter, an increase of $57 million or 34% versus Q2 prior year, and are up 38% year-to-date. The increase is primarily driven by a $51 million increase in trading and clearing revenues due to strong volume growth in European Derivatives and U.S. Options, increased market share for U.S. Options, and the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing. 
Both our European Derivatives and U.S. Option venues experienced record volume days in the second quarter. For the quarter, volumes rose 38% and 57% respectively versus Q2 prior year. For one day in May, we handled over 16 million derivative contracts globally. NYSE Euronext was the largest U.S. equity options exchange operator in the marketplace for the second consecutive quarter, with a market share of 26%. 
The revenue capture for European derivatives, ex Bclear, was $0.64 per contract in the second quarter. This was up versus the second quarter of last year due to the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing, but down slightly versus the first quarter because of the stronger dollar. 
Rate per contract in the U.S. options was $0.17 per contract in the second quarter. This is down versus both the prior year and prior quarter. The reason for the decrease is largely attributable to an increase in Penny Pilot issues traded on NYSE Arca and minor pricing changes which are offset by market share gains.
Our Global Derivatives segment increased its margins to 62% in Q2, as we were able to leverage volume and revenue growth on a lower cost base. For the first half of 2010, this segment accounted for 50% of our operating income. 
Similarly, Slide 14 and 15 show you the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings net revenue was $321 million in the second quarter of 2010, down versus last year but up sequentially versus the first quarter. The year-over-year decrease was driven by a $21 million decline in net transaction revenue and a $14 million decline in other revenue. 
Decline in net transaction revenue was attributed to pricing reductions in European cash in 2009 and lower trading volumes in U.S. cash. This was somewhat mitigated by an 18% increase in European volumes during the quarter. Decline in other revenue is principally due to a decrease in volumes on BlueNext, our environmental trading exchange. However, we are actively looking at opportunity to build upon our BlueNext franchise and bolster our carbon trading operations.
Market share in the Euronext primary market was up slightly to 74% in the second quarter, but below the 79% in the second quarter of 2009. Revenue capture for U.S. cash was $0.03 per 100 shares, in line with expectations and recent trends. Revenue capture for European cash was $0.65 per transaction versus $0.90 in the prior year. The decline was attributed to the stronger dollar and a less favorable mix in part due to higher volumes.
NYSE Euronext global listing franchise gathered momentum in the first half of 2010. A total of nine companies with a combined market capital of over $30 billion have transferred from other exchanges to NYSE. Some of these companies include Knight Capital Group, Charles Schwab and Paragon Shipping. Furthermore, a total of 55 IPOs, with total proceeds of $13 billion, listed on our markets during the first six months of the year. 
Operating margin for the Cash Trading and Listings segment was 39% in the second quarter, up from 34% in Q1, and virtually flat with the second quarter of 2009.
Slide 16 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information Services and Technology Solutions net revenue was $107 million in the second quarter, an increase of $24 million or 29% from Q2 prior year. The increase is primarily driven by the NYFIX acquisition, growth in SFTI clients, and some large software and infrastructure sales. Revenues were slightly behind Q1, but on a currency-neutral basis grew 2%. 
Operating income was $20 million, a 67% increase from the prior year, and an 18% increase from the first quarter of 2010. Operating margin was 19% compared to 14% in the second quarter of '09 and 15% in Q1. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26%. 
Advanced cabinet reservations for our new U.S. and U.K. data centers continue to be strong, with both data centers nearly fully subscribed for cabinet space. Co-location revenues will begin to accelerate in the fourth quarter, and reach their annualized level in Q2 2011 once we complete the application migrations to the data centers. The data centers are set to go live in Mahwah in September and Basildon in October.
Slide 17 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. We continue to make excellent progress in lowering our cost base in real terms, while funding incremental investment to grow the business. Q2 expenses were $20 million below the first quarter. After adjusting for favorable impact of the stronger dollar and for incremental data center integration spending, fixed costs were $15 million below Q1 on an apples-to-apples basis. Second quarter operating expenses were up $10 million versus last year on a reported basis. 
Q2 2009 included a onetime $10 million benefit curtailment related to changes made to our retiree benefit plan. After adjusting for this, FX and the impact of acquisitions such as NYSE Liffe Clearing and MiFID, fixed operating costs were down $29 million or 7% from the second quarter of 2009. 
Looking at the first half of 2010 on a constant-dollar constant-portfolio basis, our underlying fixed expenses were down $71 million or 9% compared to the first half of 2009. We continue to make good progress and are focused on efficiency and productivity improvement that will further reduce operating expenses for NYSE Euronext.
Slide 18 provides an update to our annual expense guidance. In March, when we provided fixed expense guidance for 2010, we indicated that this guidance was predicated on the average FX rates for 2009. These were $1.39 for the euro and $1.57 for the pound. Given the direction of rates in the first half, we felt it appropriate to adjust our full year guidance to reflect a scenario more in line with current currency trends. Applying the rate of $1.30 for the euro and $1.50 for the pound, our revised fixed cost range is now between $1.685 million to $1.729 million. Likewise, should these rates be applicable for 2011, our prior guidance of cost to be below $1.650 million will be adjusted accordingly. 
In the second quarter, 60% of our operating expenses were denominated in dollars, 20% in euros and 20% in pounds. Although we've adjusted the cost range solely for currency, our first half expense performance of $834 million coupled with efficiency initiatives in the pipeline provides us increasing comfort that we will achieve our cost guidance for 2010. 
Our staffing level as of June 30 is 2,993 full-time positions, which is 374 positions or 11% below year end levels. Roughly 165 of these reductions relate to the recent outsourcing of certain regulatory activities to FINRA. Approximately $11 million per quarter in compensation expense related to this headcount transfer will now be reflected in the professional services line. For the most part, the social plan and U.S. VRIP programs have now been fully executed and are compete. We will continue to pursue a number of process efficiency improvements which will further reduce expenses into 2011.
That said, we do expect cost to rise somewhat in the second half attributable to migration into our new data centers, investment in our new European clearinghouses, and launching of interest rate futures in the U.S. In addition to the integration and transition costs, we expect to begin depreciating the new data centers as we go live in the latter part of the third quarter, adding incremental depreciation costs of approximately $15 million dollars in the second half. Over time, this will be mitigated as we exit some legacy data centers.
Slide 19 details our cash and debt position as of June 30, 2010. After investing a significant amount of capital for building two state-of-the-art data centers, in-sourcing Liffe Clearing, restructuring operations and investing in other avenues of growth, we indicated late last year that our focus will be on de-levering our balance sheet. In just six months, we've made significant progress towards these goals and are now operating well within our long-term target leverage levels. Our debt leverage this quarter has declined to slightly below 1.9x debt to EBITDA versus 2.6x at year end 2009. This improvement is the result of double-digit growth in EBITDA, coupled with significant debt repayment. 
During the second quarter, our gross debt declined $434 million to $2.2 billion. Proceeds from the disposition of NSE, coupled with strong operating cash flows, enabled a sizable repayment of short-term debt. 
Cash and other financial instruments was $419 million at the end of June 2010. That compares favorably to our short-term debt, which is now below $300 million. For the second quarter of 2010, capital expenditures were $70 million, of which $26 million was for building out for our data centers. 
Having reached our comfort zone with regards to leverage, we are revisiting how best to allocate capital going forward, besides just paying down debt. This will entail investing for growth and possibly returning excess cash flows to our shareholders. We’re comfortable with the dividend at current levels, as the payout ratio remains above pre-crisis levels, while we still have an outstanding share buyback authorization. We are currently rated AA- by S&P and A3 by Moody's. The S&P rating is under credit watch, which we expect will be addressed shortly.
And finally, last week the Board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the third quarter of 2010, which is payable on September 30. With that, let me turn the call back to Duncan for some closing remarks, and then you take your questions."

So just to recap, we're obviously very pleased with our results for the quarter. I think they were strong, driven by record trading volumes, our derivatives franchise, and year-over-year growth in Technology Services revenue from NYFIX. I think we also continued to show cost discipline during the quarter. And we remained focused on proceeding with our company-wide efficiency efforts that will address globalizing our operations, reducing process complexity and streamlining organizational contracts. 
We are on the cusp of concluding a multi-year project with the lighting up of our new data centers which we expect will serve as a cornerstone of our Technology Services growth story. We are signing more major client deals and establishing more commercial exchange partnerships than ever before, based on the superior quality and breadth of technology assets that we have brought together with our organic development and acquisitions the past couple of years. 
And we have several other new initiatives that are in the wings that will drive our future growth, including NYPC and our European clearing initiatives set for later on in '11, '12. With these initiatives, we are indeed redefining what it means to be an exchange in the 21st century. So with that, we’ll wrap it up, and we’d like to open the line for your questions.

What happened was NASDAQ declared self-help against Arca, which lasted 20 minutes. We believe that was due to a server latency on about 20 symbols that lasted five minutes in Tape C. The other exchanges didn’t -- that’s declared self-help for about seven minutes, and that was due to the fact that some of the prices they were sending us violated our price bands. And when we spoke to them on the phone, they cleared that up relatively quickly. Our direct feeds did not experience latency, as far as we know, in terms of market data. There were some issues potentially on the SIP, meaning the consolidated feed, but probably about 85% or 90% of our volume actually comes from direct feeds. That's another misinformation that’s generally in the market, which is that, in general, consolidated feeds go to retail customers and people who are viewing it with their eyeballs. Most volume is actually generated from direct feeds. That said, on that period, we experienced a tripling of quotes in trades during that burst of about five minutes. When the May 6 event occurred, those were record volumes of message traffic. And I think that we always keep an eye on capacity, and have made -- we're actually in the process of some capacity expansion on the May 6 date that has subsequently been completed. I think it's something that we're always careful about. Volumes are down a bit again after the second quarter, I think everybody’s seen July. But that's partly seasonally.

But what they’re also fueling along the way, as you saw in some of the deals we outlined, is a general turning to the market centers for infrastructure support, both on their trading hub and their market data hubs.

So assuming that there's no glitches there, which we don't anticipate, and that the clients we want connected, or who are already in the process of connecting are connecting, we'd be able to turn this on very, very quickly after approval. Realistically, I think we have to start thinking about this in our own minds as a January of 2011 events. Because even if we went out for comment this month and got all the requisite approvals by the end of this year, I wouldn't anticipate that we would launch something like this the first or second week of December. I think we’d probably get advice from our clients that would say, let's come out of the gate after the new year, ready to go.

And that’s always a challenge. I think what we’re trying to do, both in Europe and particularly in the U.S. going forward, is have our tiering float more appropriately with market volume to try to insulate, both us and our clients to be honest, from getting stuck in a higher tier if volumes drop off. And likewise get pushed into a lower tier if volumes explode. And tried to sort of mitigate some of that, and we’ve implemented that. In addition the -- by the way it’s evolved over time, the European pricing model is overly complex. Because we have this whole agency principal, designation, it's a very complicated system. And we’re working right now with our clients on a way to make that simpler. Because it will make them -- it’s easier for them to make their routing decisions and figure out how they’re going to run their business. Because the reality is what they want is to be able to understand what their rates are going to be and not have them just come out in a certain place based on either volumes or mixes of business or likewise. In terms of volumes, obviously, we don’t -- we can’t do any forecasting there. Your guess is as good as ours. What we kind of note, particularly in the U.S., is while July was down versus the previous month as we've seen, on one hand June is always a very seasonably busy quarter because of Russell and other things, and July for 2010 was higher than July of 2009.

I think there is a possibility that when UTP is done and when all the data center migration and decommissioning is done, you could see another leg down. But I don't think we want to anticipate that.

A lot of that is going to hit the consultant headcount where so the mix of employees versus consultants will probably change a bit, swinging a little bit more towards the employees. But we're constantly looking for, and it will be in the realm of process reengineering, simplification and globalization towards reducing headcount. If not our primary goal -- our primary goal is cost. And the heads that are coming out as this year progresses and as we hit the end of the data center projects, et cetera, we are really built into Mike's cost guidance.

So look for us to do the third quarter earnings review from there. The good news for all of you is we won't be doing it at 8:00 a.m. Paris time. We'll probably continue to do it at 8:00 a.m. New York time. 
I'm going to start with Slide 3 in the deck, and just hit a few highlights on that slide. I think you can see from the slide and from the press release this morning, we had a very strong second quarter. We're growing our Derivatives business. We're stabilizing our Cash Equities business, and we're providing innovative technologies solutions in that business. Our results, which reflect the continued trend of improving financial performance, were driven by stronger trading volumes, increased revenue generation from our new initiatives and continued cost discipline. 
We recorded a 25% increase in EPS to $0.64 per share and a 15% increase in operating income on a 7% increase in net revenue, with incremental margins of 76%. These results reflect the growing earnings power from our three primary businesses and the inherent operating leverage in the model. Firstly, our Derivatives segment benefited from record trading volumes as well as the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing. During the month of May, we executed an average of 13 million contracts per day across our Global Derivatives businesses, driving a 34% increase in net revenue with an increase in our operating margin to 62%, up from 42% the prior year. We were the largest U.S. equities options exchange for the second consecutive quarter.
Turning to Cash and Listings in the first half of 2010, we continue to use see strong demand for our listing venues, both in terms of transfers and new listings. On the execution side, we are continuing to focus on stability and profitability of this business. In the U.S., our market share in Tape A is at 37%, up from 35% in the first quarter. And our share in Europe is holding steady at 74%. 
Additionally, on July 13, we launched trading on Tape C stocks on an unlisted trading privilege basis over the NYSE Amex platform. Trading began with 10 issues and now has expanded to approximately 675 NASDAQ listed issues. And we've seen some positive market share developments. 
Lastly, our Technology business benefited from the addition of NYFIX and improved software sales, driving a 29% increase in revenue and an increase in operating margin to 19%. I will walk you through the profiles of several deals that we’ve signed in the past few months later in the presentation. They are representative of the enterprise level dialogues that we are having with market participants, encouraging them to leverage our technology to help them run their businesses more efficiently.
As we invest in our future growth and drive our revenue generation, we are maintaining strong expense discipline as well. Our fixed operating expenses in the second quarter on a constant-dollar basis were down $29 million or 7% from the prior year period. 
Before I move to Slide 4, let me touch briefly on a few select business highlights for the quarter. Building upon our success with the launch of NYSE Liffe Clearing last July, we have announced our intention to build two new clearinghouses in London and Paris for our European Derivatives and Cash businesses. The economics for clearing are very favorable. And it is our intention to have the new clearinghouses live by mid-to-late '12. We continue to await regulatory approval of our NYSE Amex options and NYPC semi-mutualizations. 
In terms of NYPC, we now have a full management team in place. The intensive regulatory review and approval process for NYPC continues to make progress. And we appreciate all the regulatory agencies for their substantial resources they are committing to thoroughly analyze this innovative new clearing model. Given the recent focus on clearinghouses and risk in the newly enacted Financial Regulatory Reform bill, regulators are being appropriately diligent in their analysis. And we are still hoping for regulatory approvals later in the fall.
Our agreement with FINRA, under which they assume responsibility for performing the market surveillance and enforcement functions previously conducted by NYSE Regulation is affective and we believe this agreement is an important step towards consolidated market surveillance, the need for which was highlighted in the events of May 6. 
I am pleased to report that our data center migration is on track. We are establishing the liquidity hubs of the future. And Mike will address the timing of the incremental depreciation and amortization for the second half of 2010.  
Lastly, as we committed to on our last quarter's call, we have continued to de-lever, and year-to-date we have reduced our outstanding debt by more than $500 million. 
In summary, while we are pleased with our strong results for the quarter, driven by higher volumes across most of our venues and a growing base of recurring Technology Services revenue, we still have much to do. We are focused on executing against our long-term strategy of operating the most meaningful capital markets, creating even broader and deeper networks of productivity, and delivering innovative products to our expanding client base. We have, and will, continue to redefine what an exchange is in the 21st century.
Now please turn to Slide 4. The priorities on this slide highlight our goal of creating a community premium, using our scale and scope to benefit not only our own business but our customers' businesses as well. We can achieve this through initiatives and offerings like co-location, co-branding, advocacy and our global distribution network. At the center of the company and in support of our three businesses is UTP, our global integrated and scalable trading platform, an unrivaled global connectivity network and customer gateway; our focus on clearing, which will take on an greater importance in '11 and '12; and two brand-new world-class data centers, set for launch in September and October of this year.
Turning to Slide 5. We have several recent NYSE technology wins, which reflect the growing interest in our full-managed solutions capabilities. The Technology business, as I alluded to earlier, has performed well to date. And approximately 80% of the revenues in this business are recurring. On the exchange partnership side of the business, we continue to land large client deals. As you will recall, last year we signed a partnership with the Qatar Exchange to build their cash and derivatives platforms. And just a few weeks ago, we signed a multi-year eight-figure deal with the Warsaw Stock Exchange to migrate WSE's cash and derivatives markets to NYSE Technologies Universal Trading Platform. In addition, we plan to collaborate with the WSE on other mutually beneficial business initiatives. 
Regarding the more traditional client side, you will note on the chart a few examples of deals that we’ve recently signed. Despite reports of slowing technology spend, we are seeing strong interest from the broker-dealer community, investing in leading-edge trading technology. This is a welcome sign, especially after a slow 2009 that saw a decent pullback in technology spend. Our customers are working to leverage our full solution set. We believe the deals shown on this slide represent just the beginning of our ability to deliver innovative products. And these opportunities will only get larger as we deliver.  
Supporting many of these deals are our data centers. There is a lot of customer focus on the upcoming Mahwah and Basildon go live dates set for later this year.
On Slide 6, we've included a simple strategy statement to help you better understand where we're going. Our aspiration is to lead our industry and redefine what it means to be an exchange in the 21st century. To achieve this, our mission will be simply to empower the world's capital markets community to innovate and collaborate. To achieve this, our core objectives will be to operate the most important capital markets; connect the members of the community through our ever-growing network; deliver innovative products to our continually expanding client base; and to enable customers to run their businesses more profitably by using our technology and scale that UTP and the data centers deliver. 
We have already gone a long way towards redefining what an exchange is. And we’ve moved from being just an operator of markets to much more. As many companies in other industries have done, we are moving across the value chain to improve our competitive position. The more customers and partners we have, the greater the network effect, which further validates the relevance of our community. In short, it is about getting more customers for our products and services, and more products and services for our customers. From our perspective, we think the sum of the parts is being undervalued, because we believe that our unique collection of assets and global reach offers us great revenue and cost synergies, which will ultimately yield the community premium that I mentioned earlier. 
Finally for me, on Slide 7, you will see a number of current issues where we are doing our best to demonstrate leadership. We will not go through each of these bullets individually this morning, but we'll highlight a few important ones.  
While Congress considered financial regulatory reform legislation, we were very active in advocating for ourselves, and more importantly on behalf of our list of companies. We believe that the Dodd-Frank Act will solidify and bolster our opportunities for future growth, particularly in derivatives. Going forward, the Act mandates hundreds of agency rule-makings. And we are already analyzing and prioritizing these rules and expect to play an active advocacy role on behalf of our clients, but also are committed to be an active participant with the regulators who are going to have to write all these rules. 
In terms of market structure, the events of May 6 put a spotlight on the need for improvements to our equity markets. This has created opportunities for us to demonstrate the benefits that the NYSE model brings to issuers, investors and the markets. We testified twice before Congress on market structure matters. And we spent considerable time with the SEC, the CFTC and the Joint Advisory Committee. We believe these opportunities have enhanced our standing with legislative and regulatory policy makers. 
More broadly, our efforts to advocate on behalf of our issuers and to be an influencer of public policy continue to be an important part of our value proposition. We’re working hard to represent our list of companies on issues like corporate governance, proxy access and Sarbanes-Oxley reform. As well as our continued opposition on a tax on transactions to ensure that investors’ interests are protected as well.
Turning to Europe, regulators are also embarking on a plethora of legislative initiatives on both market structure and financial regulation. Two years after its implementation, European policy makers are working on a comprehensive review of MiFID, although we don't expect firm proposals until early next year. We are hopeful that officials in Europe will learn some important lessons from the market fragmentation that has occurred in the U.S. and will avoid heading down the same path. We will also be working with European legislators to ensure an adequate assessment of the increasingly high level of non-transparent trading. We believe that a proper analysis of this issue calls for priority to be given to a more transparent price formation process and increased investor protection. 
Derivative regulation is also a key issue in Europe, as has been the case in the U.S. The European Commission will publish legislative proposals in September in keeping with the G-20 commitments, before central clearing of OTC derivative trades. It is our understanding that the Commission will present proposals next year as part of a MiFID revision to bring more OTC derivatives onto central lit platforms. 
That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn it over to Mike for a review of our quarter’s financial results. Mike?"
189274,107640780,71915,"NYSE Euronext, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","NYSE Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Duncan. Slide 8 provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter. Total revenues were flat year-over-year and up 15% versus the first quarter. Net revenue profits and diluted EPS are all up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The $0.7",2419,"Thanks, Duncan. Slide 8 provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter. Total revenues were flat year-over-year and up 15% versus the first quarter. Net revenue profits and diluted EPS are all up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The $0.70 EPS posted in the second quarter was the company's highest quarterly EPS since Q3 2008. 
Unless otherwise noted, all of our financials are presented in accordance with GAAP. As we progress through the latter stages of the post-merger integration, staff reduction and system harmonization efforts, we continue to incur high levels of severance charges, asset write-offs and real estate disposition costs. These discreet items are reported in merger and exit costs. Once we move into the new data centers and exit our legacy premises, we expect the occurrence of these costs to decline significantly.
This quarter, we reported a $32 million charge in merger and exit costs. This consisted of $14 million in cash charges, primarily for severance related to the FINRA transaction, reengineering the structure of local offices, and the U.S. VRIP. The remainder is related to real estate lease cancellations and disposal of legacy system applications. Last year's merger costs of $442 million was principally for the NYSE Liffe Clearing payment, which drove the GAAP loss for the quarter. In the quarter, we reported a $54 million gain from asset disposals, primarily related to the sale of our 5% stake in the National Stock Exchange of India. 
Now I'll review our financial results. From this point forward, we'll exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs just referenced, as well as the gains from disposal activities during the quarter.  
Slide 9 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the second quarter. Including merger and exit costs in the asset sales, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.64, up 25% on prior year's $0.51. Year-to-date EPS of $1.18 is up 26%. Q2 earnings performance was driven by a 7% increase in net revenue, and another quarter of solid expense management. 
Operating income was $247 million, up 15% compared to the second quarter of 2009. Operating margin rose to 38% this quarter and is 36% year-to-date. This compares to the full year operating margin of 32% for 2009. 
Our focus for 2010 is revenue growth and margin expansion. We are pleased with our progress on both fronts. We continue to grow EBITDA margin as well, posting a 48% mark for the quarter. The relatively fixed expense base, we have significant operating leverage on our incremental revenue and volume growth.
Slide 10 provides our segment results on a currency-neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened in this quarter versus both the euro and British pound. For the quarter, 48% of our net revenue was denominated in either euros or pounds. Currency impact was unfavorable, $19 million versus prior year and $22 million versus prior quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, second quarter net revenues grew 10% and operating income 20% versus Q2 of prior year. 
Operationally, our Derivative segment grew 38% and the Technology segment grew 33% versus Q2 prior year. Cash Trading and Listings revenue declined by 8%, attributed to lower revenues from BlueNext, our carbon trading venture, and lower U.S. volumes, and revenue capture in Europe. Our Derivatives and Technology profits nearly doubled versus Q2 prior year.
On Slide 11, we show our 2010 year-to-date net revenue split by business activity and segment, with comparison for the first half of 2009. The company continues to benefit from a diversified revenue base. 51% of our net revenues were generated by transaction and clearing fees in the first half of 2010. This is slightly higher than last year because of the strong Q2 volume in 2010 and the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing. We saw the contribution from Technology Services show the most meaningful increase during the first half of 2010, the specific gains stemming from NYFIX, growth in our SFTI Europe network, and recent software and infrastructure sales.
Turning to our segments. Cash Trading and Listings comprised 48% of our net revenues in the first half of 2010; while the Derivative segment continued to be the fastest-growing segment, contributing 35% of our net revenues, up from 27% in the first half of 2009; followed by the Technology segment, which grew from 14% to 17% of revenue. Again, this is consistent with our revenue guidance and where we have invested in new initiatives.
Slide 12 and 13 detail the financial performance for our Global Derivatives segment. I'm not going to go through these slides in great detail but simply touch upon a few points. The Global Derivatives franchise continues to grow. Net revenues were $226 million in the second quarter, an increase of $57 million or 34% versus Q2 prior year, and are up 38% year-to-date. The increase is primarily driven by a $51 million increase in trading and clearing revenues due to strong volume growth in European Derivatives and U.S. Options, increased market share for U.S. Options and the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing. 
Both our European Derivatives and U.S. Option venues experienced record volume days in the second quarter. For the quarter, volumes rose 38% and 57%, respectively, versus Q2 prior year. For one day in May, we handled over 16 million derivative contracts globally. NYSE Euronext was the largest U.S. equity options exchange operator in the marketplace for the second consecutive quarter, with a market share of 26%. 
The revenue capture for European derivatives, x Bclear, was $0.64 per contract in the second quarter. This was up versus the second quarter of last year due to the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing, but down slightly versus the first quarter because of the stronger dollar. 
Rate per contract in the U.S. Options was $0.17 per contract in the second quarter. This is down versus both the prior year and prior quarter. The reason for the decrease is largely attributable to an increase in Penny Pilot issues traded on NYSE Arca and minor pricing changes which are offset by market share gains.
Our Global Derivatives segment increased its margins to 62% in Q2, as we were able to leverage volume and revenue growth on a lower cost base. For the first half of 2010, this segment accounted for 50% of our operating income. 
Similarly, Slide 14 and 15 show you the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings net revenue was $321 million in the second quarter of 2010, down versus last year but up sequentially versus the first quarter. The year-over-year decrease was driven by a $21 million decline in net transaction revenue and a $14 million decline in other revenue. 
Decline in net transaction revenue was attributed to pricing reductions in European cash in 2009 and lower trading volumes in U.S. cash. This was somewhat mitigated by an 18% increase in European volumes during the quarter. Decline in other revenue is principally due to a decrease in volumes on BlueNext, our environmental trading exchange. However, we are actively looking at opportunity to build upon our BlueNext franchise and bolster our carbon trading operations.
Market share in the Euronext primary market was up slightly to 74% in the second quarter, but below the 79% in the second quarter of 2009. Revenue capture for U.S. cash was $0.03 per 100 shares, in line with expectations and recent trends. Revenue capture for European cash was $0.65 per transaction versus $0.90 in the prior year. The decline was attributed to the stronger dollar and a less favorable mix in part due to higher volumes.
NYSE Euronext global listing franchise gathered momentum in the first half of 2010. A total of nine companies with a combined market capital of over $30 billion have transferred from other exchanges to NYSE. Some of these companies include Knight Capital Group, Charles Schwab and Paragon Shipping. Furthermore, a total of 55 IPOs, with total proceeds of $13 billion, listed on our markets during the first six months of the year. 
Operating margin for the Cash Trading and Listings segment was 39% in the second quarter, up from 34% in Q1, and virtually flat with the second quarter of 2009.
Slide 16 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information Services and Technology Solutions net revenue was $107 million in the second quarter, an increase of $24 million or 29% from Q2 prior year. The increase is primarily driven by the NYFIX acquisition, growth in SFTI clients, and some large software and infrastructure sales. Revenues were slightly behind Q1, but on a currency-neutral basis grew 2%. 
Operating income was $20 million, a 67% increase from the prior year, and an 18% increase from the first quarter of 2010. Operating margin was 19% compared to 14% in the second quarter of '09 and 15% in Q1. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26%. 
Advanced cabinet reservations for our new U.S. and U.K. data centers continue to be strong, with both data centers nearly fully subscribed for cabinet space. Co-location revenues will begin to accelerate in the fourth quarter, and reach their annualized level in Q2 2011 once we complete the application migrations to the data centers. The data centers are set to go live in Mahwah in September and Basildon in October.
Slide 17 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. We continue to make excellent progress in lowering our cost base in real terms, while funding incremental investment to grow the business. Q2 expenses were $20 million below the first quarter. After adjusting for favorable impact of the stronger dollar and for incremental data center integration spending, fixed costs were $15 million below Q1 on an apples-to-apples basis. Second quarter operating expenses were up $10 million versus last year on a reported basis. 
Q2 2009 included a onetime $10 million benefit curtailment related to changes made to our retiree benefit plan. After adjusting for this, FX and the impact of acquisitions such as NYSE Liffe Clearing and MiFID, fixed operating costs were down $29 million or 7% from the second quarter of 2009. 
Looking at the first half of 2010 on a constant-dollar constant-portfolio basis, our underlying fixed expenses were down $71 million or 9% compared to the first half of 2009. We continue to make good progress and are focused on efficiency and productivity improvement that will further reduce operating expenses for NYSE Euronext.
Slide 18 provides an update to our annual expense guidance. In March, when we provided fixed expense guidance for 2010, we indicated that this guidance was predicated on the average FX rates for 2009. These were $1.39 for the euro and $1.57 for the pound. Given the direction of rates in the first half, we felt it appropriate to adjust our full year guidance to reflect a scenario more in line with current currency trends. Applying the rate of $1.30 for the euro and $1.50 for the pound, our revised fixed cost range is now between $1.685 million to $1.729 million. Likewise, should these rates be applicable for 2011, our prior guidance of cost to be below $1.650 million will be adjusted accordingly. 
In the second quarter, 60% of our operating expenses were denominated in dollars, 20% in euros and 20% in pounds. Although we've adjusted the cost range solely for currency, our first half expense performance of $834 million coupled with efficiency initiatives in the pipeline provides us increasing comfort that we will achieve our cost guidance for 2010. 
Our staffing level as of June 30 is 2,993 full-time positions, which is 374 positions or 11% below year end levels. Roughly 165 of these reductions relate to the recent outsourcing of certain regulatory activities to FINRA. Approximately $11 million per quarter in compensation expense related to this headcount transfer will now be reflected in the professional services line. For the most part, the social plan and U.S. VRIP programs have now been fully executed and are compete. We will continue to pursue a number of process efficiency improvements which will further reduce expenses into 2011.
That said, we do expect cost to rise somewhat in the second half attributable to migration into our new data centers, investment in our new European clearinghouses, and launching of interest rate futures in the U.S. In addition to the integration and transition costs, we expect to begin depreciating the new data centers as we go live in the latter part of the third quarter, adding incremental depreciation costs of approximately $15 million dollars in the second half. Over time, this will be mitigated as we exit some legacy data centers.
Slide 19 details our cash and debt position as of June 30, 2010. After investing a significant amount of capital for building two state-of-the-art data centers, in-sourcing Liffe Clearing, restructuring operations and investing in other avenues of growth, we indicated late last year that our focus will be on de-levering our balance sheet. In just six months, we've made significant progress towards these goals and are now operating well within our long-term target leverage levels. Our debt leverage this quarter has declined to slightly below 1.9x debt to EBITDA versus 2.6x at year end 2009. This improvement is the result of double-digit growth in EBITDA, coupled with significant debt repayment. 
During the second quarter, our gross debt declined $434 million to $2.2 billion. Proceeds from the disposition of NSE, coupled with strong operating cash flows, enabled a sizable repayment of short-term debt. 
Cash and other financial instruments was $419 million at the end of June 2010. That compares favorably to our short-term debt, which is now below $300 million. For the second quarter of 2010, capital expenditures were $70 million, of which $26 million was for building out for our data centers. 
Having reached our comfort zone with regards to leverage, we are revisiting how best to allocate capital going forward, besides just paying down debt. This will entail investing for growth and possibly returning excess cash flows to our shareholders. We’re comfortable with the dividend at current levels, as the payout ratio remains above pre-crisis levels, while we still have an outstanding share buyback authorization. We are currently rated AA- by S&P and A3 by Moody's. The S&P rating is under credit watch, which we expect will be addressed shortly.
And finally, last week the Board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the third quarter of 2010, which is payable on September 30. With that, let me turn the call back to Duncan for some closing remarks, and then you take your questions."

So just to recap, we're obviously very pleased with our results for the quarter. I think they were strong, driven by record trading volumes, our derivatives franchise, and year-over-year growth in Technology Services revenue from NYFIX. I think we also continued to show cost discipline during the quarter. And we remained focused on proceeding with our company-wide efficiency efforts that will address globalizing our operations, reducing process complexity and streamlining organizational contracts. 
We are on the cusp of concluding a multi-year project with the lighting up of our new data centers which we expect will serve as a cornerstone of our Technology Services growth story. We are signing more major client deals and establishing more commercial exchange partnerships than ever before, based on the superior quality and breadth of technology assets that we have brought together with our organic development and acquisitions the past couple of years. 
And we have several other new initiatives that are in the wings that will drive our future growth, including NYPC and our European clearing initiatives set for later on in '11, '12. With these initiatives, we are indeed redefining what it means to be an exchange in the 21st century. So with that, we’ll wrap it up, and we’d like to open the line for your questions.

What happened was NASDAQ declared self-help against Arca, which lasted 20 minutes. We believe that was due to a server latency on about 20 symbols that lasted five minutes in Tape C. The other exchanges didn’t -- that’s declared self-help for about seven minutes, and that was due to the fact that some of the prices they were sending us violated our price bands. And when we spoke to them on the phone, they cleared that up relatively quickly. Our direct feeds did not experience latency, as far as we know, in terms of market data. There were some issues potentially on the SIP, meaning the consolidated feed, but probably about 85% or 90% of our volume actually comes from direct feeds. That's another misinformation that’s generally in the market, which is that, in general, consolidated feeds go to retail customers and people who are viewing it with their eyeballs. Most volume actually is generated from direct feeds. That said, on that period, we experienced a tripling of quotes in trades during that burst of about five minutes. When the May 6 event occurred, those were record volumes of message traffic. And I think that we always keep an eye on capacity, and have made -- we're actually in the process of some capacity expansion on the May 6 date that has subsequently been completed. I think it's something that we're always careful about. Volumes are down a bit again after the second quarter. I think everybody’s seen July. But that's partly seasonally. But I think it’s something that we’re just always cognizant of and always reviewing."

We didn't really re-do the $1,650 million but what we’re saying is that there would be -- if the currency stayed at today's levels, which is lower than when we -- the levels that we were at when we indicated the $1,650 million, we will be that much below the $1,650 million as well.

So assuming that there's no glitches there, which we don't anticipate, and that the clients we want connected, or who are already in the process of connecting are connecting, we'd be able to turn this on very, very quickly after approval. Realistically, I think we have to start thinking about this in our own minds as a January of 2011 events. Because even if we went out for comment this month and got all the requisite approvals by the end of the year, I wouldn't anticipate that we would launch something like this the first or second week of December. I think we’d probably get advice from our clients that would say, let's come out of the gate after the new year, ready to go.

And that’s always a challenge. I think what we’re trying to do, both in Europe and particularly in the U.S. going forward, is have our tiering float more appropriately with market volume to try to insulate, both us and our clients to be honest, from getting stuck in a higher tier if volumes drop off, and likewise get pushed into a lower tier if volumes explode. In trying to sort of mitigate some of that, we’ve implemented that. In addition the -- by the way, it’s evolved over time, the European pricing model is overly complex. Because we have this whole agency principal, designation, it's a very complicated system. And we’re working right now with our clients on a way to make that simpler. Because it will make them -- it’s easier for them to make their routing decisions and figure out how they’re going to run their business. Because the reality is what they want is to be able to understand what their rates are going to be and not have them just come out in a certain place based on either volumes or mixes of business or likewise. In terms of volumes, obviously, we don’t -- we can’t do any forecasting there. Your guess is as good as ours. What we kind of note, particularly in the U.S., is while July was down versus the previous month as we've seen, on one hand, June is always a very seasonably busy quarter because of Russell and other things. And July for 2010 was higher than July of 2009. So what conclusions you can draw from there are beyond me."

I could see it going down a little bit from here. I wouldn't expect much movement the balance of this year because, remember, as we finish the UTP migration and we’re lighting up the new data centers, which then puts us in position to decommission the older data centers, I wouldn't expect too much change in that, in the status quo on our headcount now for the balance of this year. I think there is a possibility that when UTP is done and when all the data center migration and decommissioning is done, you could see another leg down. But I don't think we want to anticipate that. Because at the same time, we've got a Technology Services business that is growing. And those require a different kind of potentially consultative sales force, so you could see us add some people there. So I would say in the near-term, those trends kind of offset. Now a lot of the operational efficiency gains that were talked -- that I referenced earlier in my remarks, I think could lead to some headcount changes on the margin. But a lot of those initiatives are simply just streamlining processes that don't really impact headcount at all."

And at the time, I just got some icy stares from the technology guys, and they actually achieved it. I think that we will be going down further as the data center is finished, as UTP finalizes and as we -- we’re globalizing operations, remember, we’d have the Belfast initiative. A lot of that is going to hit the consultant headcount where so the mix of employees versus consultants will probably change a bit, swinging a little bit more towards the employees. But we're constantly looking for, and it will be in the realm of process reengineering, simplification and globalization towards reducing headcount. If not our primary goal -- our primary goal is cost. And the heads that are coming out as this year progresses and as we hit the end of the data center projects, et cetera, we are really built into Mike's cost guidance. So that while we haven't given a headcount guidance, that was kind of where we were headed for cost, and to be honest, not all those are headcount either. That’s not really our primary focus. But clearly, as you simplify systems, that's a natural result."

We'll probably continue to do it at 8:00 a.m. New York time. 
I'm going to start with Slide 3 in the deck, and just hit a few highlights on that slide. I think you can see from the slide and from the press release this morning, we had a very strong second quarter. We're growing our Derivatives business. We're stabilizing our Cash Equities business, and we're providing innovative technologies solutions in that business. Our results, which reflect the continued trend of improving financial performance, were driven by stronger trading volumes, increased revenue generation from our new initiatives and continued cost discipline. 
We recorded a 25% increase in EPS to $0.64 per share and a 15% increase in operating income on a 7% increase in net revenue, with incremental margins of 76%. These results reflect the growing earnings power from our three primary businesses and the inherent operating leverage in the model. Firstly, our Derivatives segment benefited from record trading volumes as well as the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing. During the month of May, we executed an average of 13 million contracts per day across our Global Derivatives businesses, driving a 34% increase in net revenue with an increase in our operating margin to 62%, up from 42% the prior year. We were the largest U.S. equities options exchange for the second consecutive quarter.
Turning to Cash and Listings in the first half of 2010, we continue to use see strong demand for our listing venues, both in terms of transfers and new listings. On the execution side, we are continuing to focus on stability and profitability of this business. In the U.S., our market share in Tape A is at 37%, up from 35% in the first quarter. And our share in Europe is holding steady at 74%. 
Additionally, on July 13, we launched trading on Tape C stocks on an unlisted trading privilege basis over the NYSE Amex platform. Trading began with 10 issues and now has expanded to approximately 675 NASDAQ listed issues. And we've seen some positive market share developments. 
Lastly, our Technology business benefited from the addition of NYFIX and improved software sales, driving a 29% increase in revenue and an increase in operating margin to 19%. I will walk you through the profiles of several deals that we’ve signed in the past few months later in the presentation. They are representative of the enterprise level dialogues that we are having with market participants, encouraging them to leverage our technology to help them run their businesses more efficiently.
As we invest in our future growth and drive our revenue generation, we are maintaining strong expense discipline as well. Our fixed operating expenses in the second quarter on a constant-dollar basis were down $29 million or 7% from the prior year period. 
Before I move to Slide 4, let me touch briefly on a few select business highlights for the quarter. Building upon our success with the launch of NYSE Liffe Clearing last July, we have announced our intention to build two new clearinghouses in London and Paris for our European Derivatives and Cash businesses. The economics for clearing are very favorable. And it is our intention to have the new clearinghouses live by mid-to-late '12. We continue to await regulatory approval of our NYSE Amex options and NYPC semi-mutualizations. 
In terms of NYPC, we now have a full management team in place. The intensive regulatory review and approval process for NYPC continues to make progress. And we appreciate all the regulatory agencies for their substantial resources they are committing to thoroughly analyze this innovative new clearing model. Given the recent focus on clearinghouses and risk in the newly enacted Financial Regulatory Reform bill, regulators are being appropriately diligent in their analysis. And we are still hoping for regulatory approvals later in the fall.
Our agreement with FINRA, under which they assume responsibility for performing the market surveillance and enforcement functions previously conducted by NYSE Regulation is affective and we believe this agreement is an important step towards consolidated market surveillance, the need for which was highlighted in the events of May 6. 
I am pleased to report that our data center migration is on track. We are establishing the liquidity hubs of the future. And Mike will address the timing of the incremental depreciation and amortization for the second half of 2010.  
Lastly, as we committed to on our last quarter's call, we have continued to de-lever, and year-to-date we have reduced our outstanding debt by more than $500 million. 
In summary, while we are pleased with our strong results for the quarter, driven by higher volumes across most of our venues and a growing base of recurring Technology Services revenue, we still have much to do. We are focused on executing against our long-term strategy of operating the most meaningful capital markets, creating even broader and deeper networks of productivity, and delivering innovative products to our expanding client base. We have, and will, continue to redefine what an exchange is in the 21st century.
Now please turn to Slide 4. The priorities on this slide highlight our goal of creating a community premium, using our scale and scope to benefit not only our own business but our customers' businesses as well. We can achieve this through initiatives and offerings like co-location, co-branding, advocacy and our global distribution network. At the center of the company and in support of our three businesses is UTP, our global integrated and scalable trading platform, an unrivaled global connectivity network and customer gateway; our focus on clearing, which will take on an greater importance in '11 and '12; and two brand-new world-class data centers, set for launch in September and October of this year.
Turning to Slide 5. We have several recent NYSE technology wins, which reflect the growing interest in our full-managed solutions capabilities. The Technology business, as I alluded to earlier, has performed well to date. And approximately 80% of the revenues in this business are recurring. On the exchange partnership side of the business, we continue to land large client deals. As you will recall, last year we signed a partnership with the Qatar Exchange to build their cash and derivatives platforms. And just a few weeks ago, we signed a multi-year eight-figure deal with the Warsaw Stock Exchange to migrate WSE's cash and derivatives markets to NYSE Technologies Universal Trading Platform. In addition, we plan to collaborate with the WSE on other mutually beneficial business initiatives. 
Regarding the more traditional client side, you will note on the chart a few examples of deals that we’ve recently signed. Despite reports of slowing technology spend, we are seeing strong interest from the broker-dealer community, investing in leading-edge trading technology. This is a welcome sign, especially after a slow 2009 that saw a decent pullback in technology spend. Our customers are working to leverage our full solution set. We believe the deals shown on this slide represent just the beginning of our ability to deliver innovative products. And these opportunities will only get larger as we deliver.  
Supporting many of these deals are our data centers. There is a lot of customer focus on the upcoming Mahwah and Basildon go live dates set for later this year.
On Slide 6, we've included a simple strategy statement to help you better understand where we're going. Our aspiration is to lead our industry and redefine what it means to be an exchange in the 21st century. To achieve this, our mission will be simply to empower the world's capital markets community to innovate and collaborate. To achieve this, our core objectives will be to operate the most important capital markets; connect the members of the community through our ever-growing network; deliver innovative products to our continually expanding client base; and to enable customers to run their businesses more profitably by using our technology and scale that UTP and the data centers deliver. 
We have already gone a long way towards redefining what an exchange is. And we’ve moved from being just an operator of markets to much more. As many companies in other industries have done, we are moving across the value chain to improve our competitive position. The more customers and partners we have, the greater the network effect, which further validates the relevance of our community. In short, it is about getting more customers for our products and services, and more products and services for our customers. From our perspective, we think the sum of the parts is being undervalued, because we believe that our unique collection of assets and global reach offers us great revenue and cost synergies, which will ultimately yield the community premium that I mentioned earlier. 
Finally for me, on Slide 7, you will see a number of current issues where we are doing our best to demonstrate leadership. We will not go through each of these bullets individually this morning, but we'll highlight a few important ones.  
While Congress considered financial regulatory reform legislation, we were very active in advocating for ourselves, and more importantly on behalf of our list of companies. We believe that the Dodd-Frank Act will solidify and bolster our opportunities for future growth, particularly in derivatives. Going forward, the Act mandates hundreds of agency rule-makings. And we are already analyzing and prioritizing these rules and expect to play an active advocacy role on behalf of our clients, but also are committed to be an active participant with the regulators who are going to have to write all these rules. 
In terms of market structure, the events of May 6 put a spotlight on the need for improvements to our equity markets. This has created opportunities for us to demonstrate the benefits that the NYSE model brings to issuers, investors and the markets. We testified twice before Congress on market structure matters. And we spent considerable time with the SEC, the CFTC and the Joint Advisory Committee. We believe these opportunities have enhanced our standing with legislative and regulatory policy makers. 
More broadly, our efforts to advocate on behalf of our issuers and to be an influencer of public policy continue to be an important part of our value proposition. We’re working hard to represent our list of companies on issues like corporate governance, proxy access and Sarbanes-Oxley reform. As well as our continued opposition on a tax on transactions to ensure that investors’ interests are protected as well.
Turning to Europe, regulators are also embarking on a plethora of legislative initiatives on both market structure and financial regulation. Two years after its implementation, European policy makers are working on a comprehensive review of MiFID, although we don't expect firm proposals until early next year. We are hopeful that officials in Europe will learn some important lessons from the market fragmentation that has occurred in the U.S. and will avoid heading down the same path. We will also be working with European legislators to ensure an adequate assessment of the increasingly high level of non-transparent trading. We believe that a proper analysis of this issue calls for priority to be given to a more transparent price formation process and increased investor protection. 
Derivative regulation is also a key issue in Europe, as has been the case in the U.S. The European Commission will publish legislative proposals in September in keeping with the G-20 commitments, before central clearing of OTC derivative trades. It is our understanding that the Commission will present proposals next year as part of a MiFID revision to bring more OTC derivatives onto central lit platforms. 
That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn it over to Mike for a review of our quarter’s financial results. Mike?"
189274,107640780,71916,"NYSE Euronext, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-03-2010",2010-08-03,"Earnings Calls","NYSE Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Duncan. Slide 8 provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter. Total revenues were flat year-over-year and up 15% versus the first quarter. Net revenue profits and diluted EPS are all up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The $0.7",2419,"Thanks, Duncan. Slide 8 provides comparative GAAP results for the second quarter. Total revenues were flat year-over-year and up 15% versus the first quarter. Net revenue profits and diluted EPS are all up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The $0.70 EPS posted in the second quarter was the company's highest quarterly EPS since Q3 2008. 
Unless otherwise noted, all of our financials are presented in accordance with GAAP. As we progress through the latter stages of the post-merger integration, staff reduction and system harmonization efforts, we continue to incur high levels of severance charges, asset write-offs and real estate disposition costs. These discreet items are reported in merger and exit costs. Once we move into the new data centers and exit our legacy premises, we expect the occurrence of these costs to decline significantly.
This quarter, we reported a $32 million charge in merger and exit costs. This consisted of $14 million in cash charges, primarily for severance related to the FINRA transaction, reengineering the structure of local offices, and the U.S. VRIP. The remainder is related to real estate lease cancellations and disposal of legacy system applications. Last year's merger costs of $442 million was principally for the NYSE Liffe Clearing payment, which drove the GAAP loss for the quarter. In the quarter, we reported a $54 million gain from asset disposals, primarily related to the sale of our 5% stake in the National Stock Exchange of India. 
Now I'll review our financial results. From this point forward, we'll exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs just referenced, as well as the gains from disposal activities during the quarter.  
Slide 9 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the second quarter. Including merger and exit costs in the asset sales, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.64, up 25% on prior year's $0.51. Year-to-date EPS of $1.18 is up 26%. Q2 earnings performance was driven by a 7% increase in net revenue, and another quarter of solid expense management. 
Operating income was $247 million, up 15% compared to the second quarter of 2009. Operating margin rose to 38% this quarter and is 36% year-to-date. This compares to the full year operating margin of 32% for 2009. 
Our focus for 2010 is revenue growth and margin expansion. We are pleased with our progress on both fronts. We continue to grow EBITDA margin as well, posting a 48% mark for the quarter. The relatively fixed expense base, we have significant operating leverage on our incremental revenue and volume growth.
Slide 10 provides our segment results on a currency-neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened in this quarter versus both the euro and British pound. For the quarter, 48% of our net revenue was denominated in either euros or pounds. Currency impact was unfavorable, $19 million versus prior year and $22 million versus prior quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, second quarter net revenues grew 10% and operating income 20% versus Q2 of prior year. 
Operationally, our Derivative segment grew 38% and the Technology segment grew 33% versus Q2 prior year. Cash Trading and Listings revenue declined by 8%, attributed to lower revenues from BlueNext, our carbon trading venture, and lower U.S. volumes, and revenue capture in Europe. Our Derivatives and Technology profits nearly doubled versus Q2 prior year.
On Slide 11, we show our 2010 year-to-date net revenue split by business activity and segment, with comparison for the first half of 2009. The company continues to benefit from a diversified revenue base. 51% of our net revenues were generated by transaction and clearing fees in the first half of 2010. This is slightly higher than last year because of the strong Q2 volume in 2010 and the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing. We saw the contribution from Technology Services show the most meaningful increase during the first half of 2010, the specific gains stemming from NYFIX, growth in our SFTI Europe network, and recent software and infrastructure sales.
Turning to our segments. Cash Trading and Listings comprised 48% of our net revenues in the first half of 2010; while the Derivative segment continued to be the fastest-growing segment, contributing 35% of our net revenues, up from 27% in the first half of 2009; followed by the Technology segment, which grew from 14% to 17% of revenue. Again, this is consistent with our revenue guidance and where we have invested in new initiatives.
Slide 12 and 13 detail the financial performance for our Global Derivatives segment. I'm not going to go through these slides in great detail but simply touch upon a few points. The Global Derivatives franchise continues to grow. Net revenues were $226 million in the second quarter, an increase of $57 million or 34% versus Q2 prior year, and are up 38% year-to-date. The increase is primarily driven by a $51 million increase in trading and clearing revenues due to strong volume growth in European Derivatives and U.S. Options, increased market share for U.S. Options and the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing. 
Both our European Derivatives and U.S. Option venues experienced record volume days in the second quarter. For the quarter, volumes rose 38% and 57%, respectively, versus Q2 prior year. For one day in May, we handled over 16 million derivative contracts globally. NYSE Euronext was the largest U.S. equity options exchange operator in the marketplace for the second consecutive quarter, with a market share of 26%. 
The revenue capture for European derivatives, x Bclear, was $0.64 per contract in the second quarter. This was up versus the second quarter of last year due to the addition of NYSE Liffe Clearing, but down slightly versus the first quarter because of the stronger dollar. 
Rate per contract in the U.S. Options was $0.17 per contract in the second quarter. This is down versus both the prior year and prior quarter. The reason for the decrease is largely attributable to an increase in Penny Pilot issues traded on NYSE Arca and minor pricing changes which are offset by market share gains.
Our Global Derivatives segment increased its margins to 62% in Q2, as we were able to leverage volume and revenue growth on a lower cost base. For the first half of 2010, this segment accounted for 50% of our operating income. 
Similarly, Slide 14 and 15 show you the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings net revenue was $321 million in the second quarter of 2010, down versus last year but up sequentially versus the first quarter. The year-over-year decrease was driven by a $21 million decline in net transaction revenue and a $14 million decline in other revenue. 
Decline in net transaction revenue was attributed to pricing reductions in European cash in 2009 and lower trading volumes in U.S. cash. This was somewhat mitigated by an 18% increase in European volumes during the quarter. Decline in other revenue is principally due to a decrease in volumes on BlueNext, our environmental trading exchange. However, we are actively looking at opportunity to build upon our BlueNext franchise and bolster our carbon trading operations.
Market share in the Euronext primary market was up slightly to 74% in the second quarter, but below the 79% in the second quarter of 2009. Revenue capture for U.S. cash was $0.03 per 100 shares, in line with expectations and recent trends. Revenue capture for European cash was $0.65 per transaction versus $0.90 in the prior year. The decline was attributed to the stronger dollar and a less favorable mix in part due to higher volumes.
NYSE Euronext global listing franchise gathered momentum in the first half of 2010. A total of nine companies with a combined market capital of over $30 billion have transferred from other exchanges to NYSE. Some of these companies include Knight Capital Group, Charles Schwab and Paragon Shipping. Furthermore, a total of 55 IPOs, with total proceeds of $13 billion, listed on our markets during the first six months of the year. 
Operating margin for the Cash Trading and Listings segment was 39% in the second quarter, up from 34% in Q1, and virtually flat with the second quarter of 2009.
Slide 16 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information Services and Technology Solutions net revenue was $107 million in the second quarter, an increase of $24 million or 29% from Q2 prior year. The increase is primarily driven by the NYFIX acquisition, growth in SFTI clients, and some large software and infrastructure sales. Revenues were slightly behind Q1, but on a currency-neutral basis grew 2%. 
Operating income was $20 million, a 67% increase from the prior year, and an 18% increase from the first quarter of 2010. Operating margin was 19% compared to 14% in the second quarter of '09 and 15% in Q1. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26%. 
Advanced cabinet reservations for our new U.S. and U.K. data centers continue to be strong, with both data centers nearly fully subscribed for cabinet space. Co-location revenues will begin to accelerate in the fourth quarter, and reach their annualized level in Q2 2011 once we complete the application migrations to the data centers. The data centers are set to go live in Mahwah in September and Basildon in October.
Slide 17 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. We continue to make excellent progress in lowering our cost base in real terms, while funding incremental investment to grow the business. Q2 expenses were $20 million below the first quarter. After adjusting for favorable impact of the stronger dollar and for incremental data center integration spending, fixed costs were $15 million below Q1 on an apples-to-apples basis. Second quarter operating expenses were up $10 million versus last year on a reported basis. 
Q2 2009 included a onetime $10 million benefit curtailment related to changes made to our retiree benefit plan. After adjusting for this, FX and the impact of acquisitions such as NYSE Liffe Clearing and MiFID, fixed operating costs were down $29 million or 7% from the second quarter of 2009. 
Looking at the first half of 2010 on a constant-dollar constant-portfolio basis, our underlying fixed expenses were down $71 million or 9% compared to the first half of 2009. We continue to make good progress and are focused on efficiency and productivity improvement that will further reduce operating expenses for NYSE Euronext.
Slide 18 provides an update to our annual expense guidance. In March, when we provided fixed expense guidance for 2010, we indicated that this guidance was predicated on the average FX rates for 2009. These were $1.39 for the euro and $1.57 for the pound. Given the direction of rates in the first half, we felt it appropriate to adjust our full year guidance to reflect a scenario more in line with current currency trends. Applying the rate of $1.30 for the euro and $1.50 for the pound, our revised fixed cost range is now between $1.685 million to $1.729 million. Likewise, should these rates be applicable for 2011, our prior guidance of cost to be below $1.650 million will be adjusted accordingly. 
In the second quarter, 60% of our operating expenses were denominated in dollars, 20% in euros and 20% in pounds. Although we've adjusted the cost range solely for currency, our first half expense performance of $834 million coupled with efficiency initiatives in the pipeline provides us increasing comfort that we will achieve our cost guidance for 2010. 
Our staffing level as of June 30 is 2,993 full-time positions, which is 374 positions or 11% below year end levels. Roughly 165 of these reductions relate to the recent outsourcing of certain regulatory activities to FINRA. Approximately $11 million per quarter in compensation expense related to this headcount transfer will now be reflected in the professional services line. For the most part, the social plan and U.S. VRIP programs have now been fully executed and are compete. We will continue to pursue a number of process efficiency improvements which will further reduce expenses into 2011.
That said, we do expect cost to rise somewhat in the second half attributable to migration into our new data centers, investment in our new European clearinghouses, and launching of interest rate futures in the U.S. In addition to the integration and transition costs, we expect to begin depreciating the new data centers as we go live in the latter part of the third quarter, adding incremental depreciation costs of approximately $15 million dollars in the second half. Over time, this will be mitigated as we exit some legacy data centers.
Slide 19 details our cash and debt position as of June 30, 2010. After investing a significant amount of capital for building two state-of-the-art data centers, in-sourcing Liffe Clearing, restructuring operations and investing in other avenues of growth, we indicated late last year that our focus will be on de-levering our balance sheet. In just six months, we've made significant progress towards these goals and are now operating well within our long-term target leverage levels. Our debt leverage this quarter has declined to slightly below 1.9x debt to EBITDA versus 2.6x at year end 2009. This improvement is the result of double-digit growth in EBITDA, coupled with significant debt repayment. 
During the second quarter, our gross debt declined $434 million to $2.2 billion. Proceeds from the disposition of NSE, coupled with strong operating cash flows, enabled a sizable repayment of short-term debt. 
Cash and other financial instruments was $419 million at the end of June 2010. That compares favorably to our short-term debt, which is now below $300 million. For the second quarter of 2010, capital expenditures were $70 million, of which $26 million was for building out for our data centers. 
Having reached our comfort zone with regards to leverage, we are revisiting how best to allocate capital going forward, besides just paying down debt. This will entail investing for growth and possibly returning excess cash flows to our shareholders. We’re comfortable with the dividend at current levels, as the payout ratio remains above pre-crisis levels, while we still have an outstanding share buyback authorization. We are currently rated AA- by S&P and A3 by Moody's. The S&P rating is under credit watch, which we expect will be addressed shortly.
And finally, last week the Board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the third quarter of 2010, which is payable on September 30. With that, let me turn the call back to Duncan for some closing remarks, and then you take your questions."

So just to recap, we're obviously very pleased with our results for the quarter.

I think we also continued to show cost discipline during the quarter. And we remained focused on proceeding with our company-wide efficiency efforts that will address globalizing our operations, reducing process complexity and streamlining organizational contracts. 
We are on the cusp of concluding a multi-year project with the lighting up of our new data centers which we expect will serve as a cornerstone of our Technology Services growth story. We are signing more major client deals and establishing more commercial exchange partnerships than ever before, based on the superior quality and breadth of technology assets that we have brought together with our organic development and acquisitions the past couple of years. 
And we have several other new initiatives that are in the wings that will drive our future growth, including NYPC and our European clearing initiatives set for later on in '11, '12. With these initiatives, we are indeed redefining what it means to be an exchange in the 21st century. So with that, we’ll wrap it up, and we’d like to open the line for your questions.

The other exchanges didn’t -- that’s declared self-help for about seven minutes, and that was due to the fact that some of the prices they were sending us violated our price bands. And when we spoke to them on the phone, they cleared that up relatively quickly. Our direct feeds did not experience latency, as far as we know, in terms of market data. There were some issues potentially on the SIP, meaning the consolidated feed, but probably about 85% or 90% of our volume actually comes from direct feeds. That's another misinformation that’s generally in the market, which is that, in general, consolidated feeds go to retail customers and people who are viewing it with their eyeballs. Most volume actually is generated from direct feeds. That said, on that period, we experienced a tripling of quotes in trades during that burst of about five minutes. When the May 6 event occurred, those were record volumes of message traffic. And I think that we always keep an eye on capacity, and have made -- we're actually in the process of some capacity expansion on the May 6 date that has subsequently been completed. I think it's something that we're always careful about. Volumes are down a bit again after the second quarter. I think everybody’s seen July. But that's partly seasonally.

In trying to sort of mitigate some of that, we’ve implemented that. In addition the -- by the way, it’s evolved over time, the European pricing model is overly complex.

So I don't think they’re going to be that actively traded in the near-term. Lastly, you're absolutely right, I think our view is to be a force in OTC derivative clearing, you need to own the assets. I think we're on our way to owning potential assets with the clearinghouse build-outs in Europe and the NYPC build-out here in the U.S. But we said publicly before, short of actually owning those assets, it's difficult to play a role if you don't have the clearinghouse assets. So as you would correctly expect, that’s part of the reason behind us trying to build out some of these clearing assets because it's then limitless, the products we can clear in those houses."

I could see it going down a little bit from here. I wouldn't expect much movement the balance of this year because, remember, as we finish the UTP migration and we’re lighting up the new data centers, which then puts us in position to decommission the older data centers, I wouldn't expect too much change in that, in the status quo on our headcount now for the balance of this year. I think there is a possibility that when UTP is done and when all the data center migration and decommissioning is done, you could see another leg down. But I don't think we want to anticipate that. Because at the same time, we've got a Technology Services business that is growing. And those require a different kind of potentially consultative sales force, so you could see us add some people there. So I would say in the near-term, those trends kind of offset. Now a lot of the operational efficiency gains that were talked -- that I referenced earlier in my remarks, I think could lead to some headcount changes on the margin. But a lot of those initiatives are simply just streamlining processes that don't really impact headcount at all."

I think that we will be going down further as the data center is finished, as UTP finalizes and as we -- we’re globalizing operations, remember, we’d have the Belfast initiative. A lot of that is going to hit the consultant headcount where so the mix of employees versus consultants will probably change a bit, swinging a little bit more towards the employees. But we're constantly looking for, and it will be in the realm of process reengineering, simplification and globalization towards reducing headcount. If not our primary goal -- our primary goal is cost. And the heads that are coming out as this year progresses and as we hit the end of the data center projects, et cetera, we are really built into Mike's cost guidance. So that while we haven't given a headcount guidance, that was kind of where we were headed for cost, and to be honest, not all those are headcount either. That’s not really our primary focus.

I'm going to start on Slide 3 entitled Third Quarter 2010 Update. And I would start by saying that we're very pleased with the progress we made in the third quarter, executing against our long-term strategy. In this quarter, we made tangible progress on our goals of operating the most meaningful capital markets, creating broader and deeper networks and delivering innovative products to our expanding client base. Our business model continues to diversify, and we are focusing on new initiatives and growth area to deliver value for our shareholders through all sorts of business cycles.
For the quarter, we recorded EPS of $0.46 per share on net revenue of $599 million, down from $0.53 on $620 million in net revenue in the prior year period. The strengthening of the dollar year-over-year reduced our net revenue by $25 million and EPS by $0.03. Helping to dampen the negative impact of currencies was $31 million in incremental revenue from new businesses, highlighting the continuing diversification of our model, which I will touch on in more detail later.
Our technology business continue to show great growth and benefited from the addition of NYFIX and expanding customer base and improved software sales, driving increased revenue and operating margins. And the business hit several milestones with Qatar and the Tokyo Stock exchanges, as well as in large Eastern European stock exchange signing up to do business with us. The next stage in the growth trajectory for this business will be a combination of co-location revenues and follow-on technology sales from these co-locating clients.
On the cash and listing side, we are continuing to see strong demand for our listing venues in terms of transfers, new listings and secondaries. Year-to-date through September, 13 companies have transferred to the NYSE from other exchanges with a total market capitalization of over $40 billion. A total of 78 issuers have listed on NYSE Euronext markets, raising total proceeds of just over $17 billion, including nine Chinese companies that raised to just under $1 billion. Important to note that this success has continued in October and even in early November where we've already had two listings from Asia two days in for the month.
NYSE Euronext is also the leader year-to-date for proceeds raised through global secondaries for the total of 370 issuers, raising total proceeds of just under $150 billion, which also included the largest secondary ever done in Petrobras, which raised 25 of the $70 billion that they raised in the U.S. markets.
On the cash equities trading side, we are continuing to focus on stability and profitability. In the U.S., our market share in the third quarter is up across all three takes year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. In Europe, our share has remained relatively stable at 73%, SmartPool continues to show some strong growth. And we continue to believe that over the long-term, we will see growth in the overall European market.
Lastly, the results in our Derivatives segment were mixed. With continued growth in our U.S. Options businesses helping to partially offset negative currency and lackluster volume trends in our European derivatives business year-over-year. The combination of lower volatility and the heightened prospects for a second round of quantitative easing has clouded the outlook for interest rates and inflation, which has reduced a need for hedging over our NYSE Liffe platform and resulted in trading volume declines compared to the elevated second quarter levels.
To close on Slide 3, let me just touch briefly on a few selected business highlights for the quarter. I am most pleased to report that our NYPC DCO filing with the CFTC is now complete, and we entered the 90-day comment period yesterday. Additionally, we have been discussing with the SEC the necessary rule of filings that will govern across the cross margining agreement between NYPC and DTCC's FICC division, and we expect to formally submit that filing later this week and get the clock ticking on that comment period as well. Pending these regulatory approvals, we anticipate the launch of NYPC and the simultaneous launch of U.S. Treasury and euro/dollar futures on our NYSE Liffe U.S. future's platform in the first quarter of 2011. The CFTC, SEC, and Federal Reserve have demonstrated a high degree of coordination throughout this comprehensive review process, and we are grateful to all of the agencies involved for their substantial efforts, especially in light of its challenges they all face with the Dodd-Frank rule making processes. We will continue to work closely with these regulators through the remaining phase of the regulatory approval process, which we expect to end sometime in February of 2011.
I'm also pleased to report that we have successfully completed on time our multiyear plan to build two state-of-the-art liquidity hubs in the U.S. and the U.K., which I will let Dominique speak to later. Within our technology business, we are seeing building momentum as we move forward with our goal of $1 billion in revenue by 2015. We delivered the UTP platform to cutter in the third quarter, and we are beginning work on the derivatives exchange there as well. More recently, as I mentioned earlier, the Tokyo Stock exchange and a large Eastern European stock exchange have chosen NYSE technologies to build trading platforms for their respective exchanges. Our operating margin for this business crossed the 20% threshold for the first time, showing strong progress toward our goal of 25% to 30% margins.
Lastly in the third quarter, we boasted our listings franchise with the acquisition of corporate Board member, a premier provider of director education programs. As I alluded to earlier, we have a great pipeline of IPO prospects and transfer prospects from other exchanges to NYSE Euronext. 
Please swing to Slide 4. Slide 4 is a slide that you've seen before, where we outlined and highlight our 2010 priorities for our various business segments. Our objective is to leverage our global infrastructure and scale, to support our businesses and our customers businesses, and create a community premium for our shareholders over time. At the center of the company in support of our three segments is UTP, our globally integrated and scalable trading platform. And on arrival of global connectivity network and customer gateways, our focus on clearing, which will take on an even greater importance in the coming quarters and two brand-new world-class data centers.
We put the slide at every quarter to remind you of what we are working toward. And now that we are coming for the end of the year, it is really designed to show you what we have accomplished this year. I think you can put check marks next to the most, if not all, of the items on the slide.
Slide 5, focusing on execution. On Slide 5, we provide you with a summary of the major initiatives that we have underway for each of our segments. In addition to these points, we also have many more new initiatives on the drawing board to ensure that we have a pipeline of new initiatives ready to come online in the quarters ahead to bolster our business model and to grow our franchise. I think most of the stuff on Slide 5 is familiar to all of you, and we'll touch on a lot what we haven't already in our remarks later in the presentation.
On Slide 6. We try to show the revenue contribution of our new businesses, which reflect the increasing diversification of our model. The $31 million in incremental net revenue generated by our new businesses help dampen the impact of externalities, including foreign exchange and lower capture at volumes in selected markets. This incremental revenue came from a variety of sources; including NYFIX, which is annuity like due to the nature of the revenue model for that business and the stickiness of the channels; the reinsourcing of clearing and verticalization of our NYSE Liffe business in Europe, which occurred in late July last year; technology services revenue from Cutter [ph]; and lastly a small amount of incremental revenue from corporate Board member in the quarter.
In the current quarter where we face significant headwinds, including foreign exchange, neutral to declining volumes and capture across selected markets, we were still able to record a solid $0.46 in earnings on $599 million of revenue. This compares to just for note $0.43 in the EPS that we earned about six quarters ago in the first quarter of 2009 on basically the same amount of revenue slightly higher of $605 million. Now why do we mention that? Because it sort of a random comparison. The reason I felt that was interesting is here we are at six quarters later with the currency against us on a comparative basis, U.S. volumes down 50%, our capture and our European business down 40% because of price cuts we've made in response to competition in the last two years yet our earnings are higher on a similar revenue base. Hopefully, that begins to tell you that we're well on the way on this journey to transform the company and be a much more diversified company who is much less reliant on volumes in its core businesses.
Turning to Slide 7. We have a significant number of regulatory and legislative initiatives, both in the U.S. and Europe. I'll take care of the U.S. side and then turn it over to Dominique for the European side. In the U.S., we have intensified our regulatory advocacy in numerous ways, speaking not only on our own behalf but for investors, issuers and the markets more broadly. For instance, we've been an active participant in CFTC and SEC rule makings to implement the Dodd-Frank act. We participated in Asia and see roundtables on derivatives regulation, met weekly with agency staff and commissioners on both derivatives and cash market issues, and build coalitions with industry participants wherever possible.
We have also spent countless hours with the SEC and CFTC staff as they produced a very thoughtful and thorough analysis of May 6 market turmoil. And in speeches, meetings and commentary, we continue to be a strong advocate for needed market structure reforms, including increased transparency, enhanced market surveillance and the banning of flash orders. We've also increased our advocacy on macroeconomic issues like job creation and economic growth by providing our experience and that of our thousands of listed companies to officials at the White House, in the Treasury Department and on Capitol Hill.
Finally, before I turn it over to Dominique, we wanted to make sure we address the Arca book issue, which came up again last week. If people want to get into this more in Q&A, we can. Larry and I are prepared to answer any questions about that. But let me just give you a quick summary. This is referencing the rule filing that was approved by the SEC in 2008. We began charging these fees for market data in early 2009. Remember that in the Dodd-Frank act, this market data filings are all effective upon filing and then they can be suspended by the SEC within 60 days. In this case, in the case of many other filings recently by our competitors, so far none of these have been suspended. This one has been appeal. The court who approved the appeal did say we have to improve the competitiveness and some of the economic support for the market data filing, and we're working on that actively. And again, we can get into that in Q&A if anybody would like to. But remember that under the new regime, you will see more market data filings like this, they are effective on filing. And so far, none of them has been suspended.
So at this point, speaking on Slide 7. I will turn the call over to Dominique, and he will handle the European fee for the regulatory landscape and then update you on a number of other issues ranging from our data center launches to some additional insights on our technology services business. Thanks. Dominic?"

And this terminate in proposals in the second quarter of 2011. And after part of this review, the EU will be working closely with U.S. counterparts to develop a common approach to the regulation to some of the book rates trading[ph]. 
Derivatives regulation is also a key issue in Europe as it is in the U.S. The European commission issued a proposed draft of EMIR, which stands for European Market Infrastructure Regulation and also on [indiscernible] legislation on September 15 and this legislation is currently going to the European government and the legislative process is expected to last through most of 2011.
The European Commission has introduced the concept of financial activities tax, or FAT, and the financial transition of FAT SEC Europe. This was done in parallel with the working document on financial sector taxations. As we have stated previously, we are not in favor in any form of transaction FAT, and we will advocate this view on behalf of our shareholders and listed clients.
Lastly on Europe, we expect to see some proposed legislation on several other items in fourth quarter of 2010 and first quarter of 2011, like corporate governance, market abuse, transparency requirements for small capitals.
Turning to Slide 8. I'm pleased to report to you that we are now officially launched our EU liquidity center. And on this slide, we have provided an updated timeline on where we go from here. We have successfully completed on time the build out of the two new data centers and had to spend many years as you know in the facility sector, I can confirm that this is a tremendous completion. As I look back at least three of the facilities phase, they are which of being demonstrate sort migration. We are moving entire trading market.
And we are able to get not only for the dedication and hardwork of our global technology staff, and I thank them for their effort. It's another clear demonstration that we can execute against putting.
So let me sort of summarize where we are on Slide 8. In the U.S., our NYSE market completed its migration to Mahwah on August 25. The Europe, our cash market completed the migration successfully as it has been on September 27. And NYSE Liffe derivative market migrated yesterday on November 1, so that's all done. 
On the co-location business, in the U.S., about 97% of the costs we've sold-out. And in Europe, the rollout of the. And then the co-location revenues was viewed as we enter 2011, and we should keep full slide with two quarter 2011 billings.
The next step is the migration is for NYSE open market to migrate from Mahwah in the U.S. And that's the outlook is and what I see markets to migrate in Mahwah in the U.S., and that's the end of the first quarter 2011. And as we complete the integration progress, we will begin to retiring obsolete data centers we need to protect and our regional data center. Europe as well, where we have also look upon data center we will begin the rationalization process and ensure that we have adequate data capabilities in both U.S. and in Europe.
Let's move to Slide 9. We give you an example that in technologies that closed or are closing. So thanks to strong investment and subsequent acquisition, we now own a wide range of technology assets, including the main one, our state of the art Mahwah in Washington data center. Our best of class universal trading platform. Our world class safety network and leading communication best of breed market-based space and any of these products . And thanks with the investors, we are building market [indiscernible] provide our clients with a consolidated produce and productivity. Our strategic is reported and concerned by both market trends and the recent state of the art we're seeing from prospects seem to absorb that investiture. And Slide 9 as they show all of them. We fully integrate the value of existing asset, transaction and divestiture and data services when building service platforms either through partnerships with other or a solution provider  to clients.. 
On the top left side of the chart, global Tier 1, we will provide a full solution from continuing and management, and shows that NYSE Technology is now steadily as a Tier 1 service provider.
Must be in order on the left side, the U.S. [indiscernible] side. We provide the fully consolidated managed trading platform, and that is an example of the services that would make sense. We already talked in the middle of the chart about our partnership with the Qatar exchange, Tokyo exchange and the large Eastern European stock exchange that were just qualitative entries that's welcome. And they should effectively our platform, again, geographic and worldwide. We have mostly the recent partnership that have quickly [indiscernible] full breadth of solution.
Bottom of the chart, and most on market data and administration services, we provide to this global bank that I believe into a very wide range of market data programs where we are confirming some specific requirements  in that matter from a data platform, to fully manage across asset class integrations. And the development of the strategic deals, we guide as we said recently our world to ensure that we achieved our regional objective with the same time hitting our margin target of between 25% and 30%. 
With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Mike for a review of the financial results."

Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the third quarter. Total revenues for the quarter were $1.1 billion, which was down 9% year-over-year and 16% versus the second quarter. Net income and diluted EPS are up",2376,"Thanks, Dominique, and good morning. Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the third quarter. Total revenues for the quarter were $1.1 billion, which was down 9% year-over-year and 16% versus the second quarter. Net income and diluted EPS are up year-over-year, but down compared to the second quarter of 2010, reflecting the slower trading volume environment we experienced in the third quarter.
This quarter, we reported a $25 million charge for merger expenses and exit costs, more than half related to exit costs for our data centers. Last year's merger expenses and exit cost of $8 million was principally for severance. As we have stated previously, the data center related exit costs for legacy systems and platforms is expected to reduce dramatically after this year.
This quarter, we also recorded a deferred tax benefit of $21 million related to the reduction of the U.K. tax rates from 28% to 27%. A drop from 28% to 27% is the first step by U.K. tax authorities to lower the U.K. tax rate to 24% in the coming years. In the prior-year quarter, we reported a $4 million in net pretax gain from asset disposals primarily related to the sale of our stake in BM&F Bovespa.
My review of our financial results from this point forward, we'll exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs. Deferred tax benefits just referenced as well as gains from this global activity.
Slide 11 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the third quarter. Including merger expenses, exit costs, deferred tax benefits and asset sales, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.46, down 13% versus the prior year of $0.53. Year-to-date, EPS of $1.64 is up 12%. These results include a positive $0.02 EPS impact for a reduction of our effective tax rate from 27.5% to 26.5% as a result of the adoption of favorable tax loss in the Netherlands. We expect to have an effective tax rate of 26.5% for the remainder of 2010.
Our focus for 2010 is revenue growth and margin expansion. While the third quarter was challenging, we are pleased with our progress on both front thus far. On a constant dollar basis, year-to-date revenues were up 5% and margins have improved from 32% to 34%. These results were negatively impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar. Operating income was $180 million, down 8% compared to the third quarter of 2009.
At the time of the launch, we stopped capitalizing interest expense related to the build out of our data center in the U.S. has increased our net interest expense up for the quarter by $1 million to $26 million. In the fourth quarter, we will no longer capitalize interest expense for our U.K. data center, this will increase our net interest expense by an incremental $3 million. The average weighted diluted sharecount increased slightly in the current quarter driven by the vesting of LTIP grants. We expect the share count to remain at 262 million shares for the remainder of the year.
With a largely fixed expense base, we have significant operating leverage on incremental revenue and volume growth. Leverage however cuts both ways and, that's what we experienced in the third quarter.
Slide 12 provides our segment results on a currency neutral basis. U.S. dollar weakened this quarter versus prior year for both the euro and the British pound. For the third quarter, 48% of our net revenue was denominated in either euros or pounds. Currency impact was unfavorable $25 million versus prior year and a favorable $7 million versus the prior quarter. On a currency neutral basis, third quarter net revenues were flat and operating income declined 2% versus the third quarter of 2009. Operationally, revenues for our derivative segment was flat and the technology segment grew 26% versus Q3 prior year. Cash trading and listings revenue declined by 6%, driven with the lower U.S. volumes and lower revenue capture in Europe.
On Slide 13. We show our 2010 year-to-date net revenue split by business activity and segments in comparison to the prior-year period. The company continues to benefit from a diversified revenue base, which has helped dampen the impact of FX and volumes in the current quarter. 49% of our net revenues were generated by transactions in clearing fees for the first nine months of 2010. This is in line with prior year, although this year's results include the benefit of Liffe Clearing, which was acquired in July of last year. We saw the contribution in technology service that show the most meaningful increase with specific gains stemming from NYFIX, growth in our SFTI Europe network and recent software and infrastructure sales.
Turning to our segments. Cash trading and listings comprised 49% of our net revenue. Year-to-date, the derivative segment remains our fastest-growing segment contributing 34% of our net revenues, up from 29% in 2009, followed by the technology segment, which grew from 14% to 17% of revenue. Again, this is consistent with our revenue guidance, and where we have invested in new initiatives. Though not showing on the chart, 52% of our Q3 net revenues originated in the U.S. and 48% in  Europe.
Slide 14 and 15 detailed the financial performance of our derivative segment. I'm not going to go through these slides in great detail, but simply touch upon a few points. Net revenues were $188 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $10 million or 5% versus Q3 prior year and down $38 million or 17% from the very strong second quarter 2010. Adjusting for foreign currency impact, net revenue decreased 2% versus the prior year third quarter. Decrease versus the second quarter of 2010 was driven by volume declines in the overall market, NYC Liffe and U.S. options from elevated second quarter levels. 
The average net rate per contract for NYSE Liffe derivatives excluding Bclear was $0.67 per contract in the third quarter compared to $0.75 in the third quarter of 2009 and $0.64 in the second quarter of 2010. The decline versus the third quarter of last year was due to a stronger dollar as well as business mix in the third quarter of 2009, which resulted in lower liquidity payment during that period.
The increase versus the second quarter was principally due to the weakening of the dollar. Rate per contract in the U.S options was $0.17 per contract in the third quarter. This is down versus the prior year but up slightly quarter-over-quarter. The reason for the decrease year-over-year was largely attribute to an increase in Penny Pilot issues created on NYC Arca and minor pricing changes, which were offset by market share gains. Our Global Derivatives segment margins declined to 49% in Q3 from 53% in the prior-year quarter. Derivatives accounted for 43% of our operating income.
Similarly, Slide 16 and 17 show you the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash trading and listings net revenue was $298 million in the third quarter of 2010, down versus both the prior-year period and sequentially. Net transaction revenues, adjusting for foreign currency, were down 6% versus Q3 2009. This was attributed by pricing reductions in European cash in 2009 and lower overall market volumes in U.S. cash. Partially offset by a 9% increase in average U.S. net capture and higher market share across all venues for U.S. cash trading.
Market share on our four European markets was down slightly to 73% in the third quarter from the second quarter levels. Revenue capture for U.S. cash trended up to $0.31 per 100 shares in line with expectations and recent trends. Revenue capture for European cash was $0.66 per transaction versus $0.90 in the prior year. The decline in European pricing was attributed to the stronger dollar, prior year price reductions and a less favorable mix.
As previously announced, we have redesigned and simplify the pricing for our European cash trading offerings, effective November 1. We eliminate the distinction between agency and principal tradings, and will implement other changes that more aligned us with other European regulated exchanges. Operating margin for Cash Trading and Listings segment was 34% in the third quarter, consistent with the third quarter of 2009.
Slide 18 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information Services and Technology Solutions net revenue was $113 million in the third quarter, an increase of $19 million or 20% from Q3 prior year. On a currency neutral basis, revenues were higher by 26%. The increase was primarily driven by NYFIX acquisitions, growth in safety clients, delivering of UTP to cutter and some large software and infrastructure sales. Revenues were $6 million or 6% higher than Q2.
Operating income was $24 million, a 100% increase to prior and a 20% increase from the second quarter of 2010. Operating margin was 21% compared to 13% in the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30%. As our data center is now alive, we will be focusing on migrating clients and market and join their liquidity hubs. Co-location revenues begin to accelerate and reached our annualized level for Q2 2011.
Slide 19 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. We continue to make excellent progress in lowering our cost base in real term while funding incremental investments to grow the business. As expected, Q2 expenses were about second quarter levels as we began to appreciate the new data centers. After adjusting for negative impact of a weaker dollar, after incremental data center integration spending, fixed costs were just $4 million above Q2 in an apples-to-apples basis. Third quarter operating expenses were down $7 million versus last year on a reported basis. However, after adjusting for FX and the impact of acquisitions and divestiture such as NYFIX and Hugin and new initiatives, fixed operating costs were down $26 million or 6% in the third quarter of 2009. 
On a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis, year-to-date fixed expenses were down $97 million or 8% compared to the prior year period. We continue to make good progress and our focus on efficiency and productivity improvements, and will further reduce operating expenses NYSE Euronext in the coming years.
Slide 20 provides you with some FX sensitivity for annual expense items. In March, when we provided fixed cost guidance for 2010 at $1.723 billion to $1.768 billion, we indicated that this guidance was predicated on the average FX rates for 2009 of $1.39 for the euro and $1.57 for the pound. Based on recent currency moves, we now estimate full year 2010 currency rates of around $1.34 for the euro and $1.55 for the pound, from which you derived a currency adjusted full year 2010 at expense guidance range of $1.707 billion to $1.749 billion. Based on fixed cost developments through the three quarters of the year and a year-to-date spend of $1.253 million, we now expect our full year 2010 fixed expenses to come in below the low end of the currency adjusted range.
We remain committed to our 2011 objective of reducing constant dollar, constant portfolio of fixed expenses below $1.650 million. 2010 acquisition such as corporate board member, NYSE Blue and our May announcement to build two new clearinghouse in Europe are incremental to this guidance. In the third quarter, 61% of our operating expenses was denominated in dollars, 19% in euros, 20% in pounds. Our staffing level as of September 30 was 3,030 full-time positions, which is 337 positions or 10% below year end levels and include 34 staff from our recent acquisition of corporate board member.
Previously indicated, we do expect cost to rise in the fourth quarter largely due to the migration into our new data center, investments in our new European clearinghouses and launching of interest rate futures in the U.S. A weaker dollar are also increased costs, which is more than offset of the beneficial impact on European revenue. In addition to the integration and transition costs, we began to appreciate a new data centers, which it added an incremental depreciation of approximately $4 million in the third quarter of 2010 and an incremental $10 million will be a flow-through in the fourth quarter. Over time, this will be mitigated as we exit our legacy data centers.
Slide 21 details our cash and debt position as of September 30, 2010. Total debt was $2.5 billion, cash market securities totaled $0.4 billion and net debt was $2.1 billion. The $2.5 billion of debt, included $2.1 billion of long-term debt with a weighted average cost of 5.3%, the remaining $400 million short-term debt consisted of commercial paper at an average cost of approximately 0.5%. Through nine months, we have spent $244 million on capital expenditures, including $106 million related to our data centers. We expect our capital expenditures to decline significantly over the next two quarters to a more maintenance levels. We will provide more guidance for the outlook for CapEx at our Investor Day in March 2011.
We also paid a net $126 million in Section 31-B to the SEC this quarter, reflecting the usual payment of the eight months of these pass-through charges. At the end of September, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.25x, up from 1.9x at the end of June 2010 but still down from the 2.6x at the end of 2009. The increase in leverage ratio in Q3 was due to the seasonal effect of the payment of section 31 fee I referenced earlier, another cash outflows, including the second quarter payment and the weakening of the dollar at the end of the third quarter, which increased debt in dollar terms by $150 million. We expect our debt to EBITDA to move lower in fourth quarter as cash flows improve.
NYSE Euronext is currently rated A+ by S&P and AAA by Moody’s, and we are now on stable outlook with S&P. We continue to operate within our long-term target leverage levels, and we are committed to continue to invest in our growth and return excess cash flow to our shareholders. Last week, the Board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2010 which is payable on December 31. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Duncan for some closing remarks and then we'll take your questions."

Obviously, a quarter with very challenging market conditions. But I've come away from the quarter pretty optimistic and very pleased with the progress we're making in our multiyear strategy as we endeavored to create a global capital markets community. I think the decisions we've made in the past few years to acquire other businesses are now generating incremental revenue, and that's more than helping us offset the negative impacts of things that we don't control like the currency and the volume.
I also think that this was the quarter where we're beginning to see the results of our diversification efforts. As it's clear, there are business model is much better positioned than it was a few quarters ago. This revised periods like the one we're in right now. And I think as we look forward to 2011, with all of the things that Dominic and Mike had just touched on in terms of initiatives coming on the back of the data centers, we combine that with the anticipated launch of interest rate futures and the launch of New York portfolio we're beginning early in 2011, I think we're very optimistic that we've got some built-in growth drivers for next year, even if the volume environment remains where it is. I think if you ask us as a management team, we're cautiously optimistic that through 2011 will look a lot brighter. It's hard for us to imagine that people who just continue to stay out of the listed equity and derivative markets to the degree they have in the last few months.
The other thing I like about our data centers I think it is, they're very representative of how we've been able to change the culture of the company. This is a much more innovative company than it was a few years ago. It's a truly globally integrated enterprise now. And I think these data centers, which really will act as liquidity hubs for our community strategy going forward, I think will prove to be the cornerstone of that technology services growth story that we've talked so much about in the last few quarters. So all in all, thank you for listening. We think it's a very good show and given the conditions. And we are increasingly confident going into next year about our abilities to effectively meet the ever changing needs of our ever expanding customer base.
With that, that concludes our formal remarks, and we will open up the lines for Q&A. You've got Mike and Larry in Europe and you've got Dominic and you've got me here in Paris."

As you know, we have two hauls where we have to just filled out the infrastructure that expand into. Those will require capital investment. But the second option is to actually just densify the power supply in the existing hauls, which is a much smaller capital expenditure. This actually gives us more capacity within that. And we are looking at that option as a, it cost less and also, it's far less the lead time to do that. The we look at co-lo is it's an incremental revenue. It has cost against at obviously the that we, and we think that the ROI in it is good. But it's also important to our general strategy of building the liquidity hub and telling other value-added technology services whether those are, take or plans, managed services or other services that go along with it. So it's all part of the broader technologies, strategy that Dominic and his team have embarked on. So we sort of see it as a whole, we're really pleased with the way this is going out and we expect it to continue. So I don't if that answers it. We're not completely transparent in terms of the granularity of co-lo revenues. But you know what our competitors disclose and you should assume that we're not pretty far off on that."

I think it's a little early to tell exactly how much of these products find their way through trading venues or swap executions, facilities, et cetera. But I would tell you that our view on any of these front ends is that given that these products have here before it had been in the OTC space, any of these products that find their way, either voluntarily or by regulatory fee have to be traded more transparently. Our view is not, if you build that they will come theory, we would anticipate that we would construct these in partnership with the team, liquidity providers. We would take the selling to the realized approach we've taken in some of our other projects like our MX options business and our NYSE Liffe as to derivatives business.

They've got have enough liquidity to sort of draw the flow, include is some fungibility or interoperability of clearing issues. I think that the market is just not as well developed. We certainly do have high-frequency traders that are acting more like market makers than just liquidity takers on the regulated platforms. And I would assume that the same is true on our competitors' MTF platforms as well as the regulated market. So I don't know whether the mix is a little bit different in Europe versus the U.S. I just think the market is less well developed because there are fewer routing options, and routing itself is not as well developed or is clearing interoperability.

I'm going to start on Slide 3 entitled Third Quarter 2010 Update. And I would start by saying that we're very pleased with the progress we made in the third quarter, executing against our long-term strategy. In this quarter, we made tangible progress on our goals of operating the most meaningful capital markets, creating broader and deeper networks and delivering innovative products to our expanding client base. Our business model continues to diversify, and we are focusing on new initiatives and growth area to deliver value for our shareholders through all sorts of business cycles.
For the quarter, we recorded EPS of $0.46 per share on net revenue of $599 million, down from $0.53 on $620 million in net revenue in the prior year period. The strengthening of the dollar year-over-year reduced our net revenue by $25 million and EPS by $0.03. Helping to dampen the negative impact of currencies was $31 million in incremental revenue from new businesses, highlighting the continuing diversification of our model, which I will touch on in more detail later.
Our technology business continue to show great growth and benefited from the addition of NYFIX and expanding customer base and improved software sales, driving increased revenue and operating margins. And the business hit several milestones with Qatar and the Tokyo Stock exchanges, as well as in large Eastern European stock exchange signing up to do business with us. The next stage in the growth trajectory for this business will be a combination of co-location revenues and follow-on technology sales from these co-locating clients.
On the cash and listing side, we are continuing to see strong demand for our listing venues in terms of transfers, new listings and secondaries. Year-to-date through September, 13 companies have transferred to the NYSE from other exchanges with a total market capitalization of over $40 billion. A total of 78 issuers have listed on NYSE Euronext markets, raising total proceeds of just over $17 billion, including nine Chinese companies that raised to just under $1 billion. Important to note that this success has continued in October and even in early November where we've already had two listings from Asia two days in for the month.
NYSE Euronext is also the leader year-to-date for proceeds raised through global secondaries for the total of 370 issuers, raising total proceeds of just under $150 billion, which also included the largest secondary ever done in Petrobras, which raised 25 of the $70 billion that they raised in the U.S. markets.
On the cash equities trading side, we are continuing to focus on stability and profitability. In the U.S., our market share in the third quarter is up across all three takes year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. In Europe, our share has remained relatively stable at 73%, SmartPool continues to show some strong growth. And we continue to believe that over the long-term, we will see growth in the overall European market.
Lastly, the results in our Derivatives segment were mixed. With continued growth in our U.S. Options businesses helping to partially offset negative currency and lackluster volume trends in our European derivatives business year-over-year. The combination of lower volatility and the heightened prospects for a second round of quantitative easing has clouded the outlook for interest rates and inflation, which has reduced a need for hedging over our NYSE Liffe platform and resulted in trading volume declines compared to the elevated second quarter levels.
To close on Slide 3, let me just touch briefly on a few selected business highlights for the quarter. I am most pleased to report that our NYPC DCO filing with the CFTC is now complete, and we entered the 90-day comment period yesterday. Additionally, we have been discussing with the SEC the necessary rule of filings that will govern across the cross margining agreement between NYPC and DTCC's FICC division, and we expect to formally submit that filing later this week and get the clock ticking on that comment period as well. Pending these regulatory approvals, we anticipate the launch of NYPC and the simultaneous launch of U.S. Treasury and euro/dollar futures on our NYSE Liffe U.S. future's platform in the first quarter of 2011. The CFTC, SEC, and Federal Reserve have demonstrated a high degree of coordination throughout this comprehensive review process, and we are grateful to all of the agencies involved for their substantial efforts, especially in light of its challenges they all face with the Dodd-Frank rule making processes. We will continue to work closely with these regulators through the remaining phase of the regulatory approval process, which we expect to end sometime in February of 2011.
I'm also pleased to report that we have successfully completed on time our multiyear plan to build two state-of-the-art liquidity hubs in the U.S. and the U.K., which I will let Dominique speak to later. Within our technology business, we are seeing building momentum as we move forward with our goal of $1 billion in revenue by 2015. We delivered the UTP platform to cutter in the third quarter, and we are beginning work on the derivatives exchange there as well. More recently, as I mentioned earlier, the Tokyo Stock exchange and a large Eastern European stock exchange have chosen NYSE technologies to build trading platforms for their respective exchanges. Our operating margin for this business crossed the 20% threshold for the first time, showing strong progress toward our goal of 25% to 30% margins.
Lastly in the third quarter, we boasted our listings franchise with the acquisition of corporate Board member, a premier provider of director education programs. As I alluded to earlier, we have a great pipeline of IPO prospects and transfer prospects from other exchanges to NYSE Euronext. 
Please swing to Slide 4. Slide 4 is a slide that you've seen before, where we outlined and highlight our 2010 priorities for our various business segments. Our objective is to leverage our global infrastructure and scale, to support our businesses and our customers businesses, and create a community premium for our shareholders over time. At the center of the company in support of our three segments is UTP, our globally integrated and scalable trading platform. And on arrival of global connectivity network and customer gateways, our focus on clearing, which will take on an even greater importance in the coming quarters and two brand-new world-class data centers.
We put the slide at every quarter to remind you of what we are working toward. And now that we are coming for the end of the year, it is really designed to show you what we have accomplished this year. I think you can put check marks next to the most, if not all, of the items on the slide.
Slide 5, focusing on execution. On Slide 5, we provide you with a summary of the major initiatives that we have underway for each of our segments. In addition to these points, we also have many more new initiatives on the drawing board to ensure that we have a pipeline of new initiatives ready to come online in the quarters ahead to bolster our business model and to grow our franchise. I think most of the stuff on Slide 5 is familiar to all of you, and we'll touch on a lot what we haven't already in our remarks later in the presentation.
On Slide 6. We try to show the revenue contribution of our new businesses, which reflect the increasing diversification of our model. The $31 million in incremental net revenue generated by our new businesses help dampen the impact of externalities, including foreign exchange and lower capture at volumes in selected markets. This incremental revenue came from a variety of sources; including NYFIX, which is annuity like due to the nature of the revenue model for that business and the stickiness of the channels; the reinsourcing of clearing and verticalization of our NYSE Liffe business in Europe, which occurred in late July last year; technology services revenue from Cutter [ph]; and lastly a small amount of incremental revenue from corporate Board member in the quarter.
In the current quarter where we face significant headwinds, including foreign exchange, neutral to declining volumes and capture across selected markets, we were still able to record a solid $0.46 in earnings on $599 million of revenue. This compares to just for note $0.43 in the EPS that we earned about six quarters ago in the first quarter of 2009 on basically the same amount of revenue slightly higher of $605 million. Now why do we mention that? Because it sort of a random comparison. The reason I felt that was interesting is here we are at six quarters later with the currency against us on a comparative basis, U.S. volumes down 50%, our capture and our European business down 40% because of price cuts we've made in response to competition in the last two years yet our earnings are higher on a similar revenue base. Hopefully, that begins to tell you that we're well on the way on this journey to transform the company and be a much more diversified company who is much less reliant on volumes in its core businesses.
Turning to Slide 7. We have a significant number of regulatory and legislative initiatives, both in the U.S. and Europe. I'll take care of the U.S. side and then turn it over to Dominique for the European side. In the U.S., we have intensified our regulatory advocacy in numerous ways, speaking not only on our own behalf but for investors, issuers and the markets more broadly. For instance, we've been an active participant in CFTC and SEC rule makings to implement the Dodd-Frank act. We participated in Asia and see roundtables on derivatives regulation, met weekly with agency staff and commissioners on both derivatives and cash market issues, and build coalitions with industry participants wherever possible.
We have also spent countless hours with the SEC and CFTC staff as they produced a very thoughtful and thorough analysis of May 6 market turmoil. And in speeches, meetings and commentary, we continue to be a strong advocate for needed market structure reforms, including increased transparency, enhanced market surveillance and the banning of flash orders. We've also increased our advocacy on macroeconomic issues like job creation and economic growth by providing our experience and that of our thousands of listed companies to officials at the White House, in the Treasury Department and on Capitol Hill.
Finally, before I turn it over to Dominique, we wanted to make sure we address the Arca book issue, which came up again last week. If people want to get into this more in Q&A, we can. Larry and I are prepared to answer any questions about that. But let me just give you a quick summary. This is referencing the rule filing that was approved by the SEC in 2008. We began charging these fees for market data in early 2009. Remember that in the Dodd-Frank act, this market data filings are all effective upon filing and then they can be suspended by the SEC within 60 days. In this case, in the case of many other filings recently by our competitors, so far none of these have been suspended. This one has been appeal. The court who approved the appeal did say we have to improve the competitiveness and some of the economic support for the market data filing, and we're working on that actively. And again, we can get into that in Q&A if anybody would like to. But remember that under the new regime, you will see more market data filings like this, they are effective on filing. And so far, none of them has been suspended.
So at this point, speaking on Slide 7. I will turn the call over to Dominique, and he will handle the European fee for the regulatory landscape and then update you on a number of other issues ranging from our data center launches to some additional insights on our technology services business. Thanks. Dominic?

European policy makers are working on this comprehensive review process, and we are grateful to all the agencies with the European Commission due to issue of decompensation in November. And this terminate in proposals in the second quarter of 2011. And after part of this review, the EU will be working closely with U.S. counterparts to develop a common approach to the regulation to some of the book rates trading[ph]. 
Derivatives regulation is also a key issue in Europe as it is in the U.S. The European commission issued a proposed draft of EMIR, which stands for European Market Infrastructure Regulation and also on [indiscernible] legislation on September 15 and this legislation is currently going to the European government and the legislative process is expected to last through most of 2011.
The European Commission has introduced the concept of financial activities tax, or FAT, and the financial transition of FAT SEC Europe. This was done in parallel with the working document on financial sector taxations. As we have stated previously, we are not in favor in any form of transaction FAT, and we will advocate this view on behalf of our shareholders and listed clients.
Lastly on Europe, we expect to see some proposed legislation on several other items in fourth quarter of 2010 and first quarter of 2011, like corporate governance, market abuse, transparency requirements for small capitals.
Turning to Slide 8. I'm pleased to report to you that we are now officially launched our EU liquidity center. And on this slide, we have provided an updated timeline on where we go from here. We have successfully completed on time the build out of the two new data centers and had to spend many years as you know in the facility sector, I can confirm that this is a tremendous completion. As I look back at least three of the facilities phase, they are which of being demonstrate sort migration. We are moving entire trading market.
And we are able to get not only for the dedication and hardwork of our global technology staff, and I thank them for their effort. It's another clear demonstration that we can execute against putting.
So let me sort of summarize where we are on Slide 8. In the U.S., our NYSE market completed its migration to Mahwah on August 25. The Europe, our cash market completed the migration successfully as it has been on September 27. And NYSE Liffe derivative market migrated yesterday on November 1, so that's all done. 
On the co-location business, in the U.S., about 97% of the costs we've sold-out. And in Europe, the rollout of the. And then the co-location revenues was viewed as we enter 2011, and we should keep full slide with two quarter 2011 billings.
The next step is the migration is for NYSE open market to migrate from Mahwah in the U.S. And that's the outlook is and what I see markets to migrate in Mahwah in the U.S., and that's the end of the first quarter 2011. And as we complete the integration progress, we will begin to retiring obsolete data centers we need to protect and our regional data center. Europe as well, where we have also look upon data center we will begin the rationalization process and ensure that we have adequate data capabilities in both U.S. and in Europe.
Let's move to Slide 9. We give you an example that in technologies that closed or are closing. So thanks to strong investment and subsequent acquisition, we now own a wide range of technology assets, including the main one, our state of the art Mahwah in Washington data center. Our best of class universal trading platform. Our world class safety network and leading communication best of breed market-based space and any of these products . And thanks with the investors, we are building market [indiscernible] provide our clients with a consolidated produce and productivity. Our strategic is reported and concerned by both market trends and the recent state of the art we're seeing from prospects seem to absorb that investiture. And Slide 9 as they show all of them. We fully integrate the value of existing asset, transaction and divestiture and data services when building service platforms either through partnerships with other or a solution provider  to clients.. 
On the top left side of the chart, global Tier 1, we will provide a full solution from continuing and management, and shows that NYSE Technology is now steadily as a Tier 1 service provider.
Must be in order on the left side, the U.S. [indiscernible] side. We provide the fully consolidated managed trading platform, and that is an example of the services that would make sense. We already talked in the middle of the chart about our partnership with the Qatar exchange, Tokyo exchange and the large Eastern European stock exchange that were just qualitative entries that's welcome. And they should effectively our platform, again, geographic and worldwide. We have mostly the recent partnership that have quickly [indiscernible] full breadth of solution.
Bottom of the chart, and most on market data and administration services, we provide to this global bank that I believe into a very wide range of market data programs where we are confirming some specific requirements  in that matter from a data platform, to fully manage across asset class integrations. And the development of the strategic deals, we guide as we said recently our world to ensure that we achieved our regional objective with the same time hitting our margin target of between 25% and 30%. 
With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Mike for a review of the financial results.

Net income and diluted EPS are up",2376,"Thanks, Dominique, and good morning. Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the third quarter. Total revenues for the quarter were $1.1 billion, which was down 9% year-over-year and 16% versus the second quarter. Net income and diluted EPS are up year-over-year, but down compared to the second quarter of 2010, reflecting the slower trading volume environment we experienced in the third quarter.
This quarter, we reported a $25 million charge for merger expenses and exit costs, more than half related to exit costs for our data centers. Last year's merger expenses and exit cost of $8 million was principally for severance. As we have stated previously, the data center related exit costs for legacy systems and platforms is expected to reduce dramatically after this year.
This quarter, we also recorded a deferred tax benefit of $21 million related to the reduction of the U.K. tax rates from 28% to 27%. A drop from 28% to 27% is the first step by U.K. tax authorities to lower the U.K. tax rate to 24% in the coming years. In the prior-year quarter, we reported a $4 million in net pretax gain from asset disposals primarily related to the sale of our stake in BM&F Bovespa.
My review of our financial results from this point forward, we'll exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs. Deferred tax benefits just referenced as well as gains from this global activity.
Slide 11 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the third quarter. Including merger expenses, exit costs, deferred tax benefits and asset sales, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.46, down 13% versus the prior year of $0.53. Year-to-date, EPS of $1.64 is up 12%. These results include a positive $0.02 EPS impact for a reduction of our effective tax rate from 27.5% to 26.5% as a result of the adoption of favorable tax loss in the Netherlands. We expect to have an effective tax rate of 26.5% for the remainder of 2010.
Our focus for 2010 is revenue growth and margin expansion. While the third quarter was challenging, we are pleased with our progress on both front thus far. On a constant dollar basis, year-to-date revenues were up 5% and margins have improved from 32% to 34%. These results were negatively impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar. Operating income was $180 million, down 8% compared to the third quarter of 2009.
At the time of the launch, we stopped capitalizing interest expense related to the build out of our data center in the U.S. has increased our net interest expense up for the quarter by $1 million to $26 million. In the fourth quarter, we will no longer capitalize interest expense for our U.K. data center, this will increase our net interest expense by an incremental $3 million. The average weighted diluted sharecount increased slightly in the current quarter driven by the vesting of LTIP grants. We expect the share count to remain at 262 million shares for the remainder of the year.
With a largely fixed expense base, we have significant operating leverage on incremental revenue and volume growth. Leverage however cuts both ways and, that's what we experienced in the third quarter.
Slide 12 provides our segment results on a currency neutral basis. U.S. dollar weakened this quarter versus prior year for both the euro and the British pound. For the third quarter, 48% of our net revenue was denominated in either euros or pounds. Currency impact was unfavorable $25 million versus prior year and a favorable $7 million versus the prior quarter. On a currency neutral basis, third quarter net revenues were flat and operating income declined 2% versus the third quarter of 2009. Operationally, revenues for our derivative segment was flat and the technology segment grew 26% versus Q3 prior year. Cash trading and listings revenue declined by 6%, driven with the lower U.S. volumes and lower revenue capture in Europe.
On Slide 13. We show our 2010 year-to-date net revenue split by business activity and segments in comparison to the prior-year period. The company continues to benefit from a diversified revenue base, which has helped dampen the impact of FX and volumes in the current quarter. 49% of our net revenues were generated by transactions in clearing fees for the first nine months of 2010. This is in line with prior year, although this year's results include the benefit of Liffe Clearing, which was acquired in July of last year. We saw the contribution in technology service that show the most meaningful increase with specific gains stemming from NYFIX, growth in our SFTI Europe network and recent software and infrastructure sales.
Turning to our segments. Cash trading and listings comprised 49% of our net revenue. Year-to-date, the derivative segment remains our fastest-growing segment contributing 34% of our net revenues, up from 29% in 2009, followed by the technology segment, which grew from 14% to 17% of revenue. Again, this is consistent with our revenue guidance, and where we have invested in new initiatives. Though not showing on the chart, 52% of our Q3 net revenues originated in the U.S. and 48% in  Europe.
Slide 14 and 15 detailed the financial performance of our derivative segment. I'm not going to go through these slides in great detail, but simply touch upon a few points. Net revenues were $188 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $10 million or 5% versus Q3 prior year and down $38 million or 17% from the very strong second quarter 2010. Adjusting for foreign currency impact, net revenue decreased 2% versus the prior year third quarter. Decrease versus the second quarter of 2010 was driven by volume declines in the overall market, NYC Liffe and U.S. options from elevated second quarter levels. 
The average net rate per contract for NYSE Liffe derivatives excluding Bclear was $0.67 per contract in the third quarter compared to $0.75 in the third quarter of 2009 and $0.64 in the second quarter of 2010. The decline versus the third quarter of last year was due to a stronger dollar as well as business mix in the third quarter of 2009, which resulted in lower liquidity payment during that period.
The increase versus the second quarter was principally due to the weakening of the dollar. Rate per contract in the U.S options was $0.17 per contract in the third quarter. This is down versus the prior year but up slightly quarter-over-quarter. The reason for the decrease year-over-year was largely attribute to an increase in Penny Pilot issues created on NYC Arca and minor pricing changes, which were offset by market share gains. Our Global Derivatives segment margins declined to 49% in Q3 from 53% in the prior-year quarter. Derivatives accounted for 43% of our operating income.
Similarly, Slide 16 and 17 show you the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash trading and listings net revenue was $298 million in the third quarter of 2010, down versus both the prior-year period and sequentially. Net transaction revenues, adjusting for foreign currency, were down 6% versus Q3 2009. This was attributed by pricing reductions in European cash in 2009 and lower overall market volumes in U.S. cash. Partially offset by a 9% increase in average U.S. net capture and higher market share across all venues for U.S. cash trading.
Market share on our four European markets was down slightly to 73% in the third quarter from the second quarter levels. Revenue capture for U.S. cash trended up to $0.31 per 100 shares in line with expectations and recent trends. Revenue capture for European cash was $0.66 per transaction versus $0.90 in the prior year. The decline in European pricing was attributed to the stronger dollar, prior year price reductions and a less favorable mix.
As previously announced, we have redesigned and simplify the pricing for our European cash trading offerings, effective November 1. We eliminate the distinction between agency and principal tradings, and will implement other changes that more aligned us with other European regulated exchanges. Operating margin for Cash Trading and Listings segment was 34% in the third quarter, consistent with the third quarter of 2009.
Slide 18 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information Services and Technology Solutions net revenue was $113 million in the third quarter, an increase of $19 million or 20% from Q3 prior year. On a currency neutral basis, revenues were higher by 26%. The increase was primarily driven by NYFIX acquisitions, growth in safety clients, delivering of UTP to cutter and some large software and infrastructure sales. Revenues were $6 million or 6% higher than Q2.
Operating income was $24 million, a 100% increase to prior and a 20% increase from the second quarter of 2010. Operating margin was 21% compared to 13% in the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30%. As our data center is now alive, we will be focusing on migrating clients and market and join their liquidity hubs. Co-location revenues begin to accelerate and reached our annualized level for Q2 2011.
Slide 19 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. We continue to make excellent progress in lowering our cost base in real term while funding incremental investments to grow the business. As expected, Q2 expenses were about second quarter levels as we began to appreciate the new data centers. After adjusting for negative impact of a weaker dollar, after incremental data center integration spending, fixed costs were just $4 million above Q2 in an apples-to-apples basis. Third quarter operating expenses were down $7 million versus last year on a reported basis. However, after adjusting for FX and the impact of acquisitions and divestiture such as NYFIX and Hugin and new initiatives, fixed operating costs were down $26 million or 6% in the third quarter of 2009. 
On a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis, year-to-date fixed expenses were down $97 million or 8% compared to the prior year period. We continue to make good progress and our focus on efficiency and productivity improvements, and will further reduce operating expenses NYSE Euronext in the coming years.
Slide 20 provides you with some FX sensitivity for annual expense items. In March, when we provided fixed cost guidance for 2010 at $1.723 billion to $1.768 billion, we indicated that this guidance was predicated on the average FX rates for 2009 of $1.39 for the euro and $1.57 for the pound. Based on recent currency moves, we now estimate full year 2010 currency rates of around $1.34 for the euro and $1.55 for the pound, from which you derived a currency adjusted full year 2010 at expense guidance range of $1.707 billion to $1.749 billion. Based on fixed cost developments through the three quarters of the year and a year-to-date spend of $1.253 million, we now expect our full year 2010 fixed expenses to come in below the low end of the currency adjusted range.
We remain committed to our 2011 objective of reducing constant dollar, constant portfolio of fixed expenses below $1.650 million. 2010 acquisition such as corporate board member, NYSE Blue and our May announcement to build two new clearinghouse in Europe are incremental to this guidance. In the third quarter, 61% of our operating expenses was denominated in dollars, 19% in euros, 20% in pounds. Our staffing level as of September 30 was 3,030 full-time positions, which is 337 positions or 10% below year end levels and include 34 staff from our recent acquisition of corporate board member.
Previously indicated, we do expect cost to rise in the fourth quarter largely due to the migration into our new data center, investments in our new European clearinghouses and launching of interest rate futures in the U.S. A weaker dollar are also increased costs, which is more than offset of the beneficial impact on European revenue. In addition to the integration and transition costs, we began to appreciate a new data centers, which it added an incremental depreciation of approximately $4 million in the third quarter of 2010 and an incremental $10 million will be a flow-through in the fourth quarter. Over time, this will be mitigated as we exit our legacy data centers.
Slide 21 details our cash and debt position as of September 30, 2010. Total debt was $2.5 billion, cash market securities totaled $0.4 billion and net debt was $2.1 billion. The $2.5 billion of debt, included $2.1 billion of long-term debt with a weighted average cost of 5.3%, the remaining $400 million short-term debt consisted of commercial paper at an average cost of approximately 0.5%. Through nine months, we have spent $244 million on capital expenditures, including $106 million related to our data centers. We expect our capital expenditures to decline significantly over the next two quarters to a more maintenance levels. We will provide more guidance for the outlook for CapEx at our Investor Day in March 2011.
We also paid a net $126 million in Section 31-B to the SEC this quarter, reflecting the usual payment of the eight months of these pass-through charges. At the end of September, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.25x, up from 1.9x at the end of June 2010 but still down from the 2.6x at the end of 2009. The increase in leverage ratio in Q3 was due to the seasonal effect of the payment of section 31 fee I referenced earlier, another cash outflows, including the second quarter payment and the weakening of the dollar at the end of the third quarter, which increased debt in dollar terms by $150 million. We expect our debt to EBITDA to move lower in fourth quarter as cash flows improve.
NYSE Euronext is currently rated A+ by S&P and AAA by Moody’s, and we are now on stable outlook with S&P. We continue to operate within our long-term target leverage levels, and we are committed to continue to invest in our growth and return excess cash flow to our shareholders. Last week, the Board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2010 which is payable on December 31. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Duncan for some closing remarks and then we'll take your questions.

Obviously, a quarter with very challenging market conditions. But I've come away from the quarter pretty optimistic and very pleased with the progress we're making in our multiyear strategy as we endeavored to create a global capital markets community. I think the decisions we've made in the past few years to acquire other businesses are now generating incremental revenue, and that's more than helping us offset the negative impacts of things that we don't control like the currency and the volume.
I also think that this was the quarter where we're beginning to see the results of our diversification efforts. As it's clear, there are business model is much better positioned than it was a few quarters ago. This revised periods like the one we're in right now. And I think as we look forward to 2011, with all of the things that Dominic and Mike had just touched on in terms of initiatives coming on the back of the data centers, we combine that with the anticipated launch of interest rate futures and the launch of New York portfolio we're beginning early in 2011, I think we're very optimistic that we've got some built-in growth drivers for next year, even if the volume environment remains where it is. I think if you ask us as a management team, we're cautiously optimistic that through 2011 will look a lot brighter. It's hard for us to imagine that people who just continue to stay out of the listed equity and derivative markets to the degree they have in the last few months.
The other thing I like about our data centers I think it is, they're very representative of how we've been able to change the culture of the company. This is a much more innovative company than it was a few years ago. It's a truly globally integrated enterprise now. And I think these data centers, which really will act as liquidity hubs for our community strategy going forward, I think will prove to be the cornerstone of that technology services growth story that we've talked so much about in the last few quarters. So all in all, thank you for listening. We think it's a very good show and given the conditions. And we are increasingly confident going into next year about our abilities to effectively meet the ever changing needs of our ever expanding customer base.
With that, that concludes our formal remarks, and we will open up the lines for Q&A. You've got Mike and Larry in Europe and you've got Dominic and you've got me here in Paris.

So we previously -- we're actually moving in a way costs that was previously in the compensation line when these individuals were employees, and now on the professional services fee. So there was some reduction in the compensation line in real terms based on our continued reduction in cost but a nice portion of that improvement, which is sustainable going forward. But it did come from a little bit of movement between the line. In terms of our incentive comp, and we haven't really discussed that into much, pretty comfortable saying in aggregate, our kind of annual bonus full salaries in the cash side is about $100 million to give you a perspective out of our compensation.

As you know, we have two hauls where we have to just filled out the infrastructure that expand into. Those will require capital investment.

And we are looking at that option as a, it cost less and also, it's far less the lead time to do that. The we look at co-lo is it's an incremental revenue. It has cost against at obviously the that we, and we think that the ROI in it is good. But it's also important to our general strategy of building the liquidity hub and telling other value-added technology services whether those are, take or plans, managed services or other services that go along with it. So it's all part of the broader technologies, strategy that Dominic and his team have embarked on.

I think it's a little early to tell exactly how much of these products find their way through trading venues or swap executions, facilities, et cetera.

Our view is not, if you build that they will come theory, we would anticipate that we would construct these in partnership with the team, liquidity providers. We would take the selling to the realized approach we've taken in some of our other projects like our MX options business and our NYSE Liffe as to derivatives business. And you can safely assume we're already having conversations along that vein.

And I would assume that the same is true on our competitors' MTF platforms as well as the regulated market. So I don't know whether the mix is a little bit different in Europe versus the U.S. I just think the market is less well developed because there are fewer routing options, and routing itself is not as well developed or is clearing interoperability.

I'm going to start on Slide 3 entitled Third Quarter 2010 Update. And I would start by saying that we're very pleased with the progress we made in the third quarter, executing against our long-term strategy. In this quarter, we made tangible progress on our goals of operating in the most meaningful capital markets, creating broader and deeper networks and delivering innovative products to our expanding client base. Our business model continues to diversify, and we are focusing on new initiatives and growth areas to deliver value for our shareholders through all sorts of business cycles.
For the quarter, we recorded EPS of $0.46 per share on net revenue of $599 million, down from $0.53 on $620 million in net revenue in the prior year period. The strengthening of the dollar year-over-year reduced our net revenue by $25 million and EPS by $0.03. Hopefully [ph] to dampen the negative impact of currencies was $31 million in incremental revenue from new businesses, highlighting the continuing diversification of our model, which I will touch on in more detail later.
Our technology business continued to show great growth and benefited from the addition of NYFIX and expanding customer base and improved software sales, driving increased revenue and operating margins. And the business hit several milestones with Qatar and the Tokyo Stock exchanges, as well as a large Eastern European stock exchange signing up to do business with us. The next stage in the growth trajectory for this business will be a combination of co-location revenues and follow-on technology sales from these co-locating clients.
On the cash and listing side, we are continuing to see strong demand for our listing venues in terms of transfers, new listings and secondaries. Year-to-date through September, 13 companies have transferred to the NYSE from other exchanges with a total market capitalization of over $40 billion. A total of 78 issuers have listed on NYSE Euronext markets, raising total proceeds of just over $17 billion, including nine Chinese companies that raised just under $1 billion. Important to note that this success has continued in October and even in early November where we've already had two listings from Asia two days into the month.
NYSE Euronext is also the leader year-to-date for proceeds raised through global secondaries for the total of 370 issuers, raising total proceeds of just under $150 billion, which also included the largest secondary ever done in Petrobras, which raised $25 billion of the $70 billion that they raised in the U.S. markets.
On the cash equities trading side, we are continuing to focus on stability and profitability. In the U.S., our market share in the third quarter is up across all three takes year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. In Europe, our share has remained relatively stable at 73%, SmartPool continues to show some strong growth. And we continue to believe that over the long term, we will see growth in the overall European market.
Lastly, the results in our Derivatives segment were mixed. With continued growth in our U.S. Options businesses helping to partially offset negative currency and lackluster volume trends in our European derivatives business year-over-year. The combination of lower volatility and the heightened prospect for a second round of quantitative easing has clouded the outlook for interest rates and inflation, which has reduced the need for hedging over our NYSE Liffe platform and resulted in trading volume declines compared to the elevated second quarter levels.
To close, on Slide 3, let me just touch briefly on a few selected business highlights for the quarter. I am most pleased to report that our NYPC DCO [ph] filing with the CFTC is now complete, and we entered the 90-day comment period yesterday. Additionally, we have been discussing with the SEC the necessary rule filings that will govern the cross-margining agreement between NYPC and DTCC indiscernible] division, and we expect to formally submit that filing later this week and get the clock ticking on that comment period as well. Pending these regulatory approvals, we anticipate the launch of NYPC and the simultaneous launch of U.S. Treasury and euro/dollar futures on our NYSE Liffe U.S. future's platform in the first quarter of 2011. The CFTC, SEC Federal Reserve have demonstrated a high degree of coordination throughout this comprehensive review process, and we are grateful to all of the agencies involved for their substantial efforts, especially in light of its challenges they all face with the Dodd-Frank rulemaking processes. We will continue to work closely with these regulators through the remaining phase of the regulatory approval process, which we expect to end sometime in February of 2011.
I'm also pleased to report that we have successfully completed on time our multiyear plan to build two state-of-the-art liquidity hubs in the U.S. and the U.K., which I will let Dominique speak to later. Within our technology business, we are seeing building momentum as we move forward with our goal of $1 billion in revenue by 2015. We delivered the UTP platform to Qatar in the third quarter, and we are beginning work on the derivatives exchange there as well. More recently, as I mentioned earlier, the Tokyo Stock exchange and a large Eastern European stock exchange have chosen NYSE technologies to build trading platforms for their respective exchanges. Our operating margin for this business crossed the 20% threshold for the first time, showing strong progress toward our goal of 25% to 30% margins.
Lastly, in the third quarter, we bolstered our listings franchise with the acquisition of Corporate Board Member, a premier provider of director education programs. As I alluded to earlier, we have a great pipeline of IPO prospects and transfer prospects from other exchanges to NYSE Euronext. 
Please swing to Slide 4. Slide 4 is a slide that you've seen before, where we outlined and highlight our 2010 priorities for our various business segments. Our objective is to leverage our global infrastructure and scale, to support our businesses and our customers businesses, and create a community premium for our shareholders over time. At the center of the company in support of our three segments is UTP, our globally integrated and scalable trading platform, an unrivaled global connectivity network in customer gateways, our focus on clearing, which will take on an even greater importance in the coming quarters and two brand-new world-class data centers.
We put the slide at every quarter to remind you of what we are working toward. And now that we are coming for the end of the year, it is really designed to show you what we have accomplished this year. I think you can put check marks next to most, if not all, of the items on the slide.
Slide 5, focusing on execution. On Slide 5, we provide you with a summary of the major initiatives that we have underway for each of our segments. In addition to these points, we also have many more new initiatives on the drawing board to ensure that we have a pipeline of new initiatives ready to come online in the quarters ahead to bolster our business model and to grow our franchise. I think most of the stuff on Slide 5 is familiar to all of you, and we'll touch on a lot what we haven't already in our remarks later in the presentation.
On Slide 6. We try to show the revenue contribution of our new businesses, which reflect the increasing diversification of our model. The $31 million in incremental net revenue generated by our new businesses help dampen the impact of externalities, including foreign exchange and lower capture at volumes in selected markets. This incremental revenue came from a variety of sources including: NYFIX, which is annuity like due to the nature of the revenue model for that business and the stickiness of the channels; the re-insourcing of clearing and verticalization of our NYSE Liffe business in Europe, which occurred in late July last year; technology services revenue from Qatar; and lastly, a small amount of incremental revenue from Corporate Board Member in the quarter.
In the current quarter where we face significant headwinds, including foreign exchange, neutral to declining volumes and capture across selected markets, we were still able to record a solid $0.46 in earnings on $599 million of revenue. This compares to, just for note, $0.43 in the EPS that we earned about six quarters ago in the first quarter of 2009 on basically the same amount of revenue slightly higher, $605 million. Now why do we mention that, because it’s sort of a random comparison? The reason I felt that was interesting is here we are at six quarters later with the currency against us on a comparative basis, U.S. volumes down 50%, our capture and our European business down 40% because of price cuts we've made in response to competition in the last two years yet our earnings are higher on a similar revenue base. Hopefully, that begins to tell you that we're well on the way on this journey to transform the company and be a much more diversified company who is much less reliant on volumes in its core businesses.
Turning to Slide 7. We have a significant number of regulatory and legislative initiatives, both in the U.S. and Europe. I'll take care of the U.S. side and then turn it over to Dominique for the European side. In the U.S., we have intensified our regulatory advocacy in numerous ways, speaking not only on our own behalf, but for investors, issuers and the markets more broadly. For instance, we've been an active participant in CFTC and SEC rule- makings to implement the Dodd-Frank act. We participated in agency roundtables on derivatives regulation, met weekly with agency staff and commissioners on both derivatives and cash market issues, and build coalitions with industry participants wherever possible.
We have also spent countless hours with the SEC and CFTC staff as they produced a very thoughtful and thorough analysis of the May 6 market turmoil. And in speeches, meetings and commentary, we continue to be a strong advocate for needed market structure reforms, including increased transparency, enhanced market surveillance and the banning of flash orders. We've also increased our advocacy on macroeconomic issues like job creation and economic growth by providing our experience and that of our thousands of listed companies to officials at the White House, in the Treasury Department and on Capitol Hill.
Finally, before I turn it over to Dominique, we wanted to make sure we address the ARCAbook issue, which came up again last week. If people want to get into this more in Q&A, we can. Larry and I are prepared to answer any questions about that. But let me just give you a quick summary. This is referencing the rule filing that was approved by the SEC in 2008. We began charging these fees for market data in early 2009. Remember that in the Dodd-Frank act, these market data filings are all effective upon filing and then they can be suspended by the SEC within 60 days. In this case, in the case of many other filings recently by our competitors, so far none of these have been suspended. This one has been appealed. The court who approved the appeal did say we have to improve the competitiveness [ph] and some of the economic support for the market data filing, and we're working on that actively. And again, we can get into that in Q&A if anybody would like to. But remember that under the new regime, you will see more market data filings like this, they are effective on filing. And so far, none of them has been suspended.
So at this point, sticking on Slide 7. I will turn the call over to Dominique, and he will handle the European fee [ph] for the regulatory landscape and then update you on a number of other issues ranging from our data center launches to some additional insights on our technology services business. Thanks. Dominic?"

And turning to Europe, regulators has been also very busy dealing with issues related to the market structure and financial regulation. European policy makers are working on this comprehensive regional [indiscernible] with the European Commission due to issue of [indiscernible] in November. And this will culminate in [indiscernible] in second quarter of 2011. And after part of this review, the EU will be working closely with U.S. counterparts to develop a common approach to the regulation of [indiscernible]. 
Derivative [indiscernible] is also a key issue in Europe as it is in the U.S. The European Commission issued a proposed draft of [indiscernible], which sent to our European market [indiscernible] regulation and also on [indiscernible] legislation on September 15 and if we'll [indiscernible] European Parliament [ph] and liquid process is expected to last through most of 2011.
The European Commission has introduced the concept of financial activities tax, and a financial transactions tax SEC [ph] Europe. This was done in parallel with the working document on financial sector expectations. As was stated previously, we are not in favor of any form of transaction tax, and we will advocate this view on behalf of our shareholders and recent [ph] clients.
Lastly on Europe, we expect to see some proposed legislation on several other items in fourth quarter of 2010 and first quarter of 2011, like corporate governance, market abuse, transparency requirements for small capital.
Turning to Slide 8. I'm pleased to report to you that we have now officially launched our EU liquidity hub center. And on this slide, we have provided an updated timeline on where we go from here. We have successfully completed on time the build out of the two new data centers and, having spent many years, as you know, in the technology sector, I can confirm that this is a tremendous completion [ph]. As I look back at least three [ph] of the facilities [ph} phase, they are which of being demonstrate sort migration. We are moving entire trading market. [ph}
And we are able to get not only for the dedication and hard work of our global technology staff, and I thank them for their effort. It's another clear demonstration that we can execute against putting [ph].
So let me sort of summarize where we are on Slide 8. In the U.S., our NYSE market completed its migration to [indiscernible] on August 25. In Europe, our cash market completed the migration successfully as it has been [ph] on September 27. And NYSE Liffe derivative market migrated yesterday on November 1, so that's all done. 
On the co-location business, in the U.S., about 97% of the costs [ph] is sold-out. And in Europe, the rollout of the [ph]. And then the co-location revenues was viewed as we enter 2011, and we should keep full stride with two [ph] quarter 2011 billings.
The next step in the migration process, as you can see, is for NYSE Arca market to migrate to Mahwah in the U.S. And that's scheduled for the end of the first quarter 2011. And as we complete the migration process, we will begin retiring obsolete data centers we need to protect [ph] at 55 Water Street and our regional data center. Europe as well, where we have also multiple data centers, we will begin the rationalization process and ensure that we have adequate data [ph] capabilities in both U.S. and in Europe.
Let's move to Slide 9. We give you an example that in [ph] technologies that closed or are closing. So thanks to strong investment and subsequent acquisition, we now own a wide range of technology assets, including the main one, our state of the art Mahwah and Basildon data centers. Our best of class universal trading platform [ph]. Our world class [indiscernible] and leading communication best of breed market-based space and better [indiscernible] data process. And thanks to the investors [ph], we are building market [indiscernible] provide our clients with a consolidated product and services offering. Our strategic [ph] is reported [ph] and concerned by both market trends and the recent state of the art [ph] we're seeing from prospects seem to absorb that investiture [ph]. And Slide 9 as they show all of them. We fully integrate the value of existing asset, transaction and divestiture  [ph] and data services when building service platforms [ph]either through partnerships with other or a solution provider  to clients. 
On the top left side of the chart, global Tier 1, we will provide a full solution from continuing [ph ]and management, and shows that NYSE Technology is now steadily as a Tier 1 service provider.
Must be in order on the left side, the U.S. [indiscernible] side. We provide the fully consolidated [indiscernible] platform, and that is an example of the services that would make sense. We already talked in the middle of the chart about our partnership with the Qatar exchange, Tokyo Stock Exchange and the large Eastern European stock exchange that were just qualitative entries [ph] that's welcome. And they should effectively our platform, again, geographic and worldwide [ph]. We have mostly the recent partnership that have quickly [indiscernible] full breadth of solution.
Bottom of the chart, and most on market data and administration services [ph], we provide to this global bank that I believe into a very wide range [ph] of market data programs where we are confirming [indiscernible] requirements  in that matter from a data platform, to fully manage across asset class integrations [ph]. And the development of the strategic deals, we guide as we said recently our world [ph]to ensure that we achieved our regional objective with the same time hitting our margin target of between 25% and 30%. 
With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Mike for a review of the financial results."

Total revenues for the quarter were $1.1 billion, which was down 9% year-over-year and 16% versus the second quarter. Net income and diluted EPS are up year-over-year, but down compared to the second quarter of 2010, reflecting the slower trading volume environment we experienced in the third quarter.
This quarter, we reported a $25 million charge for merger expenses and exit costs, more than half related to exit costs for our data centers. Last year's merger expenses and exit costs of $8 million was principally for severance. As we have stated previously, the data center related exit costs for legacy systems and platforms is expected to reduce dramatically after this year.
This quarter, we also recorded a deferred tax benefit of $21 million related to the reduction of the U.K. tax rates from 28% to 27%. A drop from 28% to 27% is the first step by U.K. tax authorities to lower the U.K. tax rate to 24% in the coming years. In the prior-year quarter, we reported a $4 million in net pretax gain from asset disposals primarily related to the sale of our stake in BM&F Bovespa.
Now a review of our financial results from this point forward, we'll exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs. Deferred tax benefits just referenced as well as gains from this global activity.
Slide 11 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the third quarter. Including merger expenses, exit costs, deferred tax benefits and asset sales, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.46, down 13% versus the prior year of $0.53. Year-to-date, EPS of $1.64 is up 12%. These results include a positive $0.02 EPS impact for a reduction of our effective tax rate from 27.5% to 26.5% as a result of the adoption of favorable tax laws in the Netherlands. We expect to have an effective tax rate of 26.5% for the remainder of 2010.
Our focus for 2010 is revenue growth and margin expansion. While the third quarter was challenging, we are pleased with our progress on both front thus far. On a constant dollar basis, year-to-date revenues were up 5% and margins have improved from 32% to 34%. These results were negatively impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar. Operating income was $180 million, down 8% compared to the third quarter of 2009.
At the time of the launch, we stopped capitalizing interest expense related to the build out of our data center in the U.S. which increased our net interest expense up for the quarter by $1 million to $26 million. In the fourth quarter, we will no longer capitalize interest expense for our U.K. data center, this will increase our net interest expense by an incremental $3 million. The average weighted diluted share count increased slightly in the current quarter driven by the vesting of [indiscernible] press [ph]. We expect the share count to remain at 262 million shares for the remainder of the year.
Though largely fixed-expense based, we have significant operating leverage on incremental revenue and volume growth. Leverage however cuts both ways and, that's what we experienced in the third quarter.
Slide 12 provides our segment results on a currency neutral basis. U.S. dollar weakened this quarter versus prior year for both the euro and the British pound. For the third quarter, 48% of our net revenue was denominated in either euros or pounds. Currency impact was unfavorable $25 million versus prior year and a favorable $7 million versus the prior quarter. On a currency neutral basis, third quarter net revenues were flat and operating income declined 2% versus the third quarter of 2009. Operationally, revenues for our derivative segment were flat and the technology segment grew 26% versus Q3 prior year. Cash trading and listings revenue declined by 6%, driven with the lower U.S. volumes and lower revenue capture in Europe.
On Slide 13, we show our 2010 year-to-date net revenue split by business activity and segments in comparison to the prior-year period. The company continues to benefit from a diversified revenue base, which has helped dampen the impact of FX and volumes in the current quarter. 49% of our net revenues were generated by transactions in clearing fees for the first nine months of 2010. This is in line with prior year, although this year's results include the benefit of Liffe Clearing, which was acquired in July of last year. We saw the contribution in technology service that show the most meaningful increase with specific gains stemming from NYFIX, both on our safety [indiscernible] network and recent software and infrastructure sales.
Turning to our segments. Cash Trading and Listings comprised 49% of our net revenue. Year-to-date, the derivative segment remains our fastest-growing segment contributing 34% of our net revenues, up from 29% in 2009, followed by the technology segment, which grew from 14% to 17% of revenue. Again, this is consistent with our revenue guidance, and where we have invested in new initiatives. Though not showing on the chart, 52% of our Q3 net revenues originated in the U.S. and 48% in Europe.
Slides 14 and 15 detailed the financial performance of our derivative segment. I'm not going to go through these slides in great detail, but simply touch upon a few points. Net revenues were $188 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $10 million or 5% versus Q3 prior year and down $38 million or 17% from the very strong second quarter 2010. Adjusting for foreign currency impact, net revenue decreased 2% versus the prior year third quarter. Decrease versus the second quarter of 2010 was driven by volume declines in the overall market, NYC Liffe and U.S. Options from elevated second quarter levels. 
The average net rate per contract for NYSE Liffe derivatives excluding declear [ph] was $0.67 per contract in the third quarter compared to $0.75 in the third quarter of 2009 and $0.64 in the second quarter of 2010. The decline versus the third quarter of last year was due to a stronger dollar as well as business mix in the third quarter of 2009, which resulted in lower liquidity payment during that period.
The increase versus the second quarter was principally due to the weakening of the dollar. Rate per contract in the U.S Options was $0.17 per contract in the third quarter. This is down versus the prior year but up slightly quarter-over-quarter. The reason for the decrease year-over-year was largely attribute to an increase in Penny Pilot issues created on NYC Arca and minor pricing changes, which were offset by market share gains. Our Global Derivatives segment margins declined to 49% in Q3 from 53% in the prior-year quarter. Derivatives accounted for 43% of our operating income.
Similarly, Slides 16 and 17 show you the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash Trading and Listings net revenue was $298 million in the third quarter of 2010, down versus both the prior-year period and sequentially. Net transaction revenues, adjusting for foreign currency, were down 6% versus Q3 2009. This was attributed by pricing reductions in European cash in 2009 and lower overall market volumes in U.S. cash. Partially offset by a 9% increase in average U.S. net capture and higher market share across all venues for U.S. cash trading.
Market share on our four European markets was down slightly to 73% in the third quarter from the second quarter levels. Revenue capture for U.S. cash trended up to $0.31 per 100 shares in line with expectations and recent trends. Revenue capture for European cash was $0.66 per transaction versus $0.90 in the prior year. The decline in European pricing was attributed to the stronger dollar, prior year price reductions and a less favorable mix.
As previously announced, we have redesigned and simplify the pricing for our European cash trading offerings, effective November 1. We eliminate the distinction between agency and principal trading, and will implement other changes that more aligned us with other European regulated exchanges. Operating margin for Cash Trading and Listings segment was 34% in the third quarter, consistent with the third quarter of 2009.
Slide 18 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information Services and Technology Solutions net revenue was $113 million in the third quarter, an increase of $19 million or 20% from Q3 prior year. On a currency neutral basis, revenues were higher by 26%. The increase was primarily driven by NYFIX acquisition, growth in safety clients, delivering of UTP to Qatar and some large software and infrastructure sales. Revenues were $6 million or 6% higher than Q2.
Operating income was $24 million, a 100% increase to prior and a 20% increase from the second quarter of 2010. Operating margin was 21% compared to 13% in the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30%. As our data center is now alive, we will be focusing on migrating clients and market into our new liquidity hubs. Co-location revenues begin to accelerate and reached our annualized level for Q2 2011.
Slide 19 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. We continue to make excellent progress in lowering our cost base in real term while funding incremental investments to grow the business. As expected, Q3 expenses were above second quarter levels as we began to depreciate the new data centers. After adjusting for negative impact of a weaker dollar, after incremental data center integration spending, fixed costs were just $4 million above Q2 on an apples-to-apples basis. Third quarter operating expenses were down $7 million versus last year on a reported basis. However, after adjusting for FX and the impact of acquisitions and divestiture such as NYFIX and [indiscernible] and new initiatives, fixed operating costs were down $26 million or 6% in the third quarter of 2009. 
On a constant dollar constant portfolio basis, year-to-date fixed expenses were down $97 million or 8% compared to the prior year period. We continue to make good progress and our focus on efficiency and productivity improvements that will further reduce operating expenses NYSE Euronext in the coming years.
Slide 20 provides you with some FX sensitivity for annual expense items. In March, when we provided fixed cost guidance for 2010 at $1.723 billion to $1.768 billion, we indicated that this guidance was predicated on the average FX rates for 2009 of $1.39 for the euro and $1.57 for the pound. Based on recent currency moves, we now estimate full year 2010 currency rates of around $1.34 for the euro and $1.55 for the pound, from which you derive a currency adjusted full-year 2010 at [ph] expense guidance range of $1.707 billion to $1.749 billion. Based on fixed-cost developments through three quarters of the year and a year-to-date spend of $1.253  [ph] million, we now expect our full year 2010 fixed expenses to come in below the low end of the currency adjusted range.
We remain committed to our 2011 objective of reducing constant dollar, constant portfolio of fixed expenses below $1.650 million. 2010 acquisition such as Corporate Board Member, NYC blue [ph] and our May announcement to build two new clearinghouses in Europe are incremental to this guidance. In the third quarter, 61% of our operating expenses was denominated in dollars, 19% in euros, 20% in pounds. Our staffing level as of September 30 was 3,030 full-time positions, which is 337 positions or 10% below year-end levels and include 34 staff from our recent acquisition of Corporate Board Member.
AS previously indicated, we do expect costs to rise in the fourth quarter largely due to the migration into our new data center, investments in our new European clearinghouses and launching of interest rate futures in the U.S. A weaker dollar are also increased costs, which is more than offset of the beneficial impact on European revenue. In addition to the integration and transition costs, we began to depreciate the new data centers, which added an incremental depreciation of approximately $4 million in the third quarter of 2010 and an incremental $10 million will be a flow-through in the fourth quarter. Over time, this will be mitigated as we exit our legacy data centers.
Slide 21 details our cash and debt position as of September 30, 2010. Total debt was $2.5 billion, cash and marketable securities totaled $0.4 billion and net debt was $2.1 billion. The $2.5 billion of debt, included $2.1 billion of long-term debt with a weighted average cost of 5.3%, the remaining $400 million short-term debt consisted of commercial paper at an average cost of approximately 0.5%. Through nine months, we have spent $244 million on capital expenditures, including $106 million related to our data centers. We expect our capital expenditures to decline significantly over the next two quarters to more maintenance levels. We will provide more guidance for the outlook for CapEx at our Investor Day in March 2011.
We also paid a net $126 million in Section 31 fees to the SEC this quarter, reflecting the usual payment of the eight months of these pass-through charges. At the end of September, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.25x, up from 1.9x at the end of June 2010 but still down from the 2.6x at the end of 2009. The increase in leverage ratio in Q3 was due to the seasonal effect of the payment of Section 31 fees I referenced earlier, and other cash outflows, including the second quarter Qatar payment and the weakening of the dollar at the end of the third quarter, which increased debt in dollar terms by $150 million. We expect our debt to EBITDA to move lower in fourth quarter as cash flows improve.
NYSE Euronext is currently rated A+ by S&P and A3 by Moody’s, and we are now on stable outlook with S&P. We continue to operate within our long-term target leverage levels, and we are committed to continue to invest in our growth and return excess cash flow to our shareholders. Last week, the board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2010 which is payable on December 31. 
With that, let me turn the call back to Duncan for some closing remarks and then we'll take your questions."

Obviously, a quarter with very challenging market conditions. But I come away from the quarter pretty optimistic and very pleased with the progress we're making in our multi-year strategy as we endeavored to create a global capital markets community. I think the decisions we've made in the past few years to acquire other businesses are now generating incremental revenue, and that's more than helping us offset the negative impacts of things that we don't control like the currency and the volume.
I also think that this was the quarter where we're beginning to see the results of our diversification efforts. As it's clear, there our business model is much better positioned than it was a few quarters ago. This revised period like the one we're in right now. And I think as we look forward to 2011, with all of the things that Dominic and Mike had just touched on in terms of initiatives coming on the back of the data centers, we combine that with the anticipated launch of interest rate futures and the launch of New York Portfolio Clearing in 2011, I think we're very optimistic that we've got some built-in growth drivers for next year, even if the volume environment remains where it is. I think if you ask us as a management team, we're cautiously optimistic that through 2011 will look a lot brighter. It's hard for us to imagine that people who just continue to stay out of the listed equity and derivative markets to the degree they have in the last few months.
The other thing I like about our data centers I think it is, they're very representative of how we've been able to change the culture of the company. This is a much more innovative company than it was a few years ago. It's a truly globally integrated enterprise now. And I think these data centers, which really will act as liquidity hubs for our community strategy going forward, I think will prove to be the cornerstone of that technology services growth story that we've talked so much about in the last few quarters. So all in all, thank you for listening. We think it's a very good showing, given the conditions. And we are increasingly confident going into next year about our abilities to effectively meet the ever changing needs of our ever expanding customer base.
With that, that concludes our formal remarks, and we will open up the lines for Q&A. You've got Mike and Larry in New York and you've got Dominic and you've got me here in Paris."

From a rainy Paris, thanks for joining today's call, we appreciate it. I'm going to start on Slide 3 entitled Third Quarter 2010 Update. And I would start by saying that we're very pleased with the progress we",2023," Thanks, Steven, and good morning, everybody. From a rainy Paris, thanks for joining today's call, we appreciate it. I'm going to start on Slide 3 entitled Third Quarter 2010 Update. And I would start by saying that we're very pleased with the progress we made in the third quarter, executing against our long-term strategy. In this quarter, we made tangible progress on our goals of operating the most meaningful capital markets, creating broader and deeper networks and delivering innovative products to our expanding client base. Our business model continues to diversify, and we are focusing on new initiatives and growth area to deliver value for our shareholders through all sorts of business cycles.
 For the quarter, we recorded EPS of $0.46 per share on net revenue of $599 million, down from $0.53 on $620 million in net revenue in the prior year period. The strengthening of the dollar year-over-year reduced our net revenue by $25 million and EPS by $0.03. Helping to dampen the negative impact of currencies was $31 million in incremental revenue from new businesses, highlighting the continuing diversification of our model, which I will touch on in more detail later.
 Our technology business continue to show great growth and benefited from the addition of NYFIX and expanding customer base and improved software sales, driving increased revenue and operating margins. And the business hit several milestones with Qatar and the Tokyo Stock exchanges, as well as in large Eastern European stock exchange signing up to do business with us. The next stage in the growth trajectory for this business will be a combination of co-location revenues and follow-on technology sales from these co-locating clients.
 On the cash and listing side, we are continuing to see strong demand for our listing venues in terms of transfers, new listings and secondaries. Year-to-date through September, 13 companies have transferred to the NYSE from other exchanges with a total market capitalization of over $40 billion. A total of 78 issuers have listed on NYSE Euronext markets, raising total proceeds of just over $17 billion, including nine Chinese companies that raised to just under $1 billion. Important to note that this success has continued in October and even in early November where we've already had two listings from Asia two days in for the month.
 NYSE Euronext is also the leader year-to-date for proceeds raised through global secondaries for the total of 370 issuers, raising total proceeds of just under $150 billion, which also included the largest secondary ever done in Petrobras, which raised 25 of the $70 billion that they raised in the U.S. markets.
 On the cash equities trading side, we are continuing to focus on stability and profitability. In the U.S., our market share in the third quarter is up across all three takes year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. In Europe, our share has remained relatively stable at 73%, SmartPool continues to show some strong growth. And we continue to believe that over the long-term, we will see growth in the overall European market.
 Lastly, the results in our Derivatives segment were mixed. With continued growth in our U.S. Options businesses helping to partially offset negative currency and lackluster volume trends in our European derivatives business year-over-year. The combination of lower volatility and the heightened prospects for a second round of quantitative easing has clouded the outlook for interest rates and inflation, which has reduced a need for hedging over our NYSE Liffe platform and resulted in trading volume declines compared to the elevated second quarter levels.
 To close on Slide 3, let me just touch briefly on a few selected business highlights for the quarter. I am most pleased to report that our NYPC DCO filing with the CFTC is now complete, and we entered the 90-day comment period yesterday. Additionally, we have been discussing with the SEC the necessary rule of filings that will govern across the cross margining agreement between NYPC and DTCC's FICC division, and we expect to formally submit that filing later this week and get the clock ticking on that comment period as well. Pending these regulatory approvals, we anticipate the launch of NYPC and the simultaneous launch of U.S. Treasury and euro/dollar futures on our NYSE Liffe U.S. future's platform in the first quarter of 2011. The CFTC, SEC, and Federal Reserve have demonstrated a high degree of coordination throughout this comprehensive review process, and we are grateful to all of the agencies involved for their substantial efforts, especially in light of its challenges they all face with the Dodd-Frank rule making processes. We will continue to work closely with these regulators through the remaining phase of the regulatory approval process, which we expect to end sometime in February of 2011.
 I'm also pleased to report that we have successfully completed on time our multiyear plan to build two state-of-the-art liquidity hubs in the U.S. and the U.K., which I will let Dominique speak to later. Within our technology business, we are seeing building momentum as we move forward with our goal of $1 billion in revenue by 2015. We delivered the UTP platform to cutter in the third quarter, and we are beginning work on the derivatives exchange there as well. More recently, as I mentioned earlier, the Tokyo Stock exchange and a large Eastern European stock exchange have chosen NYSE technologies to build trading platforms for their respective exchanges. Our operating margin for this business crossed the 20% threshold for the first time, showing strong progress toward our goal of 25% to 30% margins.
 Lastly in the third quarter, we boasted our listings franchise with the acquisition of corporate Board member, a premier provider of director education programs. As I alluded to earlier, we have a great pipeline of IPO prospects and transfer prospects from other exchanges to NYSE Euronext.
 Please swing to Slide 4. Slide 4 is a slide that you've seen before, where we outlined and highlight our 2010 priorities for our various business segments. Our objective is to leverage our global infrastructure and scale, to support our businesses and our customers businesses, and create a community premium for our shareholders over time. At the center of the company in support of our three segments is UTP, our globally integrated and scalable trading platform. And on arrival of global connectivity network and customer gateways, our focus on clearing, which will take on an even greater importance in the coming quarters and two brand-new world-class data centers.
 We put the slide at every quarter to remind you of what we are working toward. And now that we are coming for the end of the year, it is really designed to show you what we have accomplished this year. I think you can put check marks next to the most, if not all, of the items on the slide.
 Slide 5, focusing on execution. On Slide 5, we provide you with a summary of the major initiatives that we have underway for each of our segments. In addition to these points, we also have many more new initiatives on the drawing board to ensure that we have a pipeline of new initiatives ready to come online in the quarters ahead to bolster our business model and to grow our franchise. I think most of the stuff on Slide 5 is familiar to all of you, and we'll touch on a lot what we haven't already in our remarks later in the presentation.
 On Slide 6. We try to show the revenue contribution of our new businesses, which reflect the increasing diversification of our model. The $31 million in incremental net revenue generated by our new businesses help dampen the impact of externalities, including foreign exchange and lower capture at volumes in selected markets. This incremental revenue came from a variety of sources; including NYFIX, which is annuity like due to the nature of the revenue model for that business and the stickiness of the channels; the reinsourcing of clearing and verticalization of our NYSE Liffe business in Europe, which occurred in late July last year; technology services revenue from Cutter [ph]; and lastly a small amount of incremental revenue from corporate Board member in the quarter.
 In the current quarter where we face significant headwinds, including foreign exchange, neutral to declining volumes and capture across selected markets, we were still able to record a solid $0.46 in earnings on $599 million of revenue. This compares to just for note $0.43 in the EPS that we earned about six quarters ago in the first quarter of 2009 on basically the same amount of revenue slightly higher of $605 million. Now why do we mention that? Because it sort of a random comparison. The reason I felt that was interesting is here we are at six quarters later with the currency against us on a comparative basis, U.S. volumes down 50%, our capture and our European business down 40% because of price cuts we've made in response to competition in the last two years yet our earnings are higher on a similar revenue base. Hopefully, that begins to tell you that we're well on the way on this journey to transform the company and be a much more diversified company who is much less reliant on volumes in its core businesses.
 Turning to Slide 7. We have a significant number of regulatory and legislative initiatives, both in the U.S. and Europe. I'll take care of the U.S. side and then turn it over to Dominique for the European side. In the U.S., we have intensified our regulatory advocacy in numerous ways, speaking not only on our own behalf but for investors, issuers and the markets more broadly. For instance, we've been an active participant in CFTC and SEC rule makings to implement the Dodd-Frank act. We participated in Asia and see roundtables on derivatives regulation, met weekly with agency staff and commissioners on both derivatives and cash market issues, and build coalitions with industry participants wherever possible.
 We have also spent countless hours with the SEC and CFTC staff as they produced a very thoughtful and thorough analysis of May 6 market turmoil. And in speeches, meetings and commentary, we continue to be a strong advocate for needed market structure reforms, including increased transparency, enhanced market surveillance and the banning of flash orders. We've also increased our advocacy on macroeconomic issues like job creation and economic growth by providing our experience and that of our thousands of listed companies to officials at the White House, in the Treasury Department and on Capitol Hill.
 Finally, before I turn it over to Dominique, we wanted to make sure we address the Arca book issue, which came up again last week. If people want to get into this more in Q&A, we can. Larry and I are prepared to answer any questions about that. But let me just give you a quick summary. This is referencing the rule filing that was approved by the SEC in 2008. We began charging these fees for market data in early 2009. Remember that in the Dodd-Frank act, this market data filings are all effective upon filing and then they can be suspended by the SEC within 60 days. In this case, in the case of many other filings recently by our competitors, so far none of these have been suspended. This one has been appeal. The court who approved the appeal did say we have to improve the competitiveness and some of the economic support for the market data filing, and we're working on that actively. And again, we can get into that in Q&A if anybody would like to. But remember that under the new regime, you will see more market data filings like this, they are effective on filing. And so far, none of them has been suspended.
 So at this point, speaking on Slide 7. I will turn the call over to Dominique, and he will handle the European fee for the regulatory landscape and then update you on a number of other issues ranging from our data center launches to some additional insights on our technology services business. Thanks. Dominic?

And turning to Europe, regulators have been also very busy dealing with issues related to the markets appear on some of the regulations. European policy makers are working on this comprehensive review process, and we are grateful to all the agencies with the European Commission due to issue of decompensation in November. And this terminate in proposals in the second quarter of 2011. And after part of this review, the EU will be working closely with U.S. counterparts to develop a common approach to the regulation to some of the book rates trading[ph].
 Derivatives regulation is also a key issue in Europe as it is in the U.S. The European commission issued a proposed draft of EMIR, which stands for European Market Infrastructure Regulation and also on [indiscernible] legislation on September 15 and this legislation is currently going to the European government and the legislative process is expected to last through most of 2011.
 The European Commission has introduced the concept of financial activities tax, or FAT, and the financial transition of FAT SEC Europe. This was done in parallel with the working document on financial sector taxations. As we have stated previously, we are not in favor in any form of transaction FAT, and we will advocate this view on behalf of our shareholders and listed clients.
 Lastly on Europe, we expect to see some proposed legislation on several other items in fourth quarter of 2010 and first quarter of 2011, like corporate governance, market abuse, transparency requirements for small capitals.
 Turning to Slide 8. I'm pleased to report to you that we are now officially launched our EU liquidity center. And on this slide, we have provided an updated timeline on where we go from here. We have successfully completed on time the build out of the two new data centers and had to spend many years as you know in the facility sector, I can confirm that this is a tremendous completion. As I look back at least three of the facilities phase, they are which of being demonstrate sort migration. We are moving entire trading market.
 And we are able to get not only for the dedication and hardwork of our global technology staff, and I thank them for their effort. It's another clear demonstration that we can execute against putting.
 So let me sort of summarize where we are on Slide 8. In the U.S., our NYSE market completed its migration to Mahwah on August 25. The Europe, our cash market completed the migration successfully as it has been on September 27. And NYSE Liffe derivative market migrated yesterday on November 1, so that's all done.
 On the co-location business, in the U.S., about 97% of the costs we've sold-out. And in Europe, the rollout of the. And then the co-location revenues was viewed as we enter 2011, and we should keep full slide with two quarter 2011 billings.
 The next step is the migration is for NYSE open market to migrate from Mahwah in the U.S. And that's the outlook is and what I see markets to migrate in Mahwah in the U.S., and that's the end of the first quarter 2011. And as we complete the integration progress, we will begin to retiring obsolete data centers we need to protect and our regional data center. Europe as well, where we have also look upon data center we will begin the rationalization process and ensure that we have adequate data capabilities in both U.S. and in Europe.
 Let's move to Slide 9. We give you an example that in technologies that closed or are closing. So thanks to strong investment and subsequent acquisition, we now own a wide range of technology assets, including the main one, our state of the art Mahwah in Washington data center. Our best of class universal trading platform. Our world class safety network and leading communication best of breed market-based space and any of these products . And thanks with the investors, we are building market [indiscernible] provide our clients with a consolidated produce and productivity. Our strategic is reported and concerned by both market trends and the recent state of the art we're seeing from prospects seem to absorb that investiture. And Slide 9 as they show all of them. We fully integrate the value of existing asset, transaction and divestiture and data services when building service platforms either through partnerships with other or a solution provider  to clients..
 On the top left side of the chart, global Tier 1, we will provide a full solution from continuing and management, and shows that NYSE Technology is now steadily as a Tier 1 service provider.
 Must be in order on the left side, the U.S. [indiscernible] side. We provide the fully consolidated managed trading platform, and that is an example of the services that would make sense. We already talked in the middle of the chart about our partnership with the Qatar exchange, Tokyo exchange and the large Eastern European stock exchange that were just qualitative entries that's welcome. And they should effectively our platform, again, geographic and worldwide. We have mostly the recent partnership that have quickly [indiscernible] full breadth of solution.
 Bottom of the chart, and most on market data and administration services, we provide to this global bank that I believe into a very wide range of market data programs where we are confirming some specific requirements  in that matter from a data platform, to fully manage across asset class integrations. And the development of the strategic deals, we guide as we said recently our world to ensure that we achieved our regional objective with the same time hitting our margin target of between 25% and 30%.
 With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Mike for a review of the financial results.

Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the third quarter. Total revenues for the quarter were $1.1 billion, which was down 9% year-over-year and 16% versus the second quarter. Net income and diluted EPS are up",2376," Thanks, Dominique, and good morning. Slide 10 provides comparative GAAP results for the third quarter. Total revenues for the quarter were $1.1 billion, which was down 9% year-over-year and 16% versus the second quarter. Net income and diluted EPS are up year-over-year, but down compared to the second quarter of 2010, reflecting the slower trading volume environment we experienced in the third quarter.
 This quarter, we reported a $25 million charge for merger expenses and exit costs, more than half related to exit costs for our data centers. Last year's merger expenses and exit cost of $8 million was principally for severance. As we have stated previously, the data center related exit costs for legacy systems and platforms is expected to reduce dramatically after this year.
 This quarter, we also recorded a deferred tax benefit of $21 million related to the reduction of the U.K. tax rates from 28% to 27%. A drop from 28% to 27% is the first step by U.K. tax authorities to lower the U.K. tax rate to 24% in the coming years. In the prior-year quarter, we reported a $4 million in net pretax gain from asset disposals primarily related to the sale of our stake in BM&F Bovespa.
 My review of our financial results from this point forward, we'll exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs. Deferred tax benefits just referenced as well as gains from this global activity.
 Slide 11 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the third quarter. Including merger expenses, exit costs, deferred tax benefits and asset sales, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.46, down 13% versus the prior year of $0.53. Year-to-date, EPS of $1.64 is up 12%. These results include a positive $0.02 EPS impact for a reduction of our effective tax rate from 27.5% to 26.5% as a result of the adoption of favorable tax loss in the Netherlands. We expect to have an effective tax rate of 26.5% for the remainder of 2010.
 Our focus for 2010 is revenue growth and margin expansion. While the third quarter was challenging, we are pleased with our progress on both front thus far. On a constant dollar basis, year-to-date revenues were up 5% and margins have improved from 32% to 34%. These results were negatively impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar. Operating income was $180 million, down 8% compared to the third quarter of 2009.
 At the time of the launch, we stopped capitalizing interest expense related to the build out of our data center in the U.S. has increased our net interest expense up for the quarter by $1 million to $26 million. In the fourth quarter, we will no longer capitalize interest expense for our U.K. data center, this will increase our net interest expense by an incremental $3 million. The average weighted diluted sharecount increased slightly in the current quarter driven by the vesting of LTIP grants. We expect the share count to remain at 262 million shares for the remainder of the year.
 With a largely fixed expense base, we have significant operating leverage on incremental revenue and volume growth. Leverage however cuts both ways and, that's what we experienced in the third quarter.
 Slide 12 provides our segment results on a currency neutral basis. U.S. dollar weakened this quarter versus prior year for both the euro and the British pound. For the third quarter, 48% of our net revenue was denominated in either euros or pounds. Currency impact was unfavorable $25 million versus prior year and a favorable $7 million versus the prior quarter. On a currency neutral basis, third quarter net revenues were flat and operating income declined 2% versus the third quarter of 2009. Operationally, revenues for our derivative segment was flat and the technology segment grew 26% versus Q3 prior year. Cash trading and listings revenue declined by 6%, driven with the lower U.S. volumes and lower revenue capture in Europe.
 On Slide 13. We show our 2010 year-to-date net revenue split by business activity and segments in comparison to the prior-year period. The company continues to benefit from a diversified revenue base, which has helped dampen the impact of FX and volumes in the current quarter. 49% of our net revenues were generated by transactions in clearing fees for the first nine months of 2010. This is in line with prior year, although this year's results include the benefit of Liffe Clearing, which was acquired in July of last year. We saw the contribution in technology service that show the most meaningful increase with specific gains stemming from NYFIX, growth in our SFTI Europe network and recent software and infrastructure sales.
 Turning to our segments. Cash trading and listings comprised 49% of our net revenue. Year-to-date, the derivative segment remains our fastest-growing segment contributing 34% of our net revenues, up from 29% in 2009, followed by the technology segment, which grew from 14% to 17% of revenue. Again, this is consistent with our revenue guidance, and where we have invested in new initiatives. Though not showing on the chart, 52% of our Q3 net revenues originated in the U.S. and 48% in  Europe.
 Slide 14 and 15 detailed the financial performance of our derivative segment. I'm not going to go through these slides in great detail, but simply touch upon a few points. Net revenues were $188 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $10 million or 5% versus Q3 prior year and down $38 million or 17% from the very strong second quarter 2010. Adjusting for foreign currency impact, net revenue decreased 2% versus the prior year third quarter. Decrease versus the second quarter of 2010 was driven by volume declines in the overall market, NYC Liffe and U.S. options from elevated second quarter levels.
 The average net rate per contract for NYSE Liffe derivatives excluding Bclear was $0.67 per contract in the third quarter compared to $0.75 in the third quarter of 2009 and $0.64 in the second quarter of 2010. The decline versus the third quarter of last year was due to a stronger dollar as well as business mix in the third quarter of 2009, which resulted in lower liquidity payment during that period.
 The increase versus the second quarter was principally due to the weakening of the dollar. Rate per contract in the U.S options was $0.17 per contract in the third quarter. This is down versus the prior year but up slightly quarter-over-quarter. The reason for the decrease year-over-year was largely attribute to an increase in Penny Pilot issues created on NYC Arca and minor pricing changes, which were offset by market share gains. Our Global Derivatives segment margins declined to 49% in Q3 from 53% in the prior-year quarter. Derivatives accounted for 43% of our operating income.
 Similarly, Slide 16 and 17 show you the financial performance for our Cash Trading and Listings segment. Cash trading and listings net revenue was $298 million in the third quarter of 2010, down versus both the prior-year period and sequentially. Net transaction revenues, adjusting for foreign currency, were down 6% versus Q3 2009. This was attributed by pricing reductions in European cash in 2009 and lower overall market volumes in U.S. cash. Partially offset by a 9% increase in average U.S. net capture and higher market share across all venues for U.S. cash trading.
 Market share on our four European markets was down slightly to 73% in the third quarter from the second quarter levels. Revenue capture for U.S. cash trended up to $0.31 per 100 shares in line with expectations and recent trends. Revenue capture for European cash was $0.66 per transaction versus $0.90 in the prior year. The decline in European pricing was attributed to the stronger dollar, prior year price reductions and a less favorable mix.
 As previously announced, we have redesigned and simplify the pricing for our European cash trading offerings, effective November 1. We eliminate the distinction between agency and principal tradings, and will implement other changes that more aligned us with other European regulated exchanges. Operating margin for Cash Trading and Listings segment was 34% in the third quarter, consistent with the third quarter of 2009.
 Slide 18 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information Services and Technology Solutions net revenue was $113 million in the third quarter, an increase of $19 million or 20% from Q3 prior year. On a currency neutral basis, revenues were higher by 26%. The increase was primarily driven by NYFIX acquisitions, growth in safety clients, delivering of UTP to cutter and some large software and infrastructure sales. Revenues were $6 million or 6% higher than Q2.
 Operating income was $24 million, a 100% increase to prior and a 20% increase from the second quarter of 2010. Operating margin was 21% compared to 13% in the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30%. As our data center is now alive, we will be focusing on migrating clients and market and join their liquidity hubs. Co-location revenues begin to accelerate and reached our annualized level for Q2 2011.
 Slide 19 provides a harmonized view of fixed operating expenses. We continue to make excellent progress in lowering our cost base in real term while funding incremental investments to grow the business. As expected, Q2 expenses were about second quarter levels as we began to appreciate the new data centers. After adjusting for negative impact of a weaker dollar, after incremental data center integration spending, fixed costs were just $4 million above Q2 in an apples-to-apples basis. Third quarter operating expenses were down $7 million versus last year on a reported basis. However, after adjusting for FX and the impact of acquisitions and divestiture such as NYFIX and Hugin and new initiatives, fixed operating costs were down $26 million or 6% in the third quarter of 2009.
 On a constant dollar, constant portfolio basis, year-to-date fixed expenses were down $97 million or 8% compared to the prior year period. We continue to make good progress and our focus on efficiency and productivity improvements, and will further reduce operating expenses NYSE Euronext in the coming years.
 Slide 20 provides you with some FX sensitivity for annual expense items. In March, when we provided fixed cost guidance for 2010 at $1.723 billion to $1.768 billion, we indicated that this guidance was predicated on the average FX rates for 2009 of $1.39 for the euro and $1.57 for the pound. Based on recent currency moves, we now estimate full year 2010 currency rates of around $1.34 for the euro and $1.55 for the pound, from which you derived a currency adjusted full year 2010 at expense guidance range of $1.707 billion to $1.749 billion. Based on fixed cost developments through the three quarters of the year and a year-to-date spend of $1.253 million, we now expect our full year 2010 fixed expenses to come in below the low end of the currency adjusted range.
 We remain committed to our 2011 objective of reducing constant dollar, constant portfolio of fixed expenses below $1.650 million. 2010 acquisition such as corporate board member, NYSE Blue and our May announcement to build two new clearinghouse in Europe are incremental to this guidance. In the third quarter, 61% of our operating expenses was denominated in dollars, 19% in euros, 20% in pounds. Our staffing level as of September 30 was 3,030 full-time positions, which is 337 positions or 10% below year end levels and include 34 staff from our recent acquisition of corporate board member.
 Previously indicated, we do expect cost to rise in the fourth quarter largely due to the migration into our new data center, investments in our new European clearinghouses and launching of interest rate futures in the U.S. A weaker dollar are also increased costs, which is more than offset of the beneficial impact on European revenue. In addition to the integration and transition costs, we began to appreciate a new data centers, which it added an incremental depreciation of approximately $4 million in the third quarter of 2010 and an incremental $10 million will be a flow-through in the fourth quarter. Over time, this will be mitigated as we exit our legacy data centers.
 Slide 21 details our cash and debt position as of September 30, 2010. Total debt was $2.5 billion, cash market securities totaled $0.4 billion and net debt was $2.1 billion. The $2.5 billion of debt, included $2.1 billion of long-term debt with a weighted average cost of 5.3%, the remaining $400 million short-term debt consisted of commercial paper at an average cost of approximately 0.5%. Through nine months, we have spent $244 million on capital expenditures, including $106 million related to our data centers. We expect our capital expenditures to decline significantly over the next two quarters to a more maintenance levels. We will provide more guidance for the outlook for CapEx at our Investor Day in March 2011.
 We also paid a net $126 million in Section 31-B to the SEC this quarter, reflecting the usual payment of the eight months of these pass-through charges. At the end of September, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was 2.25x, up from 1.9x at the end of June 2010 but still down from the 2.6x at the end of 2009. The increase in leverage ratio in Q3 was due to the seasonal effect of the payment of section 31 fee I referenced earlier, another cash outflows, including the second quarter payment and the weakening of the dollar at the end of the third quarter, which increased debt in dollar terms by $150 million. We expect our debt to EBITDA to move lower in fourth quarter as cash flows improve.
 NYSE Euronext is currently rated A+ by S&P and AAA by Moody’s, and we are now on stable outlook with S&P. We continue to operate within our long-term target leverage levels, and we are committed to continue to invest in our growth and return excess cash flow to our shareholders. Last week, the Board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2010 which is payable on December 31.
 With that, let me turn the call back to Duncan for some closing remarks and then we'll take your questions.

Obviously, a quarter with very challenging market conditions. But I've come away from the quarter pretty optimistic and very pleased with the progress we're making in our multiyear strategy as we endeavored to create a global capital markets community. I think the decisions we've made in the past few years to acquire other businesses are now generating incremental revenue, and that's more than helping us offset the negative impacts of things that we don't control like the currency and the volume.
 I also think that this was the quarter where we're beginning to see the results of our diversification efforts. As it's clear, there are business model is much better positioned than it was a few quarters ago. This revised periods like the one we're in right now. And I think as we look forward to 2011, with all of the things that Dominic and Mike had just touched on in terms of initiatives coming on the back of the data centers, we combine that with the anticipated launch of interest rate futures and the launch of New York portfolio we're beginning early in 2011, I think we're very optimistic that we've got some built-in growth drivers for next year, even if the volume environment remains where it is. I think if you ask us as a management team, we're cautiously optimistic that through 2011 will look a lot brighter. It's hard for us to imagine that people who just continue to stay out of the listed equity and derivative markets to the degree they have in the last few months.
 The other thing I like about our data centers I think it is, they're very representative of how we've been able to change the culture of the company. This is a much more innovative company than it was a few years ago. It's a truly globally integrated enterprise now. And I think these data centers, which really will act as liquidity hubs for our community strategy going forward, I think will prove to be the cornerstone of that technology services growth story that we've talked so much about in the last few quarters. So all in all, thank you for listening. We think it's a very good show and given the conditions. And we are increasingly confident going into next year about our abilities to effectively meet the ever changing needs of our ever expanding customer base.
 With that, that concludes our formal remarks, and we will open up the lines for Q&A. You've got Mike and Larry in Europe and you've got Dominic and you've got me here in Paris.

I think it's safe to say that both high frequency trading and co-location are not as well developed in Europe as they are in U.S. The market isn't as mature. There aren't as many trading venues. And a lot of what drives higher frequency trading and co-lo are having many venues to route between. That said, we had some presence both on the Liffe side and a little bit on the cash side of co-lo, not nearly as much on the cash side. Now remember, we've got a data center where we've got Liffe and the cash business located together, as well as the equity options that goes along with the Liffe business. So we believe that, that will create a healthy environment for co-location and for the high frequency trading. But it is a market that is behind the U.S. And I think I'm going to turn this over to Dominique in a second, as regulators are really taking a hard look at these. Dominic, you want to comment on that?

And we see that in the new co-lo member that we're adding in Basildon to answer your question. And last on the regulatory scrutiny, you, of course, know that they really try to understand. We consider that once we go underneath and in the details, the regulators will understand later at the model. We'll speak we'd be maybe more transparency what's there to be speak. But there is no real impact on their advocacy trading business, again, once the homework is done.

So we previously -- we're actually moving in a way costs that was previously in the compensation line when these individuals were employees, and now on the professional services fee. So there was some reduction in the compensation line in real terms based on our continued reduction in cost but a nice portion of that improvement, which is sustainable going forward. But it did come from a little bit of movement between the line. In terms of our incentive comp, and we haven't really discussed that into much, pretty comfortable saying in aggregate, our kind of annual bonus full salaries in the cash side is about $100 million to give you a perspective out of our compensation.

As you know, we have two hauls where we have to just filled out the infrastructure that expand into. Those will require capital investment. But the second option is to actually just densify the power supply in the existing hauls, which is a much smaller capital expenditure. This actually gives us more capacity within that. And we are looking at that option as a, it cost less and also, it's far less the lead time to do that. The we look at co-lo is it's an incremental revenue. It has cost against at obviously the that we, and we think that the ROI in it is good. But it's also important to our general strategy of building the liquidity hub and telling other value-added technology services whether those are, take or plans, managed services or other services that go along with it. So it's all part of the broader technologies, strategy that Dominic and his team have embarked on. So we sort of see it as a whole, we're really pleased with the way this is going out and we expect it to continue. So I don't if that answers it. We're not completely transparent in terms of the granularity of co-lo revenues. But you know what our competitors disclose and you should assume that we're not pretty far off on that.

And as everyone on the call is well aware, that is not our strong suit. We did not have, I thought the right post-trade assets. So between the NYPC venture in the U.S. and what we're working on in Europe having largely vertical as our U.K. business and now working on finishing the last step of that with the clearinghouse and the guaranty fund in the U.K. and then building one in the eurozone, I think we're in much better position in the next 12 to 18 months to participate on the post-trading side. I think it's a little early to tell exactly how much of these products find their way through trading venues or swap executions, facilities, et cetera. But I would tell you that our view on any of these front ends is that given that these products have here before it had been in the OTC space, any of these products that find their way, either voluntarily or by regulatory fee have to be traded more transparently. Our view is not, if you build that they will come theory, we would anticipate that we would construct these in partnership with the team, liquidity providers. We would take the selling to the realized approach we've taken in some of our other projects like our MX options business and our NYSE Liffe as to derivatives business. And you can safely assume we're already having conversations along that vein.

And I hope that you can maybe talk a little bit more about the high frequency trading that you're seeing over there? I think historically, when we think about high-frequency and cash equities, we think that the market makers that are using technology and are very rebate sensitive. But when we talk to people in Europe today, they're saying a lot of the growth is actually coming from the signal proprietary high-frequency traders. And when I think about those guys, I think about looking for liquidity, speed, depth of book and things like that, so that should actually really play into your existing markets.

They've got have enough liquidity to sort of draw the flow, include is some fungibility or interoperability of clearing issues. I think that the market is just not as well developed. We certainly do have high-frequency traders that are acting more like market makers than just liquidity takers on the regulated platforms. And I would assume that the same is true on our competitors' MTF platforms as well as the regulated market. So I don't know whether the mix is a little bit different in Europe versus the U.S. I just think the market is less well developed because there are fewer routing options, and routing itself is not as well developed or is clearing interoperability. It's a very different landscape. I think it will look more U.S. like over time, but it is taking time. I don't know if Duncan or Dominic, you want to add anything to that?
