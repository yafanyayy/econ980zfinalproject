Lee and David will provide you with a more detailed review of our operations, capital projects and financial results for the quarter. But I'd like to begin by discussing the highlights.
While our first quarter earnings were lower than last year, they were consistent with our expectations, despite very mild weather, which reduced our customers' electricity and natural gas consumption. They are also consistent with our earnings guidance for the year, which resulted in us affirming 2010 guidance last night.
Revenues were clearly lower than we had anticipated for the quarter, but you saw in the quarter's financial statements that we continue to hold the line on operating and maintenance costs despite continued pressure on areas over which we have limited control, such as our pension costs. Our ability to contain our controllable costs will continue to be an important factor in our financial performance given the trends we see with sales. 
New England does not yet appear to have turned around in terms of economic growth. Our retail electric sales were down nearly 5% in the first quarter of 2010 compared with last year. Excluding the weather impact, they were still down about 2½%. While this trend does not affect the financial performance of our Transmission and Generation segments, it has hurt the performance of our electric distribution utilities and underscores the need for periodic rate relief in each of our three jurisdictions.
As you know, we have reached a settlement in New Hampshire and we believe we have made a persuasive case for CL&P. We expect a final decision in both cases later this quarter. In CL&P's filing, we have requested sales decoupling. We will also request decoupling in the upcoming Western Massachusetts Electric rate case. We believe that decoupling makes sense in New England, where state energy policies focus heavily on using financial incentives to encourage customers to use electricity by upgrading the efficiency of homes and businesses.
As we said, in New Hampshire, we were pleased to reach a multi-year settlement of PSNH's distribution rate case. We appreciate the long hours that the staff of the New Hampshire Commission and the state's Office of Consumer Advocate spent negotiating this settlement, which we believe will provide benefits for both our customers and our investors. If approved, it will resolve one of the most significant uncertainties we faced as we entered 2010. It will help us improve our returns significantly, while at the same time ensuring that our customers will benefit from continued investments in our electric estimation system. We look forward to commission review, which will begin with hearings next week. David will provide you with details of the settlement in a moment, as well as an update on the current CL&P rate case.
On the legislative front, we've had a busy spring in Connecticut. Last night, the Connecticut Legislature concluded its regular 2010 legislative session. In the last stage of that session, both the Senate and House passed Senate Bill 493 , which if it becomes law, would reorganize the Department of Public Utility Control, launch a significant solar generation initiative, allow distribution companies to manage a portfolio that would provide some of their standard service supplies and implement a low-income rate. While the bill does not appear to have an adverse financial impact on us, we are concerned that certain elements, particularly the solar mandate, would increase customer prices. It is not yet clear whether Governor Rell will sign or veto this bill. However, as we learn more about this legislation, we will be sure to communicate with you about it.
In addition, last night the Connecticut Legislature approved the state budget for the 2010-2011 fiscal year. To fund a revenue gap, the budget calls for the issuance of $956 million of economic recovery revenue bonds that would be amortized over eight years. These bonds would be repaid through a charge on customer bills of CL&P, United Illuminating and municipal electrical companies. For CL&P, the revenue to pay interest and principal on the bonds would come from a continuation of a portion of its competitive transition assessment, which would otherwise end at the end of this year, as well as diverting about 1/3 of the annual funding for energy conservation programs beginning in 2012. The specifics of these adjustments will be determined by the DPUC. On average, the CL&P portion to support these bonds would be about $108 million annually. While disappointed with this legislation, it is better than the initial proposals that would have used $180 million of CL&P customer money to service $1.3 billion of new debt. As you can appreciate, the bill passed late last night, and we are still analyzing its impacts and provisions.
Turning back to the progress we've made in the first four months of the year, all major capital projects continue to move forward. PSNH has made significant progress since the beginning of this year on its largest construction project in 20 years, installation of the scrubber at Merrimack Station. The Clean Air Project is now more than half complete and we've just broken ground on the second largest project Yankee Gas has ever undertaken, and we've  started to secure key approvals for the first elements of our NEEWS family of projects. Lee will provide you with more detail on all of these projects.
We also continue to move ahead on our project to build a new 1,200-megawatt DC line to bring additional hydroelectric power from Hydro-Québec to New England. This project holds the potential to bring substantial environmental and economic benefits to the New England power sector. It could, by itself, lower total regional power sector CO2 emissions by 10%, would provide enough low-carbon power for one million homes and liberate about 50 billion cubic feet of gas annually for other uses. We consider this project an innovative way to bring competitively priced clean power to a region that has rising environmental standards. 
Earlier this year, we formed NU Transmission Ventures, a new wholly-owned subsidiary designed to hold our non-traditional transmission projects. We have also formed Northern Pass Transmission LLC, which is the entity through which NU and NSTAR would jointly invest in our new direct current power line to Canada. NU Transmission Ventures owns 75% of Northern Pass and NSTAR owns 25%.
I know that over the last month or so, due to media reports, a number of you have asked Jeff about Hydro-Québec's commitment to this project. We've had a number of conversations with HQ in recent weeks, and we fully believe they're committed to this project and we continue to be very optimistic that they will conclude negotiations and move into the siting process.
We have now signed a joint development agreement and continue to develop the terms of a transmission services agreement with NSTAR and Hydro-Québec. We hope to have a signed agreement by mid-year so we can present the TSA to FERC for approval. That agreement will set out the financial and operating arrangements with Hydro-Québec as well as the terms and conditions by which Hydro-Québec can use the new DC line.
We also continue to work to structure the long-term purchase power agreements with HQ. Any PPAs will, of course, be subject to state regulatory approval. The terms of power sales will not affect the transmission services agreement nor will they impact the financial returns that NU would generate through this initiative. However, we believe that clarity around the terms of power sales will be important to win broad public and regulatory support for the project as we enter the siting phase.
Before the end of 2010, we expect to begin the process of seeding siting approvals for this project. We hope to begin construction of the project by the end of 2012 and expect to begin delivering power across this line in 2015. Hydro-Québec is undertaking an ambitious build-out of its vast hydroelectric potential and it continues to target New England, where it has sold power since the 1980s as a principal and growing export market. 
Lee will discuss our first quarter operations, which generally were quite good. As many of you know, we had two severe winter storms during the quarter, one in February in New Hampshire and another in March in Southwest Connecticut that probably affected a number of listeners on this call today. The storms required extensive restoration efforts by our line crews and were supplemented by contractors and other utility workers from as far away as Michigan and Canada. We are proud to say that restoration was accomplished safely and efficiently, and we thank our customers for their patience and their understanding.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee."

I will begin with an update on our Transmission business, starting with operations. As you know, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation or NERC and its satellites are closely reviewing transmission operations throughout the country to ensure that grid security is enhanced and blackouts, similar to the Northeast U.S. blackout of August 2003, do not reoccur. On March 19, the Northeast Power Coordinating Council audit team concluded its on-site evaluation of our transmission group with a favorable outcome. The team determined that NU was compliant in all areas covered by the audit, which covered the period of June of 2007 to the present. The audit team looked for compliance with a total of 58 NERC reliability standards encompassing 216 requirements. These reliability standards defined requirements for the operations, planning and design of high-voltage electric transmission systems in North America. Congress made compliance with these standards mandatory as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.
The results of the audit were very strong, with three minor suggestions for improvement and two best practices noted. In light of the growing number of civil penalties elsewhere in the country, we are very pleased with the result of this audit.
Turning from operations to our capital program, we continue to make progress in the first four months of the year on signing our NEEWS projects, particularly the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, which accounts for nearly half of our approximately $1.5 billion of projected expenditures on NEEWS. On March 16, the Connecticut Siting Council approved the 12-mile section of the Greater Springfield Project in Connecticut. We are now preparing our follow-up, development and management plans for filing to the Siting Council. 
In Massachusetts, we completed siting hearings in the first quarter and filed our briefs. We feel very positive about the case we have made for the need of the Greater Springfield Reliability Project. The Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board or EFSB staff members are scheduled to discuss with the board certain larger topics in the case on May 13 and to receive the board's guidance, so that the staff can prepare its decision. If needed, a second meeting between the board and staff is scheduled for May 20. We expect a decision to be issued in the third quarter of 2010, which would support a late 2010 construction start. Once the Massachusetts audit is issued, we will review our $714 million cost estimate to determine how the final decision will affect the scope of the work. We continue to expect the Greater Springfield segment to be completed in 2013. 
In the third quarter of this year, we also expect ISO New England to announce their updated needs assessment for the other two major NEEWS segments, the Interstate Reliability Project and the Central Connecticut Reliability Project. We now expect to file state applications to build the interstate portion of the project in early 2011 and for the project to be completed in late 2014, with the central Connecticut segment following six to 12 months later.
As we have reported in earlier calls and presentations, there are more than $200 million of small projects related to NEEWS. On March 19, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities approved one of those projects, a $23 million project to separate two 115-kV lines between Agawam and West Springfield that are currently on the same structures. We expect to commence work on that project later this year and complete it in 2011. All told, our transmission capital spending totaled $51.5 million in the first quarter of this year, including $15.8 million on NEEWS.
We continue to project total capital spending of nearly $1.1 billion in 2010, including $273 million on transmission. Our largest capital project under construction currently is our Clean Air Project, which involves installing wet scrubber technology at PSNH's Merrimack coal-fired station. Through the end of April, the project was about 55% complete, and we expect it to be completed by mid-2012. The project continues to be on schedule and under its $457 million budget.
Merrimack and our other New Hampshire generation units operated well in the first quarter with a baseload equivalent availability factor of over 90% for the quarter. Our 50-megawatt Northern Wood Power Project in Portsmouth, New Hampshire continues to operate well, generating savings that are shared between customers and shareholders. We are in the process of applying for permits to double our on-site wood storage capability, which will produce additional benefits for customers.
In Massachusetts, Western Mass Electric has received all approvals necessary to begin the construction of our first solar generation facility located on a brownfield site in Pittsfield. The $10 million facility will have approximately 1.8 megawatts of capacity and is one of the largest photovoltaic projects in New England. Construction will begin in May and we expect the facility to be operational later this year. Western Mass is also in the final stages of due diligence on its second solar project, which we expect to announce in the coming weeks.
Turning to our Gas Distribution business, in April, Yankee Gas commenced construction of the new $67 million project to build a 16-mile natural gas pipeline from our three-year-old LNG plant in Waterbury to Wallingford, Connecticut. This project includes upgrades of our LNG plant's vaporization capacity and provides additional gas supply to meet peak day demand growth in the greater Cheshire area. This new capacity will allow Yankee Gas to address request for new gas service that we could not meet today. We expect some of the project to enter into service later this year and for the entire project to be complete by November of 2011.
Turning to the Electric Distribution side, I would like to follow up on some comments by Chuck about PSNH settlement. The distribution capital spending from 2010 through 2014 is consistent with the figures we provided you at the EEI Conference in November and with the spending projected in our last 10-K document.
On the Electric Distribution side, we suffered from two very damaging nor’easters in the first quarter. Together, a February 25 windstorm in New Hampshire and a mid-March wind and rainstorm primarily affecting our Southwest Connecticut service area caused about 430,000 individual power outages. Between the two storms, restoration costs are estimated to be about $45 million, the majority of which we expect will be recovered through a combination of insurance and money we collect through CL&P and PSNH rates. Connecticut regulators have commenced a review of utility storm recovery performance in the state. This review was common for some that causes power to be lost for more than a few days. While we believe we responded well to these extreme weather events, we always try to identify operating and communications lessons learned that we will factor into the next storm recovery process.
Lastly, before turning over the call to David, I want to review CL&P's March 31 advanced metering infrastructure filing with Connecticut regulators. You may recall that last summer we ran a three-month pilot program that focused on residential, commercial and industrial customer response to various pricing plans that were enabled by the installation of 3,000 AMI meters and associated infrastructure. Our filing was based on our analysis of the effectiveness of the different dynamic pricing options and also examined the state of the technology. Based on the results of our pilot and cost benefit analysis, our proposal calls for a full AMI implementation over a four-year period for all of CL&P's 1.2 million customers beginning mid-2012.
This timing assumes that the AMI standard and cybersecurity protocols presently under development are near completion and that we have received approval from Connecticut regulators. We currently estimate that the capital costs associated with this initiative will approach about $300 million. Our filing is available on the Investors section of our website.
We anticipate making additional regulatory filings to refine our cost estimates prior to implementation in mid-2012. No costs associated with this implementation are currently in our five-year capital expenditure forecast. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to David."
292525,104538381,62941,"Northeast Utilities, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May-06-2010",2010-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Lee. To start off, I'll provide you with a general overview of the quarter. First quarter results were consistent with our own expectations for the year and with our 2010 earnings guidance of between $1.80 and $2.80 per share. As we said, unusu",2986,"Thank you, Lee. To start off, I'll provide you with a general overview of the quarter. First quarter results were consistent with our own expectations for the year and with our 2010 earnings guidance of between $1.80 and $2.80 per share. As we said, unusually mild weather, typically in March, reduced our first quarter electric sales and the enactment of federal healthcare legislation cost us about $0.02 per share. But those factors were partially offset by increased transmission earnings and a 1% reduction in overall O&M despite higher pension and benefit costs. As a result, we remain comfortable with the guidance we first issued in November of last year.
Overall, we earned $86.2 million or $0.49 per share in the first quarter of '10, compared with $97.7 million or $0.60 per share in the first quarter of last year. The decline in earnings per share in part also reflects the issuance of nearly 19 million NU common shares in March of 2009. Our regulated utilities earned $88 million or $0.50 per share in the first quarter of 2010, compared with $94.6 million or $0.58 per share in the first quarter of 2009.
Our Transmission business segment showed the most improvement last year. As a result of higher level investment in the business, our Transmission segment earned $40.1 million or $0.23 per share in the first quarter of this year, compared with $35.4 million or $0.22 per share in the first quarter of '09. Transmission rate base totaled just over $2.6 billion as of March 31 of this year compared with $2.5 billion a year earlier. We continue to believe that our Transmission segment will earn between $0.90 and $0.95 per share this year. 
Unlike Transmission, our Distribution segment earnings are still somewhat dependent on unit sales to generate revenue. In the first quarter, weather New England certainly was not helpful. Compared with 2009, heating degree days were down about 13½% in the Hartford, Connecticut area and down about 16% in the Concord, New Hampshire area.
Our electric sales were down 4.9% in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the first quarter of 2009, and our firm natural gas sales were down 3½%. Mostly due to warmer than normal weather, residential electric sales fell by 6.1% in the first quarter 2010, compared with the same period of '09. While commercial sales fell by 4.9%, industrial sales were flat, reversing course from last year's big declines.
You may recall that far more of our residential revenue comes from kilowatt-hour charges than our commercial and industrial revenues. So when residential sales fall disproportionately as they did in the first quarter because of weather, our earnings are adversely affected. The overall weather effect this quarter relative to normal weather probably cost us about $10 million in revenue or roughly $0.035 per share. 
While I know you've seen signs of rebounding sales elsewhere in the country during the quarter, we expect that New England's recovery will lag the broader national recovery. On a weather-adjusted basis, commercial sales were down about 4% in the quarter compared with the same period of '09, a statistic that we believe illustrates the continued challenging economic conditions we face in New England. It also reflects the continuing long-term trend of customers benefiting from conservation and load management measures, as well as a move to distributed generation.
In other margin, I would add that during the quarter the storm activity, which left large amounts of customers without power, in some cases for extended period, certainly did not help the comparative to last year either. Weather-adjusted residential sales, which actually held up well last year, were down about 1½% in the first quarter. Overall, weather-adjusted electric sales across all of our electric companies were down 2½% relative to 2009, which so far, is somewhat more of a decline than the 1% we expected to see this year. Longer term, we see electric sales growth of roughly 0.3% over the 2011 through 2015 timeframe. While that represents some modest growth, it also reflects the underlying structural trend of increased conservation, load management and demand response, as well as continued use of distributed generation and of course, new lighting efficiency standards that are effective in 2012.
The sales results were a significant factor in the reduction of distribution earnings from $59.2 million in '09 to $47.9 million in 2010. The largest decline in distribution earnings occurred at CL&P where we earned $14.3 million in the first quarter, down about 34% from the first quarter of 2009. In addition to CL&P's 4.9% decline in sales, we experienced higher pension costs. Additionally in the first quarter of 2009, CL&P's distribution results reflected a $3.4 million benefit from the resolution of certain tax audits. There was no such benefit this year. Over the past 12 months, CL&P's distribution regulatory ROE is only 6.8%, well below our allowed level of 9.4%. That level of earnings underscores CL&P's need for distribution rate relief. 
As you know, CL&P filed a rate case in January. On April 26, all of the parties filed their final briefs in the case and our brief, the Consumer Counsel's and the AG's are posted in the Investor section of our website. In our final brief, we slightly modified our rate request to an increase of $129 million effective July 1, 2010, and an additional $41.4 million effective July 1, 2011.
We continue to recommend that the DPUC defer the first increase until January 1, 2011, so that the impact on customer bills will be more than offset by an approximate $230 million decrease in the competitive transition assessment due to the full amortization of our rate reduction bonds on December 31 of this year. This increase would also take effect on the generation portion of the bill as determined by the standard offer service rate should decline from today's level of approximately $0.113 to well below $0.10.
Back to the case, we also requested a 10½% return on equity, revenue decoupling, a pension tracker and the amortization of about $380 million of excess depreciation reserves over the remaining life of our distribution plan. While the other parties generally supported our proposed capitalization ratio, they took very different positions in several other areas. The Consumer Counsel recommended a non-deferred $6.9 million rate increase on July 1 of this year and an incremental $40.6 million increase a year later. The Consumer Counsel also recommended a 9.375% ROE, no decoupling or pension tracker and expense reductions in several areas. They also supported a seven-year amortization of excess depreciation, which accounted for about $43 million of the proposed reduction in our rate filing.
Unlike the Consumer Counsel, the Connecticut Attorney General did not launch [ph] a testimony during the case, but its brief calls for significant rate decreases, additional reliability spending, a 9.375% ROE, no decoupling or pension expense tracker. We are scheduled to receive a draft decision on May 21 with a final decision June 4, new rates in effect on July 1.
Turning to PSNH. The Distribution and Generation business earned $11.1 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared with $13.5 million in the first quarter of 2009. The benefit of a $25.6 million annualized temporary rate increase that took effect on August 1, 2009, and AFUDC earnings on the Clean Air Project were more than offset by higher pension and other operating costs and a 5.3% decline in sales. Additionally, PSNH generation booked a $1 million after-tax charge in the quarter associated with the new federal healthcare legislation. PSNH's Distribution segment ROE, which includes its generation, was 6.6% for the 12 months ended March 31, 2010.
Now as you know, we are nearing the end of a distribution rate case that was filed roughly a year ago. As a reminder, in April of 2009, PSNH filed for a $36.4 million temporary rate increase, which was followed on June 30, 2009, with a permanent rate increase request of $51 million to occur effective August 1, 2009, and they filed an additional $17 million effective July 1, 2010. On July 31, 2009, the NHPUC authorized a temporary rate increase of $25.6 million effective August 1, 2009.
Just last week on April 30, we joined the staff of the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission and the Office of Consumer Advocate in the filing of a proposed settlement of this case. The settlement addresses rate levels over the next five years, July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2015. The first rate change allows us to raise distribution rates by an incremental $45.5 million on July 1 of this year, on top of the $25.6 million temporary rate increase we implemented on August 1, 2009. Of that $45.5 million, $13.7 million represents this difference between temporary rates effective August 1, 2009, and permanent rates effective July 1, 2010. The $13.7 million will be recovered over 12 months from July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011. When the recoupment of that $13.7 million ends, the second rate change will take effect on July 1, 2011, and it will actually be a net $2.9 million rate decrease. Included in that net number is a $10.8 million increase to recognize the additional capital and reliability spending we referenced earlier. The settlement further allows a projected third rate change, which would increase rates by $9.5 million on July 1, 2012, and a fourth rate change, which would increase revenues by $11.1 million on July 1, 2013. 
Each of these rate increases is projected and relates primarily to the distribution capital and reliability investments we will continue to make in PSNH's distribution system over the next five years. The settlement maintains PSNH's distribution return on equity of 9.67% and allows a rate-making common equity ratio of 52.4%, an increase over the currently allowed level of 47.7%. It also contains a rate case scale provision until June 30, 2015, unless 12-month trailing distribution ROEs drop below 7% for two consecutive quarters, and it includes a sharing mechanism that refunds to customers 75% of any distribution earnings above a 10% ROE. Lastly, the settlement allows for additional increases based on certain exogenous events such as a general inflation rate exceeding 4% or changes in tax law or accounting regulations. PSNH's tracking generation ROE of 9.81% remains unchanged.
The New Hampshire Commission is scheduled to hold hearings on the settlement next week, and we expect new rates to be effective July 1, 2010. Since the settlement is subject to full commission approval, we will need to refrain from a full assessment of our ROE prospects over the five-year period. But I will say that we expect a very significant improvement over the 3.6% distribution-only ROE PSNH earned in 2009, and that the settlement is supportive of our 2010 distribution earnings guidance of $0.95 to $1.05 per share in our earlier statement regarding 2011 EPS prospects. Should the New Hampshire Commission approve the settlement, the primary swing factor remaining in our 2010 guidance will be the CL&P rate case.
Western Mass' Distribution segment earned $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared with $4.8 million in the first quarter of '09. The decline was due primarily to a 4.4% decline in sales. Western Mass Distribution ROE was 7.2% for the 12 months ended March 31, 2010. And as we have told you previously, we expect to file a rate case this year. The letter of intent is likely to be filed later this month, and we expect new rates will be effective in early 2011. Because the rate case will have no impact on 2010 results, we continue to project a 2010 distribution regulatory ROE at WMECO of about 6%.
Yankee Gas' earnings rose to $19.6 million in the first quarter of 2010 from $19.3 million in the first quarter of 2009. Yankee's actual firm sales declined 3.5%, but weather-adjusted sales continued to rise and were up 6.4% for the quarter. In the quarter, the impact of lower sales was more than offset by lower interest expense and lower O&M. 
You may recall that Yankee Gas results in the second half of 2009 were very negatively affected by rising uncollectible expense. We have added considerable focus to the customer-care function at Yankee Gas as well as at the Electric Distribution businesses, and we believe we are making considerable progress. We deployed additional resources and are working very thoughtfully with our customers to structure payment arrangements.
As an aside, first quarter 2010 non-tracked uncollectible expense across all of our distribution companies was just below 2009 levels, and we believe this outcome is supportive of our annual uncollectible expense embedded in our 2010 guidance. As a reminder, we've previously stated that we expect our non-tracked uncollectible expense in 2010 to decline by about $12 million from 2009 levels of $47 million and that the vast majority of that decline will be at Yankee Gas.
Turning back to Yankee. Its ROE for the 12 months ended March 31 was 6.7%. We continue to expect that level to improve by year end, but only to about 8% rather than the 9% we have projected earlier. The downward revision is the result of mild weather in the first quarter. We continue to evaluate the timing of Yankee Gas next rate case, and we do not expect a filing until 2011. 
I mentioned earlier that the new health care bill resulted in a $3 million one-time charge to earnings in the first quarter. And over the course of the year, it will cost us another $2 million, for a total of about $5 million. The first quarter impact showed up primarily in two line items on our income statement. You'll see our effective tax rate for the quarter was 47.5%. This reflects a charge to income tax expense of about $18 million associated with writing off a portion of the previously established tax asset associated with future retiree health care benefits. However, you'll also note that our amortization of regulatory assets declined by about $30 million. Approximately $24 million of that decline or about $15 million after tax reflects the creation of a regulatory asset associated with our regulated companies having lower tax benefits to defray other rate-payer costs. The $3 million charge reflects our expectation that we will have to absorb some of the impact associated with the higher future tax obligations. I mentioned the $1 million impact at PSNH generation. Another $1.2 million was split evenly in the quarter between our Competitive businesses and NU parent and other, with a balance attributable to our Transmission segment.
Including a $600,000 health care charge, our Competitive businesses earned $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared with $5.8 million in the first quarter of '09. The primary reason for the difference was mark-to-market impact of our remaining wholesale contracts. We recorded $400,000 of after-tax mark-to-market losses in the first quarter of 2010 compared with $3.2 million of mark-to-market gains in the first quarter of 2009. Our first quarter results are consistent with our 2010 guidance of zero to $0.05 per share for these businesses. But I should emphasize that we continue to wind down these businesses, so their contribution to NU's overall results will diminish over the next two to three years. 
NU parent and other subsidiaries had net expenses of $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2010, including its $600,000 share of the $3 million health care charge. That net expense is somewhat larger than the $2.7 million we recorded in the same period of 2009.  We continue to project net expense of about $0.05 per share for NU parent this year. 
Turning to our financing activities. We essentially completed our 2010 debt issuance plans in the first four months of the year. On March 8, Western Mass closed on the sale of $95 million of 10-year unsecured debt, carrying a coupon of 5.1%. On April 1, CL&P completed the re-marketing of $62 million of secured pollution-control revenue bonds. Until next April, when they must be re-marketed, they will carry a coupon of 1.4% compared with the previous one-year coupon of 5.25%. And finally, on April 22, we closed on the sale of $50 million of first mortgage bonds at Yankee Gas with a coupon of 4.87%. 
Each of these coupons support our 2010 business plan and guidance and reflect our continued ability to access the capital markets at attractive rates that will benefit customers and shareholders for years to come. Over the balance of year, our primary financing focus will be on renewing our $900 million revolving credit lines that mature in early November. We believe that the bank revolver market is becoming progressively more attractive to investment-grade borrowers such as NU, and that we will secure new lines for multiple years.
Turning, finally, from financing to our balance sheet and cash flow statements. You'll notice that we generated $159.1 million of cash from operations in the first quarter of 2010 after repayment of rate-reduction bonds. This is much better than the $77.5 million we generated in the first quarter of '09. The primary difference is a payment we made in the first quarter of last year associated with the very destructive ice storm that struck New Hampshire and Massachusetts in mid-December of 2008. Due primarily to the costs of the first quarter storms this year, however, we are adjusting our full year 2010 forecast of cash flows after rate-reduction bond payments to approximately $650 million from the previous $700 million. 
Our balance sheet ratios remain within our target ranges. Short-term and long-term debt represented 56% of our GAAP capitalization at the end of March, and we continue to project no need to issue equity before 2012. I know that next week starts the Spring investor conference season, we look forward to seeing many of you at the AGA and other conferences over the coming weeks.

Since last fall, we have discussed with you the importance of 2010 for Northeast Utilities.

Since last fall, we have discussed with you the importance of 2010 for Northeast Utilities. We knew at the start of this year that we needed to succeed in a number of areas in order to position ourselves to significantly enhance our operating and financial performance for several years to come. 
Today, seven months through the year, we have seen two of these key items reach closure, the CL&P and the PSNH distribution rate cases. Both cases were decided in late June and both were effective July 1. In both cases, regulators made important decisions of proving our distribution capital investment plan so that we can maintain the integrity of our distribution systems. In both cases, commissions improved increases in the equity component of our capital structure to help us maintain our investment-grade ratings and finance our considerable capital expenditures at reasonable rates. And perhaps, as important, both regulators approved multi-year plans which will provide us with a higher level of certainty in our business planning process for the next several years.
These rate cases were completed in a difficult economic environment, on-time and in a constructive and professional manner. And for that, we thank the regulators, their staff and the intervenors. In addition, we hope to reach closure early next year in the distribution rate case WMECO filed last month. 
The five months remaining, there are still a number of key items we hope to resolve. They were similarly important to our operating and financial performance over the next several years. Dave will discuss the status of the NEEWS family of transmission projects. We've already received approvals for some of the smaller projects and expect to receive Massachusetts approval of the Greater Springfield Reliability Project within the next few months. This project, which was approved by Connecticut siting regulators in March, will provide significant reliability benefits to New England by addressing a key bottleneck in the Springfield, Massachusetts area. 
We also look forward to working with NSTAR to wrap up our negotiations with Hydro-Québec on a transmission services agreement for Northern Pass, our proposed new 1,200-megawatt connection between Québec and Southern New Hampshire. Once signed, that agreement will be presented to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for its approval. After completing the TSA, we will begin preparing our state and federal siting applications for the project. We continue to make progress and expect to sign the TSA later this quarter, begin the siting filings later this year and bring the line in the service in the second half of 2015.
From Transmission, I'd like to turn to Legislation. Connecticut Budget Bill initially called for the state to borrow about $950 million during the new fiscal year to bridge its budget gap and have those borrowings repaid through collections from the electric bills paid by CL&P, UI and the Connecticut Municipal Electric Company customers. Fortunately and somewhat surprising to many, the state ended the 2009 to '10 fiscal year with nearly a $400 million surplus. We expect about $250 million of that sum to be used to reduce the initially projected $950 million of borrowings. That, in turn, will reduce the amount that needs to be collected from our customers over the next eight years, with a competitive transition in energy conservation charges. Our regulators in the State Treasurer's Office will determine the exact amount to be collected, but we are hopeful that the budget surplus will result in a larger reduction in CL&P bills on January 1, 2011 than we had earlier anticipated.
Finally, I'd like to comment on our change in earnings guidance. You probably noticed that we raised and narrowed guidance in the earnings news release we issued last night. We now project consolidated earnings of between $1.95 and $2.05 per share in 2010. Now more than halfway through the year, we've experienced very hot weather, good performance from our Transmission segment and our Competitive businesses and concluded d our two largest distribution rate cases. 
Temperatures in the Hartford area had been at or above 90 degrees on 12 of the 31 days in July, compared with no days in the 90s in 2009. While weather-related sales increases have been partially offset by much higher storm activity than we experienced last year, we expect July electric sales will be well ahead of both last year and our initial projections.
Additionally, we are seeing some early evidence of economic stability in New England with weather-adjusted sales up in the second quarter, our uncollectibles expense in the regions jobless rate declining. David will discuss the details of our revised guidance and sales trends, but we are certainly pleased that from an operational and financial perspective, we are achieving the targets our customers and our investors deserve. Now let me turn the call over to Lee."
292525,109945328,72305,"Northeast Utilities, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-04-2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Chuck. I will begin by reviewing our operations performance. As you know, we have had recognized temperatures in the Northeast in the week after July 4. New England experienced peak electric loads we have not seen since August of 2006. On July",1374,"Thank you, Chuck. I will begin by reviewing our operations performance. As you know, we have had recognized temperatures in the Northeast in the week after July 4. New England experienced peak electric loads we have not seen since August of 2006. On July 6, the day after the long holiday weekend, New England's peak demand was estimated about 27,154 megawatts, fourth highest ever. During that period, our system held up well. Our New Hampshire generating plants performance was strong with nearly 100% availability during peak loads, and equipment-related issues were minimal. We have not yet seen sales data for July but we expect it to be robust, especially compared with the mild and wet July we experienced in 2009.
While our system has handled the heat well, we've had a number of severe storms this year which have impacted our operational and financial results. Over the first two quarters in 2010, we recorded more than $16 million in storm restoration costs, of which approximately 77% or $46 million had been deferred for future recovery or capitalized. The resulting approximately $14 million of pretax storm expense through June is more than double our budget of approximately $6 million for the same period. 
In the second quarter alone, we experienced more than $8 million in pretax storm expense across our three Electric Distribution companies, compared to $700,000 in the second quarter of 2009. Our transmission system is much less prone to storm damage, and it performed superbly including our new Southwest Connecticut lines handling very high loads along the Connecticut shoreline, despite the fact that the heat there was more intense than the inland areas. The loads we experienced underscore the need for Transmission capital investments we continue to make in our system. Through June 30, our Transmission capital expenditures were $113 million, and we project total Transmission expenditures of $257 million this year.
We continue to project overall NU capital spending of nearly $1.1 billion in 2010. About $35 million of this year's capital spending has been on the NEEWS family of projects, and we continue to make progress in our siting initiatives, particularly the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, which accounts for nearly half of our approximately $1.5 billion of projected expenditures on NEEWS. 
In Massachusetts, the state Energy Facilities Siting Board, or EFSB, held a number of public meetings in May and June to discuss the staff, key topics that were raised during evidentiary hearings earlier this year. We expect the positive outcome to this application and for the approval of the route to be consistent with configurations that were approved by Connecticut siting regulators in March. 
We anticipate receiving a draft decision from the EFSB in September and to receive a final decision shortly thereafter. If the vote is favorable, we expect to begin construction by the end of this year or early 2011 and to complete the GSRP project in 2013. We will update our cost estimate of the project once we fully understand all of the conditions that will be placed on construction.
Later this quarter, we also expect ISO New England to announce their updated needs assessment for the other two major NEEWS projects: the Interstate Reliability Project and the Central Connecticut Reliability Project. We expect to file state siting applications to build the Interstate Project in early 2011 or the project to be completed by the end of 2012 with Central Connecticut six to 12 months later. 
As you recall from earlier calls and presentations, there are more than $200 million of smaller projects related to NEEWS, some of which are moving forward today. About $50 million of those projects are approved and some of those are currently under construction. Like other major transmission owners across the country, we are closely monitoring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or NOPR, on transmission planning and cost allocation. We support the NOPR's endorsement of regional bottom-up planning in conclusion that the cost should be allocated based on who causes the cost and who benefits from the transmission. We believe that the New England Transmission planning and allocation model works very well and want to ensure that the proposals incorporated in the NOPR do not interfere with the regions planning and investment successes. We believe that the public policy aspect of the NOPR would support both the Northern Pass HVDC project to Québec and the potential of a win consortium in New England.
Our largest capital project currently under construction is the Clean Air Project which involves installing scrubber technology, help PSNH's Merrimack coal-fired station. Throughout the end of July, the project was about 67% complete, and we expect it to be completed by mid-2012. The project continues to be on schedule and under its $457 million budget. 
In Massachusetts, Western Mass Electric has begun construction on the first solar generation facility as part of its 6-megawatt solar program. Located on the brownfield site in Pittsfield, the $10 million facility will have approximately 1.8 megawatts of capacity and is one of the largest photovoltaic projects in New England. Construction began in May and the installation of more than 6,500 solar panels is underway. We expect the facility to be operational later this year. Western Mass Electric is currently authorized to invest approximately $60 million in solar projects by the end of 2012. Site assessments of our next projects are nearly complete, and preliminary findings indicate that the potential to install between 2.5 and 4 megawatts of capacity. These larger installations of solar projects offer economies of scale the more favorable pricing. This pricing dynamic provides WMECO customers the benefits of lower cost solar power that may enable the installation of additional capacity given the appropriate regulatory approvals.
Turning to our Gas Distribution business. In April, Yankee Gas commenced construction of a new $67 million project to build a 16-mile natural gas pipeline from our LNG plant in Waterbury, Connecticut to Wallingford, Connecticut. The first phase of this project costs approximately $60 million. It will provide a new interconnection to the greater Cheshire area which has significant pent-up demand for firm gas service that we cannot currently serve due to pipeline constraints. We expect this first phase to be completed by November 1.
The second phase will involve expanding the vaporization capacity of the Waterbury LNG facility and connecting the plant to Cheshire from the West, and that should be completed in November of 2011. We have spent nearly $8.2 million on the project through June, and it is currently on schedule and on budget. 
Turning to the Electric Distribution side, I would like to follow up on some comments by Chuck about the CL&P and PSNH rate case decisions. Both commissions approved our proposed distribution capital investment plans for the coming years, and Connecticut DPUC also approved some additions to CL&P's workforce, including 16 metering technicians, 11 additional customer service representatives and various support personnel, as well as a higher level of tree trimming expense than we initially proposed in the rate case. We believe both cases will allow us to maintain the recent improvement we have made in service reliability and make additional investments going forward in CL&P's and PSNH's distribution infrastructure.
In the Western Mass Electric rate case we filed last month, we proposed a multi-year capital investment recovery mechanism to ensure that we can recover on a reasonable timely basis, distribution capital investments that we need to make Western Mass Electric's service territory more reliable. This mechanism is important to us and is important for improved reliability as we go forward.
In the case, we proposed raising WMECO's annual distribution capital expenditures from $35 million annually to about $50 million annually. In our testimonial, we told the DPU that we need the additional expenditures to stem what would be otherwise a continued degradation of distribution service liability. Also in the case, we are seeking to recover over five years, the $13 million of remaining deferred expenses related to the December 2008 ice storm and several smaller storms. You may recall that in the PSNH rate case, the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission approved recovery of PSNH's more considerable ice storm expenses over seven years. And now I'd like to turn it over to Dave McHale."

I'll start by reviewing our financial performance in both the second quarter and the first half of 2010, finish with a more in-depth comments concerning our revised 2010 guidance and future earnings prospects. We earned $71.9 million or $0.41",3229,"Thanks, Lee. I'll start by reviewing our financial performance in both the second quarter and the first half of 2010, finish with a more in-depth comments concerning our revised 2010 guidance and future earnings prospects. We earned $71.9 million or $0.41 per share in the second quarter of this year compared with $82.9 million or $0.47 per share in the second quarter of 2009.
The decline in year-over-year earnings is primarily due to the fact that in the second quarter of 2009, we sold a number of routine tax matters with state and federal authorities and recorded after-tax gains of about $11.1 million or $0.06 per share. So absent the tax-related gains, our second quarter results this year were similar to last year. 
In the first half of 2010, we earned $158.2 million or $0.90 per share compared with $180.5 million or $1.07 per share in the first half of 2009. $0.09 of the $0.17 difference were related to gains from the settlement of routine tax matters in the first half of 2009.
Earnings in our Transmission segment totaled $41.9 million in the second quarter of '10 and $82.1 million in the first half 2010, compared with $41.8 million in the second quarter of '09 and $77.2 million in the first half of 2009. The growth in year-to-date earnings reflects the increased Transmission rate base on which we earned our FERC regulated returns. Rate base at June 30, 2010 is $2.64 billion, up about $125 million from June 30, 2009.
Transmission earnings growth, while still positive of course, is slower than it was in the years during which we were building our four Southwest Connecticut projects. But now that we are on the verge of receiving final siting approvals for the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, we are poised for accelerated growth over the coming quarters. 
Earnings in our Distribution and Generation businesses totaled $27.1 million in the second quarter of '10 and $75 million in the first half of 2010, compared with $38.2 million in the second quarter of '09 and $97.4 million in the first half of '09. Much of that decline was expected and is related to the 2010 tax matters I discussed earlier. I'll go through each of the regulated businesses in a little more detail.
CL&P's Distribution segment had the greatest decline since that was a segment that benefited the most in 2009 from the tax settlements. Distribution segment earned $8.4 million in the second quarter of the year and $22.7 million in the first half of this year, compared with $21.9 million in the second quarter of '09 and $43.6 million in the first half of '09. 
In addition to the tax items, the decline in the second quarter was due in part to the storm expense Lee mentioned earlier, it was also due to higher pension expense and municipal taxes. Over the past 12 months, CL&P's regulatory ROE was 5.4% but we expect that level to improve steadily over the next several quarters as a result of the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control's distribution rate case that was effective last month.
For calendar 2010, we expect CL&P's Distribution regulatory ROE to be between 7.5% and 8%. On June 30, the DPUC approved the distribution rate increase of $63.4 million that became effective July 1, 2010, and an incremental $38.5 million that will become effective July 1, 2011. The DPUC-approved CL&P's proposed capital structure of 49.2% common equity but maintains CL&P's authorized return of 9.4%. I should probably read in our 8-Ks, the DPUC initially denied CL&P's request to establish a $13.7 million regulatory asset related to a provision in the federal health legislation that eliminated the tax deductibility of subsidies companies received providing retirees healthcare, which would have required us to take a charge to earnings. On July 14th, CL&P filed for reconsideration of this finding and on July 28, the DPUC amended its order in our favor, granting the establishment of the regulatory asset. So there was no charge taken in the second quarter.
In the rate case decision, the DPUC agreed with our positions on several topics. It accepted our projected sales assumptions for 2010 and '11, approved CL&P's capital program, funded our reliability and maintenance program, as I mentioned earlier, approved our requested capital structure. But the decision also did not allow us to recover certain expenses we may not be able to offset. Costs such as a large portion of the incentive pay for non-officers and to a lesser degree, costs related to rental expense, employee benefits and pension. Also as a reminder, there are certain costs that we chose not to include in the rate case, such as executive incentive compensation, board-related expenses and portions of D&O insurance and 401(k) expenses, $12 million in total.
That said, we believe that CL&P will be in a position to earn in the 9% area over the next two years as long as we remain diligent on managing our costs and avoid a downturn in the economy. While that may fall short of the allowed 9.4 ROE, we think the case was concluded in a constructive manner and fairly balances the needs of shareholders and customers, particularly against the current economic backdrop. 
As part of this decision, the DPUC accepted our proposal to differ implementation of the rate increase on customer bills until January 1 of 2011. As a result, while from an earnings perspective, CL&P will benefit from the rate increases in mid-'10 and mid-2011 as I described earlier, the cash impact will be different. Customers will see only one distribution rate increase totaling about $110 million annually on January 1 of 2011. That increase should allow us to recover all the revenue due to us as a result of the two-rate increases between the beginning of '11 and the middle of '12. For customers still buying their energy from CL&P, that January '11 increase will be more than offset by declines in the transition and generation portions of the bill. So even with the distribution increase, most of our customers are likely to receive a reduction of their total bill in 2011, but the generation portion, which comprises well over half of the total bill, likely down at least 10%.
From CL&P, let's look at PSNH where we also included a distribution rate case at the end of June. On July 1, PSNH implemented a $45.5 million distribution rate increase as a result of the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission's approval of a settlement we had reached for the commission staff and the consumer advocate. As I described, that five-year settlement at length during our May conference call, I won't go into the details here again, but like CL&P, we believe that the rate case will allow PSNH's distribution earnings to recover significantly over the next 12 months. 
Going forward, we estimate that its combined Distribution and Generation ROE can achieve returns in a 9.5% to 10% range, supported by its 9.81 ROE for PSNH Generation business, and in ROE in a 9% area for Distribution only. As of June 30, the combined Distribution and Generation ROE was 7.7%. We expect to be close to the authorized levels for the full calendar year 2010. 
PSNH's Distribution and Generation segment earned $16.9 million in the second quarter of '10 and $28.1 million in the first half of 2010, compared with earnings of $11.9 million in the second quarter of '09 and $25.4 million in the first half of '09. The improvement in second quarter results was due primarily to a 4.6% increase in retail electric sales and the temporary distribution rate increase that took effect a year ago, partially offset by higher pension and other operating costs.
Western Mass Electric earned $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2010 and $5.2 million in the first half of 2010, compared with $3.8 million in the second quarter of '09 and $8.6 million in the first half of '09. The decline to date was due to higher storm restoration costs, employee benefit costs, interest expense and municipal property taxes and occurred despite a 7% increase in electric sales in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the same period last year. 
Let me go trailing 12-months. Distribution ROE was 6.6% and we now expect it to be about 5% for the full calendar year 2010. As a result of this weakening performance, WMECO filed with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities on July 16 for $28.4 million increase in distribution rates, effective February 1, 2011. We expect this to be WMECO's first fully litigated rate case in about 20 years. And we may go seeking revenue decoupling, consistent with DPU policy, as well as the distribution capital tracking mechanism. It's also seeking to recover deferred storm, restoration and hardship receivable costs. A link to the rate case filing is available on our Investor website.
Although second quarter earning was certainly not strong for our Electric Distribution businesses, it did benefit from hot weather in June. Retail sales were up 5.9% in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of '09. Importantly, they were up 1% on a weather-adjusted basis. That favorable performance offset a weak first quarter, so our overall retail electric sales are flat year-to-date compared with 2009. On a weather-adjusted basis, retail electric sales are off 0.8% for the first six months of the year, which is somewhat ahead of our sales forecast of negative 1% for the full year, and a significant improvement from the first quarter weather-adjusted sales which were down 2.5% from the first quarter of '09.
The quarterly weather-adjusted year-to-year increase in sales was the first we had seen in our service territory since 2007. In fact, weather-adjusted sales in the quarter were up for all three of our electric companies and among classes, residential was up 1.8%, commercial was up 0.4% and even industrial halted its long decline, although just breaking even with last year's numbers.
We have seen the regional economy move from recession to stabilization to perhaps now a glimmer of recovery. New Hampshire's economy certainly seems to be improving. The state's unemployment rate, we started the year at 7.7%, has dropped to 5.7%, well below the overall U.S. unemployment rate of 9.5%. While the service sectors in New Hampshire such as healthcare continue to hire, it is in the resurgence in manufacturing employment that has made the most difference over the past six months. New Hampshire added 900 manufacturing jobs in May. Weekly hours are up as our average hourly wages. The state is expected to add more than 10,000 jobs this year. 
Connecticut's economy also has shown signs of improvement in 2010. In June, Connecticut added jobs to its economy for the sixth consecutive month. So at a 500 gain, this is the smallest monthly increase since February of this year. June's gain makes for a total of 13,500 new jobs since December '09. Although the insurance industry continues to shed jobs, industrial production has been bolstered by government spending on aerospace and the recovery of the global economy, which has helped export-related activity recover quite nicely. The state's unemployment rate declined from its 9.8% peak in January to 8.8% in June.
One additional area where we are seeing progress across our system is in uncollectible write-offs. You may recall that rising uncollectible expense was a development that negatively affected our results in the second half of 2009. As expected this year, we are having more success in this area and uncollectible expense is running about $5 million better than planned. As a reminder, last year, we experienced $47 million in non-track uncollectible expense, and we budgeted it for a $12 million decline in 2010 to a level of $35 million. Our current run rate, absent a reversal in the economy, has it now targeting about $30 million in non-track expense. 
As you know, July was an extremely hot month in the Northeast, cooling degree days at Bradley Airport between Hartford and Springfield totaled 386 compared with 168 last year and an average of 274. That it certainly provided us with a running start for the third quarter.
Turning to our Natural Gas business. Yankee lost $500,000 in the second quarter of 2010 compared with a profit of $600,000 in the second quarter of '09. The warm April was clearly a factor. Yankee's firm natural gas sales were down 4.3% in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the same period of '09. Over the first six months of 2010, Yankee Gas earned $19 million compared with $19.8 million during the same period in 2009. The principal factor leading to that decline was a 3.7% decline in firm natural gas sales, driven by a much warmer heating season.
Aside from the weather, Yankee Gas continues to experience real sales growth, primarily as a result of conversion. On a weather-adjusted basis, Yankee Gas firm natural gas sales were up 5.1% during the first half of 2010 compared with the same period of '09. This continues the trend we have experienced in the past couple of years. In 2009, Yankee Gas' weather-adjusted sales were up 5% over 2008 levels. With a 20% to 30% price advantage, we continue to see strong interest among our customers in installing natural gas power equipment and converting away from heating oil and other fuels. Lee discussed the Waterbury-Wallingford line earlier, phasing that line into service and into rate base will be a primary factor, triggering the need for a Yankee Gas case next year.
Second quarter results at the Competitive businesses and Parent were in part with results in 2009. Our Competitive businesses earned $5.3 million in the second quarter of '10 compared to $5.5 million in the same quarter of 2009. Although the Competitive businesses continued their wind-down mode, they benefited from remaining energy contracts and their profitable electrical contracting business, E.S. Boulos. NU Parent recorded net after-tax expenses of $2.4 million in the second quarter of '10, about $200,000 less than $2.6 million incurred at the second quarter of '09. 
As Chuck noted last night, we raised our consolidated earnings guidance to $1.95 and $2.05 per share this year. I want to take a moment and expand on these five business segments.
First, given the success of our Competitive businesses so far this year, we see that segment earning at the very top of the original $0 to $0.05 range. Therefore, we revised guidance of $0.05 per share and see little volatility remaining in the business throughout the balance of the year. 
Second, given the successful execution of our Transmission capital plan this year and prospects over the balance of the year, we also see that segment earning at the very top of this original $0.90 to $0.95 range. Therefore, we revised guidance to $0.95 per share. And even though there are a small number of items that are not appropriately track to the transmission tariff, such as the nearly $1 million in healthcare reform-related charges we incurred in the first quarter of this year, we see manageable variation remaining over the balance of the year.
Third, we are holding steady on a projected net expense of $0.05 per share at our Parent and Other businesses. And lastly, we are left with the Distribution segment, where we started the year with a range of $0.95 to $1.05. This range reflected several substantial unknowns going into the year, excluding the PSNH rate case, yet to be filed PSNH -- CL&P rate case and the prospects for a weakening economy. 
We attribute the increase in guidance in this segment to $1 to $1.10 per share to the constructive resolution of the CL&P and PSNH rate cases, perhaps what is at least a stabilizing of the economy as demonstrated by the second quarter 2010's weather-adjusted sales and an improvement in uncollectible expenses trend. Of course, we also benefited from June's warm weather, and we know July sales will be very strong due to record temperatures. In addition, inflation remains at check. We are managing O&M quite effectively, interest rates remain low and our long-term debt issuance for the year has been completed at interest rate levels better than planned.
Looking at it another way, our revised consolidated guidance of $1.95 to $2.05 per share is quite a bit better than our trailing 12-month EPS of $1.75 per share. And there are number of factors that we believe will improve results, not only over the next two quarters but in 2011 as well. I already mentioned that CL&P and PSNH's distribution rate decision, electric sales and uncollectible trends, including the fact that we recorded significant charges in the third and fourth quarter of '09 associated with uncollectible expense at both Yankee and CL&P. 
But we see other growth catalysts as well, such as of the Merrimack Clean Air Project at PSNH which, as it moves towards completion in 2012, would generate additional earnings to each quarter on its growing equity investment; with regulatory approval, the Greater Springfield Reliability Project will move into full construction in 2011, and we'll be booking our progressively larger FERC-regulated cash return of 12.89% on the equity we expect to invest in that project. We expect WMECO's distribution results to improve in 2011 should we receive reasonable rate treatment at the current case, and it's possible that Yankee Gas could have new rate in effect by midyear should we move forward with the 2011 rate case filing at that company. And of course, we will continue to manage our cost diligently in an effort to achieve our ROE targets and minimize cost to customers.
As in the past, we expect to provide you with specific 2011 earnings guidance during our customary breakfast presentation at the EEI Conference in November. But meanwhile, we will remain optimistic that our business can grow earnings at a 6% to 9% five-year compounded annual growth rate and simultaneously grow the dividend at a rate above what we think, on average, the industry will achieve, and consistent with our internal 50% dividend payout ratio target. 
Lastly, turning from earnings to cash flow in our balance sheet, net cash flows from operations after retirement of rate reduction bonds totaled $405.2 million through the first half of this year, somewhat ahead of where we were at this time last year. With the hot weather bolstering electric sales, we are now projecting cash flows after repayment of rate reduction bonds of about $700 million this year, up from the $650 million we have projected in May. 
Total debt represented about 56.3% of total capitalization at the end of June, below our general leverage target of 60%. As a result, we continue to see no equity issuances on the horizon until at least 2012. You may have noticed that in July, both Moody's and S&P completed their most recent reviews of NU and our subsidiaries. Our ratings and stable outlooks were affirmed. 
Also, over the next few months, we'll be working to renew our $900 million of credit lines. Our banks are quite comfortable with both our business outlook and results, and we expect a renewal for at least three years to be in place by October. In addition, we have no debt maturities or debt offerings between now and year end. Now let me turn the call back to Jeff."

Since last fall, we have discussed with you the importance of 2010 for Northeast Utilities. We knew at the start of this year that we needed to succeed in a number of areas i",812,"Thank you, Jeff, and I'd like to thank all of you for joining us this afternoon. Since last fall, we have discussed with you the importance of 2010 for Northeast Utilities. We knew at the start of this year that we needed to succeed in a number of areas in order to position ourselves to significantly enhance our operating and financial performance for several years to come. 
Today, seven months through the year, we have seen two of these key items reach closure, the CL&P and the PSNH distribution rate cases. Both cases were decided in late June and both were effective July 1. In both cases, regulators made important decisions of proving our distribution capital investment plan so that we can maintain the integrity of our distribution systems. In both cases, commissions improved increases in the equity component of our capital structure to help us maintain our investment-grade ratings and finance our considerable capital expenditures at reasonable rates. And perhaps, as important, both regulators approved multi-year plans which will provide us with a higher level of certainty in our business planning process for the next several years.
These rate cases were completed in a difficult economic environment, on-time and in a constructive and professional manner. And for that, we thank the regulators, their staff and the intervenors. In addition, we hope to reach closure early next year in the distribution rate case WMECO filed last month. 
The five months remaining, there are still a number of key items we hope to resolve. They were similarly important to our operating and financial performance over the next several years. Dave will discuss the status of the NEEWS family of transmission projects. We've already received approvals for some of the smaller projects and expect to receive Massachusetts approval of the Greater Springfield Reliability Project within the next few months. This project, which was approved by Connecticut siting regulators in March, will provide significant reliability benefits to New England by addressing a key bottleneck in the Springfield, Massachusetts area. 
We also look forward to working with NSTAR to wrap up our negotiations with Hydro-Québec on a transmission services agreement for Northern Pass, our proposed new 1,200-megawatt connection between Québec and Southern New Hampshire. Once signed, that agreement will be presented to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for its approval. After completing the TSA, we will begin preparing our state and federal siting applications for the project. We continue to make progress and expect to sign the TSA later this quarter, begin the siting filings later this year and bring the line in the service in the second half of 2015.
From Transmission, I'd like to turn to Legislation. Connecticut Budget Bill initially called for the state to borrow about $950 million during the new fiscal year to bridge its budget gap and have those borrowings repaid through collections from the electric bills paid by CL&P, UI and the Connecticut Municipal Electric Company customers. Fortunately and somewhat surprising to many, the state ended the 2009 to '10 fiscal year with nearly a $400 million surplus. We expect about $250 million of that sum to be used to reduce the initially projected $950 million of borrowings. That, in turn, will reduce the amount that needs to be collected from our customers over the next eight years, with a competitive transition in energy conservation charges. Our regulators in the State Treasurer's Office will determine the exact amount to be collected, but we are hopeful that the budget surplus will result in a larger reduction in CL&P bills on January 1, 2011 than we had earlier anticipated.
Finally, I'd like to comment on our change in earnings guidance. You probably noticed that we raised and narrowed guidance in the earnings news release we issued last night. We now project consolidated earnings of between $1.95 and $2.05 per share in 2010. Now more than halfway through the year, we've experienced very hot weather, good performance from our Transmission segment and our Competitive businesses and concluded d our two largest distribution rate cases. 
Temperatures in the Hartford area had been at or above 90 degrees on 12 of the 31 days in July, compared with no days in the 90s in 2009. While weather-related sales increases have been partially offset by much higher storm activity than we experienced last year, we expect July electric sales will be well ahead of both last year and our initial projections.
Additionally, we are seeing some early evidence of economic stability in New England with weather-adjusted sales up in the second quarter, our uncollectibles expense in the regions jobless rate declining. David will discuss the details of our revised guidance and sales trends, but we are certainly pleased that from an operational and financial perspective, we are achieving the targets our customers and our investors deserve. Now let me turn the call over to Lee."
292525,109945328,72310,"Northeast Utilities, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-04-2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Chuck. I will begin by reviewing our operations performance. As you know, we have had recognized temperatures in the Northeast in the week after July 4. New England experienced peak electric loads we have not seen since August of 2006. On July",1376,"Thank you, Chuck. I will begin by reviewing our operations performance. As you know, we have had recognized temperatures in the Northeast in the week after July 4. New England experienced peak electric loads we have not seen since August of 2006. On July 6, the day after the long holiday weekend, New England's peak demand was estimated about 27,154 megawatts, fourth highest ever. During that period, our system held up well. Our New Hampshire generating plants performance was strong with nearly 100% availability during peak loads, and equipment-related issues were minimal. We have not yet seen sales data for July but we expect it to be robust, especially compared with the mild and wet July we experienced in 2009.
While our system has handled the heat well, we've had a number of severe storms this year which have impacted our operational and financial results. Over the first two quarters in 2010, we recorded more than $16 million in storm restoration costs, of which approximately 77% or $46 million had been deferred for future recovery or capitalized. The result in the approximately $14 million of pretax storm expense through June is more than double our budget of approximately $6 million for the same period. 
In the second quarter alone, we experienced more than $8 million in pretax storm expense across our three Electric Distribution companies, compared to $700,000 in the second quarter of 2009. Our transmission system is much less prone to storm damage, and it performed superbly including our new Southwest Connecticut lines handling very high loads along the Connecticut shoreline, despite the fact that the heat there was more intense than the inland areas. The loads we experienced underscore the need for Transmission capital investments we continue to make in our system. Through June 30, our Transmission capital expenditures were $113 million, and we project total Transmission expenditures of $257 million this year.
We continue to project overall NU capital spending of nearly $1.1 billion in 2010. About $35 million of this year's capital spending has been on the NEEWS family of projects, and we continue to make progress on our siting initiatives, particularly the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, which accounts for nearly half of our approximately $1.5 billion of projected expenditures on NEEWS. 
In Massachusetts, the state Energy Facilities Siting Board, or EFSB, held a number of public meetings in May and June to discuss the staff, key topics that were raised during evidentiary hearings earlier this year. We expect the positive outcome to this application and for the approval of the route to be consistent with configurations that were approved by Connecticut siting regulators in March. 
We anticipate receiving a draft decision from the EFSB in September and to receive a final decision shortly thereafter. If the vote is favorable, we expect to begin construction by the end of this year or early 2011 and to complete the GSRP project in 2013. We will update our cost estimate of the project once we fully understand all of the conditions that will be placed on construction.
Later this quarter, we also expect ISO New England to announce their updated needs assessment for the other two major NEEWS projects: the Interstate Reliability Project and the Central Connecticut Reliability Project. We expect to file state siting applications to build the Interstate Project in early 2011 or the project to be completed by the end of 2012 with Central Connecticut six to 12 months later. 
As you recall from earlier calls and presentations, there are more than $200 million of smaller projects related to NEEWS, some of which are moving forward today. About $50 million of those projects are approved and some of those are currently under construction. Like other major transmission owners across the country, we are closely monitoring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or NOPR, on transmission planning and cost allocation. We support the NOPR's endorsement of regional bottom-up planning in conclusion that the cost should be allocated based on who causes the cost and who benefits from the transmission. We believe that the New England Transmission planning and allocation model works very well and want to ensure that the proposals incorporated in the NOPR do not interfere with the regions planning and investment successes. We believe that the public policy aspect of the NOPR would support both the Northern Pass HVDC project to Québec and the potential of a win consortium in New England.
Our largest capital project currently under construction is the Clean Air Project which involves installing scrubber technology, help PSNH's Merrimack coal-fired station. Throughout the end of July, the project was about 67% complete, and we expect it to be completed by mid-2012. The project continues to be on schedule and under its $457 million budget. 
In Massachusetts, Western Mass Electric has begun construction on the first solar generation facility as part of its 6-megawatt solar program. Located on a brownfield site in Pittsfield, the $10 million facility will have approximately 1.8 megawatts of capacity and is one of the largest photovoltaic projects in New England. Construction began in May and the installation of more than 6,500 solar panels is underway. We expect the facility to be operational later this year. Western Mass Electric is currently authorized to invest approximately $60 million in solar projects by the end of 2012. Site assessments of our next projects are nearly complete, and preliminary findings indicate that the potential to install between 2.5 and 4 megawatts of capacity. These larger installations of solar projects offer economies of scale the more favorable pricing. This pricing dynamic provides WMECO customers the benefits of lower cost solar power that may enable the installation of additional capacity given the appropriate regulatory approvals.
Turning to our Gas Distribution business. In April, Yankee Gas commenced construction of a new $67 million project to build a 16-mile natural gas pipeline from our LNG plant in Waterbury, Connecticut to Wallingford, Connecticut. The first phase of this project costs approximately $60 million. It will provide a new interconnection to the greater Cheshire area which has significant pent-up demand for firm gas service that we cannot currently serve due to pipeline constraints. We expect this first phase to be completed by November 1.
The second phase will involve expanding the vaporization capacity of the Waterbury LNG facility and connecting the plant to Cheshire from the West, and that should be completed in November of 2011. We have spent nearly $8.2 million on the project through June, and it is currently on schedule and on budget. 
Turning to the Electric Distribution side, I would like to follow up on some comments by Chuck about the CL&P and PSNH rate case decisions. Both commissions approved our proposed distribution capital investment plans for the coming years, and Connecticut DPUC also approved some additions to CL&P's workforce, including 16 metering technicians, 11 additional customer service representatives and various support personnel, as well as a higher level of tree trimming expense than we initially proposed in the rate case. We believe both cases will allow us to maintain the recent improvement we have made in service reliability and make additional investments going forward in CL&P's and PSNH's distribution infrastructure.
In the Western Mass Electric rate case we filed last month, we proposed a multi-year capital investment recovery mechanism to ensure that we can recover on a reasonable timely basis, distribution capital investments that we need to make Western Mass Electric's service territory more reliable. This mechanism is important to us and is important for improved reliability as we go forward.
In the case, we proposed raising WMECO's annual distribution capital expenditures from $35 million annually to about $50 million annually. In our testimonial, we told the DPU that we need the additional expenditures to stem what would be otherwise a continued degradation of distribution service liability. Also in the case, we are seeking to recover over five years, the $13 million of remaining deferred expenses related to the December 2008 ice storm and several smaller storms. You may recall that in the PSNH rate case, the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission approved recovery of PSNH's more considerable ice storm expenses over seven years. And now I'd like to turn it over to Dave McHale."
292525,109945328,72310,"Northeast Utilities, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-04-2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thanks, Lee. I'll start by reviewing our financial performance in both the second quarter and the first half of 2010, finish with a more in-depth comments concerning our revised 2010 guidance and future earnings prospects. We earned $71.9 million or $0.41",3228,"Thanks, Lee. I'll start by reviewing our financial performance in both the second quarter and the first half of 2010, finish with a more in-depth comments concerning our revised 2010 guidance and future earnings prospects. We earned $71.9 million or $0.41 per share in the second quarter of this year compared with $82.9 million or $0.47 per share in the second quarter of 2009.
The decline in year-over-year earnings is primarily due to the fact that in the second quarter of 2009, we sold a number of routine tax matters with state and federal authorities and recorded after-tax gains of about $11.1 million or $0.06 per share. So absent the tax-related gains, our second quarter results this year were similar to last year. 
In the first half of 2010, we earned $158.2 million or $0.90 per share compared with $180.5 million or $1.07 per share in the first half of 2009. $0.09 of the $0.17 difference were related to gains from the settlement of routine tax matters in the first half of 2009.
Earnings in our Transmission segment totaled $41.9 million in the second quarter of '10 and $82.1 million in the first half 2010, compared with $41.8 million in the second quarter of '09 and $77.2 million in the first half of 2009. The growth in year-to-date earnings reflects the increased Transmission rate base on which we earned our FERC regulated returns. Rate base at June 30, 2010 is $2.64 billion, up about $125 million from June 30, 2009.
Transmission earnings growth, while still positive of course, is slower than it was in the years during which we were building our four Southwest Connecticut projects. But now that we are on the verge of receiving final siting approvals for the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, we are poised for accelerated growth over the coming quarters. 
Earnings in our Distribution and Generation businesses totaled $27.1 million in the second quarter of '10 and $75 million in the first half of 2010, compared with $38.2 million in the second quarter of '09 and $97.4 million in the first half of '09. Much of that decline was expected and is related to the 2010 tax matters I discussed earlier. I'll go through each of the regulated businesses in a little more detail.
CL&P's Distribution segment had the greatest decline since that was a segment that benefited the most in 2009 from the tax settlements. Distribution segment earned $8.4 million in the second quarter of the year and $22.7 million in the first half of this year, compared with $21.9 million in the second quarter of '09 and $43.6 million in the first half of '09. 
In addition to the tax items, the decline in the second quarter was due in part to the storm expense Lee mentioned earlier, it was also due to higher pension expense and municipal taxes. Over the past 12 months, CL&P's regulatory ROE was 5.4% but we expect that level to improve steadily over the next several quarters as a result of the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control's distribution rate case that was effective last month.
For calendar 2010, we expect CL&P's Distribution regulatory ROE to be between 7.5% and 8%. On June 30, the DPUC approved the distribution rate increase of $63.4 million that became effective July 1, 2010, and an incremental $38.5 million that will become effective July 1, 2011. The DPUC-approved CL&P's proposed capital structure of 49.2% common equity but maintains CL&P's authorized return of 9.4%. I should probably read in our 8-Ks, the DPUC initially denied CL&P's request to establish a $13.7 million regulatory asset related to a provision in the federal health legislation that eliminated the tax deductibility of subsidies companies received providing retirees healthcare, which would have required us to take a charge to earnings. On July 14th, CL&P filed for reconsideration of this finding and on July 28, the DPUC amended its order in our favor, granting the establishment of the regulatory asset. So there was no charge taken in the second quarter.
In the rate case decision, the DPUC agreed with our positions on several topics. It accepted our projected sales assumptions for 2010 and '11, approved CL&P's capital program, funded our reliability and maintenance program, as I mentioned earlier, approved our requested capital structure. But the decision also did not allow us to recover certain expenses we may not be able to offset. Costs such as a large portion of the incentive pay for non-officers and to a lesser degree, costs related to rental expense, employee benefits and pension. Also as a reminder, there are certain costs that we chose not to include in the rate case, such as executive incentive compensation, board-related expenses and portions of D&O insurance and 401(k) expenses, $12 million in total.
That said, we believe that CL&P will be in a position to earn in the 9% area over the next two years as long as we remain diligent on managing our costs and avoid a downturn in the economy. While that may fall short of the allowed 9.4 ROE, we think the case was concluded in a constructive manner and fairly balances the needs of shareholders and customers, particularly against the current economic backdrop. 
As part of this decision, the DPUC accepted our proposal to differ implementation of the rate increase on customer bills until January 1 of 2011. As a result, while from an earnings perspective, CL&P will benefit from the rate increases in mid-'10 and mid-2011 as I described earlier, the cash impact will be different. Customers will see only one distribution rate increase totaling about $110 million annually on January 1 of 2011. That increase should allow us to recover all the revenue due to us as a result of the two-rate increases between the beginning of '11 and the middle of '12. For customers still buying their energy from CL&P, that January '11 increase will be more than offset by declines in the transition and generation portions of the bill. So even with the distribution increase, most of our customers are likely to receive a reduction of their total bill in 2011, but the generation portion, which comprises well over half of the total bill, likely down at least 10%.
From CL&P, let's look at PSNH where we also included a distribution rate case at the end of June. On July 1, PSNH implemented a $45.5 million distribution rate increase as a result of the New Hampshire Public Utility Commission's approval of a settlement we had reached for the commission staff and the consumer advocate. As I described, that five-year settlement at length during our May conference call, I won't go into the details here again, but like CL&P, we believe that the rate case will allow PSNH's distribution earnings to recover significantly over the next 12 months. 
Going forward, we estimate that its combined Distribution and Generation ROE can achieve returns in a 9.5% to 10% range, supported by its 9.81 ROE for PSNH Generation business, and in ROE in a 9% area for Distribution only. As of June 30, the combined Distribution and Generation ROE was 7.7%. We expect to be close to the authorized levels for the full calendar year 2010. 
PSNH's Distribution and Generation segment earned $16.9 million in the second quarter of '10 and $28.1 million in the first half of 2010, compared with earnings of $11.9 million in the second quarter of '09 and $25.4 million in the first half of '09. The improvement in second quarter results was due primarily to a 4.6% increase in retail electric sales and the temporary distribution rate increase that took effect a year ago, partially offset by higher pension and other operating costs.
Western Mass Electric earned $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2010 and $5.2 million in the first half of 2010, compared with $3.8 million in the second quarter of '09 and $8.6 million in the first half of '09. The decline to date was due to higher storm restoration costs, employee benefit costs, interest expense and municipal property taxes and occurred despite a 7% increase in electric sales in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the same period last year. 
Let me go trailing 12-months. Distribution ROE was 6.6% and we now expect it to be about 5% for the full calendar year 2010. As a result of this weakening performance, WMECO filed with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities on July 16 for $28.4 million increase in distribution rates, effective February 1, 2011. We expect this to be WMECO's first fully litigated rate case in about 20 years. And we may go seeking revenue decoupling, consistent with DPU policy, as well as the distribution capital tracking mechanism. It's also seeking to recover deferred storm, restoration and hardship receivable costs. A link to the rate case filing is available on our Investor website.
Although second quarter earning was certainly not strong for our Electric Distribution businesses, it did benefit from hot weather in June. Retail sales were up 5.9% in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of '09. Importantly, they were up 1% on a weather-adjusted basis. That favorable performance offset a weak first quarter, so our overall retail electric sales are flat year-to-date compared with 2009. On a weather-adjusted basis, retail electric sales are off 0.8% for the first six months of the year, which is somewhat ahead of our sales forecast of negative 1% for the full year, and a significant improvement from the first quarter weather-adjusted sales which were down 2.5% from the first quarter of '09.
The quarterly weather-adjusted year-to-year increase in sales was the first we had seen in our service territory since 2007. In fact, weather-adjusted sales in the quarter were up for all three of our electric companies and among classes, residential was up 1.8%, commercial was up 0.4% and even industrial halted its long decline, although just breaking even with last year's numbers.
We have seen the regional economy move from recession to stabilization to perhaps now a glimmer of recovery. New Hampshire's economy certainly seems to be improving. The state's unemployment rate, we started the year at 7.7%, has dropped to 5.7%, well below the overall U.S. unemployment rate of 9.5%. While the service sectors in New Hampshire such as healthcare continue to hire, it is in the resurgence in manufacturing employment that has made the most difference over the past six months. New Hampshire added 900 manufacturing jobs in May. Weekly hours are up as our average hourly wages. The state is expected to add more than 10,000 jobs this year. 
Connecticut's economy also has shown signs of improvement in 2010. In June, Connecticut added jobs to its economy for the sixth consecutive month. So at a 500 gain, this is the smallest monthly increase since February of this year. June's gain makes for a total of 13,500 new jobs since December '09. Although the insurance industry continues to shed jobs, industrial production has been bolstered by government spending on aerospace and the recovery of the global economy, which has helped export-related activity recover quite nicely. The state's unemployment rate declined from its 9.8% peak in January to 8.8% in June.
One additional area where we are seeing progress across our system is in uncollectible write-offs. You may recall that rising uncollectible expense was a development that negatively affected our results in the second half of 2009. As expected this year, we are having more success in this area and uncollectible expense is running about $5 million better than planned. As a reminder, last year, we experienced $47 million in non-track uncollectible expense, and we budgeted it for a $12 million decline in 2010 to a level of $35 million. Our current run rate, absent a reversal in the economy, has it now targeting about $30 million in non-track expense. 
As you know, July was an extremely hot month in the Northeast, cooling degree days at Bradley Airport between Hartford and Springfield totaled 386 compared with 168 last year and an average of 274. That it certainly provided us with a running start for the third quarter.
Turning to our Natural Gas business. Yankee lost $500,000 in the second quarter of 2010 compared with a profit of $600,000 in the second quarter of '09. The warm April was clearly a factor. Yankee's firm natural gas sales were down 4.3% in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the same period of '09. Over the first six months of 2010, Yankee Gas earned $19 million compared with $19.8 million during the same period in 2009. The principal factor leading to that decline was a 3.7% decline in firm natural gas sales, driven by a much warmer heating season.
Aside from the weather, Yankee Gas continues to experience real sales growth, primarily as a result of conversion. On a weather-adjusted basis, Yankee Gas firm natural gas sales were up 5.1% during the first half of 2010 compared with the same period of '09. This continues the trend we have experienced in the past couple of years. In 2009, Yankee Gas' weather-adjusted sales were up 5% over 2008 levels. With a 20% to 30% price advantage, we continue to see strong interest among our customers in installing natural gas power equipment and converting away from heating oil and other fuels. Lee discussed the Waterbury-Wallingford line earlier, phasing that line into service and into rate base will be a primary factor, triggering the need for a Yankee Gas case next year.
Second quarter results at the Competitive businesses and Parent were in part with results in 2009. Our Competitive businesses earned $5.3 million in the second quarter of '10 compared to $5.5 million in the same quarter of 2009. Although the Competitive businesses continued their wind-down mode, they benefited from remaining energy contracts and their profitable electrical contracting business, E.S. Boulos. NU Parent recorded net after-tax expenses of $2.4 million in the second quarter of '10, about $200,000 less than $2.6 million incurred at the second quarter of '09. 
As Chuck noted last night, we raised our consolidated earnings guidance to $1.95 and $2.05 per share this year. I want to take a moment and expand on these five business segments.
First, given the success of our Competitive businesses so far this year, we see that segment earning at the very top of the original $0 to $0.05 range. Therefore, we revised guidance of $0.05 per share and see little volatility remaining in the business throughout the balance of the year. 
Second, given the successful execution of our Transmission capital plan this year and prospects over the balance of the year, we also see that segment earning at the very top of this original $0.90 to $0.95 range. Therefore, we revised guidance to $0.95 per share. And even though there are a small number of items that are not appropriately tracked to the transmission tariff, such as the nearly $1 million in healthcare reform-related charges we incurred in the first quarter of this year, we see manageable variation remaining over the balance of the year.
Third, we are holding steady on a projected net expense of $0.05 per share at our Parent and Other businesses. And lastly, we are left with the Distribution segment, where we started the year with a range of $0.95 to $1.05. This range reflected several substantial unknowns going into the year, including the PSNH rate case, yet to be filed PSNH -- CL&P rate case and the prospects for a weakening economy. 
We attribute the increase in guidance in this segment to $1 to $1.10 per share to the constructive resolution of the CL&P and PSNH rate cases, perhaps what is at least a stabilizing of the economy as demonstrated by the second quarter 2010's weather-adjusted sales and an improvement in uncollectible expenses trend. Of course, we also benefited from June's warm weather, and we know July sales will be very strong due to record temperatures. In addition, inflation remains at check. We are managing O&M quite effectively, interest rates remain low and our long-term debt issuance for the year has been completed at interest rate levels better than planned.
Looking at it another way, our revised consolidated guidance of $1.95 to $2.05 per share is quite a bit better than our trailing 12-month EPS of $1.75 per share. And there are number of factors that we believe will improve results, not only over the next two quarters but in 2011 as well. I already mentioned that CL&P and PSNH's distribution rate decision, electric sales and uncollectible trends, including the fact that we recorded significant charges in the third and fourth quarter of '09 associated with uncollectible expense at both Yankee and CL&P. 
But we see other growth catalysts as well, such as the Merrimack Clean Air Project at PSNH which, as it moves towards completion in 2012, would generate additional earnings to each quarter on its growing equity investment; with regulatory approval, the Greater Springfield Reliability Project will move into full construction in 2011, and we'll be booking our progressively larger FERC-regulated cash return of 12.89% on the equity we expect to invest in that project. We expect WMECO's distribution results to improve in 2011 should we receive reasonable rate treatment at the current case, and it's possible that Yankee Gas could have new rate in effect by midyear should we move forward with the 2011 rate case filing at that company. And of course, we will continue to manage our cost diligently in an effort to achieve our ROE targets and minimize cost to customers.
As in the past, we expect to provide you with specific 2011 earnings guidance during our customary breakfast presentation at the EEI Conference in November. But meanwhile, we will remain optimistic that our business can grow earnings at a 6% to 9% five-year compounded annual growth rate and simultaneously grow the dividend at a rate above what we think, on average, the industry will achieve, and consistent with our internal 50% dividend payout ratio target. 
Lastly, turning from earnings to cash flow in our balance sheet, net cash flows from operations after retirement of rate reduction bonds totaled $405.2 million through the first half of this year, somewhat ahead of where we were at this time last year. With the hot weather bolstering electric sales, we are now projecting cash flows after repayment of rate reduction bonds of about $700 million this year, up from the $650 million we have projected in May. 
Total debt represented about 56.3% of total capitalization at the end of June, below our general leverage target of 60%. As a result, we continue to see no equity issuances on the horizon until at least 2012. You may have noticed that in July, both Moody's and S&P completed their most recent reviews of NU and our subsidiaries. Our ratings and stable outlooks were affirmed. 
Also, over the next few months, we'll be working to renew our $900 million of credit lines. Our banks are quite comfortable with both our business outlook and results, and we expect a renewal for at least three years to be in place by October. In addition, we have no debt maturities or debt offerings between now and year end. Now let me turn the call back to Jeff."

This is somewhat an early hour. But we have a multi-faceted presentation for you today. We're trying to do a number of things, the first and probably, the foremost, of course, is Tom and I would like to spend a little more time talking about the merger. We had a lot of conversations since we announced it, but there are some questions that some of you have asked. We'll try to hit those head on. Today, but clearly, we'll both be around for a few days and give you the opportunity to talk to us privately, if you'd like.
The second thing is we both had our earnings release is out. You saw that the third quarter for both companies was very good. NU also increased its guidance for 2010. And so, we'll get this later on in the presentation. We'll have Dave Michael and Jim Judge talk a little bit about what for the quarter for each of our companies.
And for NU, I know a lot of you views this morning as a way to get updated on [indiscernible] of the major projects. So when Tom and I just finished talking about the merger and lease, we're going to spend some time give an update on the status of the capital expenditures around some of the major projects. So that's what we're going to try to accomplish today . Please ask questions as it had the opportunity ended like to get this discussion.
So if you go to Page 5. We've spent a lot of time talking to a lot of you privately, but this really is compelling combination. And I would tell you that I have not met anyone that hasn't had logically this makes sense. This strategic for the industrial logic its combination is compelling. We think it's going to be tremendously exciting new company at closure. We talked about closure being nine to 12 months away. You'll here Tom, being, a little bit optimistic about. I ,et's try to do it on the nine-month side. I think we can actually accomplish that, and I think that's where we should be headed. We have a significant transformation opportunity to Nu. We've talked to you about those over the last number of years, and we combined that we the balance strength that we have with NSTAR and the cash flow it allows us to really expand on those projects in a way that is more effective from a financial standpoint.
This new company is larger. It will be the 15th to the 17th largest utility in the country, depending on how you measure it. And it is more diverse and much better position to support the economic growth and renewables in New England. I think and you probably said this before, New England is an inflection point. They've got Reg E Requirements. They've got RPS requirements. And you play those out over the next few years, we need to do something to make that happen. I think there's no company who is going to be positioned in a way that it will be able to help make that happen for the benefit of not only our stockholders but for the benefit of the customers and for the region. This is clearly accretive to earnings in year one, and we think provides not only increased earnings and dividend potential but an enhanced total shareholder return. The service quality capabilities enhanced is the largest customer base in New England. You've seen a map many, many times that shows the low centers in New England, it's Boston, it's Connecticut. As the two companies have a significant portion of that New England population. 
And then a highly experienced and complementarity leadership team with a proven track record. You've heard us talk a lot about the similarities of these two companies. We've worked together for a number of years. Restoration, as we've had storms. [indiscernible] NSTAR send crews to our service territories. So we've worked together. We know how that work. And the Hydro-Québec project is just one more example and probably the most used example of the two companies working together. And I think as that proven track record showed, this then becomes the next logical step in that process.
If you go to the next slide. You've seen this before. We expect to close nine to 12 months New headquarters in both [indiscernible] and Boston. Tom will spend a little bit more time processing that [indiscernible]. NU will be the company's name, the consideration is 100% NU shares. The exchange ratio as you can see is 1.312. Shares for NU per NSTAR share is about $56.44. The dividend increase will be about a valid 20% increase for NU shareholder. And [indiscernible] per NSTAR shareholder, and  from a government stamp on, i will become the non-Executive Chairman at this point of closure. Some will be president and CEO. There will be 14 board members. Tom and I will be six independent the board.
So as you look at this, this truly is a merger of equals. And we think you'll see that from the government standpoint, from the management standpoint is about any perspective, this is just a valid balanced as an interesting [ph]  Base.
The benefit to the NU share of shareholders, approximately 20% dividend increase, when you calculate it today or when it calculated projected at the time of closer. The cash flow increased to eliminate the equity issuance. We talk to you from NU standpoint, by the fact that we expected to have about $300 million equity issuance in 2012. Essentially, that equity issuance goes away. And for the foreseeable future as well up at our five-year plan, we don't see any equity issuance in that plan.
Likely, credit upgrades, obviously, the benefit of reduction in debt issuance and lower interest rates, we think that will be helpful. Increased market liquidity, number of you have difficult time buying either us or NSTAR because of the size of the organization. So if we put this into together, the market liquidity obviously expense dramatically and gives you the opportunity to bike shares in a much lower company. Increased opportunities to reduce cost over time, and this is one of those things that you ask us a lot. And this is the form of many different kinds of questions, but it is basically [ph] of synergy. And if you could tell us exactly how much there is day one, day two and day three. That would be appreciated also.
But this merger is not predicated on synergies. It's predicated on providing growth to the region and being able in a way that neither one of us can, right now, answer questions and provide solutions for our customers. That ultimately will help the shareholders of this combined company.
Now clearly if we do that, there will be opportunities for improvement in the effectiveness of these organizations. There will be a change in the compensation, composition of some of our employees, but we would expect to handle most of that through voluntary attrition and through retirement. There will be best practices. They will benefit of putting these large systems that we use today. So there will be the ability to reduce cost over time, that will flow through the benefit of not only the customers but also through our shareholders and as I said earlier, the ability to achieve a higher earnings [indiscernible] interest rate.
We have talked to you about it being accretive, we probably didn't give you exact numbers on each of one of these. We're going to point out some of the things to take us from some of the 6% to 9% growth rate that we previously were to something toward the upper end of that 6% to 9% growth rate. Obviously, the additional shares are negative to that. But for that, we get NSTAR's earnings growth, which is significant. We get the avoidance of the equity issuance that we just talked about, lower financing costs, less current parent debt and the implementation of best practices. So as we look across the spectrum for the next few years, they were going to be many real benefit to this merger in a way that will allow us to increase our earnings and ultimately our dividends at a rate that was higher than we thought we could do before and certainly at a rate that's higher that even one of the stand-alone companies.
Let's take it back about, probably two or three years now. We had a conversation with one of this leading about the [indiscernible] standard and about Reg E and what we saw as the inability of Connecticut and the region to meet those standards, if something didn't happen. What ultimately came out of that is the Hydro-Québec project. And as you know, we've made significant progress on that, and This is probably the first time that we've been able to say, ""We actually signed that thing,"" as opposed to, ""Trust us, it's moving along well."" It's hard to know exactly what's the future is going to be like. And sometimes we look at the future in a static environment and we don't think that it is dynamic. Three years ago, we wouldn't have talked about Hydro-Québec. Now it is becoming a reality and it is a business model, it's a participant pay model that may be the kind of model that allows us to deal with some of these larger renewable issues in the future. 
This slide is simply something that we talked to you before we called it the consortium, it's really a group of four companies and NSTAR, United Illuminating, National Grid and ourself that are making progress on this project. It's not complete yet and there's still a lot of work to do, but it's untested [ph] conceptual stage. So as we look at the possibility of bringing onshore wind, typically in northern New Hampshire and in Maine, down into the low centers, this kind of project has a real possibility. 250 to 300 miles long, probably 1,600 megawatts, something around $1.5 billion in cost and a participant pay model that may allow us to bundle the generation and the transmission together and make that available to the load centers in the region. We'll talk to you more about this as it continues down the path. But this is a real project that we think we will be able to move forward, it's not in the five-year financial plans right now. But it is something, clearly, that we think this new company will be able to do in a way that's better than either one of our existing companies. 
And then the last side is the Northern Pass, the Hydro-Québec project. We own 75%, NSTAR own 25%. It's closing obviously. So the new company is online percent. 1,200-megawatt of transfer capability. We have announced that Southern terminus, which is Franklin New Hampshire, the northern part obviously is a Concept [ph] station in Québec. We gave you an update on the cost of that project, it's about $1.1 billion now. The TSA was signed on October 4, permitting process started on the 14th with the U.S. application for the DOE, PPAs under discussion and will probably be filing the project with FERC, not probably, we are filing the project probably the month of November.
So that project is moving along. I know you've had a number of questions. This is moving along, and we will get there and in fact, citing we'd is a big milestone. We've still a lot of work to do. We've got to the approvals, we've got to build it. But it's moving along. the thing quite nicely and it's really is the kind of project I think that you can be duplicated elsewhere. It's going to be easier for a company the size of this new company to do this kind of project, I think, that it would have been an our stand-alone basis. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Tom [ph]."

A summer cold I guess, 90 degrees today. But bear with me, and I'll try to make it through. The Hydro-Québec project is something that Chuck thought up many, many years ago, and it kind of shows the potential. I call it might dowry. He gave 25%,  and now he took it back. But here's a project that will reduce the cost of energy in the region, but yet will remove five times of the carbon of the infamous project. So it's really a project that most of the deal dramatically from a environmental perspective, but doesn't have an impact on our economy. In fact, it helps our economy. So it really is a good project. 
And speaking about an exciting project, how about this merger? I'd like to tell my employees that I've always been interested in an industry that consolidates. Unfortunately, regulators don't always agree with us the way you should do it. But this is the perfect deal at the right time for both companies. As Chuck said, the whole world of environment and economy have come together, and it needs strong players, not to smaller players, but large and strong players to help local governments and even national governments to figure out an economic and an environmental policy that make sense for our region and the country. So bringing these two companies together is just such an exciting opportunity for us. 
One of the things that, of course, all of our shareholders, Chuck and I spent the first three or four days running every one of our large shareholders just to get a reaction and tell them why we thought this was so exciting. And the reaction has been overwhelming, if you see the way our stock prices have traded for the first two weeks after the announcement. I think it's traded better than any deal that's been in our space for about the last five or 10 years. And we did work very, very hard to create something that was a merger of equals. In fact, I think I will be forever grateful that Chuck is entrusting his shareholders in my hands for some time after the close.
But for the NSTAR shareholders, we really do see an opportunity to use what we have built over the years which in my view [indiscernible] the balance sheet to instead of be a company that could financially accelerate its growth, be a company that could invest to accelerate its growth. So it's a perfect combination of using our balance sheet to get the kind of growth that will clearly outperform that industry. I think both companies have a great track record of the last few years of outperformance. I think this will ensure that we will outperform for some time to come. And that's important to me who has a lot of pride in what we've done for our shareholders.
Also, this large footprint. They're at one point in time where about six transmission projects, the Green Line that was going to come by sea, one is by sea, one is by land. We had all sorts of projects that we're trying to get this wind power in the north down into the low centers, and everyone of them wanted to land in Boston, where we have almost five million people. And so the combination of our load centers in our map and the Northeast Utilities expertise, you all have seen what they have been able to do with their Transmission business over the last few years, really puts us in a unique position to take advantage of it. As Chuck said, we're not exactly sure what's not going to the look like, but we do believe that when Lee comes up here and tells you about the Transmission business that there are things on top of that, that will evolve in the next few years.
One also of the most exciting things, and you'll see them in the slide in a minute, we really are balancing our risk. I really do believe we're creating a lower risk, higher growth opportunity for investors. We really are balancing our regulatory risks between Connecticut, the federal government, or FERC, and Massachusetts. And that balance should help us in the long run to really maintain a more consistent and constant earnings growth stream. So we're very excited about what this has in store for our shareholders. 
And speaking of record of delivering on our promises to our shareholders, both companies have a proud history. We've been on a roll. And most importantly, I think that this is going to let us continue that track record which is, again, the goal is to outperform the industry. 
The next slide of the show the balance in our regulated businesses. And I think I just love this slide because of the way it shows how we at NSTAR will be reducing the all-in-one. We've had a great industry in Massachusetts and we expect that to continue for some time. But to have this kind of balance, I think, does provide the kind of risk profile that will allow us to be very successful going forward.
We put together, Chuck and I, have worked diligently. I know many can't wait to get your hands on the proxy so you can see about our love story. He wasn't skating in Harvard or anything like that, but we did spend a lot of time together over the last four months. And one of the things that we really were concerned about is putting together the kind of team that would carry on this tradition, that would carry on those return numbers that we just showed a few minutes ago. So we have put a team together, a balanced team. We very excited about them. And you can see that we have three and three. Three from Northeast Utilities background, three from NSTAR background. And we look forward to working together to create the kind of company that every one of us is proud of.
The timeline, Chuck said I'm very optimistic in this. I've actually challenge my people to get it done in six months. But a lot of it depends on how the election goes tomorrow night as to how quickly we get this done. But there have been an incredible reaction to this transaction from our politicians, our regulators and all of you. It really has been well received, and it's going very well and people want to help us to get on with the game. They really want help us get through the process. There's a no one throwing road blocks. There's no one saying this is stupid. And so Chuck and his team spent a lot of time in Connecticut talking to the regulators. It's a one-state approval. Connecticut has said that they don't believe they have an enroll approval process so we have to go through Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. Essentially, that's the critical past 10, and essentially that's the critical path to this. And in Massachusetts, we have a no net harms bender don't average to go through any time rate process [ph]. In fact, our company is operating under a race freeze until 2013. So there is no need to talk about rate with respect to this filing. There's a lot of history, a lot of presidents before going through and approving mergers, and so we're just looking for a window when the DPU is not to busy. And we expect, as you can see here, to file probably in November, half hearings in January and then it's up to them as to how quickly they issue an order. And hopefully, that will be on the quicker side.
There's lots of reasons why -- and we at NSTAR enjoyed a higher multiple industry because many of you have looked at us as an investment opportunity, as I mentioned earlier, that's low-risk, high growth. Period the combination. But there are a lot of characteristics that are responsible for a company having a premier valuation. And I think the slides has just about every single one of those factors that allow companies to be treated differently or special. We seem to have created a company that has every single one of them, whether it's that significant growth prospect that talk had mentioned, whether it's the strong earnings and dividend growth prospects, whether it's the diversification of income that we now have that seem so balanced, the management team we put together. I think you could our track records. We care about shareholder returns. That's what drive us. That's what we have delivered for many, many years. And we can do it all with wonderful cash flow, very, very strong cash flow. We do not need to dilute these earnings going forward.
I'm told that when something is said at this conference, it becomes public information and you can use it. So I'm going to borrow something. I don't know if Steve Fleishman is here. But I heard him yesterday tell his investors that this is a stock that you all should own. And I honestly believe, I believe it's the best total return opportunity in this industry.
I'm going to leave it at that and introduce the great, Lee Olivier, our Chief Operating Officer to tell you how he's going to help us to invest all these great cash flow."

Because of the merger, but also because of the many accomplishments we've had the course of this in terms of our major capital programs. And all of our projects environmental aspects. But I don't think there's a company that's more for the environment, if not the for the last three years between the essentially for the most part shut down all of the major goals of coal-fired power plants that used to how to do it because of the reliability needs, the obviously the building of the scrubber that's created most of the CO2, not the CO2, but the nitrogen oxide and other pollutants in the air and of course, our solar program in Western Massachusetts, as well as this project we talked about. Really it's a major environment to last about region. So they're good for shareholders, good for customers and good for the environment.
The plans has about $6.6 billion of capital spend. That's up about $200 million over las year's plan. I'll go through that in the two sides. Of note, about Transmission makes up about half of that capital spend and then you'll see that the transmission CapEx continues to stay strong as we go forward. And as Chuck indicated, there is really no capital in here for any of the transmission that would be built around the consulting project, which could be up the range of a couple of billion dollars. But as he said, that's a real project. That is moving forward. We'll have more information on that later this year.
When you look at Transmission, we had great success with new project for the reliability segment in that project but. That was a project to talk about $714 million. It's now pegged at $795 million. That is a very, very good price we received approval, both in Connecticut and in Massachusetts. And we'll start construction of the first major substation of the people project in the December time frame. We're going to finish up the environmental comedian and tutoring over the winter. Full-blown capital construction of that project next year. So we have about a couple of hundred million dollars of CapEx spend next year. That takes a lot of the uncertainty around that project. We are also in this update to the overall cost of the project, the number of changes there. The project in the Central Connecticut portion of the project shifted out about a year. We'll give you updates on that as well. 
We're also happy with having rate certainty around the deployment of capital and that the company's and about a five-year settlement, rate case most of 2012 structured it a little bit more. But we have certainty around the capital deployment and the recovery of that capital. 
When we look at generation, the Merrimack scrubber project is really on schedule. It's on the budget. if you Remember, we said that project cost about $547 million. We now reported forecasted about our project to be $430 million. It was still finish on time, in the middle of 2012 but really just again, solid progress there as well.
And recently, we completed about 1.8 megawatts of solar at Western Mass Electric. We kind of turned the switch on that last year another 4.2 megawatts of solar is part of a $41 million capital plan that we've got previously approved by the Massachusetts BPU. So solar in place by the end of 2011, beginning 2012.
Gas, another rate great growth story. Our projects what are great pipeline project what about a $67 million project is almost half complete. It's right on schedule. It's under budget. That's a project that's going to take about two years to connect a lot of customers. We're able to ask customers interruptible customers. And you see a host of other investment opportunities in and around business in a fairly significant way. And then they put it together, with the NSTAR driven thousand gas, you've got a guess customer base and that's about 500,000 customers, so real growth opportunity. 
Today, covered most of the highlights, the siding decision that we did yet from both Massachusetts and Connecticut was on what exactly what they wanted. We had very few inconvenience in that project. You see great expectance in the local community and municipal official. [indiscernible] Now reforecasted that, that project to be about $430 million will still shareholders on time in the middle of 2012. But really, just again, solid progress there is well. And recently, we completed about 1.8 megawatts of solo at [indiscernible]. We kind of threw the switch on that last week, we're going start with about four-point team. Megawatts of solo is part of a $41 dollar factorial plan the we got previously approved by the Massachusetts BPU. employees [indiscernible] by the end of 2011, beginning of 2012. And you look at liquid gas another great love story. Our projects are wanted pipeline projects with about $67 million project is almost half complete. It's right on schedule, it's under budget. That's a project that's going to take about two years to connect a lot customers. Oil to gas conversion, interruptible deferring customers, and we see a host of other investment opportunities that grows our business and it's building significant way. And then when you put it together with NSTAR 400,000 gas customer, you've got a gas customer base with about 500,000 customers. So real growth opportunities.Very interveners in that project, you see a great acceptance in the local community and municipal official. Again, strike instruction in the December timeframe and the project will be complete in service in 2013.
Now in the appendix of the presentation is that slide that we always put in we'll update you on each of the three segments and again, the key milestones, so you can see exactly when those will take place. The Interstate Liability project also known, huge for that project earlier this year. We're going to have a meeting late this month we the New England Advisory Committee. We and our partners with the National Grid will present the overall Interstate Reliability project through the past committee and as National Grid has [indiscernible] that's over in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. And the result of that, we would expect shortly thereafter to see that go ahead from [ph], in which case, we will start deciding of the IRP project in the third quarter of 2011 for the project to be completed and in service by 2015.
So again, we're very, very positive with the escalated the possibility of project which you'll see in the next slide based upon just the fact that it's that shifted out essentially a year. And the Central Connecticut portion of the project is still under review by ISO, and is being reviewed again by prospects of a number of generators that could potentially retire. So those of you that follow New England, in particularly Connecticut, you know that many of the generators was was the exception of exception of the liquid generated. For the most part, don't run. Shut down of the forward capacity market pricing, and that continues to drop. That becomes an opportunity before. 2014 time frame before it goes away. We expect that there will be retirement and would expect also to evaluate those against the market and render a decision on the new date of the project. Now that's needed, it's just a matter of the timing of the date. We expect to get that by the end of the first quarter or beginning of the second quarter of next year. 
This next slide is kind of a busy slide, but what we wanted to do for you is kind of do the math for you and reconcile the cost of these projects. And as you remember, we've had this $1.49 billion cost of for final construction cost estimate and the title planning around selling, general and administrative expenses R&T, we escalated at to $795 million. As a result of the other two projects shifting about a year and some other projects allocated to that we escalated those costs. And we arrived in this bucket of $200 million of other news-related cost. And what we've down here is the disposition both inside of the slide. So the new cost of news goes to $1.518 billion. However, United Illuminating, and Connecticut, but I'm essentially about an 8.4% ownership of the assets that are inside of Connecticut. And that would be up to about $69 million. So when you do the math, subtract that from the $1.518 billion, you cannot come up with a new project cost of $1.449 billion without of the cash flows us you see them right now on that particular slide. So finally that $84 million on the bottom of the slide, it's been $84 million of projects that are approved, underway and in many cases some of been have done. The remaining $200 million is embedded into the other segments of the project.
Now Chuck talked about the Northern Pass projects. And we are extremely confident in getting this project done in terms of the projects that we have made with the TSA being signed, with file that TSA by the end of this month. With FERC, we expect to have somewhere around late January, early February. We have filed with the DOE for the presidential permit, which is a permit that you need to cross over into Canada. That permit just two things. Environmental impact of building the lines and then answers that would align process opens into another country, doesn't cause any undue security from the energy standpoint is to building the line. Some other key milestones. We will begin all of our engineering, life long lead time, conversion station in 2011. And start construction of the project in 2013 for completion in late 2013. The person later that project, Jim Muntz is our President of transmission project director for $1.2 billion middle project is that in that effort. All of the roll out we'll have so far with business leaders, government leaders in the various communities has been very, very positive. So this has been well accepted inside of New Hampshire. So we will continue to give you updates on this. 
If you look at the bottom of that slide, there's an asterisk around the cost of $1.1 billion. And that's really all part of the commitment that we have inside of the transmission services agreement to update the cost of the project within 45 days of signing of the TSA. So we will do that later this year. I'm not trying to signal that the project cost will go up or even change in any way. But if it does, obviously, enema to the way, we will advise you about the bid process. So solid year in terms of this project moving forward.
This next slide looks at our CapEx, and it's kind of the look at a cost that look forward, the spend about $2.8 billion, the spend going forward think it's about $2.8 billion. And again, as Chuck indicated, there really is no CapEx year for the consortium project. In terms of the CapEx here, that's going to be another additional $1 billion of CapEx to becoming in the very near future.
First of all, through the bucket moves by $1.5 billion there, we will spend about $230 million on news by the end of this year, with about $1.2 billion to go. The Northern Pass, the current NU share of that is $830 million in terms of what's we get into sighting and engineering. In the appendix, an update on the last bucket which is the $845 million. And also, a smaller project which is spread throughout the new state region and I think, projects as a reader system plan or they don't need to be inside the regional system plan. That's the confidence level of building that $845 million is very, very high. So that's kind of a look, the three-bucket look, very similar to what seems in the past. 
When you look at the electric distribution generation spend, the distribution has increased $437 million over the previous five-year term period. And many of the reason why it's increased is because this three-year is $217 million of AMI Smart Grid inside of Connecticut I can call are in his seat those who are in the 2014, 2015 time frames, the total of the project is nearly about $300 million dollars, about $296 million is estimated to be right now. But also includes $130 million more as part of the rate cases that we have either settled or concluded that CL&P and PSNH. And included in there is up to a total spend of $50 million should reduce rate case Mass Electric.
You have in the past $30 million a year, we propose to spend about $50 million $20 million more is a result of aging of a chore and upgrades needed. Now in regards to AMI, and the additional CapEx spend in Western Mass, to the extent that we do not see rates or revenue rates are recovery father, we will not make those expenditures. We're not going to make those recovery. The DPUC, that Connecticut DPUC SOA started a docket on AMI. The hearings in November, December of this year, and they will render a decision sometime idea the first quarter of 2011. As you remember, we have arbitrated for a full rollout of AMI for all 1.2 million customers because it has is the least cost approach to rolling out. We've taken the approach to go longer in terms of a rollout false starts or other U.S. initiatives on private security and operating protocols so that's right just a little bit longer.
We look at generation. Generation is down by about $214 million that's really for the most part to do with Merrimack. Concluded about $152 million $160 million in the Merrimack Scrubber. We forecast and the price of that again for $4.57 to $4.30. Frankly, we look forward to those units and we probably won't have to spend as much capital as we previously thought. That's $217 million difference there.
Gas, for the reasons I indicated before, we see a good growth story there. This five-year look includes by $104 million over the previous five-year look for a total spend of $585 million. And it's really centers around the four areas. One is running the base of business, the other is just conversion from a lot of customers, about 50% of the in Connecticut, a lot of opportunities for natural gas prices in the commodity now when we think it is for the first in the future, the conversions from other guest and also from interruptibles over the firm. We have the large backlog of customers that want to be connected commercial industrial customers. And so we have a number of projects that would build out supply lines to those areas. And we also have this thing called, which is the distribution management program come which is a federally required program to basically take out the old steel piping. So a spend really about on that. Rate base, $714 million, up to $1.1 billion by the end of the five-year planning period so that's about a 53% increase in rate case, so we really do believe that this company is very successfully.
So just for the sake of time, I'm going to curtail [ph] my presentation and turn it over to David McHale, who will take you through the financials."
292525,114943549,83936,"Northeast Utilities, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Lee, and good morning.

We've got third quarter earnings that were released on five, quarter were up 55%. Based on some of the structural trends that we're seeing for the year, we've also increased guidance. Remember, we started this year with a view of midpoint around $1.90 a share, midpoint [indiscernible] new guidance of $2.15. I'm going to talk a little bit of how that work it's way into 2011 as well. 
The cash flow story has always been important for us as a company. It really speaks the finance ability of our rate case plan because of bonus appreciation and a number of really key drivers this year, we're ahead of schedule. We accretively told you that we expect that FFO to climb by about $100 million a year. Couple of years from now, we'll be at over $1 billion of FFO compared to maybe two years ago when we were half that. Very, very strong asset of our overall plan. 
In the cornerstone of our stand-alone plan, is that rate case grow that we've gone through, marrying that with the NSTAR plan is going to a think-a-draft [ph] discompelling total return story  to just this compared to a link to return story that Chuck and Tom referred to earlier this morning. And I'm just going to summarize that for you. I won't go through all those details. But first with the quarter, because there's a couple of things that we want to point out that you see the numbers here and you're right, $105.5 million for earnings, driven surprisingly by the Distribution business. The Transition business, right on course, actually little bit ahead of schedule, September is about $2.6 billion, that's up about $140 million over last year. And once we get into this greater Springfield project, that'll drive 2011. But in terms of what's really happening behind the scenes, and it's to be expected that distribution business is [indiscernible] coming off, that is Joe business is now specifically coming off the TSA may those things earnings been driven. And of course, there's a weather effect here. But the to look at what's happening this year, its work to our views for both guidance and next year, really good progress around O&M management, our uncollectible expense going [ph]  around our relative expectation, whether it's about $10 million of earnings in this quarter and also the rate cases. If there's a soft spot and you've seen this, it's around sales. When we reported second quarter and we talked to you in August, we were seeing a little bit of optimism in terms of year-over-year growth. I think April was a good month. May was a good month. June was a little bit a low month, but we've seen some summer in July and August. Now the real sales, of course, are really up 6.5%.  But for the quarter, weather-normalized sales was at about 4.5%is to inform recent commercial and industrial. Now the good news is when we look at look at September alone, figure were the commercial sector. We see in Connecticut strong export driven, growth. We see an increase in average work week, but no question that were not getting the real growth that need that maybe we saw or maybe out some progress in the summer. We've did see employment soften and all that in Connecticut. So this is something that we'll look at. You know from our conversations the past and that some of our states like Connecticut and New Hampshire, 2/3 of our revenue, our revenue our distribution revenues is tied to the sixth component of rate structure. So while we don't call outright this top lands, we're collecing a lot of revenues through and the land customers charges. So our balance business model is not as sensitive as a unit sales growth and certainly even for so for 2011, we're not dependent on our recovery on the economy. It certainly helps but it's the overall vest to program, I think weather some of what we're seeing there.
When you look at the individual components, I will spend a great deal of time on this is a little bit different than our sales equation. They are as Lee suggested, seeing weather-normalized sales growth of about 6%. They had a very mild winter, so their real sales this year is off about 20%. But the real driver is here aren't at the rate cases that we're seeing in Connecticut and in New Hampshire in O&M. Now O&M in particular is driven by real productivity benefits that we're seeing, I don't think these are sort one-off occurrencies. I think you're going to see this as one of the rationales of why we're optimistic about 2010 and 2011. 
Uncollectible expense has been a great store within the story and for the uncollectible expense in the company, that is not track to our rate last year. It cost our company's $47 million hit bottom line. When we started this year, without they see an improvement. We have built into our plan about $35 million. Right now, we are trending more like $25 million. So good story there, and now will fall to the bottom line. And I think that also translates into 2011. For PSNH, it's that plus, it's good, HPPC growth coming up of the Merrimack project.
You've already seen this slide but I'm sure, a couple of things I really want to clarify here, I'm sure our complicated by showing you both GAAP and non-GAAP segmented. What's important is the asterisk. We are saying that our guidance this year can be $2.10 to $2.20 per share, that's both GAAP and non-GAAP. And what's happening behind the scenes here is that we have in this quarter, it's not reflected yet in our financial results, that level pass as a nonrecurring gain. You're good to see that in the quarter, $16 million, $0.09 a share. It's not going to happen next day. It's not going to happen in the future. We call that man recorded. The also begin as well as our partners to the transaction cost associated with the mother the quarter as well. Those are equal roughly and upsetting, $0.09 gain, $0.07 cost. And so that's why both on our GAAP and non-GAAP basis for me to get back to that $2.10 to $2.20. But when you think about the earnings capability of this company from what we are about those top line. One of the $1.20 for distribution and $1 for the transmission business. Those are little bit ahead of plan. Again why? This is our second time we got it higher. And some whether but it's the O&M. it's the uncollectibles comments a tax benefit that we would see that was on another company's overall effective tax rate.
Now what I don't have any of that we showed you last year's forward guidance. We have stopped short of selling it 2011 guidance, not because we are not content around 2011 but we are partnering with NSTAR, they would typically put out guidance with a complete the year and at the turn of the year their view of 2011, we're going to the the same. That said, we know where our consensus as comments roughly $2.20 for 2011, maybe $2.21 depending on how you account that out. We think that's conservative, in part because what I'm telling around is the structural trends that we see a O&M. We're not going to carry weather for web per share the way we're managing our business, including as Chuck addressed the projects that are now in place, so we think having our earnings for 2011, the rate was already sad very, very well. Greater Springfield is mid-2011 over $300 million rate base alone. The Merrimack Scrubber project, that is driving earnings go into 2011 for the full year of a case, a full year at PSNH rate case, As you know, we're in the middle of a Massachusetts rate case, so all those photos are priced well. Now on the margin there are things that we are starting pretty hard, sales, pension expense and the like. Consensus out there is good but I think it is conservative. When we report for the full year, we'll give you sort of line by line segment guidance for the take away is it's been a strong year for us, 2011 is going to be another very, very attractive you overall.
Now on the CapEx, I won't go through all, but just to summarize what Lee has position there. And we've got a little bit of a callout table by segment on the right $6.64 billion. These bars that you see were the year-by-year spending in 2011 through 2015, we have sort of two callers for you here, last year's plan model fine-tuned pretty well. And then just to summarize the overall program, the cornerstone of the stand-alone plan is this rate base of growth. It adds to another 9.2% overall CAGR. The underlying transmission growth is a double-digit CAGR 10.7%.
Because of the merger, were going to stop should've say what the stand-alone growth is. You know from our discussion and from Tom, highest end of 6% to 9%. Stop short talking about what our stand-alone dividend policy is, it was 50%, now our dividend policy going forward is to drive dividend growth consistent with earnings take. We're going to talk about the overall finance ability. More definition of what we're doing 2011. This program was delayed some debt financing, not a problem, we have great access to capital. Regulator are supportive of that, much of the overall approvals, state-by-state are in place. The one thing that of course is different, there's no equity required to get this plan done. That certainly is beneficial for the numbers overall. And it's all third-party transportation profile going forward. 
Now I'm going to pause there, and give my partner Jim Judge an opportunity to run through a few slides covering their quarter."

The three takeaways is that like you to walk away from my comments on these. First of all, and star track record this is actually utilities my guess is a lot of your more familiar with the NU store. This is an opportunity to give you some perspective on who the new partner is. The second take away is that we just finished yet another very strong quarter, estimates for the quarter now provide a little bit of color on these results.
The third message is really to tell you how very excited item about this strategic combination. And this is really a transaction that makes so much sense in many front. And what we have here is the best-in-class distribution operator coming together with the best-in-class distribution operator. was having is that -- which you tell it a coming together with a project-rich utility. What we have your way to top management teams coming together to may could even stronger one. And I often say that the best indication of what a management team is going to do to you in the futures take a look of their track record of the past. These are two companies that have outstanding record in terms of delivering results to shareholders.
Just when you thought you had seen enough Safe Harbor language, here's one more slide, my making some forward-looking statements and you should and can review any further disclosures in our reports to the SEC.
So those of you NSTAR, business philosophy that is very simple. We've alluded that if you give an excellent customer service, new customers will be happy, customers are happy that letters are happy and in the regulators are happy, financial success usually follows. So follow for several years, expanding on that customer service and reliability, is really a half-dozen key metrics that gauge the performance of a distribution utility: the number of outages, the length of outages, the call center performance, billing accuracy and timeliness, every single one of those measures is in the top quartile. Many of them in the top percent of the industry. So we have some excellent customer service, excellent customer service track record. In terms of customer satisfaction of the highest in the region. And an improved for four straight years. I'm very confident that would result philosophy the most companies will be able to do more.
From a regulatory standpoint, NSTAR has a very, very long street of rates elements, working effectively with our regulators and long-term settlement for the shareholders as well as the customers. In fact, we look at this as a core competency of our management team. We haven't had a litigated rate increase since 1986. That's 25 years. I see no reason why we can't continue this. Actually, that span of 25 years, it involved the six governors, five attorney generals, more than 20 CPC commissioners. So obviously, we've been able to sort of exercise of these goods in a number of different regulatory climates. Tom and I have been involved in every one of these negotiations and I'd speak for both of us have never been more confident about our ability to do yet another settlement in the back end of this rate deal that expires by the end of 2012.
Key element of the NSTAR earnings growth story has been our ability to improve productivity and control costs. You can see that spending in 2009 went down. That was all discretionary nature. These cuts are really customer service and reliability. One Wall Street analyst, who I think is actually here, wrote in the past that NSTAR's O&M discipline is as unmatched by any utility I can think the numbers support that.
Over the last many years, we have earnings growth is outperforming. In our second quarter report, we did upper end of our guidance range to $2.50. Like David mentioned, we exclude from this onetime items this year that you should note. We earned $1.03 in the sale of business in the second quarter. We just announced a settlement in the IRS covered seven years and if the quarter. And we will have some tax-related expenses in the fourth quarter.
As a result of solid earnings per share performance, we've been able to increase the dividend 7% last November the 12th year in a row in dividend our payout ratio continues to be conservative in the low 60s. And we feel very confident as David mentioned, we have the cost structure on a combined basis higher, earnings per share growth and will fuel or higher dividend growth in expected of growth to continue to track earnings going forward.
We are particularly proud of the job shareholders, as this graph shows our total shareholder return, has increased over the past 13 years. $1,000 invested in NSTAR is over $5,000 today. Actually updated for 2010 we've provide shareholders another 18% already this year, so I'm pretty confident we'll be 14 years now and counting. To that put us performance into perspective, utility and the country that has more than three consecutive years of positive total shareholder returns.
Also to put into perspective, we've done a little bit of research, you will find any company in an industry, manufacturing, high-tech, retail, banking that can match that track record of consistent total shareholder return increases year in, year out.
So our financial performance has been up the charts investments concerned with is the financial condition of their investment. And the slide you  know about NSTAR financial condition is number one in the industry with the highest credit rating to so very long record of providing great returns but also clearly, a very strong commitment to maintaining excellent credit quality. I think both of those values will continue within the new company.
An update on transmission. Obviously, Mass Utility is supposed to child a transmission development but I do want point out that NSTAR has doubled in its transmission rate case in the past five years. And we have projects in the queue that will allow us to double it again in the next five years. We have basically based on reliability and capability projects number of year. That's about $100 million a year on average. We are currently licensing a new 345-K new line over the canal, keep in. That's $120 million investment currently before the Energy Facilities Siting Board in Massachusetts. We expect spending will 2011 and '12. We expect that to be in service by year end '12.
We have a Boston said that reliability project, the 345-K. behavioral into the timeframe 2013 expected's construction. Also have. behavioral that we're stalling done in the Mid-Cape that basically will extend the benefit of the land that we have going over the canal. The bottom bullet there Northern Pass Chuck has covered the; Hydro-Québec project and a number of folks have talked about the potential of accessing that northern New England, the Consortium project.
Released earnings after the market closed Friday. Benefited from an 8% growth in sales that reflected the hot weather in the Boston area. In addition to the sales increase from the weather, we did pick up $0.02 from our annual PVR inflation adjustment created story rate settlement. The lower interest costs compared to a year ago. They gave us $0.03 and it gave just execute a share of the purchase of when you compare with last year's number, basically provided a $0.03 in earnings. Items are things that are in line with our guidance, increased O&M, increased property taxes associated with our capital spending or rate-based growth. Lastly, what it services business so in this quarter, the absence of earnings associated with that sell which is $0.02. 
I do want to take a minute to talk about income tax settlement that you see in the footnotes. It's a positive development. It resolved all outstanding tax issues that we have firm 2001 to 2007. What those free up is a tax refund of $135 million we expect to see by the end of the year.
That's really from my view. I'd now like to turn it back to Tom and Chuck for our closing messages and then obviously, questions will follow."

This is a somewhat early hour. But we have a multi-faceted presentation for you today. We're trying to do a number of things, the first and probably, the foremost, of course, is Tom and I would like to spend a little more time talking about the merger. We've had a lot of conversations since we announced it, but there are some questions that some of you have asked. We'll try to hit those head on today, but clearly, we'll both be around for a few days and give you the opportunity to talk to us privately, if you'd like.
The second thing is we both had our earnings releases out. You saw that the third quarter for both companies was very good. NU also increased its guidance for 2010. And so, we'll get this later on in the presentation. We'll have Dave McHale and Jim Muntz talk a little bit about the respective quarters for each of our companies.
And for NU, I know a lot of you view this morning as a way to get updated on [indiscernible] on some of our major projects. So when Tom and I get finished talking a little bit about the merger, Lee's going to spend some time giving you an update on the status and on the capital expenditures around some of the major projects. So that's what we're going to try to accomplish today. Please ask questions as you get the opportunity because we really would like to have this discussion.
So if you go to Page 5. We've spent a lot of time talking to a number of you privately, but this really is a compelling combination. And I would tell you that I have not met anyone that hasn't said, logically, this makes sense. This strategic for the industrial logic its [ph] combination is compelling. We think it's going to be a tremendously exciting new company at closure. We talked about closure being nine to 12 months away. You'll here Tom being a little bit optimistic about, let's try to do it in nine months. I think we can actually accomplish that, and I think that's where we should be headed. We have a significant transformation opportunity to Nu. We've talked to you about those over the last number of years, and we combine that we the balance, strength that we have with NSTAR and the cash flow, it allows us to really expand on those projects in a way that is more effective from a financial standpoint.
This new company is larger. It will be the 15th to the 17th largest utility in the country, depending on how you measure it. And it is more diverse and much better positioned to support the economic growth and renewables in New England. I think, and you have heard me say this before, New England is an inflection point. They've got Reg E requirements. They've got RPS requirements. And if you play those out over the next few years, we need to do something to make that happen. I think this new company is going to be positioned in a way that it will be able to help make that happen for the benefit of not only our stockholders but for the benefit of the customers and for the region. This is clearly accretive to earnings in year one, and we think provides not only increased earnings and dividend potential but an enhanced total shareholder return. The service quality capabilities are enhanced. It is the largest customer base in New England. You've seen the map many, many times that shows the low centers in New England. It's Boston, it's Connecticut. As the two companies have a significant portion of that New England population. 
And then a highly experienced and complementary leadership team with a proven track record. You've heard us talk a lot about the similarities of these two companies. We've worked together for a number of years. Restoration, as we've had storms. We’ve sent crews to NSTAR, NSTAR has sent crews to our service territories. So we've worked together. We know how that works. And the Hydro-Québec project is just one more example, and probably the most recent example, of the two companies working together. And I think as that proven track record showed, this then becomes the next logical step in that process.
If you go to the next slide. You've seen this before. We expect to close in nine to 12 months. Dual headquarters in both Hartford and Boston. Tom will spend a little bit more time talking about that. NU will be the company's name, the consideration is 100% NU shares. The exchange ratio, as you can see, is 1.312. Shares for NU per NSTAR share is split about $56.44 [ph]. The dividend increase will be about a 20% increase for NU shareholders. And [indiscernible] for NSTAR shareholders, and from a government standpoint, I will become the non-Executive Chairman at this point of closure. Tom will be president and CEO. There will be 14 board members. Tom and I will each be on the board, and there will be six independent members from each one of our existing companies.
So as you look at this, this truly is a merger of equals. And we think you'll see that from the government standpoint, from the management standpoint, from just about any perspective, this is just as balanced as an entity can be.
Specific benefits to NU shareholders, we’ve talked about approximately 20% dividend increase. That number’s about right. It can vary by two or three percentage points, whether you calculate it today or whether you calculate it on what you project it to be at the time of closer. The cash flow increased to eliminate the equity issuance. We talk to you from NU standpoint, about the fact that we expected to have about $300 million equity issuance in 2012. Essentially, that equity issuance goes away. And for the foreseeable future, as we look at our five-year plan, we don't see any equity issuance in that plan.
Likely credit upgrades, obviously, the benefit of reduction in debt issuance and lower interest rates, we think that will be helpful. Increased market liquidity, a number of you have difficult times buying either us or NSTAR because of the size of the organization. So if we put these two together, the market liquidity obviously expands dramatically and gives you the opportunity to buy shares in a much larger company. Increased opportunities to reduce cost over time, and this is one of those things that you ask us a lot. And this takes the form of many different kinds of questions, but it is basically [ph] of synergy. And if you could tell us exactly how much there is in day one, day two and day three, that would be appreciated also.
But this merger is not predicated on synergies. It's predicated on providing growth to the region and being able to, in a way that neither one of us can right now, answer questions and provide solutions for our customers. That ultimately will help the shareholders of this combined company.
Now clearly if we do that, there will be opportunities for improvement in the effectiveness of these organizations. There will be a change in the composition of some of our employees, but we would expect to handle most of that through voluntary attrition and through retirement. There will be best practices. There will benefits of putting these large systems that we have together. So there will be the ability to reduce cost over time, and that will flow to the benefit of not only the customers but also of our shareholders. And as I said earlier, the ability to achieve a higher earnings growth rate.
We have talked to you about it being accretive. We probably didn't give you the exact numbers on each of one of these. We're going to point out some of the things to take us from somewhere in the 6% to 9% growth rate that we previously were to something toward the upper end of that 6% to 9% growth rate. Obviously, the additional shares are negative to that. But for that, we get NSTAR's earnings growth, which is significant. We get the avoidance of the equity issuance that we just talked about, lower financing costs, less current parent debt and the implementation of best practices. So as we look across the spectrum for the next few years, there are going to be many real benefit to this merger in a way that will allow us to increase our earnings and ultimately our dividends at a rate that was higher than we thought we could do before and certainly at a rate that's higher that either one of the stand-alone companies.
Let's take it back about, probably two or three years now. We had a conversation with one of these leading about the [indiscernible] standard and about Reg E and about what we saw as the inability of Connecticut and the region to meet those standards if something didn't happen. What ultimately came out of that is the Hydro-Québec project. And as you know, we've made significant progress on that, and this is probably the first time that we've been able to say, ""We actually signed that thing,"" as opposed to, ""Trust us, it's moving along well."" It's hard to know exactly what the future is going to be like. And sometimes we look at the future in a static environment, and we don't think that it as dynamic. Three years ago, we wouldn't have talked about Hydro-Québec. Now it is becoming a reality, and it is a business model, it's a participant pay model that may be the kind of model that allows us to deal with some of these larger renewable issues in the future. 
This slide is simply something that we talked to you before. We called it the consortium. It's really a group of four companies, NSTAR, United Illuminating, National Grid and ourselves, that are making progress on this project. It's not complete yet, and there's still a lot of work to do, but it's gone past the conceptual stage. So as we look at the possibility of bringing onshore wind [ph], typically in northern New Hampshire and in Maine, down into the low centers, this kind of project has a real possibility. 250 to 300 miles long, probably 1,600 megawatts, something around $1.5 billion in cost and a participant pay model that may allow us to bundle the generation and the transmission together and make that available to the load centers in the region. We'll talk to you more about this as it continues down the path. But this is a real project that we think we will be able to move forward. It's not in the five-year financial plans right now. But it is something, clearly, that we think this new company will be able to do in a way that's better than either one of our existing companies. 
And then the last slide is the Northern Pass, or the Hydro-Québec project. We own 75%, NSTAR owns 25%. It's closing, obviously. So the new company just owns [ph] 100 percent. 1,200 megawatts of transfer capability. We have announced the Southern terminus [ph], which is Franklin, New Hampshire. The northern part, obviously, is a Concept [ph] station in Québec. We gave you an update on the cost of that project, it's about $1.1 billion now. The TSA was signed on October 4. The permitting process started on the 14th with the U.S. application for the DOE. PPAs are under discussion and we’ll probably be filing the project with FERC -- not probably, we will be filing the project with FERC this quarter, probably in the month of November.
So that project is moving along. I know you've had a number of questions, and we kept saying, “This is moving along, we will get there,” and, in fact, signing the TSA was a big milestone. We've still a lot of work to do. We've got to get all the approvals. Then we’ve got to get the [indiscernible] approved, we've got to build it. But it's moving along quite nicely, and it really is the kind of project, I think, that can be duplicated elsewhere. It's going to be easier for a company the size of this new company to do this kind of project, I think, than it would have been for us on a stand-alone basis. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Tom."

Good morning, everyone. I'm losing my voice. A summer cold, I guess, 90 degrees today, they’re saying. But bear with me, and I'll try to make it through. The Hydro-Québec project is something that Chuck thought up many, many years ago, and it kind of shows the potential. Laughing, we call it my dowry. He gave 25%, and now he took it back. But here's a project that will reduce the cost of energy in the region, but yet will remove five times the carbon of the infamous Cape Wind project. So it really is a project that moves the needle dramatically from an environmental perspective, but doesn't have a negative impact on our economy. In fact, it helps our economy. So it’s a really exciting project. 
And speaking about an exciting project, how about this merger? I like to tell my employees that I've always been interested in an industry that consolidates. Unfortunately, regulators don't always agree with us the way you should do it. But this is the perfect deal at the right time for both companies. As Chuck said, the whole world of environment and economy have come together, and it needs strong players, not two smaller players, but large and strong players, to help local governments and even national government to figure out an economic and an environmental policy that make sense for our region and the country. So bringing these two companies together is just such an exciting opportunity for us. 
One of the things that, of course, all of our shareholders, Chuck and I spent the first three or four days running every one of our large shareholders just to get a reaction and tell them why we thought this was so exciting. And the reaction has been overwhelming, if you see the way our stock prices have traded for the first two weeks after the announcement. I think it's traded better than any deal that's been in our space for about the last five or 10 years. And we did work very, very hard to create something that was a merger of equals. In fact, I think I will be forever grateful that Chuck is entrusting his shareholders in my hands for some time after the close.
But for the NSTAR shareholders, we really do see an opportunity to use what we have built over the years, which, in my view is [indiscernible] balance sheet to instead of be a company that could financially accelerate its growth, be a company that could invest to accelerate its growth. So it's a perfect combination of using our balance sheet to get the kind of growth that will clearly outperform that in the industry. I think both companies have a great track record of the last few years of outperformance. I think this will ensure that we will outperform for some time to come. And that's important to me, who has a lot of pride in what we've done for our shareholders.
Also, this large footprint. There at one point in time were about six transmission projects, the Green Line that was going to come by sea, one is by sea, one is by land. We had all sorts of projects that we're trying to get these wind power in the north down into the low centers, and every one of them wanted to land in Boston, where we have almost five million people. And so the combination of our load centers in our map and the Northeast Utilities expertise, you all have seen what they have been able to do with their Transmission business over the last few years, really puts us in a unique position to take advantage of it. As Chuck said, we're not exactly sure what's that’s going to the look like, but we do believe that when Lee comes up here and tells you about the Transmission business, that there are things on top of that, that will evolve in the next few years.
One also of the most exciting things, and you'll see it in the slide in a minute, we really are balancing our risk. I really do believe we're creating a lower risk, higher growth opportunity for investors. We really are balancing our regulatory risk between Connecticut, the federal government or FERC, and Massachusetts. And that balance should help us in the long run to really maintain a more consistent and constant earnings growth stream. So we're very excited about what this has in store for our shareholders. 
And speaking of record of delivering on our promises to our shareholders, both companies have a proud history. We've been on a roll. And most importantly, I think that this is going to let us continue that track record which, again, the goal is to outperform the industry. 
The next slide does show this balance in our regulated businesses. And I think that -- I just love this slide because of the way it shows how we at NSTAR will be reducing the all-in-one. We've had a great history in Massachusetts, and we expect that to continue for some time. But to have this kind of balance, I think, does provide the kind of risk profile that will allow us to be very successful going forward.
We put together, Chuck and I have worked diligently. I know many of you can't wait to get your hands on the proxy so you can see about our love story. He wasn't skating in Harvard or anything like that, but we did spend a lot of time together over the last four months. And one of the things that we really were concerned about is putting together the kind of team that would carry on the tradition, that would carry on those return numbers that we just showed a few minutes ago. So we have put a team together, a balanced team. We’re very excited about them. And you can see that we have three and three. Three from a Northeast Utilities background, three from NSTAR backgrounds. And we look forward to working together to create the kind of company that every one of us is proud of.
The timeline, Chuck said I'm very optimistic in this. I've actually challenged my people to get it done in six months. But it all depends on how the election goes tomorrow night as to how quickly we get this done. But there have been an incredible reaction to this transaction from our politicians, our regulators and all of you. It really has been well received, and it's going very well and people want to help us to get on with the game. They really want help us get through the process. There's no one throwing road blocks. There's no one saying this is stupid. And so Chuck and his team spent a lot of time in Connecticut talking to the regulators. It's a one-state approval. Connecticut has said that they don't believe they have any roll in the approval process, so we have to go through Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. Essentially, that's the critical path to this. And in Massachusetts, we have a no net harm standard, which means we don't have to go through any kind of rate process. In fact, our company is operating under a rate freeze until 2013. So there is no need to talk about rate with respect to this filing. There's lots of history, a lot of precedents for going through and approving mergers, and so we're just looking for a window when the DPU is not too busy. And we can expect, as you can see here, to file probably in November, have hearings in January and then it's up to them as to how quickly they issue an order. And hopefully, that will be on the quicker side.
There's lots of reasons why -- and we at NSTAR have enjoyed a higher multiple in the industry because many of you have looked at us as an investment opportunity, as I mentioned earlier, that's low-risk and high growth. A pretty good combination. But there are lots of characteristics that are responsible for a company having a premier valuation. And I think the slide has just about every single one of those factors that allow companies to be treated differently or special. We seem to have created a company that has every single one of them, whether it's that significant growth prospect that Chuck had mentioned, whether it's the strong earnings and dividend growth prospects, whether it's that diversification of income that we now have that seems so balanced, the management team we put together. I think you can our track records. We care about shareholder returns. That's what drives us. That's what we have delivered for many, many years. And we can do it all with a wonderful cash flow, very, very strong cash flow. We do not need to dilute these earnings going forward.
I'm told that when something is said at this conference, it becomes public information, and you can use it. So I'm going to borrow something. I don't know if Steve Fleishman is here. But I heard him yesterday tell his investors that this is a stock that you all should own. And I honestly believe it. I believe it's the best total return opportunity in this industry.
I'm going to leave it at that and introduce the great Lee Olivier, our Chief Operating Officer, to tell you how he's going to help us to invest all this great cash flow."

Because of the merger, but also because of the many accomplishments we've had the course of this past year in terms of our major capital programs. And all of our projects [indiscernible] environmental aspects of it [indiscernible]. But I don't think there's a company that's more for the environment, if not the for the last few years, between the [indiscernible] project, which essentially for the most part shut down all of the major oil, coal-fired power plants that used to how to do it [ph] because of the reliability, obviously the building of the scrubber that's created most of the CO2, not the CO2, but the nitrogen oxide and other pollutants in the air and of course, our solar program in Western Massachusetts, as well as this consortium project that we’re talking about. Really is a major initiative to improve the environment [indiscernible] of our region. So they're good for shareholders, good for customers and good for the environment.
The plans has about $6.6 billion of capital spend. That's up about $200 million over last year's plan. I'll go through that in a few sides. Of note, about Transmission, makes up about half of that capital spend and then you'll see that the transmission CapEx continues to stay strong as we go forward. And as Chuck indicated, there is really no capital in here for any of the transmission that would be built around the consortium project, which could be up in the range of a couple of billion dollars. But as he said, that's a real project. That is moving forward. We'll have more information on that later this year.
When you look at Transmission, we’ve had great success with specifically the new project for the reliability segment in that project. That was a project that we said would cost about $714 million. It's now pegged at $795 million. That is a very, very good price. We received approval, both in Connecticut and in Massachusetts. And we'll start construction on the first major substation of the people [ph] project in the December time frame. We're going to finish up the environmental committee and engineering over the winter. Then we’ll be into full-blown capital construction of that project [ph] lines next year. So we’ll have about a couple of hundred million dollars of CapEx spend next year. That takes a lot of the uncertainty around that project. We are also, in this meeting, we’ll update you on the overall cost of the news project. There’s been a number of changes there. The project [indiscernible] in the Central Connecticut portion of the project shifted out about a year. We'll give you updates on that as well. 
We also are happy with having rate certainty around the deployment of capital in the two big electric company's [indiscernible] about a five-year settlement, [indiscernible] we have a rate case of 2012 and we can probably stretch it a little bit more. But we have certainty around the capital deployment and the recovery of that capital. 
When we look at generation, the Merrimack Scrubber project is really on schedule. It's on the budget. If you remember, we said that project would cost about $547 million. We have now reforecasted that project to be about $430 million. It will still finish on time, in the middle of 2012, but really, just, again, solid progress there as well.
And recently, we completed about 1.8 megawatts of solar at Western Mass Electric. We kind of threw the switch on that last week. We’re going to start about another 4.2 megawatts of solar as part of a $41 million capital plan that we've got previously approved by the Massachusetts DPU. So we’ll have about 6 megawatts of solar in place by the end of 2011, beginning of 2012.
[indiscernible] Gas, another great growth story. Our project, one was the Waterbury pipeline project, about a $67 million project, is almost half complete. It's right on schedule. It's under budget. That's a project that's going to take about two years to connect a lot of customers. We're able to ask customers [ph] interruptible [ph] customers. And we’ve seen a host of other investment opportunities in and around business [ph] in a fairly significant way. And then they put it together with the NSTAR 300,000 driven thousand gas [ph], you've got a gas customer base that's about 500,000 customers, so real growth opportunities. 
[Indiscernible] we’ve kind of covered most of the highlights, the siding decision that we did yet from both Massachusetts and Connecticut was almost exactly what we wanted. We had very few interveners in that project. You see great expectance from the local community and municipal official. Again, start construction on the project in the December timeframe, and the project will be complete in service in 2013. 
Now in the appendix of the presentation is that slide that we always put in there that updates you on each of the three segments and the key milestones, so you can see exactly when those will take place. The Interstate Liability project [ph] [indiscernible] given it’s new for that project earlier this year. We're going to have a meeting late this month with the New England Advisory Committee, where we and our partners, which is National Grid, will present the overall Interstate Reliability project to the past [ph] committee and of course National Grid has [indiscernible] that's over in Rhode Island and in Massachusetts. And as a result of that, we would expect shortly thereafter to see that go ahead from ISO, in which case, we will start deciding of the IRP project [ph] in the third quarter of 2011 for the project to be completed and in service by 2015.
So again, we're very, very positive with the -- escalated the cost of that project which you'll see in the next slide, based upon just the fact that it's shifted out essentially a year. And the Central Connecticut portion of the project is still under review by ISO, and it’s being reviewed again by [ph] prospects of a number of generators that could potentially retire. So those of you that follow New England, in particularly Connecticut, you know that many of the generators there, with the exception of exception of the liquid generated, for the most part, don't run. They [indiscernible] shut down and the revenue proceeds are essentially all around the forward capacity market pricing, and that continues to drop. Every time [indiscernible] 2014 time frame, the floor goes away. We expect that there will be retirement and we would expect also to evaluate those against the market and render a decision on the new date of that project. Now they believe it’s needed, it's just a matter of the timing of the date. We expect to get that by the end of the first quarter or beginning of the second quarter of next year. 
This next slide is kind of a busy slide, but what we wanted to do for you is kind of do the math for you and reconcile the cost of these projects. And as you remember, we've had this $1.49 billion cost of news for some period of time, but as a result of having the final construction cost estimate and the final planning around selling, general and administrative expenses R&T, we escalated that to $795 million. As a result of the other two projects shifting about a year and some other projects allocated to that, we escalated those costs. And we arrived in this bucket of $200 million of other news-related cost. And what we've down here is disposition those inside of this slide. So the new cost of news goes to $1.518 billion. However, United Illuminating, our neighbor in Connecticut, will have essentially about an 8.4% ownership of the assets that are inside of Connecticut. And that would be up to about $69 million. So when you do the math, subtract that from the $1.518 billion, you come up with a new project cost of $1.449 billion with all of the cash flows as you see them right now on that particular slide. So finally, that $84 million on the bottom of the slide, it's been $84 million of projects that are approved, underway and in many cases, some of been have done. The remainder of that $200 million is embedded into the other segments of the project.
Now Chuck talked about the Northern Pass or the HBDC [ph] projects. And we are extremely confident in getting this project done in terms of the projects that we have made with the TSA being signed with HQ. We’ll file that TSA by the end of this month with FERC. We expect to have the order back somewhere around late January, early February. We have filed with the DOE for the presidential permit, which is a permit that you need to cross over into Canada. That permit just does two things because there’s an environmental impact of building the line. It ensures that would align process opens [ph] into another country, that it doesn't cause any undue security from the energy standpoint is to building the line. 
Some other key milestones. We will begin all of our engineering, life long lead time, [indiscernible] conversion station in 2011 and start construction of the project in 2013 for completion in late 2013. The person that is leading that project, Jim Muntz, is our President of transmission [indiscernible] project director for $1.2 billion middle [ph] project is leading that in that effort. All of the roll out that we’ve had so far with business leaders, government leaders in the various communities has been very, very, very positive. So this has been well accepted inside of New Hampshire. So we will continue to give you updates on this. 
If you look at the bottom of that slide, there's an asterisk around the cost of $1.1 billion. And that's really all part of a commitment that we have inside of the transmission services agreement to update the cost of the project within 45 days of signing of the TSA. So we will do that later this year. I'm not trying to signal that the project cost will go up or even change in any way. But if it does, obviously, in a material way, we will advise you of that through the HA [ph] process. So solid year in terms of this project moving forward.
This next slide looks at our CapEx, and it's kind of the look at the past and a look forward. You can see the spend has been up in the past about $2.8 billion, the spend going forward is about $2.8 billion. And again, as Chuck indicated, there really is no CapEx here for the consortium project. In terms of the CapEx here, that could be another additional $1 billion of CapEx that could be coming in the very near future.
First of all, through the bucket moves [ph] by $1.5 billion there, we will have spent about $230 million on news by the end of this year, with about $1.2 billion to go. The Northern Pass, the current NU share of that is $830 million and we will advise you of that in terms of -- once we get into sighting and engineering. In the appendix, an update on the last bucket which it was $845 million. And those are smaller projects, which is spread throughout the new state region and I think the good news there is that 90 percent of those projects either are already inside of the region system plan or they don't need to be inside the regional system plan. That shows that the confidence level of building that $845 million is very, very high. So that's kind of a look, the three-bucket look, very similar to what you’ve seen in the past. 
When you look at the electric distribution generation spend, the distribution has increased $437 million over the previous five-year term [ph] period. And many of the reason why it's increased is because this three-year is $217 million for the rollout of AMI Smart Grid inside of Connecticut Light and Power. And you see that those who are in the 2014, 2015 time frames, the total of the project is nearly about $300 million dollars, about $296 million is estimated to be right now. It also includes $130 million more as part of the rate cases that we have either settled or concluded at CL&P and PSNH. And included in there is up to a total spend of $50 million should we be successful in our rate case at Central Mass Electric.
You have in the past $30 million a year, we propose to spend a total of about $50 million, $20 million more is a result of aging infrastructure and upgrades that are needed. Now in regards to AMI and the additional CapEx spend in Western Mass, to the extent that we do not see rates or revenue recovery father, we will not make those expenditures. We're not going to make them unless we have adequate recovery. The DPUC, that Connecticut DPUC has already started a docket on AMI. The hearings in November, December of this year, and they will render a decision sometime by the end of the first quarter of 2011. As you remember, we have arbitrated for a full rollout of AMI for all 1.2 million customers because we think it’s the least cost approach to rolling out AMI. We've taken the approach to go longer in terms of a rollout because of the issues around U.S. initiatives [ph] on private security and operating protocols, so that's why [indiscernible] just a little bit longer.
We look at generation. Generation is down by about $214 million, that's really for the most part to do with Merrimack. We’ll have contributed [ph] about $150 million to $160 million this year on the Merrimack Scrubber. We reforecasted the price of that again from $4.57 to $4.30. Frankly, we look forward to those units and we probably won't have to spend as much capital as we previously thought. That's your $217 million difference there.
Liquid [ph] gas, for the reasons I indicated before, we see a good growth story there. This five-year look increases by $104 million over the previous five-year look for a total spend of $585 million. And it really centers around four areas. One is running the base of business, the other is just conversion from a lot of customers, about 50% [ph] of the heating in Connecticut is in oil, over 50 percent. A lot of opportunities for natural gas prices in the commodity now and where we think it’ll be for the foreseeable future, the conversions from other gas and also from interruptibles over the firm. We have a large backlog of customers that want to be connected, commercial industrial customers. And so we have a number of projects that would build out supply lines to those areas. And we also have this thing called [inaudible], which is the distribution management program [ph], which is a federally required program to basically take out the old bare steel and [inaudible] piping. So a spend really about [inaudible] on that. Rate base, $714 million, up to $1.1 billion by the end of the five-year planning period, so that's about a 53% increase in rate case [ph], so we really do believe that we can build this company very successfully.
So just for the sake of time, I'm going to curtail [ph] my presentation and turn it over to David McHale, who will take you through the financials."
292525,114943549,84048,"Northeast Utilities, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Lee, and good morning. I'm to go to speak for just a few moments on business as usual. But business as usual is pretty good these days. We've got third quarter earnings that were released on five, quarter earnings were up 55%. Based on some of",1790,"Thank you, Lee, and good morning. I'm to go to speak for just a few moments on business as usual. But business as usual is pretty good these days. We've got third quarter earnings that were released on five, quarter earnings were up 55%. Based on some of the structural trends that we're seeing for the year, we've also increased guidance. Remember, we started this year with a view of midpoint around $1.90 a share, midpoint for this new guidance is $2.15. I'm going to talk a little bit about how that works its way into 2011 as well. 
The cash flow story has always been important for us as a company. It really speaks to the finance-ability of our rate-base plan because of bonus appreciation and a number of really key drivers this year, we're ahead of schedule. We accretively told you that we expected FFO to climb by about $100 million a year. Couple of years from now, we'll be at over $1 billion of FFO compared to maybe two years ago when we were half that. Very, very strong asset of our overall plan. 
In the cornerstone of our stand-alone plan is that rate-based growth that we've gone through, marrying that with the NSTAR plan is going to, I think, address this compelling total return story that Chuck and Tom referred to earlier this morning. And I'm just going to summarize that for you. I won't go through all those details. But first, with the quarter, because there's a couple of things that we want to point out. You see the numbers here on your right, $100.5 million in the quarter for earnings, driven surprisingly by the Distribution business. The Transition business, right on course, actually a little bit ahead of schedule, September is about $2.6 billion, that's up about $140 million over last year. And once we get into this greater Springfield project, that'll drive 2011. But in terms of what's really happening behind the scenes, and it's to be expected, the distribution business is now, particularly coming off [indiscernible] you’re seeing those things earnings being driven. 
And of course, there's a weather effect here. But the to look at what's happening this year, and it’s going work to into our views for both guidance and next year, really good progress around O&M management, extraordinarily good progress around our uncollectible expense relative to expectation, whether it's about $10 million of earnings in this quarter and also the rate cases. If there's a soft spot, and you've seen this, it's around sales. When we reported second quarter and we talked to you in August, we were seeing a little bit of optimism in terms of year-over-year growth. I think April was a good month. May was a good month. June was a little bit a low month, but we've seen some summer doldrums in July and August. Now the real sales, of course, are up 6.5%. But for the quarter, weather-normalized sales were down at about 4.4% and we seemed to re-hit [ph] industrial and commercial. 
Now the good news is, when we look at look at September alone, [indiscernible] with the commercial sector, we see in Connecticut strong export-driven growth. We see an increase in average work week, but no question that we’re not getting the real growth that maybe we saw or maybe held some promise in the summer. We've even seen employment in the region soften a little bit, particularly in Connecticut. So this is something that we'll look at. Now you know from our conversations in the past that some of our states like Connecticut and New Hampshire, 2/3 of our revenue, our distribution revenue, is tied to the fixed component of our rate structure. So while we don't call it outright decoupling, we're collecting a lot of revenues through customer charges and demand charges. So our balance business model is not as sensitive as a unit sales growth, and certainly even for so for 2011, we're not dependent on a recovery in the economy. It certainly helps, but the overall investment to program, I think, weathers some of what we're seeing there.
When you look at these individual components, I won’t spend a great deal of time on this. Yankee Gas [ph] is a little bit different in terms of their sales equation. They are, as Lee suggested, seeing weather-normalized sales growth of about 6%. They had a very mild winter, so their real sales this year is off about 20%. But the real drivers here are, again, the rate cases that we're seeing in Connecticut and in New Hampshire in O&M. Now O&M in particular is driven by real productivity benefits that we're seeing. I don't think these are sort of one-off occurrences. I think you're going to see this as one of the rationales of why we're optimistic about 2010 and 2011. 
Uncollectible expense has been a great story within the story. For the uncollectible expense in the company that is not tracked through our rate, last year, it cost our company's $47 million pretax to hit bottom line. When we started this year, we thought we’d see an improvement. We had built into our plan about $35 million. Right now, we are trending more like $25 million. So good story there, and that will fall right to the bottom line. And I think that also translates into 2011. For PSNH, it's that plus, it's good, HPPC [ph] growth coming out of the Merrimack project.
You've already seen this exhibit, I'm sure. A couple of things I really want to clarify here, I'm sure over-complicated this exhibit by showing you both GAAP and non-GAAP that I mentioned. What's important is the asterisk. We are saying that our guidance this year can be $2.10 to $2.20 per share, that's both GAAP and non-GAAP. And what's happening behind the scenes here is that we have, in this quarter, it's not reflected yet in our financial results, resolved an [indiscernible] tax item that is going to produce what we’re referring to as a nonrecurring gain. You're going to see that in the quarter. It’s worth about $16 million, $0.09 a share. It's not going to happen next year. It's not going to happen in the future. We call that non-recurring. 
We also are going to begin, as well as our partners, to the [ph] transaction cost associated with the merger here in the quarter as well. Those are equal roughly and offsetting, $0.09 gain, $0.07 cost. And so that's why both on a GAAP and non-GAAP, we get back to that $2.10 to $2.20. But when you think about the earnings capability of this company from what we are about those top line. One of the $1.20 for distribution and $1 for the transmission business. Those are little bit ahead of plan. Again, why are they ahead of plan? And plan, by the way, was updated in August. So this is our second time we’ve guided higher. It’s [indiscernible] for sure, but it's the O&M. It's the uncollectibles. It’s the tax benefits that we’ve received as we’re driving down the company's overall effective tax rate.
Now what I don't have on here, that we would’ve showed you last year, is forward guidance. We have stopped short of showing you 2011 guidance, not because we are not confident around 2011, but because we are partnering with NSTAR. They would typically put out guidance when they complete the year and at the turn of the year show you their view of 2011. We're going to do the same. That said, we know where our consensus is, roughly about $2.20 for 2011, maybe $2.21 depending on how you count that out. We think that's conservative, in part because what I'm telling around the structural trends that we see at O&M. We're not going to carry weather forward for sure, but the way that we're managing our business, including, as Lee suggested, all the projects that are now in place. 
So if you think of what’s driving our earnings for 2011, the year was already set off very, very well. Greater Springfield is driving earnings. By the time we finish 2011, that will be over $300 million in rate base alone. The Merrimack Scrubber project, that is driving earnings going into 2011 for the full year of a case, a full year at PSNH rate case. As you know, we're in the middle of a Massachusetts rate case, so all those fundamentals I think, are poised well. Now on the margins, there are things that we are studying pretty hard: sales, pension expense and the like. But I think that’s already dealt in some of my views. So the consensus out there is good, but I think it is conservative. When we report for the full year, we'll give you sort of line by line segment guidance for the take away is. It's been a strong year for us, 2011 is going to be another very, very attractive you overall.
Now on the CapEx, I won't go through all this, but just to summarize what Lee has positioned there. And we've got a little bit of a callout table by segment on the right $6.64 billion. These bars that you see were the year-by-year spending in 2011 through 2015, we have sort of superimposed for you here last year's plan so you can get your model fine-tuned pretty well. And then just to summarize the overall program, again, the cornerstone of the stand-alone plan is this rate-based growth. It adds to another 9.2% overall CAGR. The underlying transmission growth is a double-digit CAGR 10.7%.
Because of the merger, we’re going to stop short of saying what the stand-alone growth is. You know from our discussion and from Tom, and Chuck this morning, we’re at that highest end of 6% to 9%. We are going to stop short of talking about what our stand-alone dividend policy is. It was 50%, now our dividend policy going forward is to drive dividend growth consistent with earnings. We're going to stop short of talking about the overall finance ability. We’re going to give you more definition of what we're doing in 2011. This program will still need some debt financing. Not a problem, we have great access to capital. Regulators are supportive of that. Much of the overall approvals, state-by-state are in place. The one thing that of course is different, there is no equity required to get this plan done. That certainly is beneficial for the numbers overall. And it's also [indiscernible] cash flow profile going forward. 
Now I'm going to pause there and give my partner Jim Judge an opportunity to run through a few slides covering their quarter."

And the three takeaways that I’d like you to walk away from my comments are this. First of all, NSTAR has an outstanding track record. I realize this is actually the utilities [ph] My guess is a lot of you are familiar with the NU story. This is an opportunity to give you some perspective on who the new partner is. The second takeaway is that we just finished yet another very strong quarter, estimates for the quarter, and I’ll provide a little bit of color on these results.
The third message is really to tell you how very excited I am about this strategic combination. And this is really a transaction that makes so much sense on many fronts. What you have here is the best-in-class transmission planer and operator coming together with the best-in-class distribution operator. What you have here is a cash-rich utility coming together with a project-rich utility. What you have here are two top-flight management teams coming together to make an even stronger one. And I often say that the best indication of what a management team is going to do for you in the future is take a look of their track record, their past. These are two companies that have outstanding record in terms of delivering results to shareholders.
Just when you thought you had seen enough Safe Harbor language, here's one more slide. My lawyers, too, wanted me to remind you that we’ll be making some forward-looking statements, and you should and can review any further disclosures in our reports to the SEC.
For those of you who [indiscernible] NSTAR, business philosophy that is actually very simple. We believe that if you deliver excellent customer service, your customers will be happy, customers are happy, your regulators are happy, and when the regulators are happy, financial success usually follows. The model that we’ve followed for several years, expanding on that very first [indiscernible] about customer service and reliability, is really a half-dozen key metrics that gauge the performance of a distribution utility: the number of outages, the length of outages, the call center performance, billing accuracy and timeliness, every single one of those measures is in the top quartile. Many of them in the top percent of the industry. So we have some excellent customer service, excellent customer service track record. It’s no wonder that our JD Power scores, in terms of customer satisfaction, are the highest in the region. And have improved for four straight years. I'm very confident that with this philosophy, [indiscernible] company will be able to do even more.
From a regulatory standpoint, NSTAR has a very, very long history of rate settlements, working effectively with our regulators and long-term settlements in a win for the shareholders as well as the customers. In fact, we look at this as a core competency of our management team. We haven't had a litigated rate increase since 1986. That's 25 years. I see no reason why we can't continue this. Actually, that span of 25 years, it involves six governors, five attorney generals, more than 20 CPC commissioners. So obviously, we've been able to sort of exercise these skills in a number of different regulatory climates. Tom and I have been involved in every one of these negotiations, and I think I'd speak for both of us when I say we have never been more confident about our ability to do yet another settlement in the back end of this rate deal that expires at the end of 2012.
Key element of the NSTAR earnings growth story has been our ability to improve productivity and control costs. You can see that spending in 2009 went down. That was all discretionary nature. These cuts are really never at the expense of customer service and reliability. One Wall Street analyst, who I think is actually here, wrote in the past that “NSTAR's O&M discipline is as unmatched by any utility I can think of,” and the numbers support that.
Over the last many years, we have – our earnings growth is outperforming Philly [ph] peers. In our second quarter report, we did increase the upper end of our guidance range to $2.50. Like David mentioned, we like to exclude from this onetime items. We actually had three onetime items this year that I should note. We earned $1.03 on the sale of [indiscernible] business in the second quarter. We just announced a settlement with the IRS that covered seven years and in the [ph] quarter. And we will have some tax-related expenses in the fourth quarter.
As a result of solid earnings performance, we've been able to increase the dividend 7% last November, the 12th year in a row that we’ve increased the dividend. Our payout ratio continues to be conservative in the low 60s. And we feel very confident, as David mentioned, we have the prospects of, on a combined basis, higher earnings per share growth that will fuel higher dividend growth, and we expected dividend growth to continue to track earnings going forward.
We are particularly proud of the job we’ve done for our shareholders. As this graph shows, our total shareholder return has increased steadily over the past 13 years. $1,000 invested in NSTAR at the start of the period is worth over $5,000 today. Actually, updated for 2010, we've provide shareholders another 18% already this year, so I'm pretty confident we'll be able to say 14 years now and counting. To put that performance in perspective, you won’t be able to find another utility in the country that has more than three consecutive years of positive total shareholder returns.
Also to put it into perspective, we've done a little bit of research, you will find any company in an industry, manufacturing, high-tech, retail, banking, that can match that track record of consistent total shareholder return increases year in, year out.
So while our financial performance has been off the charts, one thing investments are also concerned with is the financial condition of their investment. And this slide says all you need to know about NSTAR. Our financial condition is number one in the industry with the highest credit rating. So a very long record of providing great returns, but also, clearly, a very strong commitment to maintaining excellent credit quality. I think both of those values will continue within the new company.
An update on transmission. Obviously, Mass [ph] Utility is the poster child of transmission development, but I do want point out that NSTAR has doubled its transmission rate base in the past five years. And we have projects in the queue that will allow us to double it again in the next five years. We have basically based [ph] on reliability and capability projects number of year. That's about $100 million a year on average. We are currently licensing a new 345-kV new line over the canal. That's $120 million investment currently before the Energy Facilities Siting Board in Massachusetts. We expect spending will occur in 2011 and '12. We expect that to be in service by year end '12.
Our next two projects, relatively new, we have a circuit reliability project, the 345-kV line into the timeframe 2014, ’15 is expected construction. We also have 115-kV line that we're stalling down in the Mid-Cape that basically will extend the benefit of the line that we have going over the canal. The bottom of bullet [ph] there Northern Pass, Chuck has covered the; Hydro-Québec project, and a number of folks have talked about the potential of accessing that northern New England, the consortium project.
We did just have a great quarter. Released earnings after the market closed Friday. We still have benefited from an 8% growth in sales that reflected the hot weather in the Boston area. In addition to the sales increase from the weather, we did pick up $0.02 from our annual PVR inflation adjustment related to our rate settlement. The lower interest costs compared to a year ago. They gave us $0.03, and we did just execute a share repurchase that, when you compare with last year's numbers, basically provided a $0.03 in earnings. Offsetting those items are items that are in line with our guidance, increased O&M, increased property taxes associated with our capital spending or rate-based growth. Lastly, we did sell the [indiscernible] business, so in this quarter, the absence of earnings associated with that [indiscernible] sale, which is $0.02. 
I do want to take a minute to talk about income tax settlement that you see in the footnotes. It's a positive development. It resolves all outstanding tax issues that we have from 2001 to 2007. What it does free up is a tax refund of $135 million we expect to receive by the end of the year.
That's really it for my overview. I'd now like to turn it back to Tom and Chuck for our closing messages and then, obviously, questions will follow."

So when Tom and I get finished talking a little bit about the merger, Lee's going to spend some time giving you an update on the status and on the capital expenditures around some of the major projects. So that's what we're going to try to accomplish today. Please ask questions as you get the opportunity because we really would like to have this discussion.
So if you go to Page 5. We've spent a lot of time talking to a number of you privately, but this really is a compelling combination. And I would tell you that I have not met anyone that hasn't said, logically, this makes sense. This strategic for the industrial logic its [ph] combination is compelling. We think it's going to be a tremendously exciting new company at closure. We talked about closure being nine to 12 months away. You'll here Tom being a little bit optimistic about, let's try to do it in nine months. I think we can actually accomplish that, and I think that's where we should be headed. We have a significant transformation opportunity to Nu. We've talked to you about those over the last number of years, and we combine that we the balance, strength that we have with NSTAR and the cash flow, it allows us to really expand on those projects in a way that is more effective from a financial standpoint.
This new company is larger. It will be the 15th to the 17th largest utility in the country, depending on how you measure it. And it is more diverse and much better positioned to support the economic growth and renewables in New England. I think, and you have heard me say this before, New England is an inflection point. They've got Reg E requirements. They've got RPS requirements. And if you play those out over the next few years, we need to do something to make that happen. I think this new company is going to be positioned in a way that it will be able to help make that happen for the benefit of not only our stockholders but for the benefit of the customers and for the region. This is clearly accretive to earnings in year one, and we think provides not only increased earnings and dividend potential but an enhanced total shareholder return. The service quality capabilities are enhanced. It is the largest customer base in New England. You've seen the map many, many times that shows the low centers in New England. It's Boston, it's Connecticut. As the two companies have a significant portion of that New England population. 
And then a highly experienced and complementary leadership team with a proven track record. You've heard us talk a lot about the similarities of these two companies. We've worked together for a number of years. Restoration, as we've had storms. We’ve sent crews to NSTAR, NSTAR has sent crews to our service territories. So we've worked together. We know how that works. And the Hydro-Québec project is just one more example, and probably the most recent example, of the two companies working together. And I think as that proven track record showed, this then becomes the next logical step in that process.
If you go to the next slide. You've seen this before. We expect to close in nine to 12 months. Dual headquarters in both Hartford and Boston. Tom will spend a little bit more time talking about that. NU will be the company's name, the consideration is 100% NU shares. The exchange ratio, as you can see, is 1.312. Shares for NU per NSTAR share is split about $56.44 [ph]. The dividend increase will be about a 20% increase for NU shareholders. And [indiscernible] for NSTAR shareholders, and from a government standpoint, I will become the non-Executive Chairman at this point of closure. Tom will be president and CEO. There will be 14 board members. Tom and I will each be on the board, and there will be six independent members from each one of our existing companies.
So as you look at this, this truly is a merger of equals. And we think you'll see that from the government standpoint, from the management standpoint, from just about any perspective, this is just as balanced as an entity can be.
Specific benefits to NU shareholders, we’ve talked about approximately 20% dividend increase. That number’s about right. It can vary by two or three percentage points, whether you calculate it today or whether you calculate it on what you project it to be at the time of closer. The cash flow increased to eliminate the equity issuance. We talk to you from NU standpoint, about the fact that we expected to have about $300 million equity issuance in 2012. Essentially, that equity issuance goes away. And for the foreseeable future, as we look at our five-year plan, we don't see any equity issuance in that plan.
Likely credit upgrades, obviously, the benefit of reduction in debt issuance and lower interest rates, we think that will be helpful. Increased market liquidity, a number of you have difficult times buying either us or NSTAR because of the size of the organization. So if we put these two together, the market liquidity obviously expands dramatically and gives you the opportunity to buy shares in a much larger company. Increased opportunities to reduce cost over time, and this is one of those things that you ask us a lot. And this takes the form of many different kinds of questions, but it is basically [ph] of synergy. And if you could tell us exactly how much there is in day one, day two and day three, that would be appreciated also.
But this merger is not predicated on synergies. It's predicated on providing growth to the region and being able to, in a way that neither one of us can right now, answer questions and provide solutions for our customers. That ultimately will help the shareholders of this combined company.
Now clearly if we do that, there will be opportunities for improvement in the effectiveness of these organizations. There will be a change in the composition of some of our employees, but we would expect to handle most of that through voluntary attrition and through retirement. There will be best practices. There will benefits of putting these large systems that we have together. So there will be the ability to reduce cost over time, and that will flow to the benefit of not only the customers but also of our shareholders. And as I said earlier, the ability to achieve a higher earnings growth rate.
We have talked to you about it being accretive. We probably didn't give you the exact numbers on each of one of these. We're going to point out some of the things to take us from somewhere in the 6% to 9% growth rate that we previously were to something toward the upper end of that 6% to 9% growth rate. Obviously, the additional shares are negative to that. But for that, we get NSTAR's earnings growth, which is significant. We get the avoidance of the equity issuance that we just talked about, lower financing costs, less current parent debt and the implementation of best practices. So as we look across the spectrum for the next few years, there are going to be many real benefit to this merger in a way that will allow us to increase our earnings and ultimately our dividends at a rate that was higher than we thought we could do before and certainly at a rate that's higher that either one of the stand-alone companies.
Let's take it back about, probably two or three years now. We had a conversation with one of these leading about the [indiscernible] standard and about Reg E and about what we saw as the inability of Connecticut and the region to meet those standards if something didn't happen. What ultimately came out of that is the Hydro-Québec project. And as you know, we've made significant progress on that, and this is probably the first time that we've been able to say, ""We actually signed that thing,"" as opposed to, ""Trust us, it's moving along well."" It's hard to know exactly what the future is going to be like. And sometimes we look at the future in a static environment, and we don't think that it as dynamic. Three years ago, we wouldn't have talked about Hydro-Québec. Now it is becoming a reality, and it is a business model, it's a participant pay model that may be the kind of model that allows us to deal with some of these larger renewable issues in the future. 
This slide is simply something that we talked to you before. We called it the consortium. It's really a group of four companies, NSTAR, United Illuminating, National Grid and ourselves, that are making progress on this project. It's not complete yet, and there's still a lot of work to do, but it's gone past the conceptual stage. So as we look at the possibility of bringing onshore wind [ph], typically in northern New Hampshire and in Maine, down into the low centers, this kind of project has a real possibility. 250 to 300 miles long, probably 1,600 megawatts, something around $1.5 billion in cost and a participant pay model that may allow us to bundle the generation and the transmission together and make that available to the load centers in the region. We'll talk to you more about this as it continues down the path. But this is a real project that we think we will be able to move forward. It's not in the five-year financial plans right now. But it is something, clearly, that we think this new company will be able to do in a way that's better than either one of our existing companies. 
And then the last slide is the Northern Pass, or the Hydro-Québec project. We own 75%, NSTAR owns 25%. It's closing, obviously. So the new company just owns [ph] 100 percent. 1,200 megawatts of transfer capability. We have announced the Southern terminus [ph], which is Franklin, New Hampshire. The northern part, obviously, is a Concept [ph] station in Québec. We gave you an update on the cost of that project, it's about $1.1 billion now. The TSA was signed on October 4. The permitting process started on the 14th with the U.S. application for the DOE. PPAs are under discussion and we’ll probably be filing the project with FERC -- not probably, we will be filing the project with FERC this quarter, probably in the month of November.
So that project is moving along. I know you've had a number of questions, and we kept saying, “This is moving along, we will get there,” and, in fact, signing the TSA was a big milestone. We've still a lot of work to do. We've got to get all the approvals. Then we’ve got to get the [indiscernible] approved, we've got to build it. But it's moving along quite nicely, and it really is the kind of project, I think, that can be duplicated elsewhere. It's going to be easier for a company the size of this new company to do this kind of project, I think, than it would have been for us on a stand-alone basis. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Tom."

Good morning, everyone. I'm losing my voice. A summer cold, I guess, 90 degrees today, they’re saying. But bear with me, and I'll try to make it through. The Hydro-Québec project is something that Chuck thought up many, many years ago, and it kind of shows the potential. Laughing, we call it my dowry. He gave 25%, and now he took it back. But here's a project that will reduce the cost of energy in the region, but yet will remove five times the carbon of the infamous Cape Wind project. So it really is a project that moves the needle dramatically from an environmental perspective, but doesn't have a negative impact on our economy. In fact, it helps our economy. So it’s a really exciting project. 
And speaking about an exciting project, how about this merger? I like to tell my employees that I've always been interested in an industry that consolidates. Unfortunately, regulators don't always agree with us the way you should do it. But this is the perfect deal at the right time for both companies. As Chuck said, the whole world of environment and economy have come together, and it needs strong players, not two smaller players, but large and strong players, to help local governments and even national government to figure out an economic and an environmental policy that make sense for our region and the country. So bringing these two companies together is just such an exciting opportunity for us. 
One of the things that, of course, all of our shareholders, Chuck and I spent the first three or four days running every one of our large shareholders just to get a reaction and tell them why we thought this was so exciting. And the reaction has been overwhelming, if you see the way our stock prices have traded for the first two weeks after the announcement. I think it's traded better than any deal that's been in our space for about the last five or 10 years. And we did work very, very hard to create something that was a merger of equals. In fact, I think I will be forever grateful that Chuck is entrusting his shareholders in my hands for some time after the close.
But for the NSTAR shareholders, we really do see an opportunity to use what we have built over the years, which, in my view is [indiscernible] balance sheet to instead of be a company that could financially accelerate its growth, be a company that could invest to accelerate its growth. So it's a perfect combination of using our balance sheet to get the kind of growth that will clearly outperform that in the industry. I think both companies have a great track record of the last few years of outperformance. I think this will ensure that we will outperform for some time to come. And that's important to me, who has a lot of pride in what we've done for our shareholders.
Also, this large footprint. There at one point in time were about six transmission projects, the Green Line that was going to come by sea, one is by sea, one is by land. We had all sorts of projects that we're trying to get these wind power in the north down into the low centers, and every one of them wanted to land in Boston, where we have almost five million people. And so the combination of our load centers in our map and the Northeast Utilities expertise, you all have seen what they have been able to do with their Transmission business over the last few years, really puts us in a unique position to take advantage of it. As Chuck said, we're not exactly sure what's that’s going to the look like, but we do believe that when Lee comes up here and tells you about the Transmission business, that there are things on top of that, that will evolve in the next few years.
One also of the most exciting things, and you'll see it in the slide in a minute, we really are balancing our risk. I really do believe we're creating a lower risk, higher growth opportunity for investors. We really are balancing our regulatory risk between Connecticut, the federal government or FERC, and Massachusetts. And that balance should help us in the long run to really maintain a more consistent and constant earnings growth stream. So we're very excited about what this has in store for our shareholders. 
And speaking of record of delivering on our promises to our shareholders, both companies have a proud history. We've been on a roll. And most importantly, I think that this is going to let us continue that track record which, again, the goal is to outperform the industry. 
The next slide does show this balance in our regulated businesses. And I think that -- I just love this slide because of the way it shows how we at NSTAR will be reducing the all-in-one. We've had a great history in Massachusetts, and we expect that to continue for some time. But to have this kind of balance, I think, does provide the kind of risk profile that will allow us to be very successful going forward.
We put together, Chuck and I have worked diligently. I know many of you can't wait to get your hands on the proxy so you can see about our love story. He wasn't skating in Harvard or anything like that, but we did spend a lot of time together over the last four months. And one of the things that we really were concerned about is putting together the kind of team that would carry on the tradition, that would carry on those return numbers that we just showed a few minutes ago. So we have put a team together, a balanced team. We’re very excited about them. And you can see that we have three and three. Three from a Northeast Utilities background, three from NSTAR backgrounds. And we look forward to working together to create the kind of company that every one of us is proud of.
The timeline, Chuck said I'm very optimistic in this. I've actually challenged my people to get it done in six months. But it all depends on how the election goes tomorrow night as to how quickly we get this done. But there have been an incredible reaction to this transaction from our politicians, our regulators and all of you. It really has been well received, and it's going very well and people want to help us to get on with the game. They really want help us get through the process. There's no one throwing road blocks. There's no one saying this is stupid. And so Chuck and his team spent a lot of time in Connecticut talking to the regulators. It's a one-state approval. Connecticut has said that they don't believe they have any roll in the approval process, so we have to go through Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. Essentially, that's the critical path to this. And in Massachusetts, we have a no net harm standard, which means we don't have to go through any kind of rate process. In fact, our company is operating under a rate freeze until 2013. So there is no need to talk about rate with respect to this filing. There's lots of history, a lot of precedents for going through and approving mergers, and so we're just looking for a window when the DPU is not too busy. And we can expect, as you can see here, to file probably in November, have hearings in January and then it's up to them as to how quickly they issue an order. And hopefully, that will be on the quicker side.
There's lots of reasons why -- and we at NSTAR have enjoyed a higher multiple in the industry because many of you have looked at us as an investment opportunity, as I mentioned earlier, that's low-risk and high growth. A pretty good combination. But there are lots of characteristics that are responsible for a company having a premier valuation. And I think the slide has just about every single one of those factors that allow companies to be treated differently or special. We seem to have created a company that has every single one of them, whether it's that significant growth prospect that Chuck had mentioned, whether it's the strong earnings and dividend growth prospects, whether it's that diversification of income that we now have that seems so balanced, the management team we put together. I think you can our track records. We care about shareholder returns. That's what drives us. That's what we have delivered for many, many years. And we can do it all with a wonderful cash flow, very, very strong cash flow. We do not need to dilute these earnings going forward.
I'm told that when something is said at this conference, it becomes public information, and you can use it. So I'm going to borrow something. I don't know if Steve Fleishman is here. But I heard him yesterday tell his investors that this is a stock that you all should own. And I honestly believe it. I believe it's the best total return opportunity in this industry.
I'm going to leave it at that and introduce the great Lee Olivier, our Chief Operating Officer, to tell you how he's going to help us to invest all this great cash flow."

Because of the merger, but also because of the many accomplishments we've had the course of this past year in terms of our major capital programs. And all of our projects [indiscernible] environmental aspects of it [indiscernible]. But I don't think there's a company that's more for the environment, if not the for the last few years, between the [indiscernible] project, which essentially for the most part shut down all of the major oil, coal-fired power plants that used to how to do it [ph] because of the reliability, obviously the building of the scrubber that's created most of the CO2, not the CO2, but the nitrogen oxide and other pollutants in the air and of course, our solar program in Western Massachusetts, as well as this consortium project that we’re talking about. Really is a major initiative to improve the environment [indiscernible] of our region. So they're good for shareholders, good for customers and good for the environment.
The plans has about $6.6 billion of capital spend. That's up about $200 million over last year's plan. I'll go through that in a few sides. Of note, about Transmission, makes up about half of that capital spend and then you'll see that the transmission CapEx continues to stay strong as we go forward. And as Chuck indicated, there is really no capital in here for any of the transmission that would be built around the consortium project, which could be up in the range of a couple of billion dollars. But as he said, that's a real project. That is moving forward. We'll have more information on that later this year.
When you look at Transmission, we’ve had great success with specifically the new project for the reliability segment in that project. That was a project that we said would cost about $714 million. It's now pegged at $795 million. That is a very, very good price. We received approval, both in Connecticut and in Massachusetts. And we'll start construction on the first major substation of the people [ph] project in the December time frame. We're going to finish up the environmental committee and engineering over the winter. Then we’ll be into full-blown capital construction of that project [ph] lines next year. So we’ll have about a couple of hundred million dollars of CapEx spend next year. That takes a lot of the uncertainty around that project. We are also, in this meeting, we’ll update you on the overall cost of the news project. There’s been a number of changes there. The project [indiscernible] in the Central Connecticut portion of the project shifted out about a year. We'll give you updates on that as well. 
We also are happy with having rate certainty around the deployment of capital in the two big electric company's [indiscernible] about a five-year settlement, [indiscernible] we have a rate case of 2012 and we can probably stretch it a little bit more. But we have certainty around the capital deployment and the recovery of that capital. 
When we look at generation, the Merrimack Scrubber project is really on schedule. It's on the budget. If you remember, we said that project would cost about $547 million. We have now reforecasted that project to be about $430 million. It will still finish on time, in the middle of 2012, but really, just, again, solid progress there as well.
And recently, we completed about 1.8 megawatts of solar at Western Mass Electric. We kind of threw the switch on that last week. We’re going to start about another 4.2 megawatts of solar as part of a $41 million capital plan that we've got previously approved by the Massachusetts DPU. So we’ll have about 6 megawatts of solar in place by the end of 2011, beginning of 2012.
[indiscernible] Gas, another great growth story. Our project, one was the Waterbury pipeline project, about a $67 million project, is almost half complete. It's right on schedule. It's under budget. That's a project that's going to take about two years to connect a lot of customers. We're able to ask customers [ph] interruptible [ph] customers. And we’ve seen a host of other investment opportunities in and around business [ph] in a fairly significant way. And then they put it together with the NSTAR 300,000 driven thousand gas [ph], you've got a gas customer base that's about 500,000 customers, so real growth opportunities. 
[Indiscernible] we’ve kind of covered most of the highlights, the siding decision that we did yet from both Massachusetts and Connecticut was almost exactly what we wanted. We had very few interveners in that project. You see great expectance from the local community and municipal official. Again, start construction on the project in the December timeframe, and the project will be complete in service in 2013. 
Now in the appendix of the presentation is that slide that we always put in there that updates you on each of the three segments and the key milestones, so you can see exactly when those will take place. The Interstate Liability project [ph] [indiscernible] given it’s new for that project earlier this year. We're going to have a meeting late this month with the New England Advisory Committee, where we and our partners, which is National Grid, will present the overall Interstate Reliability project to the past [ph] committee and of course National Grid has [indiscernible] that's over in Rhode Island and in Massachusetts. And as a result of that, we would expect shortly thereafter to see that go ahead from ISO, in which case, we will start deciding of the IRP project [ph] in the third quarter of 2011 for the project to be completed and in service by 2015.
So again, we're very, very positive with the -- escalated the cost of that project which you'll see in the next slide, based upon just the fact that it's shifted out essentially a year. And the Central Connecticut portion of the project is still under review by ISO, and it’s being reviewed again by [ph] prospects of a number of generators that could potentially retire. So those of you that follow New England, in particularly Connecticut, you know that many of the generators there, with the exception of exception of the liquid generated, for the most part, don't run. They [indiscernible] shut down and the revenue proceeds are essentially all around the forward capacity market pricing, and that continues to drop. Every time [indiscernible] 2014 time frame, the floor goes away. We expect that there will be retirement and we would expect also to evaluate those against the market and render a decision on the new date of that project. Now they believe it’s needed, it's just a matter of the timing of the date. We expect to get that by the end of the first quarter or beginning of the second quarter of next year. 
This next slide is kind of a busy slide, but what we wanted to do for you is kind of do the math for you and reconcile the cost of these projects. And as you remember, we've had this $1.49 billion cost of news for some period of time, but as a result of having the final construction cost estimate and the final planning around selling, general and administrative expenses R&T, we escalated that to $795 million. As a result of the other two projects shifting about a year and some other projects allocated to that, we escalated those costs. And we arrived in this bucket of $200 million of other news-related cost. And what we've down here is disposition those inside of this slide. So the new cost of news goes to $1.518 billion. However, United Illuminating, our neighbor in Connecticut, will have essentially about an 8.4% ownership of the assets that are inside of Connecticut. And that would be up to about $69 million. So when you do the math, subtract that from the $1.518 billion, you come up with a new project cost of $1.449 billion with all of the cash flows as you see them right now on that particular slide. So finally, that $84 million on the bottom of the slide, it's been $84 million of projects that are approved, underway and in many cases, some of been have done. The remainder of that $200 million is embedded into the other segments of the project.
Now Chuck talked about the Northern Pass or the HBDC [ph] projects. And we are extremely confident in getting this project done in terms of the projects that we have made with the TSA being signed with HQ. We’ll file that TSA by the end of this month with FERC. We expect to have the order back somewhere around late January, early February. We have filed with the DOE for the presidential permit, which is a permit that you need to cross over into Canada. That permit just does two things because there’s an environmental impact of building the line. It ensures that would align process opens [ph] into another country, that it doesn't cause any undue security from the energy standpoint is to building the line. 
Some other key milestones. We will begin all of our engineering, life long lead time, [indiscernible] conversion station in 2011 and start construction of the project in 2013 for completion in late 2013. The person that is leading that project, Jim Muntz, is our President of transmission [indiscernible] project director for $1.2 billion middle [ph] project is leading that in that effort. All of the roll out that we’ve had so far with business leaders, government leaders in the various communities has been very, very, very positive. So this has been well accepted inside of New Hampshire. So we will continue to give you updates on this. 
If you look at the bottom of that slide, there's an asterisk around the cost of $1.1 billion. And that's really all part of a commitment that we have inside of the transmission services agreement to update the cost of the project within 45 days of signing of the TSA. So we will do that later this year. I'm not trying to signal that the project cost will go up or even change in any way. But if it does, obviously, in a material way, we will advise you of that through the HA [ph] process. So solid year in terms of this project moving forward.
This next slide looks at our CapEx, and it's kind of the look at the past and a look forward. You can see the spend has been up in the past about $2.8 billion, the spend going forward is about $2.8 billion. And again, as Chuck indicated, there really is no CapEx here for the consortium project. In terms of the CapEx here, that could be another additional $1 billion of CapEx that could be coming in the very near future.
First of all, through the bucket moves [ph] by $1.5 billion there, we will have spent about $230 million on news by the end of this year, with about $1.2 billion to go. The Northern Pass, the current NU share of that is $830 million and we will advise you of that in terms of -- once we get into sighting and engineering. In the appendix, an update on the last bucket which it was $845 million. And those are smaller projects, which is spread throughout the new state region and I think the good news there is that 90 percent of those projects either are already inside of the region system plan or they don't need to be inside the regional system plan. That shows that the confidence level of building that $845 million is very, very high. So that's kind of a look, the three-bucket look, very similar to what you’ve seen in the past. 
When you look at the electric distribution generation spend, the distribution has increased $437 million over the previous five-year term [ph] period. And many of the reason why it's increased is because this three-year is $217 million for the rollout of AMI Smart Grid inside of Connecticut Light and Power. And you see that those who are in the 2014, 2015 time frames, the total of the project is nearly about $300 million dollars, about $296 million is estimated to be right now. It also includes $130 million more as part of the rate cases that we have either settled or concluded at CL&P and PSNH. And included in there is up to a total spend of $50 million should we be successful in our rate case at Central Mass Electric.
You have in the past $30 million a year, we propose to spend a total of about $50 million, $20 million more is a result of aging infrastructure and upgrades that are needed. Now in regards to AMI and the additional CapEx spend in Western Mass, to the extent that we do not see rates or revenue recovery father, we will not make those expenditures. We're not going to make them unless we have adequate recovery. The DPUC, that Connecticut DPUC has already started a docket on AMI. The hearings in November, December of this year, and they will render a decision sometime by the end of the first quarter of 2011. As you remember, we have arbitrated for a full rollout of AMI for all 1.2 million customers because we think it’s the least cost approach to rolling out AMI. We've taken the approach to go longer in terms of a rollout because of the issues around U.S. initiatives [ph] on private security and operating protocols, so that's why [indiscernible] just a little bit longer.
We look at generation. Generation is down by about $214 million, that's really for the most part to do with Merrimack. We’ll have contributed [ph] about $150 million to $160 million this year on the Merrimack Scrubber. We reforecasted the price of that again from $4.57 to $4.30. Frankly, we look forward to those units and we probably won't have to spend as much capital as we previously thought. That's your $217 million difference there.
Liquid [ph] gas, for the reasons I indicated before, we see a good growth story there. This five-year look increases by $104 million over the previous five-year look for a total spend of $585 million. And it really centers around four areas. One is running the base of business, the other is just conversion from a lot of customers, about 50% [ph] of the heating in Connecticut is in oil, over 50 percent. A lot of opportunities for natural gas prices in the commodity now and where we think it’ll be for the foreseeable future, the conversions from other gas and also from interruptibles over the firm. We have a large backlog of customers that want to be connected, commercial industrial customers. And so we have a number of projects that would build out supply lines to those areas. And we also have this thing called [inaudible], which is the distribution management program [ph], which is a federally required program to basically take out the old bare steel and [inaudible] piping. So a spend really about [inaudible] on that. Rate base, $714 million, up to $1.1 billion by the end of the five-year planning period, so that's about a 53% increase in rate case [ph], so we really do believe that we can build this company very successfully.
So just for the sake of time, I'm going to curtail [ph] my presentation and turn it over to David McHale, who will take you through the financials."
292525,114943549,1757612,"Northeast Utilities, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Lee, and good morning. I'm to go to speak for just a few moments on business as usual. But business as usual is pretty good these days. We've got third quarter earnings that were released on five, quarter earnings were up 55%. Based on some of",1790,"Thank you, Lee, and good morning. I'm to go to speak for just a few moments on business as usual. But business as usual is pretty good these days. We've got third quarter earnings that were released on five, quarter earnings were up 55%. Based on some of the structural trends that we're seeing for the year, we've also increased guidance. Remember, we started this year with a view of midpoint around $1.90 a share, midpoint for this new guidance is $2.15. I'm going to talk a little bit about how that works its way into 2011 as well. 
The cash flow story has always been important for us as a company. It really speaks to the finance-ability of our rate-base plan because of bonus appreciation and a number of really key drivers this year, we're ahead of schedule. We accretively told you that we expected FFO to climb by about $100 million a year. Couple of years from now, we'll be at over $1 billion of FFO compared to maybe two years ago when we were half that. Very, very strong asset of our overall plan. 
In the cornerstone of our stand-alone plan is that rate-based growth that we've gone through, marrying that with the NSTAR plan is going to, I think, address this compelling total return story that Chuck and Tom referred to earlier this morning. And I'm just going to summarize that for you. I won't go through all those details. But first, with the quarter, because there's a couple of things that we want to point out. You see the numbers here on your right, $100.5 million in the quarter for earnings, driven surprisingly by the Distribution business. The Transition business, right on course, actually a little bit ahead of schedule, September is about $2.6 billion, that's up about $140 million over last year. And once we get into this greater Springfield project, that'll drive 2011. But in terms of what's really happening behind the scenes, and it's to be expected, the distribution business is now, particularly coming off [indiscernible] you’re seeing those things earnings being driven. 
And of course, there's a weather effect here. But the to look at what's happening this year, and it’s going work to into our views for both guidance and next year, really good progress around O&M management, extraordinarily good progress around our uncollectible expense relative to expectation, whether it's about $10 million of earnings in this quarter and also the rate cases. If there's a soft spot, and you've seen this, it's around sales. When we reported second quarter and we talked to you in August, we were seeing a little bit of optimism in terms of year-over-year growth. I think April was a good month. May was a good month. June was a little bit a low month, but we've seen some summer doldrums in July and August. Now the real sales, of course, are up 6.5%. But for the quarter, weather-normalized sales were down at about 4.4% and we seemed to re-hit [ph] industrial and commercial. 
Now the good news is, when we look at look at September alone, [indiscernible] with the commercial sector, we see in Connecticut strong export-driven growth. We see an increase in average work week, but no question that we’re not getting the real growth that maybe we saw or maybe held some promise in the summer. We've even seen employment in the region soften a little bit, particularly in Connecticut. So this is something that we'll look at. Now you know from our conversations in the past that some of our states like Connecticut and New Hampshire, 2/3 of our revenue, our distribution revenue, is tied to the fixed component of our rate structure. So while we don't call it outright decoupling, we're collecting a lot of revenues through customer charges and demand charges. So our balance business model is not as sensitive as a unit sales growth, and certainly even for so for 2011, we're not dependent on a recovery in the economy. It certainly helps, but the overall investment to program, I think, weathers some of what we're seeing there.
When you look at these individual components, I won’t spend a great deal of time on this. Yankee Gas [ph] is a little bit different in terms of their sales equation. They are, as Lee suggested, seeing weather-normalized sales growth of about 6%. They had a very mild winter, so their real sales this year is off about 20%. But the real drivers here are, again, the rate cases that we're seeing in Connecticut and in New Hampshire in O&M. Now O&M in particular is driven by real productivity benefits that we're seeing. I don't think these are sort of one-off occurrences. I think you're going to see this as one of the rationales of why we're optimistic about 2010 and 2011. 
Uncollectible expense has been a great story within the story. For the uncollectible expense in the company that is not tracked through our rate, last year, it cost our company's $47 million pretax to hit bottom line. When we started this year, we thought we’d see an improvement. We had built into our plan about $35 million. Right now, we are trending more like $25 million. So good story there, and that will fall right to the bottom line. And I think that also translates into 2011. For PSNH, it's that plus, it's good, HPPC [ph] growth coming out of the Merrimack project.
You've already seen this exhibit, I'm sure. A couple of things I really want to clarify here, I'm sure over-complicated this exhibit by showing you both GAAP and non-GAAP that I mentioned. What's important is the asterisk. We are saying that our guidance this year can be $2.10 to $2.20 per share, that's both GAAP and non-GAAP. And what's happening behind the scenes here is that we have, in this quarter, it's not reflected yet in our financial results, resolved an [indiscernible] tax item that is going to produce what we’re referring to as a nonrecurring gain. You're going to see that in the quarter. It’s worth about $16 million, $0.09 a share. It's not going to happen next year. It's not going to happen in the future. We call that non-recurring. 
We also are going to begin, as well as our partners, to the [ph] transaction cost associated with the merger here in the quarter as well. Those are equal roughly and offsetting, $0.09 gain, $0.07 cost. And so that's why both on a GAAP and non-GAAP, we get back to that $2.10 to $2.20. But when you think about the earnings capability of this company from what we are about those top line. One of the $1.20 for distribution and $1 for the transmission business. Those are little bit ahead of plan. Again, why are they ahead of plan? And plan, by the way, was updated in August. So this is our second time we’ve guided higher. It’s [indiscernible] for sure, but it's the O&M. It's the uncollectibles. It’s the tax benefits that we’ve received as we’re driving down the company's overall effective tax rate.
Now what I don't have on here, that we would’ve showed you last year, is forward guidance. We have stopped short of showing you 2011 guidance, not because we are not confident around 2011, but because we are partnering with NSTAR. They would typically put out guidance when they complete the year and at the turn of the year show you their view of 2011. We're going to do the same. That said, we know where our consensus is, roughly about $2.20 for 2011, maybe $2.21 depending on how you count that out. We think that's conservative, in part because what I'm telling around the structural trends that we see at O&M. We're not going to carry weather forward for sure, but the way that we're managing our business, including, as Lee suggested, all the projects that are now in place. 
So if you think of what’s driving our earnings for 2011, the year was already set off very, very well. Greater Springfield is driving earnings. By the time we finish 2011, that will be over $300 million in rate base alone. The Merrimack Scrubber project, that is driving earnings going into 2011 for the full year of a case, a full year at PSNH rate case. As you know, we're in the middle of a Massachusetts rate case, so all those fundamentals I think, are poised well. Now on the margins, there are things that we are studying pretty hard: sales, pension expense and the like. But I think that’s already dealt in some of my views. So the consensus out there is good, but I think it is conservative. When we report for the full year, we'll give you sort of line by line segment guidance for the take away is. It's been a strong year for us, 2011 is going to be another very, very attractive you overall.
Now on the CapEx, I won't go through all this, but just to summarize what Lee has positioned there. And we've got a little bit of a callout table by segment on the right $6.64 billion. These bars that you see were the year-by-year spending in 2011 through 2015, we have sort of superimposed for you here last year's plan so you can get your model fine-tuned pretty well. And then just to summarize the overall program, again, the cornerstone of the stand-alone plan is this rate-based growth. It adds to another 9.2% overall CAGR. The underlying transmission growth is a double-digit CAGR 10.7%.
Because of the merger, we’re going to stop short of saying what the stand-alone growth is. You know from our discussion and from Tom, and Chuck this morning, we’re at that highest end of 6% to 9%. We are going to stop short of talking about what our stand-alone dividend policy is. It was 50%, now our dividend policy going forward is to drive dividend growth consistent with earnings. We're going to stop short of talking about the overall finance ability. We’re going to give you more definition of what we're doing in 2011. This program will still need some debt financing. Not a problem, we have great access to capital. Regulators are supportive of that. Much of the overall approvals, state-by-state are in place. The one thing that of course is different, there is no equity required to get this plan done. That certainly is beneficial for the numbers overall. And it's also [indiscernible] cash flow profile going forward. 
Now I'm going to pause there and give my partner Jim Judge an opportunity to run through a few slides covering their quarter."

And the three takeaways that I’d like you to walk away from my comments are this. First of all, NSTAR has an outstanding track record. I realize this is actually the utilities [ph] My guess is a lot of you are familiar with the NU story. This is an opportunity to give you some perspective on who the new partner is. The second takeaway is that we just finished yet another very strong quarter, estimates for the quarter, and I’ll provide a little bit of color on these results.
The third message is really to tell you how very excited I am about this strategic combination. And this is really a transaction that makes so much sense on many fronts. What you have here is the best-in-class transmission planer and operator coming together with the best-in-class distribution operator. What you have here is a cash-rich utility coming together with a project-rich utility. What you have here are two top-flight management teams coming together to make an even stronger one. And I often say that the best indication of what a management team is going to do for you in the future is take a look of their track record, their past. These are two companies that have outstanding record in terms of delivering results to shareholders.
Just when you thought you had seen enough Safe Harbor language, here's one more slide. My lawyers, too, wanted me to remind you that we’ll be making some forward-looking statements, and you should and can review any further disclosures in our reports to the SEC.
For those of you who [indiscernible] NSTAR, business philosophy that is actually very simple. We believe that if you deliver excellent customer service, your customers will be happy, customers are happy, your regulators are happy, and when the regulators are happy, financial success usually follows. The model that we’ve followed for several years, expanding on that very first [indiscernible] about customer service and reliability, is really a half-dozen key metrics that gauge the performance of a distribution utility: the number of outages, the length of outages, the call center performance, billing accuracy and timeliness, every single one of those measures is in the top quartile. Many of them in the top percent of the industry. So we have some excellent customer service, excellent customer service track record. It’s no wonder that our JD Power scores, in terms of customer satisfaction, are the highest in the region. And have improved for four straight years. I'm very confident that with this philosophy, [indiscernible] company will be able to do even more.
From a regulatory standpoint, NSTAR has a very, very long history of rate settlements, working effectively with our regulators and long-term settlements in a win for the shareholders as well as the customers. In fact, we look at this as a core competency of our management team. We haven't had a litigated rate increase since 1986. That's 25 years. I see no reason why we can't continue this. Actually, that span of 25 years, it involves six governors, five attorney generals, more than 20 CPC commissioners. So obviously, we've been able to sort of exercise these skills in a number of different regulatory climates. Tom and I have been involved in every one of these negotiations, and I think I'd speak for both of us when I say we have never been more confident about our ability to do yet another settlement in the back end of this rate deal that expires at the end of 2012.
Key element of the NSTAR earnings growth story has been our ability to improve productivity and control costs. You can see that spending in 2009 went down. That was all discretionary nature. These cuts are really never at the expense of customer service and reliability. One Wall Street analyst, who I think is actually here, wrote in the past that “NSTAR's O&M discipline is as unmatched by any utility I can think of,” and the numbers support that.
Over the last many years, we have – our earnings growth is outperforming Philly [ph] peers. In our second quarter report, we did increase the upper end of our guidance range to $2.50. Like David mentioned, we like to exclude from this onetime items. We actually had three onetime items this year that I should note. We earned $1.03 on the sale of [indiscernible] business in the second quarter. We just announced a settlement with the IRS that covered seven years and in the [ph] quarter. And we will have some tax-related expenses in the fourth quarter.
As a result of solid earnings performance, we've been able to increase the dividend 7% last November, the 12th year in a row that we’ve increased the dividend. Our payout ratio continues to be conservative in the low 60s. And we feel very confident, as David mentioned, we have the prospects of, on a combined basis, higher earnings per share growth that will fuel higher dividend growth, and we expected dividend growth to continue to track earnings going forward.
We are particularly proud of the job we’ve done for our shareholders. As this graph shows, our total shareholder return has increased steadily over the past 13 years. $1,000 invested in NSTAR at the start of the period is worth over $5,000 today. Actually, updated for 2010, we've provide shareholders another 18% already this year, so I'm pretty confident we'll be able to say 14 years now and counting. To put that performance in perspective, you won’t be able to find another utility in the country that has more than three consecutive years of positive total shareholder returns.
Also to put it into perspective, we've done a little bit of research, you will find any company in an industry, manufacturing, high-tech, retail, banking, that can match that track record of consistent total shareholder return increases year in, year out.
So while our financial performance has been off the charts, one thing investments are also concerned with is the financial condition of their investment. And this slide says all you need to know about NSTAR. Our financial condition is number one in the industry with the highest credit rating. So a very long record of providing great returns, but also, clearly, a very strong commitment to maintaining excellent credit quality. I think both of those values will continue within the new company.
An update on transmission. Obviously, Mass [ph] Utility is the poster child of transmission development, but I do want point out that NSTAR has doubled its transmission rate base in the past five years. And we have projects in the queue that will allow us to double it again in the next five years. We have basically based [ph] on reliability and capability projects number of year. That's about $100 million a year on average. We are currently licensing a new 345-kV new line over the canal. That's $120 million investment currently before the Energy Facilities Siting Board in Massachusetts. We expect spending will occur in 2011 and '12. We expect that to be in service by year end '12.
Our next two projects, relatively new, we have a circuit reliability project, the 345-kV line into the timeframe 2014, ’15 is expected construction. We also have 115-kV line that we're stalling down in the Mid-Cape that basically will extend the benefit of the line that we have going over the canal. The bottom of bullet [ph] there Northern Pass, Chuck has covered the; Hydro-Québec project, and a number of folks have talked about the potential of accessing that northern New England, the consortium project.
We did just have a great quarter. Released earnings after the market closed Friday. We still have benefited from an 8% growth in sales that reflected the hot weather in the Boston area. In addition to the sales increase from the weather, we did pick up $0.02 from our annual PVR inflation adjustment related to our rate settlement. The lower interest costs compared to a year ago. They gave us $0.03, and we did just execute a share repurchase that, when you compare with last year's numbers, basically provided a $0.03 in earnings. Offsetting those items are items that are in line with our guidance, increased O&M, increased property taxes associated with our capital spending or rate-based growth. Lastly, we did sell the [indiscernible] business, so in this quarter, the absence of earnings associated with that [indiscernible] sale, which is $0.02. 
I do want to take a minute to talk about income tax settlement that you see in the footnotes. It's a positive development. It resolves all outstanding tax issues that we have from 2001 to 2007. What it does free up is a tax refund of $135 million we expect to receive by the end of the year.
That's really it for my overview. I'd now like to turn it back to Tom and Chuck for our closing messages and then, obviously, questions will follow."

We've seen some of the actions that have taken place. We're going to spend a lot of time said that and have that discussion about what impacts is on NSTAR, but I think there’s an argument that going forward, even without existing ratings profile, they are going to maintain that. Now I’ll allow Jim to add any other color to that, but we're going to have that assumption."

This is a somewhat early hour. But we have a multi-faceted presentation for you today. We're trying to do a number of things, the first and probably, the foremost, of course, is Tom and I would like to spend a little more time talking about the merger. We've had a lot of conversations since we announced it, but there are some questions that some of you have asked. We'll try to hit those head on today, but clearly, we'll both be around for a few days and give you the opportunity to talk to us privately, if you'd like.
The second thing is we both had our earnings releases out. You saw that the third quarter for both companies was very good. NU also increased its guidance for 2010. And so, we'll get this later on in the presentation. We'll have Dave McHale and Jim Muntz talk a little bit about the respective quarters for each of our companies.
And for NU, I know a lot of you view this morning as a way to get updated on [indiscernible] on some of our major projects. So when Tom and I get finished talking a little bit about the merger, Lee's going to spend some time giving you an update on the status and on the capital expenditures around some of the major projects. So that's what we're going to try to accomplish today. Please ask questions as you get the opportunity because we really would like to have this discussion.
So if you go to Page 5. We've spent a lot of time talking to a number of you privately, but this really is a compelling combination. And I would tell you that I have not met anyone that hasn't said, logically, this makes sense. This strategic for the industrial logic its [ph] combination is compelling. We think it's going to be a tremendously exciting new company at closure. We talked about closure being nine to 12 months away. You'll here Tom being a little bit optimistic about, let's try to do it in nine months. I think we can actually accomplish that, and I think that's where we should be headed. We have a significant transformation opportunity to Nu. We've talked to you about those over the last number of years, and we combine that we the balance, strength that we have with NSTAR and the cash flow, it allows us to really expand on those projects in a way that is more effective from a financial standpoint.
This new company is larger. It will be the 15th to the 17th largest utility in the country, depending on how you measure it. And it is more diverse and much better positioned to support the economic growth and renewables in New England. I think, and you have heard me say this before, New England is an inflection point. They've got Reg E requirements. They've got RPS requirements. And if you play those out over the next few years, we need to do something to make that happen. I think this new company is going to be positioned in a way that it will be able to help make that happen for the benefit of not only our stockholders but for the benefit of the customers and for the region. This is clearly accretive to earnings in year one, and we think provides not only increased earnings and dividend potential but an enhanced total shareholder return. The service quality capabilities are enhanced. It is the largest customer base in New England. You've seen the map many, many times that shows the low centers in New England. It's Boston, it's Connecticut. As the two companies have a significant portion of that New England population. 
And then a highly experienced and complementary leadership team with a proven track record. You've heard us talk a lot about the similarities of these two companies. We've worked together for a number of years. Restoration, as we've had storms. We’ve sent crews to NSTAR, NSTAR has sent crews to our service territories. So we've worked together. We know how that works. And the Hydro-Québec project is just one more example, and probably the most recent example, of the two companies working together. And I think as that proven track record showed, this then becomes the next logical step in that process.
If you go to the next slide. You've seen this before. We expect to close in nine to 12 months. Dual headquarters in both Hartford and Boston. Tom will spend a little bit more time talking about that. NU will be the company's name, the consideration is 100% NU shares. The exchange ratio, as you can see, is 1.312. Shares for NU per NSTAR share is split about $56.44 [ph]. The dividend increase will be about a 20% increase for NU shareholders. And [indiscernible] for NSTAR shareholders, and from a government standpoint, I will become the non-Executive Chairman at this point of closure. Tom will be president and CEO. There will be 14 board members. Tom and I will each be on the board, and there will be six independent members from each one of our existing companies.
So as you look at this, this truly is a merger of equals. And we think you'll see that from the government standpoint, from the management standpoint, from just about any perspective, this is just as balanced as an entity can be.
Specific benefits to NU shareholders, we’ve talked about approximately 20% dividend increase. That number’s about right. It can vary by two or three percentage points, whether you calculate it today or whether you calculate it on what you project it to be at the time of closer. The cash flow increased to eliminate the equity issuance. We talk to you from NU standpoint, about the fact that we expected to have about $300 million equity issuance in 2012. Essentially, that equity issuance goes away. And for the foreseeable future, as we look at our five-year plan, we don't see any equity issuance in that plan.
Likely credit upgrades, obviously, the benefit of reduction in debt issuance and lower interest rates, we think that will be helpful. Increased market liquidity, a number of you have difficult times buying either us or NSTAR because of the size of the organization. So if we put these two together, the market liquidity obviously expands dramatically and gives you the opportunity to buy shares in a much larger company. Increased opportunities to reduce cost over time, and this is one of those things that you ask us a lot. And this takes the form of many different kinds of questions, but it is basically [ph] of synergy. And if you could tell us exactly how much there is in day one, day two and day three, that would be appreciated also.
But this merger is not predicated on synergies. It's predicated on providing growth to the region and being able to, in a way that neither one of us can right now, answer questions and provide solutions for our customers. That ultimately will help the shareholders of this combined company.
Now clearly if we do that, there will be opportunities for improvement in the effectiveness of these organizations. There will be a change in the composition of some of our employees, but we would expect to handle most of that through voluntary attrition and through retirement. There will be best practices. There will benefits of putting these large systems that we have together. So there will be the ability to reduce cost over time, and that will flow to the benefit of not only the customers but also of our shareholders. And as I said earlier, the ability to achieve a higher earnings growth rate.
We have talked to you about it being accretive. We probably didn't give you the exact numbers on each of one of these. We're going to point out some of the things to take us from somewhere in the 6% to 9% growth rate that we previously were to something toward the upper end of that 6% to 9% growth rate. Obviously, the additional shares are negative to that. But for that, we get NSTAR's earnings growth, which is significant. We get the avoidance of the equity issuance that we just talked about, lower financing costs, less current parent debt and the implementation of best practices. So as we look across the spectrum for the next few years, there are going to be many real benefit to this merger in a way that will allow us to increase our earnings and ultimately our dividends at a rate that was higher than we thought we could do before and certainly at a rate that's higher that either one of the stand-alone companies.
Let's take it back about, probably two or three years now. We had a conversation with one of these leading about the [indiscernible] standard and about Reg E and about what we saw as the inability of Connecticut and the region to meet those standards if something didn't happen. What ultimately came out of that is the Hydro-Québec project. And as you know, we've made significant progress on that, and this is probably the first time that we've been able to say, ""We actually signed that thing,"" as opposed to, ""Trust us, it's moving along well."" It's hard to know exactly what the future is going to be like. And sometimes we look at the future in a static environment, and we don't think that it as dynamic. Three years ago, we wouldn't have talked about Hydro-Québec. Now it is becoming a reality, and it is a business model, it's a participant pay model that may be the kind of model that allows us to deal with some of these larger renewable issues in the future. 
This slide is simply something that we talked to you before. We called it the consortium. It's really a group of four companies, NSTAR, United Illuminating, National Grid and ourselves, that are making progress on this project. It's not complete yet, and there's still a lot of work to do, but it's gone past the conceptual stage. So as we look at the possibility of bringing onshore wind [ph], typically in northern New Hampshire and in Maine, down into the low centers, this kind of project has a real possibility. 250 to 300 miles long, probably 1,600 megawatts, something around $1.5 billion in cost and a participant pay model that may allow us to bundle the generation and the transmission together and make that available to the load centers in the region. We'll talk to you more about this as it continues down the path. But this is a real project that we think we will be able to move forward. It's not in the five-year financial plans right now. But it is something, clearly, that we think this new company will be able to do in a way that's better than either one of our existing companies. 
And then the last slide is the Northern Pass, or the Hydro-Québec project. We own 75%, NSTAR owns 25%. It's closing, obviously. So the new company just owns [ph] 100 percent. 1,200 megawatts of transfer capability. We have announced the Southern terminus [ph], which is Franklin, New Hampshire. The northern part, obviously, is a Concept [ph] station in Québec. We gave you an update on the cost of that project, it's about $1.1 billion now. The TSA was signed on October 4. The permitting process started on the 14th with the U.S. application for the DOE. PPAs are under discussion and we’ll probably be filing the project with FERC -- not probably, we will be filing the project with FERC this quarter, probably in the month of November.
So that project is moving along. I know you've had a number of questions, and we kept saying, “This is moving along, we will get there,” and, in fact, signing the TSA was a big milestone. We've still a lot of work to do. We've got to get all the approvals. Then we’ve got to get the [indiscernible] approved, we've got to build it. But it's moving along quite nicely, and it really is the kind of project, I think, that can be duplicated elsewhere. It's going to be easier for a company the size of this new company to do this kind of project, I think, than it would have been for us on a stand-alone basis. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Tom."

Good morning, everyone. I'm losing my voice. A summer cold, I guess, 90 degrees today, they’re saying. But bear with me, and I'll try to make it through. The Hydro-Québec project is something that Chuck thought up many, many years ago, and it kind of shows the potential. Laughing, we call it my dowry. He gave 25%, and now he took it back. But here's a project that will reduce the cost of energy in the region, but yet will remove five times the carbon of the infamous Cape Wind project. So it really is a project that moves the needle dramatically from an environmental perspective, but doesn't have a negative impact on our economy. In fact, it helps our economy. So it’s a really exciting project. 
And speaking about an exciting project, how about this merger? I like to tell my employees that I've always been interested in an industry that consolidates. Unfortunately, regulators don't always agree with us the way you should do it. But this is the perfect deal at the right time for both companies. As Chuck said, the whole world of environment and economy have come together, and it needs strong players, not two smaller players, but large and strong players, to help local governments and even national government to figure out an economic and an environmental policy that make sense for our region and the country. So bringing these two companies together is just such an exciting opportunity for us. 
One of the things that, of course, all of our shareholders, Chuck and I spent the first three or four days running every one of our large shareholders just to get a reaction and tell them why we thought this was so exciting. And the reaction has been overwhelming, if you see the way our stock prices have traded for the first two weeks after the announcement. I think it's traded better than any deal that's been in our space for about the last five or 10 years. And we did work very, very hard to create something that was a merger of equals. In fact, I think I will be forever grateful that Chuck is entrusting his shareholders in my hands for some time after the close.
But for the NSTAR shareholders, we really do see an opportunity to use what we have built over the years, which, in my view is [indiscernible] balance sheet to instead of be a company that could financially accelerate its growth, be a company that could invest to accelerate its growth. So it's a perfect combination of using our balance sheet to get the kind of growth that will clearly outperform that in the industry. I think both companies have a great track record of the last few years of outperformance. I think this will ensure that we will outperform for some time to come. And that's important to me, who has a lot of pride in what we've done for our shareholders.
Also, this large footprint. There at one point in time were about six transmission projects, the Green Line that was going to come by sea, one is by sea, one is by land. We had all sorts of projects that we're trying to get these wind power in the north down into the low centers, and every one of them wanted to land in Boston, where we have almost five million people. And so the combination of our load centers in our map and the Northeast Utilities expertise, you all have seen what they have been able to do with their Transmission business over the last few years, really puts us in a unique position to take advantage of it. As Chuck said, we're not exactly sure what's that’s going to the look like, but we do believe that when Lee comes up here and tells you about the Transmission business, that there are things on top of that, that will evolve in the next few years.
One also of the most exciting things, and you'll see it in the slide in a minute, we really are balancing our risk. I really do believe we're creating a lower risk, higher growth opportunity for investors. We really are balancing our regulatory risk between Connecticut, the federal government or FERC, and Massachusetts. And that balance should help us in the long run to really maintain a more consistent and constant earnings growth stream. So we're very excited about what this has in store for our shareholders. 
And speaking of record of delivering on our promises to our shareholders, both companies have a proud history. We've been on a roll. And most importantly, I think that this is going to let us continue that track record which, again, the goal is to outperform the industry. 
The next slide does show this balance in our regulated businesses. And I think that -- I just love this slide because of the way it shows how we at NSTAR will be reducing the all-in-one. We've had a great history in Massachusetts, and we expect that to continue for some time. But to have this kind of balance, I think, does provide the kind of risk profile that will allow us to be very successful going forward.
We put together, Chuck and I have worked diligently. I know many of you can't wait to get your hands on the proxy so you can see about our love story. He wasn't skating in Harvard or anything like that, but we did spend a lot of time together over the last four months. And one of the things that we really were concerned about is putting together the kind of team that would carry on the tradition, that would carry on those return numbers that we just showed a few minutes ago. So we have put a team together, a balanced team. We’re very excited about them. And you can see that we have three and three. Three from a Northeast Utilities background, three from NSTAR backgrounds. And we look forward to working together to create the kind of company that every one of us is proud of.
The timeline, Chuck said I'm very optimistic in this. I've actually challenged my people to get it done in six months. But it all depends on how the election goes tomorrow night as to how quickly we get this done. But there have been an incredible reaction to this transaction from our politicians, our regulators and all of you. It really has been well received, and it's going very well and people want to help us to get on with the game. They really want help us get through the process. There's no one throwing road blocks. There's no one saying this is stupid. And so Chuck and his team spent a lot of time in Connecticut talking to the regulators. It's a one-state approval. Connecticut has said that they don't believe they have any roll in the approval process, so we have to go through Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. Essentially, that's the critical path to this. And in Massachusetts, we have a no net harm standard, which means we don't have to go through any kind of rate process. In fact, our company is operating under a rate freeze until 2013. So there is no need to talk about rate with respect to this filing. There's lots of history, a lot of precedents for going through and approving mergers, and so we're just looking for a window when the DPU is not too busy. And we can expect, as you can see here, to file probably in November, have hearings in January and then it's up to them as to how quickly they issue an order. And hopefully, that will be on the quicker side.
There's lots of reasons why -- and we at NSTAR have enjoyed a higher multiple in the industry because many of you have looked at us as an investment opportunity, as I mentioned earlier, that's low-risk and high growth. A pretty good combination. But there are lots of characteristics that are responsible for a company having a premier valuation. And I think the slide has just about every single one of those factors that allow companies to be treated differently or special. We seem to have created a company that has every single one of them, whether it's that significant growth prospect that Chuck had mentioned, whether it's the strong earnings and dividend growth prospects, whether it's that diversification of income that we now have that seems so balanced, the management team we put together. I think you can our track records. We care about shareholder returns. That's what drives us. That's what we have delivered for many, many years. And we can do it all with a wonderful cash flow, very, very strong cash flow. We do not need to dilute these earnings going forward.
I'm told that when something is said at this conference, it becomes public information, and you can use it. So I'm going to borrow something. I don't know if Steve Fleishman is here. But I heard him yesterday tell his investors that this is a stock that you all should own. And I honestly believe it. I believe it's the best total return opportunity in this industry.
I'm going to leave it at that and introduce the great Lee Olivier, our Chief Operating Officer, to tell you how he's going to help us to invest all this great cash flow."

Because of the merger, but also because of the many accomplishments we've had the course of this past year in terms of our major capital programs. And all of our projects [indiscernible] environmental aspects of it [indiscernible]. But I don't think there's a company that's more for the environment, if not the for the last few years, between the [indiscernible] project, which essentially for the most part shut down all of the major oil, coal-fired power plants that used to how to do it [ph] because of the reliability, obviously the building of the scrubber that's created most of the CO2, not the CO2, but the nitrogen oxide and other pollutants in the air and of course, our solar program in Western Massachusetts, as well as this consortium project that we’re talking about. Really is a major initiative to improve the environment [indiscernible] of our region. So they're good for shareholders, good for customers and good for the environment.
The plans has about $6.6 billion of capital spend. That's up about $200 million over last year's plan. I'll go through that in a few sides. Of note, about Transmission, makes up about half of that capital spend and then you'll see that the transmission CapEx continues to stay strong as we go forward. And as Chuck indicated, there is really no capital in here for any of the transmission that would be built around the consortium project, which could be up in the range of a couple of billion dollars. But as he said, that's a real project. That is moving forward. We'll have more information on that later this year.
When you look at Transmission, we’ve had great success with specifically the new project for the reliability segment in that project. That was a project that we said would cost about $714 million. It's now pegged at $795 million. That is a very, very good price. We received approval, both in Connecticut and in Massachusetts. And we'll start construction on the first major substation of the people [ph] project in the December time frame. We're going to finish up the environmental committee and engineering over the winter. Then we’ll be into full-blown capital construction of that project [ph] lines next year. So we’ll have about a couple of hundred million dollars of CapEx spend next year. That takes a lot of the uncertainty around that project. We are also, in this meeting, we’ll update you on the overall cost of the news project. There’s been a number of changes there. The project [indiscernible] in the Central Connecticut portion of the project shifted out about a year. We'll give you updates on that as well. 
We also are happy with having rate certainty around the deployment of capital in the two big electric company's [indiscernible] about a five-year settlement, [indiscernible] we have a rate case of 2012 and we can probably stretch it a little bit more. But we have certainty around the capital deployment and the recovery of that capital. 
When we look at generation, the Merrimack Scrubber project is really on schedule. It's on the budget. If you remember, we said that project would cost about $547 million. We have now reforecasted that project to be about $430 million. It will still finish on time, in the middle of 2012, but really, just, again, solid progress there as well.
And recently, we completed about 1.8 megawatts of solar at Western Mass Electric. We kind of threw the switch on that last week. We’re going to start about another 4.2 megawatts of solar as part of a $41 million capital plan that we've got previously approved by the Massachusetts DPU. So we’ll have about 6 megawatts of solar in place by the end of 2011, beginning of 2012.
[indiscernible] Gas, another great growth story. Our project, one was the Waterbury pipeline project, about a $67 million project, is almost half complete. It's right on schedule. It's under budget. That's a project that's going to take about two years to connect a lot of customers. We're able to ask customers [ph] interruptible [ph] customers. And we’ve seen a host of other investment opportunities in and around business [ph] in a fairly significant way. And then they put it together with the NSTAR 300,000 driven thousand gas [ph], you've got a gas customer base that's about 500,000 customers, so real growth opportunities. 
[Indiscernible] we’ve kind of covered most of the highlights, the siding decision that we did yet from both Massachusetts and Connecticut was almost exactly what we wanted. We had very few interveners in that project. You see great expectance from the local community and municipal official. Again, start construction on the project in the December timeframe, and the project will be complete in service in 2013. 
Now in the appendix of the presentation is that slide that we always put in there that updates you on each of the three segments and the key milestones, so you can see exactly when those will take place. The Interstate Liability project [ph] [indiscernible] given it’s new for that project earlier this year. We're going to have a meeting late this month with the New England Advisory Committee, where we and our partners, which is National Grid, will present the overall Interstate Reliability project to the past [ph] committee and of course National Grid has [indiscernible] that's over in Rhode Island and in Massachusetts. And as a result of that, we would expect shortly thereafter to see that go ahead from ISO, in which case, we will start deciding of the IRP project [ph] in the third quarter of 2011 for the project to be completed and in service by 2015.
So again, we're very, very positive with the -- escalated the cost of that project which you'll see in the next slide, based upon just the fact that it's shifted out essentially a year. And the Central Connecticut portion of the project is still under review by ISO, and it’s being reviewed again by [ph] prospects of a number of generators that could potentially retire. So those of you that follow New England, in particularly Connecticut, you know that many of the generators there, with the exception of exception of the liquid generated, for the most part, don't run. They [indiscernible] shut down and the revenue proceeds are essentially all around the forward capacity market pricing, and that continues to drop. Every time [indiscernible] 2014 time frame, the floor goes away. We expect that there will be retirement and we would expect also to evaluate those against the market and render a decision on the new date of that project. Now they believe it’s needed, it's just a matter of the timing of the date. We expect to get that by the end of the first quarter or beginning of the second quarter of next year. 
This next slide is kind of a busy slide, but what we wanted to do for you is kind of do the math for you and reconcile the cost of these projects. And as you remember, we've had this $1.49 billion cost of news for some period of time, but as a result of having the final construction cost estimate and the final planning around selling, general and administrative expenses R&T, we escalated that to $795 million. As a result of the other two projects shifting about a year and some other projects allocated to that, we escalated those costs. And we arrived in this bucket of $200 million of other news-related cost. And what we've down here is disposition those inside of this slide. So the new cost of news goes to $1.518 billion. However, United Illuminating, our neighbor in Connecticut, will have essentially about an 8.4% ownership of the assets that are inside of Connecticut. And that would be up to about $69 million. So when you do the math, subtract that from the $1.518 billion, you come up with a new project cost of $1.449 billion with all of the cash flows as you see them right now on that particular slide. So finally, that $84 million on the bottom of the slide, it's been $84 million of projects that are approved, underway and in many cases, some of been have done. The remainder of that $200 million is embedded into the other segments of the project.
Now Chuck talked about the Northern Pass or the HBDC [ph] projects. And we are extremely confident in getting this project done in terms of the projects that we have made with the TSA being signed with HQ. We’ll file that TSA by the end of this month with FERC. We expect to have the order back somewhere around late January, early February. We have filed with the DOE for the presidential permit, which is a permit that you need to cross over into Canada. That permit just does two things because there’s an environmental impact of building the line. It ensures that would align process opens [ph] into another country, that it doesn't cause any undue security from the energy standpoint is to building the line. 
Some other key milestones. We will begin all of our engineering, life long lead time, [indiscernible] conversion station in 2011 and start construction of the project in 2013 for completion in late 2013. The person that is leading that project, Jim Muntz, is our President of transmission [indiscernible] project director for $1.2 billion middle [ph] project is leading that in that effort. All of the roll out that we’ve had so far with business leaders, government leaders in the various communities has been very, very, very positive. So this has been well accepted inside of New Hampshire. So we will continue to give you updates on this. 
If you look at the bottom of that slide, there's an asterisk around the cost of $1.1 billion. And that's really all part of a commitment that we have inside of the transmission services agreement to update the cost of the project within 45 days of signing of the TSA. So we will do that later this year. I'm not trying to signal that the project cost will go up or even change in any way. But if it does, obviously, in a material way, we will advise you of that through the HA [ph] process. So solid year in terms of this project moving forward.
This next slide looks at our CapEx, and it's kind of the look at the past and a look forward. You can see the spend has been up in the past about $2.8 billion, the spend going forward is about $2.8 billion. And again, as Chuck indicated, there really is no CapEx here for the consortium project. In terms of the CapEx here, that could be another additional $1 billion of CapEx that could be coming in the very near future.
First of all, through the bucket moves [ph] by $1.5 billion there, we will have spent about $230 million on news by the end of this year, with about $1.2 billion to go. The Northern Pass, the current NU share of that is $830 million and we will advise you of that in terms of -- once we get into sighting and engineering. In the appendix, an update on the last bucket which it was $845 million. And those are smaller projects, which is spread throughout the new state region and I think the good news there is that 90 percent of those projects either are already inside of the region system plan or they don't need to be inside the regional system plan. That shows that the confidence level of building that $845 million is very, very high. So that's kind of a look, the three-bucket look, very similar to what you’ve seen in the past. 
When you look at the electric distribution generation spend, the distribution has increased $437 million over the previous five-year term [ph] period. And many of the reason why it's increased is because this three-year is $217 million for the rollout of AMI Smart Grid inside of Connecticut Light and Power. And you see that those who are in the 2014, 2015 time frames, the total of the project is nearly about $300 million dollars, about $296 million is estimated to be right now. It also includes $130 million more as part of the rate cases that we have either settled or concluded at CL&P and PSNH. And included in there is up to a total spend of $50 million should we be successful in our rate case at Central Mass Electric.
You have in the past $30 million a year, we propose to spend a total of about $50 million, $20 million more is a result of aging infrastructure and upgrades that are needed. Now in regards to AMI and the additional CapEx spend in Western Mass, to the extent that we do not see rates or revenue recovery father, we will not make those expenditures. We're not going to make them unless we have adequate recovery. The DPUC, that Connecticut DPUC has already started a docket on AMI. The hearings in November, December of this year, and they will render a decision sometime by the end of the first quarter of 2011. As you remember, we have arbitrated for a full rollout of AMI for all 1.2 million customers because we think it’s the least cost approach to rolling out AMI. We've taken the approach to go longer in terms of a rollout because of the issues around U.S. initiatives [ph] on private security and operating protocols, so that's why [indiscernible] just a little bit longer.
We look at generation. Generation is down by about $214 million, that's really for the most part to do with Merrimack. We’ll have contributed [ph] about $150 million to $160 million this year on the Merrimack Scrubber. We reforecasted the price of that again from $4.57 to $4.30. Frankly, we look forward to those units and we probably won't have to spend as much capital as we previously thought. That's your $217 million difference there.
Liquid [ph] gas, for the reasons I indicated before, we see a good growth story there. This five-year look increases by $104 million over the previous five-year look for a total spend of $585 million. And it really centers around four areas. One is running the base of business, the other is just conversion from a lot of customers, about 50% [ph] of the heating in Connecticut is in oil, over 50 percent. A lot of opportunities for natural gas prices in the commodity now and where we think it’ll be for the foreseeable future, the conversions from other gas and also from interruptibles over the firm. We have a large backlog of customers that want to be connected, commercial industrial customers. And so we have a number of projects that would build out supply lines to those areas. And we also have this thing called [inaudible], which is the distribution management program [ph], which is a federally required program to basically take out the old bare steel and [inaudible] piping. So a spend really about [inaudible] on that. Rate base, $714 million, up to $1.1 billion by the end of the five-year planning period, so that's about a 53% increase in rate case [ph], so we really do believe that we can build this company very successfully.
So just for the sake of time, I'm going to curtail [ph] my presentation and turn it over to David McHale, who will take you through the financials."
292525,114943549,1757612,"Northeast Utilities, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Lee, and good morning. I'm to go to speak for just a few moments on business as usual. But business as usual is pretty good these days. We've got third quarter earnings that were released on five, quarter earnings were up 55%. Based on some of",1790,"Thank you, Lee, and good morning. I'm to go to speak for just a few moments on business as usual. But business as usual is pretty good these days. We've got third quarter earnings that were released on five, quarter earnings were up 55%. Based on some of the structural trends that we're seeing for the year, we've also increased guidance. Remember, we started this year with a view of midpoint around $1.90 a share, midpoint for this new guidance is $2.15. I'm going to talk a little bit about how that works its way into 2011 as well. 
The cash flow story has always been important for us as a company. It really speaks to the finance-ability of our rate-base plan because of bonus appreciation and a number of really key drivers this year, we're ahead of schedule. We accretively told you that we expected FFO to climb by about $100 million a year. Couple of years from now, we'll be at over $1 billion of FFO compared to maybe two years ago when we were half that. Very, very strong asset of our overall plan. 
In the cornerstone of our stand-alone plan is that rate-based growth that we've gone through, marrying that with the NSTAR plan is going to, I think, address this compelling total return story that Chuck and Tom referred to earlier this morning. And I'm just going to summarize that for you. I won't go through all those details. But first, with the quarter, because there's a couple of things that we want to point out. You see the numbers here on your right, $100.5 million in the quarter for earnings, driven surprisingly by the Distribution business. The Transition business, right on course, actually a little bit ahead of schedule, September is about $2.6 billion, that's up about $140 million over last year. And once we get into this greater Springfield project, that'll drive 2011. But in terms of what's really happening behind the scenes, and it's to be expected, the distribution business is now, particularly coming off [indiscernible] you’re seeing those things earnings being driven. 
And of course, there's a weather effect here. But the to look at what's happening this year, and it’s going work to into our views for both guidance and next year, really good progress around O&M management, extraordinarily good progress around our uncollectible expense relative to expectation, whether it's about $10 million of earnings in this quarter and also the rate cases. If there's a soft spot, and you've seen this, it's around sales. When we reported second quarter and we talked to you in August, we were seeing a little bit of optimism in terms of year-over-year growth. I think April was a good month. May was a good month. June was a little bit a low month, but we've seen some summer doldrums in July and August. Now the real sales, of course, are up 6.5%. But for the quarter, weather-normalized sales were down at about 4.4% and we seemed to re-hit [ph] industrial and commercial. 
Now the good news is, when we look at look at September alone, [indiscernible] with the commercial sector, we see in Connecticut strong export-driven growth. We see an increase in average work week, but no question that we’re not getting the real growth that maybe we saw or maybe held some promise in the summer. We've even seen employment in the region soften a little bit, particularly in Connecticut. So this is something that we'll look at. Now you know from our conversations in the past that some of our states like Connecticut and New Hampshire, 2/3 of our revenue, our distribution revenue, is tied to the fixed component of our rate structure. So while we don't call it outright decoupling, we're collecting a lot of revenues through customer charges and demand charges. So our balance business model is not as sensitive as a unit sales growth, and certainly even for so for 2011, we're not dependent on a recovery in the economy. It certainly helps, but the overall investment to program, I think, weathers some of what we're seeing there.
When you look at these individual components, I won’t spend a great deal of time on this. Yankee Gas [ph] is a little bit different in terms of their sales equation. They are, as Lee suggested, seeing weather-normalized sales growth of about 6%. They had a very mild winter, so their real sales this year is off about 20%. But the real drivers here are, again, the rate cases that we're seeing in Connecticut and in New Hampshire in O&M. Now O&M in particular is driven by real productivity benefits that we're seeing. I don't think these are sort of one-off occurrences. I think you're going to see this as one of the rationales of why we're optimistic about 2010 and 2011. 
Uncollectible expense has been a great story within the story. For the uncollectible expense in the company that is not tracked through our rate, last year, it cost our company's $47 million pretax to hit bottom line. When we started this year, we thought we’d see an improvement. We had built into our plan about $35 million. Right now, we are trending more like $25 million. So good story there, and that will fall right to the bottom line. And I think that also translates into 2011. For PSNH, it's that plus, it's good, HPPC [ph] growth coming out of the Merrimack project.
You've already seen this exhibit, I'm sure. A couple of things I really want to clarify here, I'm sure over-complicated this exhibit by showing you both GAAP and non-GAAP that I mentioned. What's important is the asterisk. We are saying that our guidance this year can be $2.10 to $2.20 per share, that's both GAAP and non-GAAP. And what's happening behind the scenes here is that we have, in this quarter, it's not reflected yet in our financial results, resolved an [indiscernible] tax item that is going to produce what we’re referring to as a nonrecurring gain. You're going to see that in the quarter. It’s worth about $16 million, $0.09 a share. It's not going to happen next year. It's not going to happen in the future. We call that non-recurring. 
We also are going to begin, as well as our partners, to the [ph] transaction cost associated with the merger here in the quarter as well. Those are equal roughly and offsetting, $0.09 gain, $0.07 cost. And so that's why both on a GAAP and non-GAAP, we get back to that $2.10 to $2.20. But when you think about the earnings capability of this company from what we are about those top line. One of the $1.20 for distribution and $1 for the transmission business. Those are little bit ahead of plan. Again, why are they ahead of plan? And plan, by the way, was updated in August. So this is our second time we’ve guided higher. It’s [indiscernible] for sure, but it's the O&M. It's the uncollectibles. It’s the tax benefits that we’ve received as we’re driving down the company's overall effective tax rate.
Now what I don't have on here, that we would’ve showed you last year, is forward guidance. We have stopped short of showing you 2011 guidance, not because we are not confident around 2011, but because we are partnering with NSTAR. They would typically put out guidance when they complete the year and at the turn of the year show you their view of 2011. We're going to do the same. That said, we know where our consensus is, roughly about $2.20 for 2011, maybe $2.21 depending on how you count that out. We think that's conservative, in part because what I'm telling around the structural trends that we see at O&M. We're not going to carry weather forward for sure, but the way that we're managing our business, including, as Lee suggested, all the projects that are now in place. 
So if you think of what’s driving our earnings for 2011, the year was already set off very, very well. Greater Springfield is driving earnings. By the time we finish 2011, that will be over $300 million in rate base alone. The Merrimack Scrubber project, that is driving earnings going into 2011 for the full year of a case, a full year at PSNH rate case. As you know, we're in the middle of a Massachusetts rate case, so all those fundamentals I think, are poised well. Now on the margins, there are things that we are studying pretty hard: sales, pension expense and the like. But I think that’s already dealt in some of my views. So the consensus out there is good, but I think it is conservative. When we report for the full year, we'll give you sort of line by line segment guidance for the take away is. It's been a strong year for us, 2011 is going to be another very, very attractive you overall.
Now on the CapEx, I won't go through all this, but just to summarize what Lee has positioned there. And we've got a little bit of a callout table by segment on the right $6.64 billion. These bars that you see were the year-by-year spending in 2011 through 2015, we have sort of superimposed for you here last year's plan so you can get your model fine-tuned pretty well. And then just to summarize the overall program, again, the cornerstone of the stand-alone plan is this rate-based growth. It adds to another 9.2% overall CAGR. The underlying transmission growth is a double-digit CAGR 10.7%.
Because of the merger, we’re going to stop short of saying what the stand-alone growth is. You know from our discussion and from Tom, and Chuck this morning, we’re at that highest end of 6% to 9%. We are going to stop short of talking about what our stand-alone dividend policy is. It was 50%, now our dividend policy going forward is to drive dividend growth consistent with earnings. We're going to stop short of talking about the overall finance ability. We’re going to give you more definition of what we're doing in 2011. This program will still need some debt financing. Not a problem, we have great access to capital. Regulators are supportive of that. Much of the overall approvals, state-by-state are in place. The one thing that of course is different, there is no equity required to get this plan done. That certainly is beneficial for the numbers overall. And it's also [indiscernible] cash flow profile going forward. 
Now I'm going to pause there and give my partner Jim Judge an opportunity to run through a few slides covering their quarter."
292525,114943549,1757612,"Northeast Utilities, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, David. Good morning, folks. I'm going to finish up, I guess, with about seven or eight slides. And the three takeaways that I’d like you to walk away from my comments are this. First of all, NSTAR has an outstanding track record. I realize th",1511,"Thank you, David. Good morning, folks. I'm going to finish up, I guess, with about seven or eight slides. And the three takeaways that I’d like you to walk away from my comments are this. First of all, NSTAR has an outstanding track record. I realize this is actually the utilities [ph] My guess is a lot of you are familiar with the NU story. This is an opportunity to give you some perspective on who the new partner is. The second takeaway is that we just finished yet another very strong quarter, estimates for the quarter, and I’ll provide a little bit of color on these results.
The third message is really to tell you how very excited I am about this strategic combination. And this is really a transaction that makes so much sense on many fronts. What you have here is the best-in-class transmission planer and operator coming together with the best-in-class distribution operator. What you have here is a cash-rich utility coming together with a project-rich utility. What you have here are two top-flight management teams coming together to make an even stronger one. And I often say that the best indication of what a management team is going to do for you in the future is take a look of their track record, their past. These are two companies that have outstanding record in terms of delivering results to shareholders.
Just when you thought you had seen enough Safe Harbor language, here's one more slide. My lawyers, too, wanted me to remind you that we’ll be making some forward-looking statements, and you should and can review any further disclosures in our reports to the SEC.
For those of you who [indiscernible] NSTAR, business philosophy that is actually very simple. We believe that if you deliver excellent customer service, your customers will be happy, customers are happy, your regulators are happy, and when the regulators are happy, financial success usually follows. The model that we’ve followed for several years, expanding on that very first [indiscernible] about customer service and reliability, is really a half-dozen key metrics that gauge the performance of a distribution utility: the number of outages, the length of outages, the call center performance, billing accuracy and timeliness, every single one of those measures is in the top quartile. Many of them in the top percent of the industry. So we have some excellent customer service, excellent customer service track record. It’s no wonder that our JD Power scores, in terms of customer satisfaction, are the highest in the region. And have improved for four straight years. I'm very confident that with this philosophy, [indiscernible] company will be able to do even more.
From a regulatory standpoint, NSTAR has a very, very long history of rate settlements, working effectively with our regulators and long-term settlements in a win for the shareholders as well as the customers. In fact, we look at this as a core competency of our management team. We haven't had a litigated rate increase since 1986. That's 25 years. I see no reason why we can't continue this. Actually, that span of 25 years, it involves six governors, five attorney generals, more than 20 CPC commissioners. So obviously, we've been able to sort of exercise these skills in a number of different regulatory climates. Tom and I have been involved in every one of these negotiations, and I think I'd speak for both of us when I say we have never been more confident about our ability to do yet another settlement in the back end of this rate deal that expires at the end of 2012.
Key element of the NSTAR earnings growth story has been our ability to improve productivity and control costs. You can see that spending in 2009 went down. That was all discretionary nature. These cuts are really never at the expense of customer service and reliability. One Wall Street analyst, who I think is actually here, wrote in the past that “NSTAR's O&M discipline is as unmatched by any utility I can think of,” and the numbers support that.
Over the last many years, we have – our earnings growth is outperforming Philly [ph] peers. In our second quarter report, we did increase the upper end of our guidance range to $2.50. Like David mentioned, we like to exclude from this onetime items. We actually had three onetime items this year that I should note. We earned $1.03 on the sale of [indiscernible] business in the second quarter. We just announced a settlement with the IRS that covered seven years and in the [ph] quarter. And we will have some tax-related expenses in the fourth quarter.
As a result of solid earnings performance, we've been able to increase the dividend 7% last November, the 12th year in a row that we’ve increased the dividend. Our payout ratio continues to be conservative in the low 60s. And we feel very confident, as David mentioned, we have the prospects of, on a combined basis, higher earnings per share growth that will fuel higher dividend growth, and we expected dividend growth to continue to track earnings going forward.
We are particularly proud of the job we’ve done for our shareholders. As this graph shows, our total shareholder return has increased steadily over the past 13 years. $1,000 invested in NSTAR at the start of the period is worth over $5,000 today. Actually, updated for 2010, we've provide shareholders another 18% already this year, so I'm pretty confident we'll be able to say 14 years now and counting. To put that performance in perspective, you won’t be able to find another utility in the country that has more than three consecutive years of positive total shareholder returns.
Also to put it into perspective, we've done a little bit of research, you will find any company in an industry, manufacturing, high-tech, retail, banking, that can match that track record of consistent total shareholder return increases year in, year out.
So while our financial performance has been off the charts, one thing investments are also concerned with is the financial condition of their investment. And this slide says all you need to know about NSTAR. Our financial condition is number one in the industry with the highest credit rating. So a very long record of providing great returns, but also, clearly, a very strong commitment to maintaining excellent credit quality. I think both of those values will continue within the new company.
An update on transmission. Obviously, Mass [ph] Utility is the poster child of transmission development, but I do want point out that NSTAR has doubled its transmission rate base in the past five years. And we have projects in the queue that will allow us to double it again in the next five years. We have basically based [ph] on reliability and capability projects number of year. That's about $100 million a year on average. We are currently licensing a new 345-kV new line over the canal. That's $120 million investment currently before the Energy Facilities Siting Board in Massachusetts. We expect spending will occur in 2011 and '12. We expect that to be in service by year end '12.
Our next two projects, relatively new, we have a circuit reliability project, the 345-kV line into the timeframe 2014, ’15 is expected construction. We also have 115-kV line that we're stalling down in the Mid-Cape that basically will extend the benefit of the line that we have going over the canal. The bottom of bullet [ph] there Northern Pass, Chuck has covered the; Hydro-Québec project, and a number of folks have talked about the potential of accessing that northern New England, the consortium project.
We did just have a great quarter. Released earnings after the market closed Friday. We still have benefited from an 8% growth in sales that reflected the hot weather in the Boston area. In addition to the sales increase from the weather, we did pick up $0.02 from our annual PVR inflation adjustment related to our rate settlement. The lower interest costs compared to a year ago. They gave us $0.03, and we did just execute a share repurchase that, when you compare with last year's numbers, basically provided a $0.03 in earnings. Offsetting those items are items that are in line with our guidance, increased O&M, increased property taxes associated with our capital spending or rate-based growth. Lastly, we did sell the [indiscernible] business, so in this quarter, the absence of earnings associated with that [indiscernible] sale, which is $0.02. 
I do want to take a minute to talk about income tax settlement that you see in the footnotes. It's a positive development. It resolves all outstanding tax issues that we have from 2001 to 2007. What it does free up is a tax refund of $135 million we expect to receive by the end of the year.
That's really it for my overview. I'd now like to turn it back to Tom and Chuck for our closing messages and then, obviously, questions will follow."

This is a somewhat early hour. But we have a multi-faceted presentation for you today. We're trying to do a number of things, the first and probably, the foremost, of course, is Tom and I would like to spend a little more time talking about the merger. We've had a lot of conversations since we announced it, but there are some questions that some of you have asked. We'll try to hit those head on today, but clearly, we'll both be around for a few days and give you the opportunity to talk to us privately, if you'd like.
The second thing is we both had our earnings releases out. You saw that the third quarter for both companies was very good. NU also increased its guidance for 2010. And so, we'll get this later on in the presentation. We'll have Dave McHale and Jim Muntz talk a little bit about the respective quarters for each of our companies.
And for NU, I know a lot of you view this morning as a way to get updated on [indiscernible] on some of our major projects. So when Tom and I get finished talking a little bit about the merger, Lee's going to spend some time giving you an update on the status and on the capital expenditures around some of the major projects. So that's what we're going to try to accomplish today. Please ask questions as you get the opportunity because we really would like to have this discussion.
So if you go to Page 5. We've spent a lot of time talking to a number of you privately, but this really is a compelling combination. And I would tell you that I have not met anyone that hasn't said, logically, this makes sense. This strategic for the industrial logic its [ph] combination is compelling. We think it's going to be a tremendously exciting new company at closure. We talked about closure being nine to 12 months away. You'll here Tom being a little bit optimistic about, let's try to do it in nine months. I think we can actually accomplish that, and I think that's where we should be headed. We have a significant transformation opportunity to Nu. We've talked to you about those over the last number of years, and we combine that we the balance, strength that we have with NSTAR and the cash flow, it allows us to really expand on those projects in a way that is more effective from a financial standpoint.
This new company is larger. It will be the 15th to the 17th largest utility in the country, depending on how you measure it. And it is more diverse and much better positioned to support the economic growth and renewables in New England. I think, and you have heard me say this before, New England is an inflection point. They've got Reg E requirements. They've got RPS requirements. And if you play those out over the next few years, we need to do something to make that happen. I think this new company is going to be positioned in a way that it will be able to help make that happen for the benefit of not only our stockholders but for the benefit of the customers and for the region. This is clearly accretive to earnings in year one, and we think provides not only increased earnings and dividend potential but an enhanced total shareholder return. The service quality capabilities are enhanced. It is the largest customer base in New England. You've seen the map many, many times that shows the low centers in New England. It's Boston, it's Connecticut. As the two companies have a significant portion of that New England population. 
And then a highly experienced and complementary leadership team with a proven track record. You've heard us talk a lot about the similarities of these two companies. We've worked together for a number of years. Restoration, as we've had storms. We’ve sent crews to NSTAR, NSTAR has sent crews to our service territories. So we've worked together. We know how that works. And the Hydro-Québec project is just one more example, and probably the most recent example, of the two companies working together. And I think as that proven track record showed, this then becomes the next logical step in that process.
If you go to the next slide. You've seen this before. We expect to close in nine to 12 months. Dual headquarters in both Hartford and Boston. Tom will spend a little bit more time talking about that. NU will be the company's name, the consideration is 100% NU shares. The exchange ratio, as you can see, is 1.312. Shares for NU per NSTAR share is split about $56.44 [ph]. The dividend increase will be about a 20% increase for NU shareholders. And [indiscernible] for NSTAR shareholders, and from a government standpoint, I will become the non-Executive Chairman at this point of closure. Tom will be president and CEO. There will be 14 board members. Tom and I will each be on the board, and there will be six independent members from each one of our existing companies.
So as you look at this, this truly is a merger of equals. And we think you'll see that from the government standpoint, from the management standpoint, from just about any perspective, this is just as balanced as an entity can be.
Specific benefits to NU shareholders, we’ve talked about approximately 20% dividend increase. That number’s about right. It can vary by two or three percentage points, whether you calculate it today or whether you calculate it on what you project it to be at the time of closer. The cash flow increased to eliminate the equity issuance. We talk to you from NU standpoint, about the fact that we expected to have about $300 million equity issuance in 2012. Essentially, that equity issuance goes away. And for the foreseeable future, as we look at our five-year plan, we don't see any equity issuance in that plan.
Likely credit upgrades, obviously, the benefit of reduction in debt issuance and lower interest rates, we think that will be helpful. Increased market liquidity, a number of you have difficult times buying either us or NSTAR because of the size of the organization. So if we put these two together, the market liquidity obviously expands dramatically and gives you the opportunity to buy shares in a much larger company. Increased opportunities to reduce cost over time, and this is one of those things that you ask us a lot. And this takes the form of many different kinds of questions, but it is basically [ph] of synergy. And if you could tell us exactly how much there is in day one, day two and day three, that would be appreciated also.
But this merger is not predicated on synergies. It's predicated on providing growth to the region and being able to, in a way that neither one of us can right now, answer questions and provide solutions for our customers. That ultimately will help the shareholders of this combined company.
Now clearly if we do that, there will be opportunities for improvement in the effectiveness of these organizations. There will be a change in the composition of some of our employees, but we would expect to handle most of that through voluntary attrition and through retirement. There will be best practices. There will benefits of putting these large systems that we have together. So there will be the ability to reduce cost over time, and that will flow to the benefit of not only the customers but also of our shareholders. And as I said earlier, the ability to achieve a higher earnings growth rate.
We have talked to you about it being accretive. We probably didn't give you the exact numbers on each of one of these. We're going to point out some of the things to take us from somewhere in the 6% to 9% growth rate that we previously were to something toward the upper end of that 6% to 9% growth rate. Obviously, the additional shares are negative to that. But for that, we get NSTAR's earnings growth, which is significant. We get the avoidance of the equity issuance that we just talked about, lower financing costs, less current parent debt and the implementation of best practices. So as we look across the spectrum for the next few years, there are going to be many real benefit to this merger in a way that will allow us to increase our earnings and ultimately our dividends at a rate that was higher than we thought we could do before and certainly at a rate that's higher that either one of the stand-alone companies.
Let's take it back about, probably two or three years now. We had a conversation with one of these leading about the [indiscernible] standard and about Reg E and about what we saw as the inability of Connecticut and the region to meet those standards if something didn't happen. What ultimately came out of that is the Hydro-Québec project. And as you know, we've made significant progress on that, and this is probably the first time that we've been able to say, ""We actually signed that thing,"" as opposed to, ""Trust us, it's moving along well."" It's hard to know exactly what the future is going to be like. And sometimes we look at the future in a static environment, and we don't think that it as dynamic. Three years ago, we wouldn't have talked about Hydro-Québec. Now it is becoming a reality, and it is a business model, it's a participant pay model that may be the kind of model that allows us to deal with some of these larger renewable issues in the future. 
This slide is simply something that we talked to you before. We called it the consortium. It's really a group of four companies, NSTAR, United Illuminating, National Grid and ourselves, that are making progress on this project. It's not complete yet, and there's still a lot of work to do, but it's gone past the conceptual stage. So as we look at the possibility of bringing onshore wind [ph], typically in northern New Hampshire and in Maine, down into the low centers, this kind of project has a real possibility. 250 to 300 miles long, probably 1,600 megawatts, something around $1.5 billion in cost and a participant pay model that may allow us to bundle the generation and the transmission together and make that available to the load centers in the region. We'll talk to you more about this as it continues down the path. But this is a real project that we think we will be able to move forward. It's not in the five-year financial plans right now. But it is something, clearly, that we think this new company will be able to do in a way that's better than either one of our existing companies. 
And then the last slide is the Northern Pass, or the Hydro-Québec project. We own 75%, NSTAR owns 25%. It's closing, obviously. So the new company just owns [ph] 100 percent. 1,200 megawatts of transfer capability. We have announced the Southern terminus [ph], which is Franklin, New Hampshire. The northern part, obviously, is a Concept [ph] station in Québec. We gave you an update on the cost of that project, it's about $1.1 billion now. The TSA was signed on October 4. The permitting process started on the 14th with the U.S. application for the DOE. PPAs are under discussion and we’ll probably be filing the project with FERC -- not probably, we will be filing the project with FERC this quarter, probably in the month of November.
So that project is moving along. I know you've had a number of questions, and we kept saying, “This is moving along, we will get there,” and, in fact, signing the TSA was a big milestone. We've still a lot of work to do. We've got to get all the approvals. Then we’ve got to get the [indiscernible] approved, we've got to build it. But it's moving along quite nicely, and it really is the kind of project, I think, that can be duplicated elsewhere. It's going to be easier for a company the size of this new company to do this kind of project, I think, than it would have been for us on a stand-alone basis. 
So with that, let me turn it over to Tom."

Good morning, everyone. I'm losing my voice. A summer cold, I guess, 90 degrees today, they’re saying. But bear with me, and I'll try to make it through. The Hydro-Québec project is something that Chuck thought up many, many years ago, and it kind of shows the potential. Laughing, we call it my dowry. He gave 25%, and now he took it back. But here's a project that will reduce the cost of energy in the region, but yet will remove five times the carbon of the infamous Cape Wind project. So it really is a project that moves the needle dramatically from an environmental perspective, but doesn't have a negative impact on our economy. In fact, it helps our economy. So it’s a really exciting project. 
And speaking about an exciting project, how about this merger? I like to tell my employees that I've always been interested in an industry that consolidates. Unfortunately, regulators don't always agree with us the way you should do it. But this is the perfect deal at the right time for both companies. As Chuck said, the whole world of environment and economy have come together, and it needs strong players, not two smaller players, but large and strong players, to help local governments and even national government to figure out an economic and an environmental policy that make sense for our region and the country. So bringing these two companies together is just such an exciting opportunity for us. 
One of the things that, of course, all of our shareholders, Chuck and I spent the first three or four days running every one of our large shareholders just to get a reaction and tell them why we thought this was so exciting. And the reaction has been overwhelming, if you see the way our stock prices have traded for the first two weeks after the announcement. I think it's traded better than any deal that's been in our space for about the last five or 10 years. And we did work very, very hard to create something that was a merger of equals. In fact, I think I will be forever grateful that Chuck is entrusting his shareholders in my hands for some time after the close.
But for the NSTAR shareholders, we really do see an opportunity to use what we have built over the years, which, in my view is [indiscernible] balance sheet to instead of be a company that could financially accelerate its growth, be a company that could invest to accelerate its growth. So it's a perfect combination of using our balance sheet to get the kind of growth that will clearly outperform that in the industry. I think both companies have a great track record of the last few years of outperformance. I think this will ensure that we will outperform for some time to come. And that's important to me, who has a lot of pride in what we've done for our shareholders.
Also, this large footprint. There at one point in time were about six transmission projects, the Green Line that was going to come by sea, one is by sea, one is by land. We had all sorts of projects that we're trying to get these wind power in the north down into the low centers, and every one of them wanted to land in Boston, where we have almost five million people. And so the combination of our load centers in our map and the Northeast Utilities expertise, you all have seen what they have been able to do with their Transmission business over the last few years, really puts us in a unique position to take advantage of it. As Chuck said, we're not exactly sure what's that’s going to the look like, but we do believe that when Lee comes up here and tells you about the Transmission business, that there are things on top of that, that will evolve in the next few years.
One also of the most exciting things, and you'll see it in the slide in a minute, we really are balancing our risk. I really do believe we're creating a lower risk, higher growth opportunity for investors. We really are balancing our regulatory risk between Connecticut, the federal government or FERC, and Massachusetts. And that balance should help us in the long run to really maintain a more consistent and constant earnings growth stream. So we're very excited about what this has in store for our shareholders. 
And speaking of record of delivering on our promises to our shareholders, both companies have a proud history. We've been on a roll. And most importantly, I think that this is going to let us continue that track record which, again, the goal is to outperform the industry. 
The next slide does show this balance in our regulated businesses. And I think that -- I just love this slide because of the way it shows how we at NSTAR will be reducing the all-in-one. We've had a great history in Massachusetts, and we expect that to continue for some time. But to have this kind of balance, I think, does provide the kind of risk profile that will allow us to be very successful going forward.
We put together, Chuck and I have worked diligently. I know many of you can't wait to get your hands on the proxy so you can see about our love story. He wasn't skating in Harvard or anything like that, but we did spend a lot of time together over the last four months. And one of the things that we really were concerned about is putting together the kind of team that would carry on the tradition, that would carry on those return numbers that we just showed a few minutes ago. So we have put a team together, a balanced team. We’re very excited about them. And you can see that we have three and three. Three from a Northeast Utilities background, three from NSTAR backgrounds. And we look forward to working together to create the kind of company that every one of us is proud of.
The timeline, Chuck said I'm very optimistic in this. I've actually challenged my people to get it done in six months. But it all depends on how the election goes tomorrow night as to how quickly we get this done. But there have been an incredible reaction to this transaction from our politicians, our regulators and all of you. It really has been well received, and it's going very well and people want to help us to get on with the game. They really want help us get through the process. There's no one throwing road blocks. There's no one saying this is stupid. And so Chuck and his team spent a lot of time in Connecticut talking to the regulators. It's a one-state approval. Connecticut has said that they don't believe they have any roll in the approval process, so we have to go through Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. Essentially, that's the critical path to this. And in Massachusetts, we have a no net harm standard, which means we don't have to go through any kind of rate process. In fact, our company is operating under a rate freeze until 2013. So there is no need to talk about rate with respect to this filing. There's lots of history, a lot of precedents for going through and approving mergers, and so we're just looking for a window when the DPU is not too busy. And we can expect, as you can see here, to file probably in November, have hearings in January and then it's up to them as to how quickly they issue an order. And hopefully, that will be on the quicker side.
There's lots of reasons why -- and we at NSTAR have enjoyed a higher multiple in the industry because many of you have looked at us as an investment opportunity, as I mentioned earlier, that's low-risk and high growth. A pretty good combination. But there are lots of characteristics that are responsible for a company having a premier valuation. And I think the slide has just about every single one of those factors that allow companies to be treated differently or special. We seem to have created a company that has every single one of them, whether it's that significant growth prospect that Chuck had mentioned, whether it's the strong earnings and dividend growth prospects, whether it's that diversification of income that we now have that seems so balanced, the management team we put together. I think you can our track records. We care about shareholder returns. That's what drives us. That's what we have delivered for many, many years. And we can do it all with a wonderful cash flow, very, very strong cash flow. We do not need to dilute these earnings going forward.
I'm told that when something is said at this conference, it becomes public information, and you can use it. So I'm going to borrow something. I don't know if Steve Fleishman is here. But I heard him yesterday tell his investors that this is a stock that you all should own. And I honestly believe it. I believe it's the best total return opportunity in this industry.
I'm going to leave it at that and introduce the great Lee Olivier, our Chief Operating Officer, to tell you how he's going to help us to invest all this great cash flow."

Because of the merger, but also because of the many accomplishments we've had the course of this past year in terms of our major capital programs. And all of our projects [indiscernible] environmental aspects of it [indiscernible]. But I don't think there's a company that's more for the environment, if not the for the last few years, between the [indiscernible] project, which essentially for the most part shut down all of the major oil, coal-fired power plants that used to how to do it [ph] because of the reliability, obviously the building of the scrubber that's created most of the CO2, not the CO2, but the nitrogen oxide and other pollutants in the air and of course, our solar program in Western Massachusetts, as well as this consortium project that we’re talking about. Really is a major initiative to improve the environment [indiscernible] of our region. So they're good for shareholders, good for customers and good for the environment.
The plans has about $6.6 billion of capital spend. That's up about $200 million over last year's plan. I'll go through that in a few sides. Of note, about Transmission, makes up about half of that capital spend and then you'll see that the transmission CapEx continues to stay strong as we go forward. And as Chuck indicated, there is really no capital in here for any of the transmission that would be built around the consortium project, which could be up in the range of a couple of billion dollars. But as he said, that's a real project. That is moving forward. We'll have more information on that later this year.
When you look at Transmission, we’ve had great success with specifically the new project for the reliability segment in that project. That was a project that we said would cost about $714 million. It's now pegged at $795 million. That is a very, very good price. We received approval, both in Connecticut and in Massachusetts. And we'll start construction on the first major substation of the people [ph] project in the December time frame. We're going to finish up the environmental committee and engineering over the winter. Then we’ll be into full-blown capital construction of that project [ph] lines next year. So we’ll have about a couple of hundred million dollars of CapEx spend next year. That takes a lot of the uncertainty around that project. We are also, in this meeting, we’ll update you on the overall cost of the news project. There’s been a number of changes there. The project [indiscernible] in the Central Connecticut portion of the project shifted out about a year. We'll give you updates on that as well. 
We also are happy with having rate certainty around the deployment of capital in the two big electric company's [indiscernible] about a five-year settlement, [indiscernible] we have a rate case of 2012 and we can probably stretch it a little bit more. But we have certainty around the capital deployment and the recovery of that capital. 
When we look at generation, the Merrimack Scrubber project is really on schedule. It's on the budget. If you remember, we said that project would cost about $547 million. We have now reforecasted that project to be about $430 million. It will still finish on time, in the middle of 2012, but really, just, again, solid progress there as well.
And recently, we completed about 1.8 megawatts of solar at Western Mass Electric. We kind of threw the switch on that last week. We’re going to start about another 4.2 megawatts of solar as part of a $41 million capital plan that we've got previously approved by the Massachusetts DPU. So we’ll have about 6 megawatts of solar in place by the end of 2011, beginning of 2012.
[indiscernible] Gas, another great growth story. Our project, one was the Waterbury pipeline project, about a $67 million project, is almost half complete. It's right on schedule. It's under budget. That's a project that's going to take about two years to connect a lot of customers. We're able to ask customers [ph] interruptible [ph] customers. And we’ve seen a host of other investment opportunities in and around business [ph] in a fairly significant way. And then they put it together with the NSTAR 300,000 driven thousand gas [ph], you've got a gas customer base that's about 500,000 customers, so real growth opportunities. 
[Indiscernible] we’ve kind of covered most of the highlights, the siding decision that we did yet from both Massachusetts and Connecticut was almost exactly what we wanted. We had very few interveners in that project. You see great expectance from the local community and municipal official. Again, start construction on the project in the December timeframe, and the project will be complete in service in 2013. 
Now in the appendix of the presentation is that slide that we always put in there that updates you on each of the three segments and the key milestones, so you can see exactly when those will take place. The Interstate Liability project [ph] [indiscernible] given it’s new for that project earlier this year. We're going to have a meeting late this month with the New England Advisory Committee, where we and our partners, which is National Grid, will present the overall Interstate Reliability project to the past [ph] committee and of course National Grid has [indiscernible] that's over in Rhode Island and in Massachusetts. And as a result of that, we would expect shortly thereafter to see that go ahead from ISO, in which case, we will start deciding of the IRP project [ph] in the third quarter of 2011 for the project to be completed and in service by 2015.
So again, we're very, very positive with the -- escalated the cost of that project which you'll see in the next slide, based upon just the fact that it's shifted out essentially a year. And the Central Connecticut portion of the project is still under review by ISO, and it’s being reviewed again by [ph] prospects of a number of generators that could potentially retire. So those of you that follow New England, in particularly Connecticut, you know that many of the generators there, with the exception of exception of the liquid generated, for the most part, don't run. They [indiscernible] shut down and the revenue proceeds are essentially all around the forward capacity market pricing, and that continues to drop. Every time [indiscernible] 2014 time frame, the floor goes away. We expect that there will be retirement and we would expect also to evaluate those against the market and render a decision on the new date of that project. Now they believe it’s needed, it's just a matter of the timing of the date. We expect to get that by the end of the first quarter or beginning of the second quarter of next year. 
This next slide is kind of a busy slide, but what we wanted to do for you is kind of do the math for you and reconcile the cost of these projects. And as you remember, we've had this $1.49 billion cost of news for some period of time, but as a result of having the final construction cost estimate and the final planning around selling, general and administrative expenses R&T, we escalated that to $795 million. As a result of the other two projects shifting about a year and some other projects allocated to that, we escalated those costs. And we arrived in this bucket of $200 million of other news-related cost. And what we've down here is disposition those inside of this slide. So the new cost of news goes to $1.518 billion. However, United Illuminating, our neighbor in Connecticut, will have essentially about an 8.4% ownership of the assets that are inside of Connecticut. And that would be up to about $69 million. So when you do the math, subtract that from the $1.518 billion, you come up with a new project cost of $1.449 billion with all of the cash flows as you see them right now on that particular slide. So finally, that $84 million on the bottom of the slide, it's been $84 million of projects that are approved, underway and in many cases, some of been have done. The remainder of that $200 million is embedded into the other segments of the project.
Now Chuck talked about the Northern Pass or the HBDC [ph] projects. And we are extremely confident in getting this project done in terms of the projects that we have made with the TSA being signed with HQ. We’ll file that TSA by the end of this month with FERC. We expect to have the order back somewhere around late January, early February. We have filed with the DOE for the presidential permit, which is a permit that you need to cross over into Canada. That permit just does two things because there’s an environmental impact of building the line. It ensures that would align process opens [ph] into another country, that it doesn't cause any undue security from the energy standpoint is to building the line. 
Some other key milestones. We will begin all of our engineering, life long lead time, [indiscernible] conversion station in 2011 and start construction of the project in 2013 for completion in late 2013. The person that is leading that project, Jim Muntz, is our President of transmission [indiscernible] project director for $1.2 billion middle [ph] project is leading that in that effort. All of the roll out that we’ve had so far with business leaders, government leaders in the various communities has been very, very, very positive. So this has been well accepted inside of New Hampshire. So we will continue to give you updates on this. 
If you look at the bottom of that slide, there's an asterisk around the cost of $1.1 billion. And that's really all part of a commitment that we have inside of the transmission services agreement to update the cost of the project within 45 days of signing of the TSA. So we will do that later this year. I'm not trying to signal that the project cost will go up or even change in any way. But if it does, obviously, in a material way, we will advise you of that through the HA [ph] process. So solid year in terms of this project moving forward.
This next slide looks at our CapEx, and it's kind of the look at the past and a look forward. You can see the spend has been up in the past about $2.8 billion, the spend going forward is about $2.8 billion. And again, as Chuck indicated, there really is no CapEx here for the consortium project. In terms of the CapEx here, that could be another additional $1 billion of CapEx that could be coming in the very near future.
First of all, through the bucket moves [ph] by $1.5 billion there, we will have spent about $230 million on news by the end of this year, with about $1.2 billion to go. The Northern Pass, the current NU share of that is $830 million and we will advise you of that in terms of -- once we get into sighting and engineering. In the appendix, an update on the last bucket which it was $845 million. And those are smaller projects, which is spread throughout the new state region and I think the good news there is that 90 percent of those projects either are already inside of the region system plan or they don't need to be inside the regional system plan. That shows that the confidence level of building that $845 million is very, very high. So that's kind of a look, the three-bucket look, very similar to what you’ve seen in the past. 
When you look at the electric distribution generation spend, the distribution has increased $437 million over the previous five-year term [ph] period. And many of the reason why it's increased is because this three-year is $217 million for the rollout of AMI Smart Grid inside of Connecticut Light and Power. And you see that those who are in the 2014, 2015 time frames, the total of the project is nearly about $300 million dollars, about $296 million is estimated to be right now. It also includes $130 million more as part of the rate cases that we have either settled or concluded at CL&P and PSNH. And included in there is up to a total spend of $50 million should we be successful in our rate case at Central Mass Electric.
You have in the past $30 million a year, we propose to spend a total of about $50 million, $20 million more is a result of aging infrastructure and upgrades that are needed. Now in regards to AMI and the additional CapEx spend in Western Mass, to the extent that we do not see rates or revenue recovery father, we will not make those expenditures. We're not going to make them unless we have adequate recovery. The DPUC, that Connecticut DPUC has already started a docket on AMI. The hearings in November, December of this year, and they will render a decision sometime by the end of the first quarter of 2011. As you remember, we have arbitrated for a full rollout of AMI for all 1.2 million customers because we think it’s the least cost approach to rolling out AMI. We've taken the approach to go longer in terms of a rollout because of the issues around U.S. initiatives [ph] on private security and operating protocols, so that's why [indiscernible] just a little bit longer.
We look at generation. Generation is down by about $214 million, that's really for the most part to do with Merrimack. We’ll have contributed [ph] about $150 million to $160 million this year on the Merrimack Scrubber. We reforecasted the price of that again from $4.57 to $4.30. Frankly, we look forward to those units and we probably won't have to spend as much capital as we previously thought. That's your $217 million difference there.
Liquid [ph] gas, for the reasons I indicated before, we see a good growth story there. This five-year look increases by $104 million over the previous five-year look for a total spend of $585 million. And it really centers around four areas. One is running the base of business, the other is just conversion from a lot of customers, about 50% [ph] of the heating in Connecticut is in oil, over 50 percent. A lot of opportunities for natural gas prices in the commodity now and where we think it’ll be for the foreseeable future, the conversions from other gas and also from interruptibles over the firm. We have a large backlog of customers that want to be connected, commercial industrial customers. And so we have a number of projects that would build out supply lines to those areas. And we also have this thing called [inaudible], which is the distribution management program [ph], which is a federally required program to basically take out the old bare steel and [inaudible] piping. So a spend really about [inaudible] on that. Rate base, $714 million, up to $1.1 billion by the end of the five-year planning period, so that's about a 53% increase in rate case [ph], so we really do believe that we can build this company very successfully.
So just for the sake of time, I'm going to curtail [ph] my presentation and turn it over to David McHale, who will take you through the financials."
292525,114943549,1760154,"Northeast Utilities, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Lee, and good morning. I'm to go to speak for just a few moments on business as usual. But business as usual is pretty good these days. We've got third quarter earnings that were released on five, quarter earnings were up 55%. Based on some of",1790,"Thank you, Lee, and good morning. I'm to go to speak for just a few moments on business as usual. But business as usual is pretty good these days. We've got third quarter earnings that were released on five, quarter earnings were up 55%. Based on some of the structural trends that we're seeing for the year, we've also increased guidance. Remember, we started this year with a view of midpoint around $1.90 a share, midpoint for this new guidance is $2.15. I'm going to talk a little bit about how that works its way into 2011 as well. 
The cash flow story has always been important for us as a company. It really speaks to the finance-ability of our rate-base plan because of bonus appreciation and a number of really key drivers this year, we're ahead of schedule. We accretively told you that we expected FFO to climb by about $100 million a year. Couple of years from now, we'll be at over $1 billion of FFO compared to maybe two years ago when we were half that. Very, very strong asset of our overall plan. 
In the cornerstone of our stand-alone plan is that rate-based growth that we've gone through, marrying that with the NSTAR plan is going to, I think, address this compelling total return story that Chuck and Tom referred to earlier this morning. And I'm just going to summarize that for you. I won't go through all those details. But first, with the quarter, because there's a couple of things that we want to point out. You see the numbers here on your right, $100.5 million in the quarter for earnings, driven surprisingly by the Distribution business. The Transition business, right on course, actually a little bit ahead of schedule, September is about $2.6 billion, that's up about $140 million over last year. And once we get into this greater Springfield project, that'll drive 2011. But in terms of what's really happening behind the scenes, and it's to be expected, the distribution business is now, particularly coming off [indiscernible] you’re seeing those things earnings being driven. 
And of course, there's a weather effect here. But the to look at what's happening this year, and it’s going work to into our views for both guidance and next year, really good progress around O&M management, extraordinarily good progress around our uncollectible expense relative to expectation, whether it's about $10 million of earnings in this quarter and also the rate cases. If there's a soft spot, and you've seen this, it's around sales. When we reported second quarter and we talked to you in August, we were seeing a little bit of optimism in terms of year-over-year growth. I think April was a good month. May was a good month. June was a little bit a low month, but we've seen some summer doldrums in July and August. Now the real sales, of course, are up 6.5%. But for the quarter, weather-normalized sales were down at about 4.4% and we seemed to re-hit [ph] industrial and commercial. 
Now the good news is, when we look at look at September alone, [indiscernible] with the commercial sector, we see in Connecticut strong export-driven growth. We see an increase in average work week, but no question that we’re not getting the real growth that maybe we saw or maybe held some promise in the summer. We've even seen employment in the region soften a little bit, particularly in Connecticut. So this is something that we'll look at. Now you know from our conversations in the past that some of our states like Connecticut and New Hampshire, 2/3 of our revenue, our distribution revenue, is tied to the fixed component of our rate structure. So while we don't call it outright decoupling, we're collecting a lot of revenues through customer charges and demand charges. So our balance business model is not as sensitive as a unit sales growth, and certainly even for so for 2011, we're not dependent on a recovery in the economy. It certainly helps, but the overall investment to program, I think, weathers some of what we're seeing there.
When you look at these individual components, I won’t spend a great deal of time on this. Yankee Gas [ph] is a little bit different in terms of their sales equation. They are, as Lee suggested, seeing weather-normalized sales growth of about 6%. They had a very mild winter, so their real sales this year is off about 20%. But the real drivers here are, again, the rate cases that we're seeing in Connecticut and in New Hampshire in O&M. Now O&M in particular is driven by real productivity benefits that we're seeing. I don't think these are sort of one-off occurrences. I think you're going to see this as one of the rationales of why we're optimistic about 2010 and 2011. 
Uncollectible expense has been a great story within the story. For the uncollectible expense in the company that is not tracked through our rate, last year, it cost our company's $47 million pretax to hit bottom line. When we started this year, we thought we’d see an improvement. We had built into our plan about $35 million. Right now, we are trending more like $25 million. So good story there, and that will fall right to the bottom line. And I think that also translates into 2011. For PSNH, it's that plus, it's good, HPPC [ph] growth coming out of the Merrimack project.
You've already seen this exhibit, I'm sure. A couple of things I really want to clarify here, I'm sure over-complicated this exhibit by showing you both GAAP and non-GAAP that I mentioned. What's important is the asterisk. We are saying that our guidance this year can be $2.10 to $2.20 per share, that's both GAAP and non-GAAP. And what's happening behind the scenes here is that we have, in this quarter, it's not reflected yet in our financial results, resolved an [indiscernible] tax item that is going to produce what we’re referring to as a nonrecurring gain. You're going to see that in the quarter. It’s worth about $16 million, $0.09 a share. It's not going to happen next year. It's not going to happen in the future. We call that non-recurring. 
We also are going to begin, as well as our partners, to the [ph] transaction cost associated with the merger here in the quarter as well. Those are equal roughly and offsetting, $0.09 gain, $0.07 cost. And so that's why both on a GAAP and non-GAAP, we get back to that $2.10 to $2.20. But when you think about the earnings capability of this company from what we are about those top line. One of the $1.20 for distribution and $1 for the transmission business. Those are little bit ahead of plan. Again, why are they ahead of plan? And plan, by the way, was updated in August. So this is our second time we’ve guided higher. It’s [indiscernible] for sure, but it's the O&M. It's the uncollectibles. It’s the tax benefits that we’ve received as we’re driving down the company's overall effective tax rate.
Now what I don't have on here, that we would’ve showed you last year, is forward guidance. We have stopped short of showing you 2011 guidance, not because we are not confident around 2011, but because we are partnering with NSTAR. They would typically put out guidance when they complete the year and at the turn of the year show you their view of 2011. We're going to do the same. That said, we know where our consensus is, roughly about $2.20 for 2011, maybe $2.21 depending on how you count that out. We think that's conservative, in part because what I'm telling around the structural trends that we see at O&M. We're not going to carry weather forward for sure, but the way that we're managing our business, including, as Lee suggested, all the projects that are now in place. 
So if you think of what’s driving our earnings for 2011, the year was already set off very, very well. Greater Springfield is driving earnings. By the time we finish 2011, that will be over $300 million in rate base alone. The Merrimack Scrubber project, that is driving earnings going into 2011 for the full year of a case, a full year at PSNH rate case. As you know, we're in the middle of a Massachusetts rate case, so all those fundamentals I think, are poised well. Now on the margins, there are things that we are studying pretty hard: sales, pension expense and the like. But I think that’s already dealt in some of my views. So the consensus out there is good, but I think it is conservative. When we report for the full year, we'll give you sort of line by line segment guidance for the take away is. It's been a strong year for us, 2011 is going to be another very, very attractive you overall.
Now on the CapEx, I won't go through all this, but just to summarize what Lee has positioned there. And we've got a little bit of a callout table by segment on the right $6.64 billion. These bars that you see were the year-by-year spending in 2011 through 2015, we have sort of superimposed for you here last year's plan so you can get your model fine-tuned pretty well. And then just to summarize the overall program, again, the cornerstone of the stand-alone plan is this rate-based growth. It adds to another 9.2% overall CAGR. The underlying transmission growth is a double-digit CAGR 10.7%.
Because of the merger, we’re going to stop short of saying what the stand-alone growth is. You know from our discussion and from Tom, and Chuck this morning, we’re at that highest end of 6% to 9%. We are going to stop short of talking about what our stand-alone dividend policy is. It was 50%, now our dividend policy going forward is to drive dividend growth consistent with earnings. We're going to stop short of talking about the overall finance ability. We’re going to give you more definition of what we're doing in 2011. This program will still need some debt financing. Not a problem, we have great access to capital. Regulators are supportive of that. Much of the overall approvals, state-by-state are in place. The one thing that of course is different, there is no equity required to get this plan done. That certainly is beneficial for the numbers overall. And it's also [indiscernible] cash flow profile going forward. 
Now I'm going to pause there and give my partner Jim Judge an opportunity to run through a few slides covering their quarter."
292525,114943549,1760154,"Northeast Utilities, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2010",2010-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, David. Good morning, folks. I'm going to finish up, I guess, with about seven or eight slides. And the three takeaways that I’d like you to walk away from my comments are this. First of all, NSTAR has an outstanding track record. I realize th",1511,"Thank you, David. Good morning, folks. I'm going to finish up, I guess, with about seven or eight slides. And the three takeaways that I’d like you to walk away from my comments are this. First of all, NSTAR has an outstanding track record. I realize this is actually the utilities [ph] My guess is a lot of you are familiar with the NU story. This is an opportunity to give you some perspective on who the new partner is. The second takeaway is that we just finished yet another very strong quarter, estimates for the quarter, and I’ll provide a little bit of color on these results.
The third message is really to tell you how very excited I am about this strategic combination. And this is really a transaction that makes so much sense on many fronts. What you have here is the best-in-class transmission planer and operator coming together with the best-in-class distribution operator. What you have here is a cash-rich utility coming together with a project-rich utility. What you have here are two top-flight management teams coming together to make an even stronger one. And I often say that the best indication of what a management team is going to do for you in the future is take a look of their track record, their past. These are two companies that have outstanding record in terms of delivering results to shareholders.
Just when you thought you had seen enough Safe Harbor language, here's one more slide. My lawyers, too, wanted me to remind you that we’ll be making some forward-looking statements, and you should and can review any further disclosures in our reports to the SEC.
For those of you who [indiscernible] NSTAR, business philosophy that is actually very simple. We believe that if you deliver excellent customer service, your customers will be happy, customers are happy, your regulators are happy, and when the regulators are happy, financial success usually follows. The model that we’ve followed for several years, expanding on that very first [indiscernible] about customer service and reliability, is really a half-dozen key metrics that gauge the performance of a distribution utility: the number of outages, the length of outages, the call center performance, billing accuracy and timeliness, every single one of those measures is in the top quartile. Many of them in the top percent of the industry. So we have some excellent customer service, excellent customer service track record. It’s no wonder that our JD Power scores, in terms of customer satisfaction, are the highest in the region. And have improved for four straight years. I'm very confident that with this philosophy, [indiscernible] company will be able to do even more.
From a regulatory standpoint, NSTAR has a very, very long history of rate settlements, working effectively with our regulators and long-term settlements in a win for the shareholders as well as the customers. In fact, we look at this as a core competency of our management team. We haven't had a litigated rate increase since 1986. That's 25 years. I see no reason why we can't continue this. Actually, that span of 25 years, it involves six governors, five attorney generals, more than 20 CPC commissioners. So obviously, we've been able to sort of exercise these skills in a number of different regulatory climates. Tom and I have been involved in every one of these negotiations, and I think I'd speak for both of us when I say we have never been more confident about our ability to do yet another settlement in the back end of this rate deal that expires at the end of 2012.
Key element of the NSTAR earnings growth story has been our ability to improve productivity and control costs. You can see that spending in 2009 went down. That was all discretionary nature. These cuts are really never at the expense of customer service and reliability. One Wall Street analyst, who I think is actually here, wrote in the past that “NSTAR's O&M discipline is as unmatched by any utility I can think of,” and the numbers support that.
Over the last many years, we have – our earnings growth is outperforming Philly [ph] peers. In our second quarter report, we did increase the upper end of our guidance range to $2.50. Like David mentioned, we like to exclude from this onetime items. We actually had three onetime items this year that I should note. We earned $1.03 on the sale of [indiscernible] business in the second quarter. We just announced a settlement with the IRS that covered seven years and in the [ph] quarter. And we will have some tax-related expenses in the fourth quarter.
As a result of solid earnings performance, we've been able to increase the dividend 7% last November, the 12th year in a row that we’ve increased the dividend. Our payout ratio continues to be conservative in the low 60s. And we feel very confident, as David mentioned, we have the prospects of, on a combined basis, higher earnings per share growth that will fuel higher dividend growth, and we expected dividend growth to continue to track earnings going forward.
We are particularly proud of the job we’ve done for our shareholders. As this graph shows, our total shareholder return has increased steadily over the past 13 years. $1,000 invested in NSTAR at the start of the period is worth over $5,000 today. Actually, updated for 2010, we've provide shareholders another 18% already this year, so I'm pretty confident we'll be able to say 14 years now and counting. To put that performance in perspective, you won’t be able to find another utility in the country that has more than three consecutive years of positive total shareholder returns.
Also to put it into perspective, we've done a little bit of research, you will find any company in an industry, manufacturing, high-tech, retail, banking, that can match that track record of consistent total shareholder return increases year in, year out.
So while our financial performance has been off the charts, one thing investments are also concerned with is the financial condition of their investment. And this slide says all you need to know about NSTAR. Our financial condition is number one in the industry with the highest credit rating. So a very long record of providing great returns, but also, clearly, a very strong commitment to maintaining excellent credit quality. I think both of those values will continue within the new company.
An update on transmission. Obviously, Mass [ph] Utility is the poster child of transmission development, but I do want point out that NSTAR has doubled its transmission rate base in the past five years. And we have projects in the queue that will allow us to double it again in the next five years. We have basically based [ph] on reliability and capability projects number of year. That's about $100 million a year on average. We are currently licensing a new 345-kV new line over the canal. That's $120 million investment currently before the Energy Facilities Siting Board in Massachusetts. We expect spending will occur in 2011 and '12. We expect that to be in service by year end '12.
Our next two projects, relatively new, we have a circuit reliability project, the 345-kV line into the timeframe 2014, ’15 is expected construction. We also have 115-kV line that we're stalling down in the Mid-Cape that basically will extend the benefit of the line that we have going over the canal. The bottom of bullet [ph] there Northern Pass, Chuck has covered the; Hydro-Québec project, and a number of folks have talked about the potential of accessing that northern New England, the consortium project.
We did just have a great quarter. Released earnings after the market closed Friday. We still have benefited from an 8% growth in sales that reflected the hot weather in the Boston area. In addition to the sales increase from the weather, we did pick up $0.02 from our annual PVR inflation adjustment related to our rate settlement. The lower interest costs compared to a year ago. They gave us $0.03, and we did just execute a share repurchase that, when you compare with last year's numbers, basically provided a $0.03 in earnings. Offsetting those items are items that are in line with our guidance, increased O&M, increased property taxes associated with our capital spending or rate-based growth. Lastly, we did sell the [indiscernible] business, so in this quarter, the absence of earnings associated with that [indiscernible] sale, which is $0.02. 
I do want to take a minute to talk about income tax settlement that you see in the footnotes. It's a positive development. It resolves all outstanding tax issues that we have from 2001 to 2007. What it does free up is a tax refund of $135 million we expect to receive by the end of the year.
That's really it for my overview. I'd now like to turn it back to Tom and Chuck for our closing messages and then, obviously, questions will follow."
