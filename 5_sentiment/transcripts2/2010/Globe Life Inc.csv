308916,84216137,49476,"Torchmark Corp., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-11-2010",2010-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel; Rosemary Montgomery, our Chief Actuary; and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations.Some of my comment",678,"Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel; Rosemary Montgomery, our Chief Actuary; and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations.Some of my comments or answers to your questions this morning may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2008 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.Net operating income for the fourth quarter was $122 million or $1.47 per share, a per share increase of 5% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $113 million or $1.36 per share. Excluding FAS 115, our return on equity was 14.3% and our book value per share was $44.22, a 13% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturity investments carried at market value, book value was $40.87 per share.In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 4% to $418 million, and life underwriting margins increased 2% to $114 million. Life net sales were $81 million, up 5% from a year ago. At American Income, life premiums were up 11% to $132 million, and life underwriting margin was up 6% to $43 million. Net life sales increased 24% to $35 million. Producing agents at American Income grew to 4,154, up 35% for the year.I'm pleased with the results at American Income. We believe that we now have the processes in place to sustain long-term double-digit growth in life sales, as well as premiums and underwriting margin. We continue to test new ways to improve these processes to enhance our agent recruiting, training and retention, as well as our policy persistency. In our Direct Response operation, life premiums were up 6% to $133 million, and life underwriting margin grew 13% to $35 million. Net life sales were down 3% to $30 million for the quarter, but increased 7% for the full year. For 2010, we expect to see low single-digit growth in life sales during the first quarter, improving the double-digit growth for the balance of the year.At Liberty National, life premiums declined 2% to $74 million, and life underwriting margin was down 26% to $14 million. Net life sales for the Liberty National offices declined 26% to $10 million and the producing agent count was down to 1,740. The decline in life sales and producing agents was greater than we expected during the quarter. While we've seen significant improvement in our policy persistency, it will take us a little longer to rebuild than I indicated on the last call. The sales and agent count numbers should stabilize in the first quarter and begin to show growth in the second quarter. We now expect low single-digit growth for the full year 2010.On the health side, premium revenue, excluding Part D, declined 11% to $201 million, and health underwriting margin was down 18% to $34 million. Health net sales increased 28% to $39 million, due primarily to strong group Medicare supplement sales, which are normally concentrated in the fourth quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic concerning the new growth in our Medicare supplement sales, particularly in the second half of 2010. By June 1, we expect to introduce a new standardized Medicare supplement plan, as well as reprice our existing products in many states.We believe we will be better able to compete, not only with Medicare Advantage Plans, but with other companies offering Medicare supplement products. Premium revenue for Medicare Part D was $45 million for the quarter, a 4% increase, while underwriting margin improved 16% to $6 million. Part D sales grew 69% for the quarter to $27 million and were up 52% for the full year. Underwriting margin for our Annuity business was $1.1 million for the quarter versus the loss of $8.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Administrative expenses were $38 million for the quarter, down 13% from a year ago. For the full year, administrative expenses were down 3%. I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer for his comments."
308916,84216137,49476,"Torchmark Corp., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb-11-2010",2010-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio and liquidity and capital. First, the investment portfolio. On our website are three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of December 31, 2009",1178,"Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio and liquidity and capital. First, the investment portfolio. On our website are three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of December 31, 2009. As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $11 billion, including $10.2 billion of fixed maturities of amortized costs. Combined, RMBS, CMBS and mortgage loans are $38 million.Of the $10.2 billion of fixed maturities, $9.3 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. Below investment grade bonds are $824 million, 8.1% of fixed maturities. We began 2009 with $712 million of below investment grade bonds then there were 7.4% of fixed maturities at that time. By June 30, the below investment grade bonds have grown to $1.2 billion, 13% of the portfolio, due primarily to downgrades of formerly investment grade securities. In the last six months of 2009, there were no material downgrades, and we reduced below investment grade bonds through sales of $350 million and impairments of $76 million, thus ending the year with $824 million of below investment grade bonds. We expect that the percentage of below investment grade bonds at 8.1% is still high relative to our peers. However, due to our significantly lower portfolio leverage, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding FAS 115, is 22%, which is likely less than the peer average. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB plus, same as the year ago.During the quarter, we charged realized cap losses for other-than-temporary impairments on four bonds. The total charge was $25 million pretax or $16 million after tax. Including net gains on asset sales, net realized capital losses for the quarter were $15 million after tax. Year-to-date, realized capital losses are $93 million after tax. For further information regarding impairments, see the schedule on our website entitled Summary of Net Realized Investment Losses.Net unrealized losses in the fixed maturity portfolio are $456 million compared to $1.8 billion a year ago. They are $60 million higher than in September primarily because treasury rates increased slightly more than spreads, tightened in most of our sectors. Now I'd like to discuss the asset types within our fixed maturity portfolio. 74% of the portfolio is in corporate bonds and another 14% is in redeemable preferred stocks. All of the $1.4 billion of redeemable preferreds have a stated maturity date and other characteristics that make them more like debt securities, and to date, all scheduled interest payment have been received. None of these securities are perpetual preferreds.Municipal bonds now comprise 10% of the portfolio compared to 3% a year ago. In 2009, we purchased $773 million of Build America Bonds. These are taxable debt securities issued by state and local governments to receive a federal subsidy equal to 35% of the required interest payments. Our BAB bonds are rated AA and have an average yield 6.3%. Due to concentration considerations, we do not expect to make significant investments in Build American Bonds in 2010. The remaining 2% of the portfolio consists primarily of government-related securities. Our CDO exposure is now down to $55 million in two securities where the underlying collateral is primarily bank and insurance company trust preferreds.Now to conclude the discussion on investments, I will cover the investment yield. We ended the third quarter with excess cash due primarily to the portfolio repositioning undertaken later in that quarter to reduce the amount of below investment grade bonds. At the September 30, we had approximately $1.1 billion in cash, short-term investments and receivables for the sale of securities. In the fourth quarter, we invested $879 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the municipal, industrial and utility sectors. We invested an average annual effective yield of 6%, an average rating of A and an average life of 18 to 23 years. For the full year, we invested $2.3 billion at an average yield of 6.4%, rating of A and life of 16 to 21 years. For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 6.86% compared to 6.97% yield earned in each of the previous eight quarters. The decline in yield is due primarily to the previously mentioned portfolio repositioning that took place late in the third quarter and to a lesser extent, the lower fourth quarter new money yield. As of 12/31/09, the yield on the portfolio is 6.81%. We ended the year with $590 million of cash and short-term investments, $435 million in the insurance companies and $155 million in the parent company. Now regarding RBC, as previously indicated, we intend to maintain RBC ratio at the 300% plus level held in past years. This ratio is lower than some peer companies but is sufficient for our company, in line with our consistent with statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. Entering 2009, our consolidated RBC ratio was 329%. But by June 30, the ratio had fallen to 245% due to bond impairments and downgrades, and a disproportionate share of dividends for the parent in the first half of the year. In the last half of 2009, we took steps to improve the RBC ratio. We increased the capital of the insurance companies by having the parent company contribute $175 million, $125 million in the third quarter and $50 million in the fourth quarter. And we reduced required capital by selling below investment grade bonds.Although we haven't finalized our 2009 statutory financial statements, we expect that RBC at 12/31/09 will be in the range of 325% to 330%. This means that we have approximately $125 million of capital in excess of that required to meet the targeted 300% ratio. In addition, assuming no impairments, we estimate that excess capital should increase by around $100 million in 2010, primarily because statutory income will exceed dividends paid to the parent.Regarding liquidity. At December 31, the parent company had $155 million of cash. In addition, we estimate that free cash flow for 2010 will add another $260 million of cash. As a result, the total cash available to parent for 2010 will be around $415 million.In addition to the cash at the parent, we have other sources of liquidity such as debt issuance, increased good credit facilities and other company financing. Although we don't think we'll need to tap these sources, they could provide another $1.2 billion of cash. Based on the $115 million of excess capital within the insurance companies at 12/31/09 and the expectation that it will grow in 2010 and the available cash and other liquidity at the parent, we believe there's more than sufficient liquidity to offset the impact on statutory capital of future realized losses and downgrades.In 2010, we plan to utilize excess cash as efficiently as possible, but we'll be prudent in doing so. We plan to maintain a cash reserve at the parent and then determine the best use of the remaining cash after we're assured that our desired capital levels will be maintained. Those are my comments, I will now turn the call back to Mark."

We made some changes in our compensation really, set higher standards for persistency and quality business being written, and that did cause some increased turnover, particularly in agents who were writing poor quality business. But also unfortunately, the focus being on improving the quality of the business took some of the focus away from our recruiting. So in the fourth quarter, our reporting numbers for Liberty National were also down from 25% from where they were the prior year. So we believe we've made the changes that are necessary there. We actually had to close some offices during the quarter. But we now are refocused on getting our recruiting back up and moving forward."

So we typically report 13 weeks of sales in our financials, which means about once every five years, we have of 14-week quarter, which the fourth quarter of 2008 was 14-week quarter. So part of the only having 5% growth in our life sales this year is a poor quarter to compare with last year. We did have 14-week quarter in the fourth quarter of last year. So actually, our life sales, if I compare the same 13 weeks that we reported this year, we were actually up 12% versus the 5%. So we are continuing to see a very positive trend there. But if I look at the American Income, again, we've been making changes there for the last two and a half, three years as far as taking control of the lead generation and some of the changes we made and our bonus compensation, and we feel very good about where it's at today. We went from 63 to 70 SGAs during the year. Our lead generation was up, let's see I think I have that number around here, we generated -- we increased our lead generation by 11% for the year. And it's really in a good spot right now. Some of the things we're doing, I guess the biggest thing we're doing is changing, as I mentioned in prior calls, changing the sales process to a laptop sales presentation. We're taking this very slowly. We're introducing it with a handful of our SGAs at this point in time. But the early results are very, very good. We're getting higher average face amount, higher average premium, higher closing ratio. So I think that has a potential to continue to fuel growth. Although even without that, we fully expect to see growth. We think we can continue to maintain the level of growth that we've been seeing at American Income. Direct Response, I think we reported sales down 3%. Again, if I compare the same 13 weeks with 13 weeks a year ago, it's actually 8.5% for the same comparable period. We've got some very good things going on Direct Response. We've had some very encouraging tests in the second half of 2009, particularly in our packaging. We tried some packages where we had more personalization and a higher quality package. And it generates substantially 15% to 18% better response in the tests that we performed. Unfortunately, we have to order new equipment in order to rollout with these new packages, and that equipment would be installed until April. So I feel very good about the second half of this year and Direct Response should see double-digit growth in sales. The first quarter because of some of the cutbacks that we did in the second half of last year, we only expect low single-digit growth in the first quarter, but that growth will accelerate significantly in the second half, really, in the last three quarters of the year. So I feel good about where it's at. Although it's still a constant challenge to find new and better ways to do things. Based upon the results of tests we've already seen, I feel very good about the growth that we're going to see in 2010."

Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel; Rosemary Montgomery, our Chief Actuary; and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations.Some of my comment",678,"Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning is Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer; Larry Hutchison, our General Counsel; Rosemary Montgomery, our Chief Actuary; and Mike Majors, Vice President of Investor Relations.Some of my comments or answers to your questions this morning may contain forward-looking statements that are provided for general guidance purposes only. Accordingly, please refer to our 2008 10-K and any subsequent Forms 10-Q on file with the SEC.Net operating income for the fourth quarter was $122 million or $1.47 per share, a per share increase of 5% from a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $113 million or $1.36 per share. Excluding FAS 115, our return on equity was 14.3% and our book value per share was $44.22, a 13% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturity investments carried at market value, book value was $40.87 per share.In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 4% to $418 million, and life underwriting margins increased 2% to $114 million. Life net sales were $81 million, up 5% from a year ago. At American Income, life premiums were up 11% to $132 million, and life underwriting margin was up 6% to $43 million. Net life sales increased 24% to $35 million. Producing agents at American Income grew to 4,154, up 35% for the year.I'm pleased with the results at American Income. We believe that we now have the processes in place to sustain long-term double-digit growth in life sales, as well as premiums and underwriting margin. We continue to test new ways to improve these processes to enhance our agent recruiting, training and retention, as well as our policy persistency. In our Direct Response operation, life premiums were up 6% to $133 million, and life underwriting margin grew 13% to $35 million. Net life sales were down 3% to $30 million for the quarter, but increased 7% for the full year. For 2010, we expect to see low single-digit growth in life sales during the first quarter, improving the double-digit growth for the balance of the year.At Liberty National, life premiums declined 2% to $74 million, and life underwriting margin was down 26% to $14 million. Net life sales for the Liberty National offices declined 26% to $10 million and the producing agent count was down to 1,740. The decline in life sales and producing agents was greater than we expected during the quarter. While we've seen significant improvement in our policy persistency, it will take us a little longer to rebuild than I indicated on the last call. The sales and agent count numbers should stabilize in the first quarter and begin to show growth in the second quarter. We now expect low single-digit growth for the full year 2010.On the health side, premium revenue, excluding Part D, declined 11% to $201 million, and health underwriting margin was down 18% to $34 million. Health net sales increased 28% to $39 million, due primarily to strong group Medicare supplement sales, which are normally concentrated in the fourth quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic concerning the new growth in our Medicare supplement sales, particularly in the second half of 2010. By June 1, we expect to introduce a new standardized Medicare supplement plan, as well as reprice our existing products in many states.We believe we will be better able to compete, not only with Medicare Advantage Plans, but with other companies offering Medicare supplement products. Premium revenue for Medicare Part D was $45 million for the quarter, a 4% increase, while underwriting margin improved 16% to $6 million. Part D sales grew 69% for the quarter to $27 million and were up 52% for the full year. Underwriting margin for our Annuity business was $1.1 million for the quarter versus the loss of $8.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Administrative expenses were $38 million for the quarter, down 13% from a year ago. For the full year, administrative expenses were down 3%. I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer for his comments."

I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio and liquidity and capital. First, the investment portfolio. On our website are three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of December 31, 2009",1178,"Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio and liquidity and capital. First, the investment portfolio. On our website are three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of December 31, 2009. As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $11 billion, including $10.2 billion of fixed maturities of amortized costs. Combined, RMBS and CMBS and mortgage loans are $38 million.Of the $10.2 billion of fixed maturities, $9.3 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A-. Below investment grade bonds are $824 million, 8.1% of fixed maturities. We began 2009 with $712 million of below investment grade bonds then there were 7.4% of fixed maturities at that time. By June 30, the below investment grade bonds have grown to $1.2 billion, 13% of the portfolio, due primarily to downgrades of formerly investment grade securities. In the last six months of 2009, there were no material downgrades, and we reduced below investment grade bonds through sales of $350 million and impairments of $76 million, thus ending the year with $824 million of below investment grade bonds. We expect that the percentage of below investment grade bonds at 8.1% is still high relative to our peers. However, due to our significantly lower portfolio leverage, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding FAS 115 is 22%, which is likely less than the peer average. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB plus same as the year ago.During the quarter, we charged realized cap losses for other-than-temporary impairments on four bonds. The total charge was $25 million pretax or $16 million after tax. Including net gains on asset sales, net realized capital losses for the quarter were $15 million after tax. Year-to-date, realized capital losses are $93 million after tax. For further information regarding impairments, see the schedule on our website entitled Summary of Net Realized Investment Losses.Net unrealized losses in the fixed maturity portfolio are $456 million compared to $1.8 billion a year ago. They are $60 million higher than in September primarily because treasury rates increased slightly more than spreads tightened in most of our sectors. Now I'd like to discuss the asset types within our fixed maturity portfolio. 74% of the portfolio is in corporate bonds and another 14% is in redeemable preferred stocks. All of the $1.4 billion are redeemable preferred have a stated maturity date and other characteristics that make them more like debt securities. And to date, all scheduled interest payments have been received. None of these securities are perpetual preferreds.Municipal bonds now comprise 10% of the portfolio compared to 3% a year ago. In 2009, we purchased $773 million of Build America Bonds. These are taxable debt securities issued by state and local governments who receive a federal subsidy equal to 35% of the required interest payments. Our BAB bonds are rated AA and have an average yield 6.3%. Due to concentration considerations, we do not expect to make significant investments in Build America Bonds in 2010. The remaining 2% of the portfolio consists primarily of government-related securities. Our CDO exposure is now down to $55 million and two securities where the underlying collateral is primarily bank and insurance company trust preferreds.Now to conclude the discussion on investments, I will cover the investment yield. We ended the third quarter with excess cash due primarily to the portfolio repositioning undertaken later in that quarter to reduce the amount of below investment grade bonds. At the September 30, we had approximately $1.1 billion in cash, short-term investments and receivables for the sale of securities. In the fourth quarter, we invested $879 million in investment grade fixed maturities, primarily in the municipal, industrial and utility sectors. We invested an average annual effective yield of 6%, an average rating of A and an average life of 18 to 23 years. For the full year, we invested $2.3 billion at an average yield of 6.4%, rating of A and life of 16 to 21 years. For the entire portfolio, the fourth quarter yield was 6.86% compared to 6.97% yield earned in each of the previous eight quarters. The decline in yield is due primarily to the previously mentioned portfolio repositioning that took place late in the third quarter and to a lesser extent, the lower fourth quarter new money yield. As of 12/31/09, the yield on the portfolio is 6.81%. We ended the year with $590 million of cash and short-term investments, $435 million in the insurance companies and $155 million in the parent company. Now regarding RBC, as previously indicated, we intend to maintain our RBC ratio at the 300% plus level held in past years. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies, in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities and our ratings. Entering 2009, our consolidated RBC ratio was 329%. But by June 30, the ratio had fallen to 245% due to bond impairments and downgrades and a disproportionate share of dividends to the parent during the first half of the year. In the last half of 2009, we took steps to improve the RBC ratio. We increased the capital of the insurance companies by having the parent company contribute $175 million, $125 million in the third quarter and $50 million in the fourth quarter. And we reduced required capital by selling below investment grade bonds.Although we haven't finalized our 2009 statutory financial statements, we expect that RBC at 12/31/09, will be in the range of 325% to 330%. This means that we have approximately $125 million of capital in excess of that required to meet the targeted 300% ratio. In addition, assuming no impairments, we estimate that excess capital should increase by around $100 million in 2010, primarily because statutory income will exceed dividends paid to the parent.Regarding liquidity. At December 31, the parent company had $155 million of cash. In addition, we estimate that free cash flow for 2010 will add another $260 million of cash. As a result, the total cash available to parent for 2010 will be around $415 million.In addition to the cash at the parent, we have other sources of liquidity such as debt issuance, increased good credit facilities and intercompany financing. Although we don't think we'll need to tap these sources, they could provide another $1.2 billion of cash. Based on the $115 million of excess capital within the insurance companies at 12/31/09, and the expectation that it will grow in 2010 and the available cash and other liquidity at the parent, we believe there's more than sufficient liquidity to offset the impact on statutory capital of future realized losses and downgrades.In 2010, we plan to utilize excess cash as efficiently as possible, but we'll be prudent in doing so. We plan to maintain a cash reserve at the parent and then determine the best use of the remaining cash after we're sure that our desired capital levels will be maintained. Those are my comments, I will now turn the call back to Mark."

So we typically report 13 weeks of sales in our financials, which means about once every five years, we have of 14-week quarter, which the fourth quarter of 2008 was 14-week quarter. So part of the only having 5% growth in our life sales this year is a poor quarter to compare with last year. We did have 14-week quarter in the fourth quarter of last year. So actually, our life sales, if I compare the same 13 weeks that we reported this year, we were actually up 12% versus the 5%. So we are continuing to see a very positive trend there. But if I look at the American Income, again, we've been making changes there for the last two and a half, three years as far as taking control of the lead generation and some of the changes we made and our bonus compensation, and we feel very good about where it's at today. We went from 63 to 70 SGAs during the year. Our lead generation was up, let's see I think I have that number around here, we generated -- we increased our lead generation by 11% for the year. And it's really in a good spot right now. Some of the things we're doing, I guess the biggest thing we're doing is changing, as I mentioned in prior calls, changing the sales process to a laptop sales presentation. We're taking this very slowly. We're introducing it with a handful of our SGAs at this point in time. But the early results are very, very good. We're getting higher average face amount, higher average premium, higher closing ratio. So I think that has a potential to continue to fuel growth. Although even without that, we fully expect to see growth. We think we can continue to maintain the level of growth that we've been seeing at American Income. Direct Response, I think we reported sales down 3%. Again, if I compare the same 13 weeks with 13 weeks a year ago, it's actually 8.5% for the same comparable period. We've got some very good things going on Direct Response. We've had some very encouraging tests in the second half of 2009, particularly in our packaging. We tried some packages where we had more personalization and a higher quality package. And it generates substantially 15% to 18% better response in the tests that we performed. Unfortunately, we have to order new equipment in order to rollout with these new packages, and that equipment would be installed until April. So I feel very good about the second half of this year and Direct Response should see double-digit growth in sales. The first quarter because of some of the cutbacks that we did in the second half of last year, we only expect low single-digit growth in the first quarter, but that growth will accelerate significantly in the second half, really, in the last three quarters of the year. So I feel good about where it's at. Although it's still a constant challenge to find new and better ways to do things. Based upon the results of tests we've already seen, I feel very good about the growth that we're going to see in 2010."

Net operating income for the second quarter was $131 million or $1.58 per share, a per share increase of 3% from a year ago. Net income was $126 million or $1.53 per share, an 11% increase.
Excluding FAS 115, our return on equity was 13.7% and our book value per share was $46.81, a 12% increase from a year ago. On a GAAP reported basis, with fixed maturities carried at market value, book value was $48.16 per share.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue grew 5% to $434 million and life underwriting margins increased 8% to $120 million. Life net sales were $89 million, up 4% from a year ago.
At American Income, life premiums were up 12% to $140 million and life underwriting margin was up 11% to $46 million. Net life sales increased 11% in the quarter to $37 million. The producing agent count was 4,200, which was unchanged during the quarter, but up 10% from a year ago.
By most standards, American Income had another great quarter, although the producing agent count has remained flat, relatively flat for the first half of this year. While our new agent recruiting has increased 17% during that period, we have seen a retention of new agents slipped somewhat.
After analyzing this situation, we have identified a couple of possible causes for this change in new agent retention and have taken appropriate action. We expect to see renewed growth in our producing agents during the second half of this year, while continuing to project 15% to 20% sales growth for the full year of 2010.
In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% to $143 million. Life underwriting margin grew 12% to $37 million.
Net life sales increased 9% at Globe to $37 million. Life sales growth was less than expected for the quarter. The improvements we saw in the first quarter and our insert media response rate did not hold up and appeared to be the result of a reversal in consumer confidence.
If this trend continues, we expect to see sales growth in the mid single digits for the balance of this year. Life premiums at Liberty National declined 2% to $74 million and life underwriting margin was down 4% to $14 million.
Our net life sales of the combined Liberty National United American agency operations declined 21% to $12 million. First-year collected life premiums were flat at $9 million, reflecting the improved persistency of new sales.
Also, while life sales were down from a year ago, they increased 11% from the first quarter level. The producing agent count at Liberty National was 1,606, down 51% from a year ago, but up 5% from the level in the first quarter.
We believe we have turned the corner at Liberty National as reflected in our growth in new agents and life sales over the first quarter levels. We expect this trend to continue along with additional improvement and the persistency of the new business written.
On the health side, premium revenue, excluding Part D, declined 6% to $199 million and health underwriting margin was unchanged at $38 million.
Health net sales decreased 23% from a year ago to $15 million, while health first-year collected premiums were flat at $20 million.
In our Medicare Supplements business, premiums increased 1% to $116 million. Net sales were up 39% from a year ago to $7 million, while first-year collected premiums grew 94% to $11 million.
We are pleased with results in our health business. While the total sales and premiums continue to be impacted by the runoff of the limited-benefit plans at United American, this business is lower margin, poor persistency business.
The new health business we are writing today has significantly higher margins and much better persistency. We project our health underwriting margins to begin to grow by the end of this year.
Premium revenue for Medicare Part D was $53 million a 16% increase while underwriting margin was $5 million, up 7%. First-year collected premium for Part D grew 79% to $12 million.
We reported an underwriting loss of $1 million in our annuity business during the quarter versus a $5.2 million gain a year ago. This loss can be attributed to the decline in the equity markets during the second quarter.
Administrative expenses were $40 million for the quarter, the same as a year ago. Due to higher than expected employee health costs, we are now projecting administrative expenses to grow in a 2% to 3% range for the full year.
I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer for his comments.

308916,109407341,70510,"Torchmark Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Globe Life Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, excess investment income, capital and share repurchases.First, the investment portfolio. On our website, there are three schedules that provide summary information regardin",933,"Thanks, Mark. I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment portfolio, excess investment income, capital and share repurchases.
First, the investment portfolio. On our website, there are three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of June 30, 2010.
As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $11.5 billion, including $10.7 billion of fixed maturities at amortized costs.
Of the fixed maturities, $9.9 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A minus. Below investment grade bonds are $832 million, 7.7% of fixed maturities, and as compared to $891 million at the end of the first quarter and $1.2 billion a year ago. The $59 million decline in the second quarter included $40 million of bonds upgraded to investment grade.
We expect that the percentage of below investment grade bonds at 7.7% is still relatively high regarding our peers. However, due to our significantly lower portfolio leverage, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding OCI, is 22% which is slightly less than the peer average.
Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as a year ago. During the quarter, we recognized $3.6 million of after tax realized losses, $2.5 million on asset dispositions and $1.1 million from retirement debt. However, for the six months, we’ve had net realized capital gains of $1.5 million after tax.
We had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of over $178 million compared to net unrealized losses of $173 million at March 31 and $1.4 billion a year ago. The increase in the unrealized gains in the second quarter is due primarily to treasury yields declining more than a credit spreads increased.
Now looking at investment yield, in the second quarter we invested $377 million in investment grade of fixed maturities primarily in the industrial sector. We invested an average annual effective yield of 6.3%, an average rating of BBB+, and an average life of 25 years to 27 years.
For the six months, we’ve invested $1.1 billion at an average yield of 6.1%. For the entire portfolio, the first quarter yield was 6.75% compared to 6.79% earned in the previous quarter and the 6.97% earned in the second quarter 2009, the decline in yield is due to investing a larger than normal amount money at lower yield.
In the last 12 months, we invested $2.9 billion at an average yield of 6.2%, the unusually higher amount of money invested in that period was due to the third quarter 2009 portfolio restructuring to reduce low investment grade bonds and also investing money that was previously being held as cash for liquidity purposes. As of June 30, the yield on the portfolio is now 6.73%.
Now turning to excess investment income. Excess investment income is the net investment income less interest cost on the net policy liabilities and the financing cost of our debt. In the second quarter, it was $80 million, up $4 million or 5% from a year ago.
The year-over-year comparison of each component is as follows. First, net investment income was up $14 million. This represents an 8.5% increase in income, slightly lower than the 10% increase in average invested assets due to the lower portfolio yield. Next, the interest cost on net policy liabilities increased $6 million or 8% in line with the 8% increase in the average liabilities.
Lastly, financing costs were up $4 million due to the interest expense resulting from the $300 million debt issue at the end of the second quarter of 2009.
Regarding RBC, we plan to maintain our RBC ratio at 325% level compared to 300% target dues in prior years. This ratio is lower than some peer companies, but is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities, and the level of our ratings.
At year-end 2009, the RBC ratio was 355%, adjusted capital of $1.5 billion divided by the required capital of $416 million. Adjusted capital at that time was approximately $125 million in excess of that required for the target 325% ratio. We estimate that the ratio at June 30 is slightly less than 350% because of the timing of dividends declared by the subsidiaries.
However, at year end, we expect that RBC will be at or higher than the 355% that we began the year with, resulting in excess capital of $125 million to $150 million.
Finally, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets. In the second quarter, we spent $63 million to buy 1.2 million Torchmark shares. So far, in July, we have used $33 million to buy another 675,000 shares at $48.96 per share.
For the full year through today, we have spent $108 million to acquire 2.1 million shares. At June 30, the parent company had liquid assets of $300 million. With free cash flow expected to be approximately $65 million in the last six months, the parent ended the second quarter with a total of $365 million available for the last half of the year.
As of today, after deducting the $33 million used for the July shares repurchases, the parent will have approximately $332 million available between now and the end of the year. We currently expect to maintain liquid assets of around $200 million for the remainder of the year. We will use the remaining $130 plus million as efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be one of the uses of those funds.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Mark.

There is an expectation too that they may delay the implementation date from 2011 to 2012, which we certainly hope to do because of the amount of efforts that’s going to be required to implement this. There is really two changes that impact us. First of all, on Direct Response, the deferral will now move under advertising rules that are in SOP 93-7. We’ve taken a look at that and we think that the cost that we’re currently deferring will qualify under SOP 93-7, and so we’ll continue to defer those costs.
And then the other costs, the agency-related cost, our Asia-produced business, we expect that we’ll continue to be able to defer the commissions and the other commission-related type expenses. Where we may have an issue is we’ve got about $90 million of agency and home office expenses that may not meet the criteria. We feel that we’ll be able to convert some of those to commission-type expenses, but some portion of those, we may not be able to defer anymore.
Now what will happen is we’ll go through and we’ll look through all the costs and make that determination, and if they are non-deferrable, we’re going to make a retroactive adoption of this, so we’ll have to go back in time and recreate the asset. The result of that is that we’ll have a one-time write-down of DAC. These numbers I gave you are very raw because we don’t know exactly how it is going to be applied but we think that that one-time write-down would be an after tax write-down of about $300 million to $400 million or 8% to 10% of our book value.
Now, as far as what we see as the effect on earnings going forward is that; one, we’ll recover that amount of the write-down over the future earnings. Also, we look at it not having a significant impact on reported earnings because the reduction in expenses that are being deferred on newly issued policies will be offset by the fact that we’ll have reduced amortization on the total block of policies in force.

A couple of things. One thing that came to light was, as we converted over to electronic applications and laptop sales presentation, we inadvertently made it more difficult for an agent to qualify for bonus, which we have corrected that problem now. But when an agent thinks he is going to make a bonus and it turns out he doesn’t achieve a bonus, that’s even though we can’t quantify it exactly, we know that had some impact.
The other thing, looking back, we put out an incentive at the beginning of the year to try to stimulate our new agent recruiting, which we did. Our recruiting is up 17%, but our first-year agent count really hasn’t grown and we didn’t place enough emphasis on retention. We’ve now made some modifications and put out an additional incentive that rewards retention and we fully expect our new agent retention to get back more to the levels it was last year.

We gave you an example. It’s not a big number in our company, but in some companies, the cost of underwriting policies. In the current rules, you could defer all of the salaries and whatever costs in you are underwriting department. Under the new rules the way we see them is that you can only take the portion of those salaries the policies are actually issued. In other words, amount of salaries toward policies that were declined, you wouldn’t be able to defer. So that’s one change.
For us, I mentioned that we’ve got some non-commission expenses, for example agency, support staff, conventions, leads, that kind of thing that you can’t tie directly to the insurance of the new policy, and so therefore, under the definition in the new rule, as we read it, we will not be able to defer those costs. Those costs are included in that $90 million I mentioned earlier. Out of the $520 million that we’ll defer this year, there’s $90 million that would fall in that category of non-commission expenses. What I mentioned we’re now being able to re-characterize so that they will be as part of the commissions and therefore deferrable, we just don’t know how much of that $90 million we can re-characterize like that.

To frame that a little bit, in the last 20 years, we have averaged more than 17% on their money, and just if you back just five years, we have averaged over 6.5%. So I think if we saw interest rates stay low for a long period of time, then that might make a difference and we might have to adjust to that, but I think it’s going to take a period of time. Actually I think there is greater chance that interest rates will increase in the next few years as opposed to stay at this level or decline.

We could lower our interest crediting and take it out of underwriting margin and move it over to excess investment income, but it’s a wash. But it’s something we’ll continue to evaluate and it’s not out of the realm of the possibility that we may put through some increases at some point.

It was also my impression that at least with the laptop presentations, you were paying careful attention in looking out specifically for these types of issues. So with that in mind, can you maybe help us understand how we got to the point where overall agent growth at American Income, which had been pretty steady and pretty high has flattened out and been impacted before these issues got caught?

So actually, part of what we did at American Income because we absolutely did not want that to reoccur and we had not seen any deterioration, in fact, we had seen somewhat improvement in our persistency there.
We’re no longer paying agents or allowing agents to earn a bonus until that initial premium clears the bank. In fact, that made it much more difficult for an agent to predict whether he was going to qualify for a bonus. We are taking our time in introducing that. It’s not like we put all of our new agents on at all at once. It is something that we are doing that over a 12-month period introducing that. So, we did catch it relatively quickly. I will not decline, but the determinations are being higher on new agents, yes. So it’s really not the same situation that we saw at Liberty National.

Net operating income for the third quarter was a $132 million or $1.63per share, a per share increase of 10% from the year ago. Net income was a $115 million or $1.41 per share, a 16% increase.
Net income for the quarter was reduced by $31 million as a result of a GAAP loss on our pending sale of the United Investors. Excluding FAS 115, our return on equity was 13.7% and our book value per share was $47.92, a 12% increase from the year ago. On a GAAP reported basis with fixed maturities carried at market value, book value was $52.77 per share.
In our life insurance operations, premium revenue excluding United Investors grew 5% to $417 million and life underwriting margins increased 8% to $115 million. Life net sales were $79 million, down 7% from a year ago, our first down quarter in two quarters.
Life first year collected premiums however were up 8% to $61 million, significantly better than our 3% growth in year-to-date sales and reflected of improving persistency.
At American Income, life premiums were up 11% to $142 million and life underwriting margin was up 9% to $47 million. Life net sales increased 5% to $34 million. The producing agent count was 4,065, up 3% from a year ago, but down 3% from last quarter.
The renewed growth in our producing agents at American Income is taking longer than we previously anticipated. In addition to changes in our management incentive compensation, we are working on growing our middle management ranks as well as improvements in our sales lead volume inflow. We expect it will take another two to three months to see the impact of these efforts.
We are also in the fourth quarter beginning to implement a centralized recruiting call center for both American Income and Liberty National, which we believe will significantly increase our recruiting activity at both companies.
In our Direct Response operation at Globe Life, life premiums were up 6% to $142 million, and life underwriting margin grew 8% to $36 million. Life net sales declined 3% to $32 million.
The sales in Direct Response were again less than anticipated as response rates in our insert media segment continued to fall during the summer months. For the June to August time period, the response rates were 14% to 17% less than a year ago. For the last 60 days however, we have seen some improvement with the response rate lagging only 3% from last year.
Due to other positive developments in our testing and modeling, we expect to see mid-single digit growth in life sales in Direct Response for 2011, despite these lower response rates and our insert media.
Life sales at Liberty National declined 2% to $73 million and life underwriting margin was up 10% to $16 million. Net life sales for the combined Liberty National United American agency declined 19% to $11.4 million. Although, first-year collected life premiums were flat at $8.6 million, again reflecting improved persistency.
We are beginning to see an upturn in our recruiting activity at Liberty National as a result of our implementation of the recruiting call center which I previously mentioned. For 2011, we currently anticipate 10% to 15% growth in net life sales at Liberty National.
On the health side, premium revenue, excluding Part D, declined 5% to $189 million, while health underwriting margin grew 2% to $37 million. Health net sales decreased 29% from the year ago to $13 million, but first year health collected premiums increased 11% to $20 million.
While official numbers are not yet available, the contact person at CMS has resonated that roughly 900,000 Medicare Advantage participants will be disenrolled at the end of this year and which would be a 50% over last year. We believe we are in significantly better positioned than we were a year ago to capture a share in these disenrollees.
Premium revenue for Medicare Part D was $53 million, a 10% increase, while the underwriting margin was $6 million, down 4%. Part D sales grew 128% to $7 million for the quarter and first year collected premiums were up 83% to $13 million.
Our administrative expenses were $38.4 million for the quarter, up 5% from the year ago. This increase is primarily the result of continued high employee healthcare costs.
I will now turn the call over to Gary Coleman, our Chief Financial Officer for his comments.

The $327 million of pre-closing distributions consist of a $188 million of Torchmark preferred stock, a $132 million of fixed maturities, and approximately $7 million of other assets and liabilities.
The fixed maturities consisting primarily of the low investment grade bonds were excluded from the sale, because we did not want to sell them at a loss. We expect to hold them and receive full value and maturity for all these bonds.
Although the sale generates a statutory gain, we are recognizing a GAAP loss of approximately $35 million or $31 million after-tax, and that’s due primarily to the BAC, goodwill, and the difference in GAAP and staff benefit reserves.
We expect the sale to result in approximately $15 million of lost income after-tax in 2011, $25 million of foregone United Investors earnings, offset by $2 million of investment income on the sales proceeds, if all the proceeds are invested at 5.5%.
However, due to the sale, Liberty National should be able to increase its dividends to the parent company by $250 million to $320 million in 2011, to the extent of sales proceeds, our dividend to the parent, [inaudible] investment income will be less than the $10 million.
For the remainder of my comments, any reference to investments from continuing operations may include the bonds that will be received in the pre-closing distribution.
Now, I want to spend a few minutes discussing our investments as well as excess investment income, capital and share repurchase.
First, the investment portfolio. On our website, there are three schedules that provide summary information regarding our portfolio as of September 30th. As indicated on these schedules, invested assets are $10.9 billion, including $10.4 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost.
Of the fixed maturities, $9.6 billion are investment grade with an average rating of A minus. Below investment grade bonds are $822 million, 7.9% of fixed maturities compared to $832 million at the end of the second quarter and $946 million a year ago.
Again, we expect that the percentage of below investment grade bonds at 7.9% is still high relatively relative to our peers. However, due to our significantly lower portfolio leverage, the percentage of below investment grade bonds to equity, excluding OCI, is 21% which is slightly less than the peer average. Overall, the total portfolio is rated BBB+, same as a year ago.
During the quarter, we recognized $5 million of after-tax realized gains. For the nine months, we had net realized capital gains of $6.7 million after-tax.
We had net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of $572 million compared to net unrealized gains of a $143 million at June 30 and net unrealized losses of $4.2 million a year ago. The increase in the unrealized gains in the third quarter is due primarily to the decline in both treasury yields and credit spreads.
Regarding investment yield, in the third quarter we invested $447 million in investment grade of fixed maturities primarily in the industrial sector. We invested at an average annual effective yield of 5.6%, an average rating of A-, and an average life of 23 years to 25 years.
For the nine months, we invested $1.4 billion at an average yield of 5.9%. For the entire portfolio, the third quarter yield was 6.68% compared to 6.74% earned in the previous quarter and the 6.96% earned in the third quarter 2009. The decline in yield is due to investing a larger than normal amount money at lower yields.
In the last 12 months, we invested over $2 billion at an average yield of 5.95%. This unusually higher amount of money invested in that period was due to the third quarter 2009 portfolio repositioning to reduce low investment grade bonds and investing money that was previously held as cash for liquidity purposes. As of September 30th, yield in the portfolio is 6.66%.
Now turning to excess investment income. Excess investment income is the net investment income less interest cost on the net policy liabilities and the financing cost of our debt. In the second quarter, it was $75 million, up $9million or 14% from the year ago.
The year-over-year comparison of each component is as follows. First, net investment income was up $13 million. This represents an 8% increase in income, slightly higher than the 7% increase in average invested assets. Despite lower yield in the bond portfolio, investment income increased at a higher rate in the related assets, because we’ve got significant more cash and short-term securities in the third quarter 2009 than we have in 2010.
Next, the interest cost on net policy liabilities increased $6 million or 8% in line with the 8% increase in the average liabilities. And lastly, financing costs were down $1.6 million due primarily to the maturity of an $99 million issue in mid third quarter of 2009.
Regarding RBC, we plan to maintain our RBC ratio at around 325%. This ratio was lower than some of our peer companies, but it is sufficient for our companies in light of our consistent and statutory earnings, the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities, and our ratings.
At yearend 2009, the RBC ratio was 355%, and adjusted capital was approximately $125 million in excess of that required for the targeted 325% ratio. We estimate that the ratio at September 30th is around 350%. However, we estimate that RBC at the end of the year will be somewhere around 400%, due to the impact of the sale of United Investors. Net of the proceeds from the sale will be dividend to the parent company until 2011.
Finally, regarding share repurchases and parent company assets, in the third quarter, we spent $66 million to buy 1.3 million Torchmark shares. For the nine months, we have spent a $141 million to acquire 2.7 million shares.
At September 30, the parent company had liquid assets of $220 million. In addition, we expect to generate another $50 million of free cash flow in the last three months of the year. Considering that we plan to maintain the liquid assets of around $200 million, this leaves $70 million of cash available for use in the fourth quarter.
For 2011, in addition to the $200 million of liquid assets, free cash flow at the parent company was expected to be approximately $590 million to $660 million, assuming no more impairments in the remainder of 2010. This consists of approximately $340 million of free cash flow from normal operations along with $250 million to $320 million resulting from the sale of United Investors.
Now free cash flow generated by the United Investor sale depends on how much cash will need to be retained in the insurance subsidiaries to maintain our consolidated RBC ratio at around the 325% level.
As noted before, we will use our cash efficiently as possible. If market conditions are favorable, we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use for those funds.
Now, before I turn the call back to Mark, and we’d like to address a question that came up on the last call, the question was in light of low interest rate environment, what would be the impact on product processing if we lowered the assumed interest rate.
As we discussed on the last call, we are not creating policy of our accounts on our live policies. The GAAP interest rate and the discount rate that we use to calculate the GAAP reserves and it’s also the rate that we use in our pricing. For most policies issues since 2000, the weighted average rate has 6.75%. However the weighted average discount rate on all policies for us is around 5.6%.
The new money rate on third quarter investments was 5.6%. The lowest it has been in five years. If we felt that interest rates were going to remain at that level for a long period of time, we would likely reduce our GAAP and pricing interest rates.
For illustration purposes, if we lowered our GAAP interest rate and processing rate to 100 basis points, we can maintain the current underwriting margins by increasing premiums on new business by just 1% to 3% for most of our product lines.
To illustrate the magnitude of such a change, a 2% increase in premium on our due to the whole life business would average about $0.14 a month and a 3% increase in our American Income Whole Life business would average about $0.75 a month. We don’t think that such premium increases will have a significant impact on new sales. However, we don’t have any current plans to make changes to the GAAP interest rates as we don’t expect the new mid yields remain to this low for an extended period of time.
Those are my comments. I will now turn the call back to Mark.

As Gary mentioned, we are proceeding with the sale of United Investors and expect it to close by the end of 2010. Assuming we use between $250 million and $320 million of the proceeds from this sale to repurchase shares, we anticipate a small dilution of our earnings per share for 2011 of roughly $0.05 a share, followed by an accretion of $0.10 to $0.20 for 2012 with additional accretion in subsequent years.
And our guidance first for the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect earnings per share to be between a $1.66 and a $1.70, so we are raising our 2010 guidance to a range of $6.38 to $6.42. For 2011, we expect earnings per share to be between $6.75 and $7.10 per share, assuming that we spend between $590 million and $640 million on share repurchase. This guidance is lighter than normal due to our uncertainty concerning the timing and price of this share repurchase.
Those are my comments for this morning. I will now open it up for questions.

One of the things Jimmy obviously we’re going to have a much easier year to compare again next year. If you look in 2009, we had $46 million of life sales of Liberty National where this year we expected to be down closer to $36 million.
So even though we’re expecting to see growth going forward next year, it really doesn’t quite get us back to the level of sales we were in 2009, but we do expect to see 10% to 15% growth over the current levels. So I believe we are moving forward there. We have seen an improvement in our recruiting activity. So I mean those aren’t build increases.
As far as the agent counts, at American Income, the plateau we’ve kind of hit in our agent count was a little more involved than what I had originally thought it was. Though, we have made some changes in management incentive compensation, but also and looking we really haven’t significantly grown our middle management, which for the people that are doing the training of these new hires.
So the even though our recruiting activity was up, we really just had more people there to train those people, and also a late flow in some areas, really it hadn’t grown the support in the increased number of new agents. I am encouraged that we have started again this call center to actually be calling on Internet resumes.
And the initial results we’ve seen there as we’ve gotten a very higher response as far as people wanting to come in and be interviewed. But it also involves - we’ve got have more people there to train and we’ve also got to do a little better job in some areas of increasing our lead flow.
So we’re working on all those things. So I’m optimistic that - actually in September we started to see some turnaround there, but it’s - I really think it’ll be first quarter before we see the full impact of the things we’re working on.

And initially we just ran ads and we got responses to the ads. And that was a good source of recruiting inexpensively.
We later a few years ago, I guess it’s been five to six years, we started a program where we started selecting resumes off of that database and sending emails to these people who are asking if they would be interested and coming to work for us. That increased our response and our potential candidates, I don’t have the numbers in front of me, but substantially. We got far more responses to that than we did to our ads.
And now, recently, we’ve done testing doing automated phone calls to selected resumes in addition to the email, and again the response - what we’d do is we would send an automated phone calls from people to selected resumes and if they wanted to schedule an interview it was automatically transferred to a live person.
Well in our tests, a live person was in the local sales office and in the offices that we use it for our both companies, we’d basically overwhelm them with calls. So actually what we’re working on now is a centralized place where those calls can come into to where we can schedule the interviews, so that we can better handle the volume and just have better control over it.
But initial results are very encouraging and it’s something it’s going to take us a while to expand that nationally in both companies, but it has a lot of potential to take our recruiting to a significant higher level.

So again, even in our assumptions from next year, we’re expecting a mid-single digit growth in sales, but we’re not assuming that the economy is going to improve or that those response rates are going to improve on their own. If they do, we hope to see better growth than what we’re using in our guidance. But I think we’ve been fairly conservative in our estimates for next year as far as sales.

The cash flow that we’ve earned in 2010 on policies issued 2005, we’ve only invested that 5.9% rate that we’ve invested money in this year.
