This morning, I'll review our fourth quarter 2009 results and provide comments on several highlights from the quarter. Jim will then provide additional financial detail, as well as our 2010 guidance.Net sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion. We're pleased that our earnings per share were $1.12 adjusted, above quarterly consensus expectations and in line with our 2009 guidance. For the quarter, we once again recorded year-over-year sales growth in all three of our geographic reporting segments. Asia-Pacific showed notable strength with 6.8% constant currency growth. We're encouraged by the sequential improvement in our Knee business, which posted worldwide year-over-year growth of 5.5% constant currency and incremental growth over the third quarter of 270 basis points. Flex Knees accounted for 57% of our knee unit sales on a global basis in the fourth quarter.For the second consecutive year, Flex Knees represented more than 50% of our annual knee unit sales. Worldwide knee growth was led by the Asia Pacific and Americas geographic segments, with 10.3% and 6.2% constant currency growth, respectively. Reconstructive sales increased 3.5% in constant currency in the quarter. Our 5.5% constant currency knee sales increase represents volume and mix growth of 6.2%, partially offset by negative price of 0.7%.Hip sales were down 0.4% in the quarter in constant currency, reflecting positive volume and mix of 0.4%, less negative price of 0.8%. In the quarter, our European businesses kept pace in a challenging market. This performance was offset by continued sequential improvement in the Americas and Asia Pacific, with our new stems, including the Zimmer M/L Taper Hip Prosthesis with connective technology and the bone-conserving Fitmore Hip stem leading the growth. Although we're just in the early phases of launching our new acetabular cup systems globally, the feedback we've received from the field has been very positive.Extremity products posted healthy results for the quarter, with sales growth of 15.2% constant currency. Once again, our proprietary Trabecular Metal Technology is playing a critical role in addressing previously unmet clinical needs in the expanding extremities market. And during the quarter, we experienced continued rapid sales growth of our Trabecular Metal Shoulder Glenoid. Dental sales on a constant currency basis decreased 4.5% for the quarter. A weak global economy continues to adversely affect market demand for dental implants. For the quarter, dental sales in Asia Pacific increased 11.5%, but were more than offset by slower sales in the Americas and Europe. Our Dental business is performing in line with the market. We continue to believe the dental market will rebound as the global economy recovers, and we look forward to new opportunities as our product line is expanded through internal and external development efforts.Trauma sales in the quarter were up over the prior year period 6.6% constant currency, with particularly strong growth in Europe, which was up 24.9%, driven by Intramedullary Nail sales. Zimmer Spine reported a sales decrease of 14.7% constant currency in the quarter. Our Spinal business continues to experience reimbursement challenges related to the Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization System. The recent FDA panel recommendation was disappointing, but we're working with the FDA to determine the best path forward for this technology in the United States market. The Abbott Spine transaction closed just over a year ago on October 16 of 2008, so our fourth quarter results largely compare performance of the combined business. We're coming to a close at the integration effort and we have successfully enhanced our product offering. We'll still see some revenue dyssynergy and disruption in 2010 on our Spine business. However, we believe that we have a solid portfolio of products and pipeline, as well as a broader global distribution channel that will allow us to take advantage of our investment in the Spine business. We remain committed to this attractive market.In the fourth quarter, our Orthopaedic Surgical Products franchise experienced 13.4% constant currency growth. Sales growth in bone cement, as well as the return to market of wound debridement products helped drive the growth in OSP. There were several highlights from the quarter, but I'd like to mention because they lay a strong foundation for sustained growth in the year ahead. In November, Zimmer received FDA clearance to market in the U.S. two acetabular cup systems, the Zimmer MMC Cup, our new hemispherical, large-diameter-head, metal-on-metal cup system and the Zimmer Continuum Cup, our new modular, multi-bearing surface Trabecular Metal Technology cup system. These systems give surgeons a comprehensive array of acetabular cup solutions that, in concert with our comprehensive stem portfolio, provide tremendous patient-matching options for surgeons.On the knee side, we reached another important milestone in late November with FDA clearance of our Zimmer patient-specific instruments. Zimmer's patient-specific instruments enable a physician to tailor the surgical plan to the patient's unique anatomy, leveraging the physician's own expertise with the industry's leading needs [ph] system. Unlike some patient-specific instruments solutions that create fixed cut guides, we create pin guides that utilize the existing cut guides, preserving intraoperative flexibility. Empowering the surgeon and preserving intraoperative flexibility are hallmarks of Zimmer. Our cut guides offer a more opposing surface to create what we believe is a much better, more reliable and more confident fit. Zimmer is one of the only companies with FDA clearance for both preoperative planning software and patient-specific pin guides. Of course these new products will require time before their contributions to sales and earnings are fully realized. However, we're encouraged that they have been very well-received in the early stages of both our international and domestic launches.We've completed the infrastructure investment projects in Eschbach Germany, our automated centralized distribution facility for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, and in Shannon, Ireland, our new implant manufacturing facility. Both facilities are now operational and providing the planned economic benefits that we can look forward to for the full-year 2010. We finished the year in a strong position in our medical education programming provided through the Zimmer Institute. Our new model for education and BioSkills training has now been implemented around the world and is delivering high quality, highly interactive learning for surgeons and clinicians.Another highlight for the quarter was the excellent job that our associates have done in focusing on working capital management. Because of these efforts, our cash flows remained especially strong during the quarter. Jim will provide more detail about that in his remarks. Finally, I want to briefly mention the senior unsecured notes offering we completed in the fourth quarter of 2009. We took advantage of a great opportunity to retire some pre-existing debt to further strengthen our balance sheet. We're pleased with the results of the offering. With respect to guidance, we provided our outlook for 2010 in the release this morning, which reflects our expectation of delivering sales growth and leverage earnings. Jim will now provide further details on the quarter and our guidance. Jim?"

I will review our performance in the quarter in  more detail and then provide additional information related to our 2010 guidance.Our total revenues for the quarter, as David mentioned, were $1.107 billion, a 2 1/2% constant currency improvement compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Dollar strength in the quarter resulted in a tailwind from foreign currency translation, which increased revenues by 5% or $52 million in the quarter. Consolidated pricing was down 0.3% for the quarter. Pricing in the Americas and Asia Pacific was negative 0.7% and negative 0.5%, respectively, while European results include positive average selling prices of 0.7%, compared to the prior-year fourth quarter. While price pressures persisted throughout 2009, our contract management personnel working diligently with our direct and indirect sales channels managed to effectively defend the outstanding value proposition our devices offer for patients.Our adjusted gross profit margin of 75.5% for the quarter is down 130 basis points from the prior-year fourth quarter and in line with our expectations and the comments we have made on previous calls. Higher unit manufacturing costs as compared against the prior period accounted for the majority of the change.Moving down the income statement, R&D expense as a percentage of sales was similar to last year at 4.7%, and at $51.6 million for the quarter, is up slightly on a total dollar basis when compared to the prior year. Our total R&D spend was 5% of sales for the full year within, but at the low end of our expected range. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $460 million in the fourth quarter. However, at 41.6% of sales, SG&A expenses are 60 basis points below prior-year fourth quarter.As indicated in our release, the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $73 million in the fourth quarter, related to our U.S. Spine reporting unit. The impairment is a non-cash charge and is not deductible for tax purposes, so the charge amounts to $0.35 per diluted share on an after-tax basis. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the full carrying value of the reporting unit may not be recoverable. In accordance with accounting policies as described in our Form 10-K, we performed the annual test for impairment in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we determined a fair value to net assets by U.S. Spine reporting unit by discounting to present value its estimated future cash flows. Due to reimbursement and competitive challenges impacting sales of Dynesys in the U.S., including the non-approvable recommendation by the FDA advisory panel last November, among other factors the estimated discount of future cash flows by U.S. Spine reporting unit was negatively impacted, causing the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit to be lower than the carrying value. We calculated the fair value of goodwill and determined that the goodwill assigned to our U.S. Spine reporting unit was impaired.Continuing down the income statements, acquisition, integration, realignment and other amounted to $9.6 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased to $323.7 million. At 29.2%, our adjusted operating profit-to-sales ratio is 70 basis points lower than the prior-year fourth quarter, largely due to higher production costs. Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $8.7 million, mainly due to the $1 billion senior unsecured notes offering we completed in November 2009. Adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter increased 5.1% compared to prior year at $236.1 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $1.12 on $211.2 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.06 of share-based compensation. At $0.74, reported diluted earnings per share, which include the items reflected in the goodwill impairment, certain claims in acquisition, integration, realignment and other decreased 1.3% from prior-year fourth quarter reported EPS of $0.75.Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.1% and our full-year adjusted tax rate was 26.9%. The rate for the full year was lower than anticipated, and part as a consequence of certain realignment initiatives that drove higher profitability in low tax jurisdictions.During the quarter, we used a portion of the proceeds from our notes offering to repurchase 9 million shares at a total purchase price of $519 million. Approximately $211 million remain authorized under a $1.25 billion repurchase authorization, which expires at the end of 2010. The company had approximately 204 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2009, down from 213 million as of September 30, 2009.Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $385.5 million, up 86% from $206.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Increased net earnings and focus on working capital management contributed to the improvement. At $336.2 million in the fourth quarter, we accomplished another quarter of producing exceptionally strong free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow, less outflows for instruments and property, plant and equipment. Free cash flow for the full year was $888.7 million. Our employees worldwide have taken on the challenge of better managing the inventory assets required to meet ever-increasing service levels. We entered the year intending to decrease investment in inventories on a constant currency basis, while maintaining the same service levels on order fulfillment. We achieved that objective. We're also pleased with the outstanding results our business units achieved with accounts receivable collections in a challenging economic environment. Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 302 days, down 51 days from the third quarter. Our adjusted trade accounts receivable day sales outstanding finished the quarter at 56 days, a seven-day improvement compared to the prior-year quarter and three days better than the fourth quarter of 2008.Depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter amounted to $87.8 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $49.3 million, including $21 million for instruments and $28.3 million for property, plant and equipment. As David mentioned, Shannon and Eschbach are operational. As the new facilities came online, we realigned our spending on property, plant and equipment with capacity utilization and maintenance requirements, which helped to reduce capital expenditures in the quarter. Cash outlays associated with investing activities during the quarter include $2.9 million for acquired intellectual property, another $14.7 million for certain international distributor acquisitions and $66.4 million in certificates of deposit with maturities greater than three months. I'll turn now to our guidance for 2010.In our earnings release this morning, we announced that the company expects full-year revenue to increase between 3% to 5% in constant currency when compared to 2009. At this time, assuming currency rates remain at year-end 2009 levels, we anticipate foreign currency translation will increase our reported 2010 revenues by an estimated 1%. Therefore on a reported basis, our revenues are projected to be in the range of 4% to 6% above 2009 results. Given the expected pacing in our new product launches, we anticipate sales growth in 2010 on a constant currency basis to be lower in the first half than in the second half. In the second half of 2009, we saw encouraging signs that orthopaedic procedure volumes in certain markets were recovering. Our market assumptions, coming out of the fourth quarter, are that in 2010, knee and hip procedures will grow in mid-single digits within the Americas and Asia Pacific markets and remain flat to slightly positive in the Europe, Middle East and Africa markets. On the matter of pricing, we ended the year about where we thought we would with worldwide pricing slightly negative overall, down 0.6%. In 2010, we will of course receive new reimbursement prices from MHLW in Japan which will take effect from April 1, 2010. We anticipate modest price pressure in other markets, such as the U.S. On balance, we expect another year of moderate price erosion of minus 1% to minus 2%. We also anticipate offsetting negative price with positive mix contribution from new products.Assuming currency rates remain at year-end 2009 levels, we expect our gross margin ratio to be approximately 75%. This takes into account the higher cost inventory we carry into 2010, as well as some foreign currency headwind, partially offset by lower anticipated excess and obsolete inventory charges in 2010. We expect the gross margin ratio to be slightly lower in the first half of 2010 as compared to the second half of the year.We expect to continue making investments in R&D in the range of 5% to 6% of sales. SG&A is expected to be approximately 41% of sales for the full year, as we restore leverage from revenue growth, offset in part by sales and marketing investments in support of new product launches. Operating margin is expected to be in the range of 28% to 29% for the year. The interest expense and other line of our P&Ls expected to be unfavorable year-over-year due to the $1 billion notes offering we completed in the fourth quarter of 2009. The impact of this expense on our EPS will be more than offset due to the additional shares we purchased with a portion of the proceeds from the notes offering. We anticipate the 2010 full-year tax rate of approximately 27%, slightly above our final rate for 2009, given the relative growth expectations among the different tax jurisdictions. We anticipate the diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2010 to be between 203 million and 204 million shares. To arrive at our GAAP earnings per share, you should subtract projected acquisition, integration and other cost of approximately $20 million pretax or approximately $0.07 per share.Turning to cash flow, we anticipate total capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $320 million to $340 million. Instrument capital in 2010 is expected to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million. Traditional PP&E is expected to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million, reflecting the cash outlays necessary to complete new product-related investments and normal replacement of older machinery and equipment for 2010. Our first priority for use of free cash flow remains external development when and if the right opportunities arise at technology, products or businesses that strategically align with our focus on musculoskeletal health. Our guidance assumes that we will utilize for share repurchases the $211 million remaining under the approved program that expires at the end of 2010. Free cash flow in excess of $211 million is assumed to be held in cash and cash equivalents.Estimated depreciation and amortization expense for the year is in the range of $350 million to $360 million. 2010 full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $4.15 to $4.35. Finally, please note that our guidance does not include any impact from a potential medical device industry tax, as part of U.S. healthcare reform, potential acquisitions or other unforeseen events. David, I'll turn the call back over to you."

Intra-operative flexibility, with choice of liner and burying [ph] surface for the surgeon, it is the industry-leading in-growth technology with tribecca [ph] metals, so that's a great set up for us.

This is a first-rate cup that's going to perform well for us in that category. So especially in circumstances where we may have maintained a relationship with the surgeon and they're using our products, they like our stems, but they're looking for a metal-on-metal solution consistent with their own preferences, we think that MMC Cup is going to serve us well in those circumstances. So whether it's expanding an existing relationship and potentially taking someone from one bearing surface to another that provides mix opportunity, picking up that case that we were missing because we didn't have a cup that they were looking for or taking market share principally, I think with that continuum cup, we think that these are going to be game changers relative to our performance in that sector."

And I think you mentioned there was some growing reimbursement challenges, some competitive challenges well I actually guess poured [ph] and some Abbott integration issues and then also Dynesys having some challenges here in the U.S. When you look at those various factors, what do you think the biggest hit to you guys right now in Spine is?"

When we spoke about reimbursement, Raj, we're really talking about that in the context of Dynesys. And so that's really the answer to your action question, is the Dynesys franchise, it was a principal driver for the legacy Zimmer spine business grown. And the reimbursement challenges mounted, and obviously the first step to resolving those is a broader claim on their products, which we had been pursuing. We dealt setback in November, but are continuing on a path to try to resolve that favorably for the business, then we're in a position to ultimately set [ph] that  franchise forward. We believe in the technology, and the technology has been out for an extensive period of time. There are tens of thousands of successful procedures that have been conducted, so we do believe that it needs to be a part of the offering going forward. But as a principal growth driver and then all of a sudden that business gets cut down substantially, there really wasn't anything at that particular point in time that was going to backfill it rapidly. So that will stabilize one way or another, and we'll get on with executing everything that we need to on a sales and marketing side with this broader portfolio through a broader distribution channel, So again, we like to market space a lot. We think that we've achieved a lot since 2003 when we picked up only the beginnings of a Spine business. And we're going to stay the course and we'll make progress in 2010."

This morning, I'll review our first quarter 2010 results and provide comments on highlights from the quarter. Jim will then provide additional financial details. 
Net sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion, an increase of 3.4% on a constant currency basis and our earnings per share were $1.02 on an adjusted basis. Our sales performance reflects incremental constant currency growth over the fourth quarter of 2009 of 90 basis points. Sales results improved when compared with the fourth quarter in the Americas and Asia-Pacific but remained under pressure in Europe, Middle East and Africa segment in large part due to the challenging economic environment in that region. For the quarter, we once again recorded year-over-year sales growth in all three of our geographic reporting segments. Americas showed 2.8% constant currency growth while Europe, Middle East and Africa grew slower, as we anticipated, at 1.1%. Asia-Pacific again lead our geographic segments with a solid 10.8% constant currency growth. 
Knee sales for the quarter improved year-over-year 7.4% on a reported basis and 3.8% constant currency, reflecting positive volume and mix of 5% less negative price of 1.2%. Sales of partial knee devices, including The Zimmer Uni-Knee and the Jenner Solutions [ph] patella femoral joint contributed to Knee growth for the quarter. Also showing growth for the quarter were later stage devices like the NextGen Legacy Constrained Condylar Knee and the Rotating-Hinge Knee. We're confident that initiatives already underway will accelerate the growth of our primary knee systems and drive further improvement in the performance of our knee franchise this year. 
At AOES, we debuted an expansion of our Patient-Specific Instrument portfolio by adding our Natural Knee brand to that recently cleared NexGen brand. Our patient-specific instruments are our proprietary toolset customized to the individual patient's anatomy and are designed to streamline total knee replacement procedures by ensuring the successful implementation of the surgeon’s pre-operative planning. We're pleased with the early clinical feedback on these instruments and expect to further leverage our industry-leading knee systems with the continued rollout of patient-specific instruments as well as other innovative instruments that we expect to launch mid-year. 
Hip sales for the quarter improved year-over-year 5.4% on a reported basis and 1% constant currency, reflecting positive volume and mix of 2.1% less negative price of 1.1%. Sales of recision-hip products such as The Zimmer Modular Revision Hip and the Trabecular Metal revision shell and augment cups were strong in the quarter when compared to prior year, as were sales of BioLux delta heads. With 140 basis points of incremental growth over the fourth quarter, we see positive signs in our hip business. 
The global launches of our Continuum System and MMC acetabular products are underway. But as we described before, we don't expect to see a meaningful impact from these new product introductions until the second half of this year after sets of implants and instruments are more widely deployed. 
We are, however, on track with our expectations for the stage rollout of these products and the initial clinical feedback has been quite positive. The Continuum System further reinforces Zimmer's commitment to providing surgeons with the most comprehensive flexible and integrated array of metal, ceramic and Polyethylene solutions to meet the diverse and unique needs of their total hip replacement patients. In combination with our Comprehensive Step portfolio, including our Fitmore Hip Stem and our M/L taper with connective technology, the Continuum System offers surgeons tremendous flexibility and confidence to personalize the implant solution. 
Extremity Products posted healthy results for the quarter with sales growth of 13.9% constant currency. Our Trabecular Metal Technology has played a key role in the success of this product line as the TM Reverse Shoulder and TM Glenoid continue their outstanding growth trends. 
Following a year of weaker demand caused by the global recession, our Dental sales increased 6.2% constant currency for the quarter. Sales of our implants restorative components and regenerative products all grew in the quarter. The Asia-Pacific region reported the largest increase in Dental sales at 23.9% for the quarter with distributors in the region restocking as demand begins to recover from the depressed levels of the prior year. 
Trauma sales in the quarter were up over the prior-year period 2.7% constant currency. Sales of non-contact bridging plates, cable products, intramedullary nails and locking plates and screws contributed to growth in the quarter. The comprehensive rollout of our Natural Nail system remains key to driving improved performance in Trauma. The rollout continued during the quarter with a limited release of Acephalamedullary Nail. The reception of the TM Nail System has been extremely positive with surgeons who have commented on the ease of use due to the anatomical nail design proprietary fixed-angle locking-screw technology and intuitive instrumentation. 
Zimmer Spine reported sales decrease of 9.1% constant currency in the first quarter. Our Spinal business continues to experience challenges related in part to the Dynesys dynamic stabilization system, but we remain committed to the product category. We expect incremental growth opportunities for Dynesys in regions outside the United States. Overall, signs of improvement in our Spine business are reflected in the growth reported by our international units and in the positive worldwide growth recorded for acquired spine products, including the Pathfinder MIS platform, the Artist Inner-body System, the Universal Clamp and the Sequoia pedicle Screw System. For the quarter, Spine sales increased 15% in Europe and 7.7% in Asia-Pacific, although our base there is relatively small compared to our Americas business. 
Europe and Asia-Pacific growth is coming from stabilization of our distribution channel resulting from our 2009 integration efforts 
In the first quarter, our Orthopedics Surgical Product franchise experienced 18.3% constant currency growth. Sales of wound debridement devices were up over 65% in the quarter as our global sales channel continue to make progress on recovering market share in the category. Bone, cement and powered instruments also reported strong numbers in the quarter compared to prior year. I want to make particular note of the excellent performances for the quarter by our Dental and OSP businesses and by our Asia-Pacific team. Each has faced considerable challenges for nearly two years and I'd like to thank these teams for the work that they have done to turn their performance around. 
There are a couple of other topics I'll touch on briefly. Regarding pricing, consolidated average selling prices in the first quarter were down 0.7% compared to the prior-year period. We experienced negative pricing of 1.1% in the Americas, positive pricing in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region of 0.2% and negative pricing in the Asia-Pacific region of 0.4%. Now please keep in mind that bi-annual pricing adjustments in Japan did not go into effect until April 1. The consolidated pricing for the first quarter was consistent with our expectations and we continue to anticipate moderate price erosion of minus 1% to minus 2% for the year. Volume trends across our geographic regions were largely in line with our expectations for the quarter. Volumes throughout our Europe, Middle East and Africa region continue to be suppressed but appear stable as contemplated in our guidance. In the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions, demand appears to be returning to prerecession levels. Finally, with respect to guidance, as we said in our earnings release this morning, we are reaffirming our outlook for 2010. 
Jim will now provide further details on the quarter and our guidance. Jim?"

I will review our performance in the quarter in more detail and then provide additional information related to our 2010 guidance. Our total revenues for the quarter, as David mentioned, were $1,063,000,000, a 3.4% constant currency improvement compared to the first quarter of last year. Dollar strength in the quarter resulted in a tailwind from foreign currency translation which increased revenues by 3.7% or $36 million in the quarter. Our adjusted gross profit margin at 74.9% for the quarter was in line with our expectations and 230 basis points below the prior year. As expected, higher unit cost of product sold and foreign currency hedge losses as compared with prior period hedge gains account for the majority of the change. As we continue to deploy our pipeline inventory of our recently cleared acetabular cups products and our new line of Intramedullary nails, as well as experience steady growth in our core reconstructive business, we improved utilization across our manufacturing network. As a result, and also taking into account the change in our outlook for foreign currency translation, we are now expecting our gross margin ratio to be between 75% and 76% for the full year. 
Moving down the income statement, R&D expense as a percentage of sales was at 4.8% and at $51 million for the quarter is 1.8% favorable on a total dollar basis when compared to the prior year. Our R&D spend in the prior year was higher due to the extensive development activities underway at that time related to the Continuum and MMC cup products, as well as the Zimmer Natural Nail. We are expecting R&D expense to increase through the balance of the year as new development programs accelerate. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $447 million in the first quarter, but at 42% of sales, SG&A expenses are 70 basis points below prior year first quarter. Medical training and education expenses increased in the quarter as compared to the prior year. Spending related to certain operational excellence and growth initiatives also contributed to higher expenses in the quarter. As a consequence of accelerating these programs, SG&A as a percentage of sales is now anticipated to be between 41% and 42% for the full year. 
Continuing down the income statement, acquisition, integration, realignment and other amounted to $2.6 million in the quarter and includes costs principally related to prior period acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased to $298 million. At 28%, our adjusted operating profit to sales ratio is 130 basis points below prior-year first quarter, largely due to higher production costs. Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $14.6 million compared to $3.7 million in the prior-year quarter mainly due to the $1 billion senior unsecured notes offering we completed in November of 2009. Adjusted net earnings were $207.4 million for the quarter, a decrease of 1.2% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 7.4% to $1.02 on 204.2 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share inclusive of approximately $0.05 of share-based compensation. At $1.01, reported diluted earnings per share which included the items reflected in Acquisition Integration, Realignment and Other increased 11% over the prior-year first quarter reported EPS of $0.91. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 26.8%, in line with our expectations. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares at a total purchase price of $94 million. As of March 31, 2010, approximately $118 million remained authorized under a $1.25 billion repurchase program which expires at the end of 2010. The Company had approximately 203 million shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2010, down from 204 million as of December 31, 2009. Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $260 million, up 41% from $185 million in the first quarter of 2009. In the prior-year quarter, we resolved outstanding payments to health care professionals and institutions, resulting in substantial cash outflows. The strong results for the quarter also reflect the benefit of our continued efforts to streamline inventory investments. Overall, the operating cash flow for the first quarter is representative of our expectations for continued strength in cash flow.  A $209 million in the first quarter free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less cash outflows for instruments and property plant equipment, is in line with our expectations at this point in the year. 
Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 302 days, a decrease of 71 days compared to the first quarter of 2009, as a result of field and central warehouse page inventory reductions achieved in the second half of 2009. Our adjusted trade accounts receivable day sales outstanding finished the quarter at 60 days, a decrease of one day from the first quarter of 2009. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter amounted to $84.9 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $50.9 million including $39.3 million for instruments and $11.6 million for property plant equipment. We expect capital expenditures to be higher in each of the subsequent quarters for the remainder of the year as we replace machinery and equipment in the normal course and invest in instruments to support our new product launches. Cash outlays associated with investing activities during the quarter included $2.9 million for certain international distributor acquisitions. 
I'd like to turn now to our guidance for 2010. In our earnings release this morning, we reaffirmed our full-year constant currency sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance. Full-year revenues are expected to increase between 3% and 5% on a constant currency basis, assuming foreign currency exchange rates remain near recent levels, the Company estimate that foreign currency translation will increase revenues by  0.5% for the full year 2010, resulting in expected revenue growth on a reported basis between 3.5% and 5.5%. 2010 full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in a range of $4.15 to $4.35.

In the first quarter, we made progress that will enable us to accelerate our growth. Our improving performance and incremental manufacturing throughput are allowing us to increase investments in several strategic initiatives. We're also encouraged by improvements in working capital management, which helped generate strong cash flows during the quarter. In addition, our new product launches are progressing and we're continuing to deploy instruments and implants and the medical education associated with the new systems. As mentioned earlier, the clinical feedback we've received, both in the early launches domestically and in jurisdictions outside the U.S. where they've been in use for a number of months, gives us further optimism that these products are providing surgeons with excellent solutions for their patients. More broadly, our organization has a sense of excitement coming off the AEOS meeting and we're driving our strategic plan and moving forward with confidence. 
And now I'd like to have Celeste to begin the Q&A portion of our call."

On the hip side, the acetabular cups are going to give us great opportunities to pair those up with what we believe to be industry-leading technology on the step side, and we're already seeing early indications that, that hypothesis is going to prove very much true. Those sets do take time to get out and, as we've said, it really is a second half of the year productivity story for us on the deployments. In the jurisdictions overseas where the cups have been launched and are probably, say that early period, six months, into the process, we are already seeing improvements in the performance in those markets. So the uptake has been attractive. I am absolute that we're going to see the same experience in the U.S. markets. 
On the knee side, it's much the same story. We mentioned PSI. We're getting good uptick in that already. I will tell you that I think it's going to be a growth driver for us principally in the U.S. marketplace, but there are other instruments that will be launching mid-year that were going to put us in a much more competitive advantage for instruments to be responsive to what the surgeons are looking for. They're looking for simpler instruments to take time out of the OR, lead to reproducible results for more ergonomically design, and we have a great solution that we'll be launching mid-year in that category. So we’re very optimistic about the prospects for improving both of those key franchise performances within the year."

So again, with the build out of the pipeline for our new acetabular cup products as well as our new line of Intramedullary nails, we're seeing increased improvement  across the manufacturing network. We expect that to continue through the first half of the year. So we're now putting lower cost inventory to the shelf, and we anticipate that inventory is going to turn in the second half of the year. So, in part, that's what leads us to a higher expectation for the gross margin ratio for the second half. 
Now I should point out that production volumes are expected to peak in the first half of 2010 with these pipeline inventory builds and then taper off perhaps in the second half of the year. And there is about a six-month lag in recognition of those efficiencies across the network. Now, how much of it tapers off will depend in part on the success we have with penetration of those new products as well as procedure growth rates across our core markets. And that accounts for about half of the improvements, David, that’s reflected in the updated guidance that we provided. The other half is related to the change in outlook that we have for foreign currency. So to use the rates that were in effect at the time that we gave our guidance at the beginning of the year, we clearly have a different outlook with respect to the hedge losses we were projecting at the time relative to the gains that we have experienced last year."

So I don't think that that's a driving issue for our performance at this stage. 
As far as the hip launch goes, I don't see anything that's happening with metal-on-metal as at all inhibiting our ability to execute on the opportunity that we hace with this new cup system. We were always quite low relative to the market in our share of that metal-on-metal side of things, down around 5% relative to a market that was probably 25% to 30% as measured by dollars and maybe 20% to 25% as measured by units. And some of the competitors had 50% or maybe even north of 50% in mix. So while there is likely to be some settling of the composition of the overall mix of metal within the hip cup offerings for the market, we have nothing but upside on that. And we don't believe that that segment is going to go away within the market. So this is all a great opportunity for us.

You see numbers around, plus or minus a couple of percent or so in each of those markets, but when you wait them out, it looks like a very flat market for the large joints right now. There obviously are good growth opportunities stiil in those developing markets in Europe, but they're not large enough to offset the flat nature of the large five within Europe. And so as we described in our prepared remarks, we see stability in that. I don't think that it’s getting worse. I think that it's stable. And so at some point, clearly those markets are going to improve, but it really involves a fair amount of speculation as to when that’s going to occur, because you're looking for a more fundamental recovery in some of those economies, freeing up some of those dollars that are controlled by those centralized healthcare systems so that those patients that are deferring receiving the implants right now can get in and get the benefits of those solutions. And I still would project out the way we did in our guidance call earlier this year as far as Europe goes. And it's going to be flat to slightly positive."

This morning, I'll review our first quarter 2010 results and provide comments on highlights from the quarter. Jim will then provide additional financial details. 
Net sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion, an increase of 3.4% on a constant currency basis and our earnings per share were $1.02 on an adjusted basis. Our sales performance reflects incremental constant currency growth over the fourth quarter of 2009 of 90 basis points. Sales results improved when compared with the fourth quarter in the Americas and Asia-Pacific but remained under pressure in Europe, Middle East and Africa segment in large part due to the challenging economic environment in that region. For the quarter, we once again recorded year-over-year sales growth in all three of our geographic reporting segments. Americas showed 2.8% constant currency growth while Europe, Middle East and Africa grew slower, as we anticipated, at 1.1%. Asia-Pacific again led our geographic segments with a solid 10.8% constant currency growth. 
Knee sales for the quarter improved year-over-year 7.4% on a reported basis and 3.8% constant currency, reflecting positive volume and mix of 5% less negative price of 1.2%. Sales of partial knee devices, including The Zimmer Uni-Knee and the Gender Solutions Patello-Femoral Joint contributed to Knee growth for the quarter. Also showing growth for the quarter were later stage devices like the NextGen Legacy Constrained Condylar Knee and the Rotating-Hinge Knee. We're confident that initiatives already underway will accelerate the growth of our primary knee systems and drive further improvement in the performance of our knee franchise this year. 
At AOES, we debuted an expansion of our Patient-Specific Instrument portfolio by adding our Natural Knee brand to that recently cleared NexGen brand. Our patient-specific instruments are our proprietary toolset customized to the individual patient's anatomy and are designed to streamline total knee replacement procedures by ensuring the successful implementation of the surgeon’s pre-operative planning. We're pleased with the early clinical feedback on these instruments and expect to further leverage our industry-leading knee systems with the continued rollout of patient-specific instruments as well as other innovative instruments that we expect to launch mid-year. 
Hip sales for the quarter improved year-over-year 5.4% on a reported basis and 1% constant currency, reflecting positive volume and mix of 2.1% less negative price of 1.1%. Sales of recision-hip products such as The Zimmer Modular Revision Hip and the Trabecular Metal revision shell and augment cups were strong in the quarter when compared to prior year, as were sales of BioLux delta heads. With 140 basis points of incremental growth over the fourth quarter, we see positive signs in our hip business. 
The global launches of our Continuum System and MMC acetabular products are underway. But as we described before, we don't expect to see a meaningful impact from these new product introductions until the second half of this year after sets of implants and instruments are more widely deployed. 
We are, however, on track with our expectations for the stage rollout of these products and the initial clinical feedback has been quite positive. The Continuum System further reinforces Zimmer's commitment to providing surgeons with the most comprehensive flexible and integrated array of metal, ceramic and Polyethylene solutions to meet the diverse and unique needs of their total hip replacement patients. In combination with our Comprehensive Step portfolio, including our Fitmore Hip Stem and our M/L taper with connective technology, the Continuum System offers surgeons tremendous flexibility and confidence to personalize the implant solution. 
Extremity Products posted healthy results for the quarter with sales growth of 13.9% constant currency. Our Trabecular Metal Technology has played a key role in the success of this product line as the TM Reverse Shoulder and TM Glenoid continue their outstanding growth trends. 
Following a year of weaker demand caused by the global recession, our Dental sales increased 6.2% constant currency for the quarter. Sales of our implants restorative components and regenerative products all grew in the quarter. The Asia-Pacific region reported the largest increase in Dental sales at 23.9% for the quarter with distributors in the region restocking as demand begins to recover from the depressed levels of the prior year. 
Trauma sales in the quarter were up over the prior-year period 2.7% constant currency. Sales of non-contact bridging plates, cable products, intramedullary nails and locking plates and screws contributed to growth in the quarter. The comprehensive rollout of our Natural Nail system remains key to driving improved performance in Trauma. The rollout continued during the quarter with a limited release of a cephalomedullary nail. The reception of the TM '[Trabecular Metal] nail system has been extremely positive with surgeons who have commented on ease of use due to the anatomical nail design, proprietary fixed-angle locking screw technology and intuitive instrumentation. 
Zimmer Spine reported a sales decrease of 9.1% constant currency in the quarter. Our Spinal business continues to experience challenges related in part to the Dynesys Dynamic Stabilization System, but we remain committed to the product category. We expect incremental growth opportunities for Dynesys in regions outside the United States. Overall, signs of improvement in our Spine business are reflected in the growth reported by our international units and in the positive worldwide growth recorded for acquired spine products, including the Pathfinder MIS platform, the Ardis Interbody System, the Universal Clamp and the Sequoia Pedicle Screw System. For the quarter, Spine sales increased 15% in Europe and 7.7% in Asia-Pacific, although our base there is relatively small compared to our Americas business.  Europe and Asia-Pacific growth is coming from stabilization of our distribution channel resulting from our 2009 integration efforts 
In the first quarter, our Orthopaedic Surgical Products franchise experienced 18.3% constant-currency growth. Sales of wound debridement devices were up over 65% in the quarter as our global sales channel continue to make progress on recovering market share in the category. Bone cement and powered instruments also reported strong numbers in the quarter compared to prior year. 
I want to make particular note of the excellent performances for the quarter by our Dental and OSP businesses and by our Asia-Pacific team. Each has faced considerable challenges for nearly two years and I'd like to thank these teams for the work that they have done to turn their performance around. 
There are a couple of other topics I'll touch on briefly. Regarding pricing, consolidated average selling prices in the first quarter were down 0.7% compared to the prior-year period. We experienced negative pricing of 1.1% in the Americas, positive pricing in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region of 0.2% and negative pricing in the Asia-Pacific region of 0.4%. Now please keep in mind that bi-annual pricing adjustments in Japan did not go into effect until April 1. 
The consolidated pricing for the first quarter was consistent with our expectations and we continue to anticipate moderate price erosion of minus 1% to minus 2% for the year. Volume trends across our geographic regions were largely in line with our expectations for the quarter. Volumes throughout our Europe, Middle East and Africa region continue to be suppressed but appear stable as contemplated in our guidance. In the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions, demand appears to be returning to prerecession levels. Finally, with respect to guidance, as we said in our earnings release this morning, we are reaffirming our outlook for 2010. 
Jim will now provide further details on the quarter and our guidance. Jim?"

I will review our performance in the quarter in more detail and then provide additional information related to our 2010 guidance.

I will review our performance in the quarter in more detail and then provide additional information related to our 2010 guidance. Our total revenues for the quarter, as David mentioned, were $1,063,000,000, a 3.4% constant-currency improvement compared to the first quarter of last year. Dollar strength in the quarter resulted in a tailwind from foreign currency translation which increased revenues by 3.7% or $36 million in the quarter.
 Our adjusted gross profit margin at 74.9% for the quarter was in line with our expectations and 230 basis points below the prior year. As expected, higher unit cost of product sold and foreign currency hedge losses as compared with prior-period hedge gains account for the majority of the change. As we continue to build and deploy pipeline inventory of our recently cleared acetabular cup products and our new line of Intramedullary nails, as well as experience steady growth in our core Reconstructive business, we improved utilization across our manufacturing network. As a result, and also taking into account the change in our outlook for foreign currency translation, we are now expecting our gross margin ratio to be between 75% and 76% for the full year. 
Moving down the income statement, R&D expense as a percentage of sales was at 4.8%, and at $51 million for the quarter, is 1.8% favorable on a total-dollar basis when compared to the prior year. Our R&D spend in the prior year was higher due to the extensive development activities underway at that time related to the Continuum and MMC Cup products, as well as the Zimmer Natural Nail. We are expecting R&D expense to increase through the balance of the year as new development programs accelerate. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $447 million in the first quarter, but at 42% of sales, SG&A expenses are 70 basis points below prior year first quarter. Medical training and education expenses increased in the quarter as compared to the prior year. Spending related to certain operational excellence and growth initiatives also contributed to higher expenses in the quarter. As a consequence of accelerating these programs, SG&A as a percentage of sales is now anticipated to be between 41% and 42% for the full year. 
Continuing down the income statement, acquisition, integration, realignment and other amounted to $2.6 million in the quarter and includes costs principally related to prior period acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased to $298 million. At 28%, our adjusted operating profit to sales ratio is 130 basis points below prior-year first quarter, largely due to higher production costs. Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $14.6 million compared to $3.7 million in the prior-year quarter mainly due to the $1 billion senior unsecured notes offering we completed in November of 2009. Adjusted net earnings were $207.4 million for the quarter, a decrease of 1.2% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 7.4% to $1.02 on 204.2 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share inclusive of approximately $0.05 of share-based compensation. At $1.01, reported diluted earnings per share which included the items reflected in Acquisition Integration, Realignment and Other increased 11% over the prior-year first quarter reported EPS of $0.91. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 26.8%, in line with our expectations. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares at a total purchase price of $94 million. As of March 31, 2010, approximately $118 million remained authorized under a $1.25 billion repurchase program which expires at the end of 2010. The Company had approximately 203 million shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2010, down from 204 million as of December 31, 2009. Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $260 million, up 41% from $185 million in the first quarter of 2009. In the prior-year quarter, we resolved outstanding payments to health care professionals and institutions, resulting in substantial cash outflows. The strong results for the quarter also reflect the benefit of our continued efforts to streamline inventory investments. Overall, the operating cash flow for the first quarter is representative of our expectations for continued strength in cash flow.  A $209 million in the first quarter free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less cash outflows for instruments and property plant equipment, is in line with our expectations at this point in the year. 
Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 302 days, a decrease of 71 days compared to the first quarter of 2009, as a result of field and central warehouse page inventory reductions achieved in the second half of 2009. Our adjusted trade accounts receivable day sales outstanding finished the quarter at 60 days, a decrease of one day from the first quarter of 2009. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter amounted to $84.9 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $50.9 million including $39.3 million for instruments and $11.6 million for property plant equipment. We expect capital expenditures to be higher in each of the subsequent quarters for the remainder of the year as we replace machinery and equipment in the normal course and invest in instruments to support our new product launches. Cash outlays associated with investing activities during the quarter included $2.9 million for certain international distributor acquisitions. 
I'd like to turn now to our guidance for 2010. In our earnings release this morning, we reaffirmed our full-year constant currency sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance. Full-year revenues are expected to increase between 3% and 5% on a constant currency basis, assuming foreign currency exchange rates remain near recent levels, the Company estimate that foreign currency translation will increase revenues by  0.5% for the full year 2010, resulting in expected revenue growth on a reported basis between 3.5% and 5.5%. 2010 full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in a range of $4.15 to $4.35. 
David, I'll turn the call back over to you."

On the hip side, the acetabular cups are going to give us great opportunities to pair those up with what we believe to be industry-leading technology on the step side, and we're already seeing early indications that, that hypothesis is going to prove very much true. Those sets do take time to get out and, as we've said, it really is a second half of the year productivity story for us on the deployments. In the jurisdictions overseas where the cups have been launched and are probably, say that early period, six months, into the process, we are already seeing improvements in the performance in those markets. So the uptake has been attractive. I am absolute that we're going to see the same experience in the U.S. markets.  On the knee side, it's much the same story. We mentioned PSI. We're getting good uptick in that already. I will tell you that I think it's going to be a growth driver for us principally in the U.S. marketplace, but there are other instruments that will be launching mid-year that were going to put us in a much more competitive advantage for instruments to be responsive to what the surgeons are looking for. They're looking for simpler instruments to take time out of the OR, lead to reproducible results for more ergonomically design, and we have a great solution that we'll be launching mid-year in that category.

Without going into too much detail, those investments are generally in the area of sales and marketing support for new products and include, just to give one example, sales planning and scheduling tools that can be used to optimize field inventory and instrument deployments as we get into these major new product launches. So I guess the other thing I would tell you is that just given where we are with these new product launches in this operating period, the focus of those investments is naturally going to be on sales and marketing. You can expect coming out of this operating period, we'd like to be investing more money in research and development to accelerate new product development programs.

So again, with the build out of the pipeline for our new acetabular cup products as well as our new line of Intramedullary nails, we're seeing increased improvement  across the manufacturing network. We expect that to continue through the first half of the year. So we're now putting lower cost inventory to the shelf, and we anticipate that inventory is going to turn in the second half of the year. So, in part, that's what leads us to a higher expectation for the gross margin ratio for the second half.  Now I should point out that production volumes are expected to peak in the first half of 2010 with these pipeline inventory builds and then taper off perhaps in the second half of the year. And there is about a six-month lag in recognition of those efficiencies across the network. Now, how much of it tapers off will depend in part on the success we have with penetration of those new products as well as procedure growth rates across our core markets. And that accounts for about half of the improvements, David, that’s reflected in the updated guidance that we provided. The other half is related to the change in outlook that we have for foreign currency.

So I don't think that that's a driving issue for our performance at this stage.  As far as the hip launch goes, I don't see anything that's happening with metal-on-metal as at all inhibiting our ability to execute on the opportunity that we have with this new cup system. We were always quite low relative to the market in our share of that metal-on-metal side of things, down around 5% relative to a market that was probably 25% to 30% as measured by dollars and maybe 20% to 25% as measured by units. And some of the competitors had 50% or maybe even north of 50% in mix. So while there is likely to be some settling of the composition of the overall mix of metal within the hip cup offerings for the market, we have nothing but upside on that. And we don't believe that that segment is going to go away within the market. So this is all a great opportunity for us.

I think that this particular solution has some leveragability on other franchises, but I think that it will be augmented by other technologies that create more efficient reproducible procedures that give the surgeons even more confidence. So it's an area of import. I think that it's an area that we intend to improve and lead the industry in improving. As far as penetration rates, that is just going to depend upon the clinical success that people have with these procedures and, importantly, whether or not they solve some other challenges. There's going to be a cost challenge, there's going to be a reimbursement challenge and an income challenge on the surgeon’s part. And so all of those instrument advancements are going to have to be crafted in a way where they resolve multiple issues and create value in multiple contexts and that really will dictate what level of penetration.

So we're going to be in a good position when there is a more full recovery, and that will come, but come it hasn't come yet, Matt."

We're glad you could join us for today's call. This morning, I will review our second quarter and first half 2010 results. Jim will then provide additional financial details. Throughout the first",1215,"Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone, and welcome. We're glad you could join us for today's call. This morning, I will review our second quarter and first half 2010 results. Jim will then provide additional financial details. 
Throughout the first six months of 2010, we've continued to perform in line with our expectations entering the year, demonstrating year-over-year constant-currency sales growth across all geographic segments. We've made progress with new product introductions, particularly in our Hip business, and we expect these additions, along with our new instrument offerings in Knees will increasingly contribute to revenues in the second half of the year.
Net sales for the quarter were $1.06 billion, an increase of 3.3% on a constant-currency basis, and our earnings per share were $1.09 on an adjusted basis. For the quarter, the Americas region grew sales 2.8% constant currency compared to the prior year. The Asia-Pacific segment grew 6.5%. And despite a continued challenging market, our Europe, Middle East and Africa region improved its sales performance with 2.8% growth. Knee sales for the quarter improved year-over-year, 3% on a constant-currency basis, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.5%, less negative price of 1.5%.
To accelerate our growth in the Knee franchise, we've launched several strategic initiatives to reinforce the strength and performance of our Knee systems, which we believe will also help to gain new customers. We continue to see growth in our patient-specific instruments as more physicians seek opportunities to optimize the accuracy of their surgical cases, as well as enhance their operative inefficiency with these MRI-based surgical guides. Along with patient-specific instruments, we plan to deploy our posterior referencing instruments in the second half of this year, following the developer release that took place this past quarter. 
Posterior referencing instruments offer physicians, who subscribe to the surgical philosophy, access to our clinically proven NexGen implant. Early trial results have been encouraging as these instruments have been favorably received by posterior referencing positions. 
Hip sales for the second quarter improved year-over-year 2.6% on a constant-currency basis, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.2% less negative price of 1.6%. Adoption of our newly launched Continuum System Acetabular products continues to progress, and we anticipate sales of these products will positively impact our performance in the second half of the year. The Continuum System, combined the best of Zimmer's proven Hip technologies and further reinforces our commitment to providing an integrated line of polyethylene, ceramic and metal bearing options that more closely match the unique needs and lifestyles of patients.
Growth in the second quarter was supported by our Fitmore and M/L Taper with connective technology stems, which we firmly believe represents the industry's most versatile Hip System. The Fitmore Stem experienced 56% sales growth compared to the prior year as its bone preservation attributes continued to be favored by many surgeons and patients. Sales of our M/L Taper with connective technology grew 31% in the quarter compared to last year. This product offers the surgeons superior interoperative flexibility with its independent adjustment of labeling, offset and version to match a wide range of patient anatomies. Positive performance across our Hip business is reflected by the 160 basis points of incremental growth over the first quarter.
Extremities posted solid results for the quarter with sales growth of 13% constant currency, due in large part to the success of our Trabecular Metal products sold in United States. Noteworthy product lines were the Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder with 31% second quarter sales growth, and the Trabecular Metal Glenoid, which doubled its sales compared to the same period in the prior year. 
Our Dental business reported another solid quarter as well, with sales increasing 7.7% constant currency. Following last year's weak demand fueled by global economic uncertainty, we believe our two successive quarters of growth reflect a stabilizing trend in this sector, as well as a nice performance from our Dental team. The Americas contributed 8.7% growth and sales in Europe increased 10.6% constant currency over the prior year quarter. Earlier this month, Zimmer Dental launched Zimmer Collagen Capsules and Wedge, the first-ever bone shaping membranes for dental graft containment during sinus lifts, socket repair and preservation procedures.
Trauma sales in the second quarter were up over the prior year 1% constant currency. The global rollout of our Natural Nail System continue with our recently released Cephalomedullary Nail. The second quarter also marked the first implantation of our NCB Periprosthetic Plating System, the first compress of solution for addressing complex femoral fractures around the area of a knee or hip implant. The rollout of this product will continue throughout the remainder of 2010.
Our Spine business has been through a series of operational challenges over the past few quarters, and we recorded a sales decrease of 9.2% constant currency in the second quarter. As we negotiate the challenging reimbursement landscape and continue to focus on improved sales execution, we anticipate performance will begin to stabilize. 
We continue to make steady progress in our Orthopaedic Surgical Products franchise. We reported 14.6% constant-currency growth, supported by 56% sales growth in Wound Debridement and 13% sales growth in the wound cement and accessories category, both on a constant-currency basis.
Before handing off to Jim, I'll briefly touch on a few final topics. Regarding the overall market, while there did appear to be a modest step-down in growth during the second quarter, we believe that the broader market dynamics are unchanged. Looking at the first half of the year, based on a majority of the market having reported second quarter results, it appears that worldwide reconstructive growth is actually up about 1% compared to the full year growth in 2009. Moreover, the fundamental drivers for attractive growth within the musculoskeletal markets have not changed. 
Turning to the European market. Our performance in this a geographic segment remains in line with our expectations coming into the year. Although government spending controls continue to contribute to challenging market conditions in Europe overall, we're not seeing further market deterioration, and we're encouraged by our performance during the quarter. 
With regard to pricing, consolidated average selling prices in the second quarter were down 0.9% compared to the prior year period. We experienced negative pricing of 1.1% in Americas, positive pricing in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region of 0.4%, and negative pricing in the Asia-Pacific region of 2.4%, driven largely by the price cuts in Japan. Consolidated pricing for the second quarter was consistent with our expectations, and we continue to anticipate moderate price erosion of negative 1% to negative 2% for the year. With respect to guidance, as we discussed in our earnings release this morning, we're reaffirming our outlook for 2010. 
Finally, we announced this morning that Zimmer has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Beijing Montagne Medical Devices Co. Ltd. The agreement contains certain closing conditions, and we anticipate consummating the acquisition in late 2010 or early 2011. Montagne is a China-based manufacturer and distributor of orthopaedic implants with annual revenues of approximately $10 million. This acquisition would make Zimmer the leading provider of reconstructive orthopaedic solutions in China. We're excited about this opportunity to expand our presence in a vital emerging market for the industry.
Jim will now provide further details on the quarter and on our guidance. Jim?"

I will review our performance in the quarter in more detail and then provide additional information related to our 2010 guidance. Our total revenues for the quarter, as David mentioned, were $1,058,000,000, a 3.3% constant-currency improv",1373,"Thanks, David. I will review our performance in the quarter in more detail and then provide additional information related to our 2010 guidance. 
Our total revenues for the quarter, as David mentioned, were $1,058,000,000, a 3.3% constant-currency improvement compared to the second quarter of last year. Our tailwind from the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen offset a headwind from the euro in the quarter, resulting in a slightly positive impact from foreign currency translation, which increased revenues by 0.4% or $4 million in the quarter. Our adjusted gross profit margin of 76.3% for the quarter reflects improvements in operating efficiency and the recognition of gains on currency hedge contracts. The margin ratio is down 70 basis points compared to second quarter 2009 but increased 140 basis points compared with the first quarter. We are now expecting our gross margin ratio to be between 76% and 76.5% for the full year. These expectations include an assumption that foreign currency exchange rates remain at recent levels. 
Moving down the income statement, R&D expense, as a percentage of sales, was at 5.2%. And that $55.1 million for the quarter is 10.5% higher on a total dollar basis when compared to the prior year. This increase is in line with our plans for the year, as we begin to accelerate our new product development programs in the second quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $437 million in the second quarter and at 41.4% of sales or 100 basis point below prior year. SG&A, as a percentage of sales, is now anticipated to be approximately 42% for the full year, as our outlook is negatively impacted by a change in foreign currency exchange rates and the higher product liability expenses incurred in the first quarter.
We expect SG&A expense to increase to around 43.5% of sales in the third quarter due to seasonality. Typically, the third quarter SG&A expense, as a percentage of sales, represents the high watermark for the year due to the summer slowdown of procedure volumes. During the second quarter, the company recorded a provision of $75 million for known and anticipated claims related to the Durom Cup. Zimmer's estimate for these claims now include worldwide revisions associated with surgeries predating the 2008 temporary U.S. suspension. Adjusted 2010 figures exclude the impact of this provision. The total provision for all claims to include those that were expensed in the normal course is now $222 million. This estimated contingent liability is based on a two-year pattern of claims made. Prior estimates were necessarily based on a smaller data set of claims made and the shorter time series. An independent actuarial model was also used to assist in determining an appropriate level of approval for these claims. Any claims received outside of the defined timeframe are managed in the normal course and are reflected in our standard quarterly product liability accruals.
Continuing down the income statement, acquisition integration realignment and other amounted to, $11.5 million in the quarter and includes one-time cost for realignment of our global IT infrastructure and other charges related to prior-period acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased to $315 million, a 29.7%, our adjusted operating profit per sales ratio is 10 basis points lower than the prior year second quarter, as the anticipated decrease in gross margin was offset by leverage in SG&A. Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $14.3 million compared to $4 million in the prior-year quarter. Similar to the first quarter, the change is primarily due to the $1 billion senior unsecured notes offering we completed in November of 2009. Adjusted net earnings were $221 million for the second quarter, an increase of 2.6% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $1.09 on $203 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.06 of share-based compensation. At $0.82 reported diluted earnings per share, which include the items reflected in certain claims and acquisition, integration, realignment and other, decreased 16.3% from the prior year second quarter reported EPS of $0.98. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.4%, slightly below the first quarter as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax positions. We still anticipate a 2010 full year tax rate of approximately 27%.
During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at a full purchase price of $85 million. As of June 30, 2010, approximately $32 million remained authorized under $1.25 billion repurchase program, which expires at the end of 2010. The company had approximately 201 million shares of common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2010, down from $204 million as of December 31, 2009. Our Board has approved an additional $1.5 billion stock repurchase program, which expires December 31, 2013. We continually review the best utilization of the cash that we generate. Our intentions with regard to use of free cash flow remain the same as we have indicated for some time. Our first priority is external development, when and if the right opportunities arise, to add technology, products or businesses that strategically align with our focus on musculoskeletal health. We balance this priority with maintaining strong liquidity and continue to believe that share repurchases are an efficient and effective way to return excess free cash flow to our shareholders. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $273 million, up nearly 40% from $195 million in the second quarter of 2009. Our focused efforts on managing our working capital have allowed us to offset significant investments to build out the inventory pipeline for Acetabular Cup and Intramedullary Nail new product launches. This quarter, we continue to carefully manage inventory levels with our global distribution network. Inventories were $10 million below first quarter at $886 million. As a consequence, adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 318 days, a decrease of 57 days compared to the second quarter of 2009. 
Our adjusted trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 61 days, a decrease of two days from the second quarter of 2009. Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter amounted to $81 million. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $214 million, $73 million higher than the second quarter of 2009. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outflows for instruments and property plant and equipment. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $58.9 million, including $43.7 million for instruments and $15.2 million for property plant and equipment. We expect capital expenditure to be higher in the second half of the year as we make significant investments in our new posterior referencing knee instruments, continue to deploy instruments in support of our previously mentioned new product launches and replace machinery and equipment in the normal course. Cash outlays associated with investing activity during the quarter include $4.1 million for certain international distributor acquisitions. 
I'd like to turn now to our guidance for 2010. In our earnings release this morning, we reaffirmed our full year constant-currency sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance. Full year revenues are expected to increase between 3% and 5% on a constant-currency basis. Assuming foreign currency exchange rates remain near recent levels, we estimate that foreign currency translation will decrease revenues by 0.5% for the full year 2010, resulting in expected revenue growth on a reported basis between 2.5% and 4.5%. For the third and fourth quarters, we anticipate foreign currency translation will decrease revenues by approximately 2% and 5%, respectively. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in a range of $4.15 to $4.35 for the full year 2010. Additionally, with respect to the third quarter, we believe, based on a review of published independent analysts earnings models for Zimmer that seasonal revenue and expense patents are not fully reflected in those models. Also, new product and instrument deployments will progressively ramp up and are expected to have a greater impact on revenues in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. Taking into account the anticipated effects of seasonality and other factors, we expect that our third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share will be between $0.93 and $0.98. 
David, I'll turn the call back over to you."

So in the first half of this year, our manufacturing facilities were operating at or near optimal levels of capacity utilization, in contrast to what we were talking about in the back half of last year. So this has allowed us to put lower cost inventories to the shelf in the first half. And in addition, our efforts to reduce core inventories as we build out the pipeline of new product inventory has resulted in lower obsolescence charges.

And from my perspective, I think they really want to look at the first half of the year as opposed to isolating the second quarter on a stand-alone basis. A little bit more profound of a stepdown on the U.S. side in Knees. And I think that there was a bit of a procedural stepdown. I will tell you that very anecdotally, we saw a bit more of that in the earlier interventions. So the new knees [ph]  and Cruciate Retaining knees as opposed to the posterior stabilized knees. So that might be indicative of people in that younger category deferring the procedures at this point in year or making some decisions as impacted by the health of the economy in general, but very anecdotal at this point in time.

So mid single digits, right at 5-ish%. But I think the thing that is important to remember is you have some big markets that are suppressing that number, primarily those developed markets in Europe at this point in time and significant price pressure as it applies to Japan, in particular, at this point in time. And so these procedures are getting deferred in Europe and the developed markets to be sure, and those are going to come back at some point in time. And so you will see some procedural uptick from that dead middle single digits. Furthermore, I think that we continue to believe that there is mixed opportunity on top of that procedural growth. And we think that, that mixed opportunity, as we've discussed in the past, if you want to put numbers to it is, is in a range of say 1% to 3%. So right now, we would suspect that in general, those mixed opportunities are washing out the downward price pressure, pure price pressure.

And so it's a stabilizing market at this point in time. I wouldn't describe our performance as probably being market-level performance. I would suspect that our growth rate is above market growth rate.

And again, the fundamentals, we've got a good leadership team, a good product cadence, a focused sales force and they're executing quite well coming out of a difficult time period.

It is not kind of largely integrated in any significant way, Matt, with our Reconstructive distribution channel. So it's quite dependent of that focus on Spine. And I think we have some good people there, and we need to get them a good opportunity with a full product bag to go out and compete. And so that's what we're working on, and I would expect to see our performance o U.S. improve within that Spine market in the second half of the year and then begin to stabilize at the end of the year within the United States market, and head into 2011 with good prospects to see some growth come out of the Spine division."

First of all, as we indicated or I indicated in my prepared remarks, Steve, inventory days on hand, which is how we measure sort of inventories, and we calculate that using a quarterly cost of goods so that it's somewhat sensitive to quarter-to-quarter changes in cost of goods. It came in 57 days below where we were in the second quarter of last year. At $886 million, the total investment in inventory dollars is down $10 million from the first quarter of this year, and that's in spite of significant pipeline build-out for the new product launches. So I would tell you that if anything, we're kind of ahead of where we would have expected to be at this point the year in terms of making progress on better managing our field inventory deployments. And it's one of the things, as I indicated, that's contributing to our stronger outlook for gross margin in the back half of the year. I would tell you, as far as the balance of the year, we typically see an increase in inventory days in the third quarter because of the slowdown in procedure volumes. And as we continue to build inventory through the summer months in advance of what ends up being a busier surgery schedule, busier schedule for surgeries in the fourth quarter, we would expect to see a bit of an increase on days on-hand in the third quarter and then have it come back down in the fourth quarter."

Again, we picked up some great capabilities on the product development side, a broader distributor channel, a broader portfolio of products that are designed for that specific market at this point in time. And that's really the principal driver for that transaction. A collateral benefit to be sure will be enhancing our capabilities on the manufacturing side within that jurisdiction, and that is one that I would think of as more an intermediate or longer-term objective and strategic rationale for the deal. So the principal driver is to position us to compete effectively within China itself.

This morning, I will review our second quarter and first half 2010 results. Jim will then provide additional financial details. 
Throughout the first six months of 2010, we've continued to perform in line with our expectations entering the year, demonstrating year-over-year constant-currency sales growth across all geographic segments. We've made progress with new product introductions, particularly in our Hip business, and we expect these additions, along with our new instrument offerings in Knees will increasingly contribute to revenues in the second half of the year.
Net sales for the quarter were $1.06 billion, an increase of 3.3% on a constant-currency basis, and our earnings per share were $1.09 on an adjusted basis. For the quarter, the Americas region grew sales 2.8% constant currency compared to the prior year. The Asia-Pacific segment grew 6.5%. And despite a continued challenging market, our Europe, Middle East and Africa region improved its sales performance with 2.8% growth. Knee sales for the quarter improved year-over-year, 3% on a constant-currency basis, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.5%, less negative price of 1.5%.
To accelerate our growth in the Knee franchise, we've launched several strategic initiatives to reinforce the strength and performance of our Knee systems, which we believe will also help to gain new customers. We continue to see growth in our patient-specific instruments as more physicians seek opportunities to optimize the accuracy of their surgical cases, as well as enhance their operative inefficiency with these MRI-based surgical guides. Along with patient-specific instruments, we plan to deploy our posterior referencing instruments in the second half of this year, following the developer release that took place this past quarter. 
Posterior referencing instruments offer physicians, who subscribe to the surgical philosophy, access to our clinically proven NexGen implant. Early trial results have been encouraging as these instruments have been favorably received by posterior referencing positions. 
Hip sales for the second quarter improved year-over-year 2.6% on a constant-currency basis, reflecting positive volume and mix of 4.2% less negative price of 1.6%. Adoption of our newly launched Continuum System Acetabular products continues to progress, and we anticipate sales of these products will positively impact our performance in the second half of the year. The Continuum System, combined the best of Zimmer's proven Hip technologies and further reinforces our commitment to providing an integrated line of polyethylene, ceramic and metal bearing options that more closely match the unique needs and lifestyles of patients.
Growth in the second quarter was supported by our Fitmore and M/L Taper with connective technology stems, which we firmly believe represents the industry's most versatile Hip System. The Fitmore Stem experienced 56% sales growth compared to the prior year as its bone preservation attributes continued to be favored by many surgeons and patients. Sales of our M/L Taper with connective technology grew 31% in the quarter compared to last year. This product offers the surgeons superior interoperative flexibility with its independent adjustment of labeling, offset and version to match a wide range of patient anatomies. Positive performance across our Hip business is reflected by the 160 basis points of incremental growth over the first quarter.
Extremities posted solid results for the quarter with sales growth of 13% constant currency, due in large part to the success of our Trabecular Metal products sold in United States. Noteworthy product lines were the Trabecular Metal Reverse Shoulder with 31% second quarter sales growth, and the Trabecular Metal Glenoid, which doubled its sales compared to the same period in the prior year. 
Our Dental business reported another solid quarter as well, with sales increasing 7.7% constant currency. Following last year's weak demand fueled by global economic uncertainty, we believe our two successive quarters of growth reflect a stabilizing trend in this sector, as well as a nice performance from our Dental team. The Americas contributed 8.7% growth and sales in Europe increased 10.6% constant currency over the prior year quarter. Earlier this month, Zimmer Dental launched Zimmer Collagen Capsules and Wedges [Collagen Capsules and Wedge] the first-ever bone shaping membranes for dental graft containment during sinus lifts, socket repair and preservation procedures.
Trauma sales in the second quarter were up over the prior year 1% constant currency. The global rollout of our Natural Nail System continue with our recently released Cephalomedullary Nails [Cephalomedullary Nail] The second quarter also marked the first implantation of our NCB Periprosthetic Plating System, the first comprehensive solution for addressing complex femoral fractures around the area of a knee or hip implant. The rollout of this product will continue throughout the remainder of 2010.
Our Spine business has been through a series of operational challenges over the past few quarters, and we recorded a sales decrease of 9.2% constant currency in the second quarter. As we negotiate the challenging reimbursement landscape and continue to focus on improved sales execution, we anticipate performance will begin to stabilize. 
We continue to make steady progress in our Orthopaedic Surgical Products franchise. We reported 14.6% constant-currency growth, supported by 56% sales growth in wound debridement and 13% sales growth in the bone cement and accessories categories, both on a constant-currency basis.
Before handing off to Jim, I'll briefly touch on a few final topics. Regarding the overall market, while there did appear to be a modest step-down in growth during the second quarter, we believe that the broader market dynamics are unchanged. Looking at the first half of the year, based on a majority of the market having reported second quarter results, it appears that worldwide reconstructive growth is actually up about 1% compared to the full year growth in 2009. Moreover, the fundamental drivers for attractive growth within the musculoskeletal markets have not changed. 
Turning to the European market. Our performance in this geographic segment remains in line with our expectations coming into the year. Although government spending controls continue to contribute to challenging market conditions in Europe overall, we're not seeing further market deterioration, and we're encouraged by our performance during the quarter. 
With regard to pricing, consolidated average selling prices in the second quarter were down 0.9% compared to the prior year period. We experienced negative pricing of 1.1% in Americas, positive pricing in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region of 0.4%, and negative pricing in the Asia-Pacific region of 2.4%, driven largely by the price cuts in Japan. Consolidated pricing for the second quarter was consistent with our expectations, and we continue to anticipate moderate price erosion of negative 1% to negative 2% for the year. With respect to guidance, as we discussed in our earnings release this morning, we're reaffirming our outlook for 2010. 
Finally, we announced this morning that Zimmer has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Beijing Montagne Medical Devices Co. Ltd. The agreement contains certain closing conditions, and we anticipate consummating the acquisition in late 2010 or early 2011. Montagne is a China-based manufacturer and distributor of orthopaedic implants with annual revenues of approximately $10 million. This acquisition would make Zimmer the leading provider of reconstructive orthopaedic solutions in China. We're excited about this opportunity to expand our presence in a vital emerging market for the industry.
Jim will now provide further details on the quarter and on our guidance. Jim?"

I will review our performance in the quarter in more detail and then provide additional information related to our 2010 guidance. Our total revenues for the quarter, as David mentioned, were $1,058,000,000, a 3.3% constant-currency improv",1373,"Thanks, David. I will review our performance in the quarter in more detail and then provide additional information related to our 2010 guidance. 
Our total revenues for the quarter, as David mentioned, were $1,058,000,000, a 3.3% constant-currency improvement compared to the second quarter of last year. Our tailwind from the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen offset a headwind from the euro in the quarter, resulting in a slightly positive impact from foreign currency translation, which increased revenues by 0.4% or $4 million in the quarter. Our adjusted gross profit margin of 76.3% for the quarter reflects improvements in operating efficiency and the recognition of gains on currency hedge contracts. The margin ratio is down 70 basis points compared to second quarter 2009 but increased 140 basis points compared with the first quarter. We are now expecting our gross margin ratio to be between 76% and 76.5% for the full year. These expectations include an assumption that foreign currency exchange rates remain at recent levels. 
Moving down the income statement, R&D expense, as a percentage of sales, was at 5.2%. And that $55.1 million for the quarter is 10.5% higher on a total dollar basis when compared to the prior year. This increase is in line with our plans for the year, as we begin to accelerate our new product development programs in the second quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $437 million in the second quarter and at 41.4% of sales or 100 basis point below prior year. SG&A, as a percentage of sales, is now anticipated to be approximately 42% for the full year, as our outlook is negatively impacted by a change in foreign currency exchange rates and the higher product liability expenses incurred in the first quarter.
We expect SG&A expense to increase to around 43.5% of sales in the third quarter due to seasonality. Typically, the third quarter SG&A expense, as a percentage of sales, represents the high watermark for the year due to the summer slowdown of procedure volumes. During the second quarter, the company recorded a provision of $75 million for known and anticipated claims related to the Durom Cup. Zimmer's estimate for these claims now include worldwide revisions associated with surgeries predating the 2008 temporary U.S. suspension. Adjusted 2010 figures exclude the impact of this provision. The total provision for all claims to include those that were expensed in the normal course is now $222 million. This estimated contingent liability is based on a two-year pattern of claims made. Prior estimates were necessarily based on a smaller data set of claims made and the shorter time series. An independent actuarial model was also used to assist in determining an appropriate level of approval for these claims. Any claims received outside of the defined timeframe are managed in the normal course and are reflected in our standard quarterly product liability accruals.
Continuing down the income statement, acquisition integration realignment and other amounted to $11.5 million in the quarter and includes one-time cost for realignment of our global IT infrastructure and other charges related to prior-period acquisitions. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased to $315 million, a 29.7%. Our adjusted operating profit per sales ratio is 10 basis points lower than the prior year second quarter, as the anticipated decrease in gross margin was offset by leverage in SG&A. Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $14.3 million compared to $4 million in the prior-year quarter. Similar to the first quarter, the change is primarily due to the $1 billion senior unsecured notes offering we completed in November of 2009. Adjusted net earnings were $221 million for the second quarter, an increase of 2.6% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $1.09 on $203 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share are inclusive of approximately $0.06 of share-based compensation. At $0.82 reported diluted earnings per share, which include the items reflected in certain claims and acquisition, integration, realignment and other, decreased 16.3% from the prior year second quarter reported EPS of $0.98. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.4%, slightly below the first quarter as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax positions. We still anticipate a 2010 full year tax rate of approximately 27%.
During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at a total purchase price of $85 million. As of June 30, 2010, approximately $32 million remained authorized under $1.25 billion repurchase program, which expires at the end of 2010. The company had approximately 201 million shares of common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2010, down from $204 million as of December 31, 2009. Our Board has approved an additional $1.5 billion stock repurchase program, which expires December 31, 2013. We continually review the best utilization of the cash that we generate. Our intentions with regard to use of free cash flow remain the same as we have indicated for some time. Our first priority is external development, when and if the right opportunities arise, to add technology, products or businesses that strategically align with our focus on musculoskeletal health. We balance this priority with maintaining strong liquidity and continue to believe that share repurchases are an efficient and effective way to return excess free cash flow to our shareholders. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $273 million, up nearly 40% from $195 million in the second quarter of 2009. Our focused efforts on managing our working capital have allowed us to offset significant investments to build out the inventory pipeline for Acetabular Cup and Intramedullary Nail new product launches. This quarter, we continue to carefully manage inventory levels with our global distribution network. Inventories were $10 million below first quarter at $886 million. As a consequence, adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 318 days, a decrease of 57 days compared to the second quarter of 2009. 
Our adjusted trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 61 days, a decrease of two days from the second quarter of 2009. Depreciation and amortization expense for the second quarter amounted to $81 million. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $214 million, $73 million higher than the second quarter of 2009. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outflows for instruments and property plant and equipment. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $58.9 million, including $43.7 million for instruments and $15.2 million for property plant and equipment. We expect capital expenditure to be higher in the second half of the year as we make significant investments in our new posterior referencing knee instruments, continue to deploy instruments in support of our previously mentioned new product launches and replace machinery and equipment in the normal course. Cash outlays associated with investing activity during the quarter include $4.1 million for certain international distributor acquisitions. 
I'd like to turn now to our guidance for 2010. In our earnings release this morning, we reaffirmed our full year constant-currency sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance. Full year revenues are expected to increase between 3% and 5% on a constant-currency basis. Assuming foreign currency exchange rates remain near recent levels, we estimate that foreign currency translation will decrease revenues by 0.5% for the full year 2010, resulting in expected revenue growth on a reported basis between 2.5% and 4.5%. For the third and fourth quarters, we anticipate foreign currency translation will decrease revenues by approximately 2% and 5%, respectively. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in a range of $4.15 to $4.35 for the full year 2010. Additionally, with respect to the third quarter, we believe, based on a review of published independent analysts earnings models for Zimmer that seasonal revenue and expense patents are not fully reflected in those models. Also, new product and instrument deployments will progressively ramp up and are expected to have a greater impact on revenues in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. Taking into account the anticipated effects of seasonality and other factors, we expect that our third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share will be between $0.93 and $0.98. 
David, I'll turn the call back over to you."

So in the first half of this year, our manufacturing facilities were operating at or near optimal levels of capacity utilization, in contrast to what we were talking about in the back half of last year. So this has allowed us to put lower cost inventories to the shelf in the first half. And in addition, our efforts to reduce core inventories as we build out the pipeline of new product inventory has resulted in lower obsolescence charges. Currency, as we look at the balance of the year, currencies has a relatively modest to the positive impact.

So mid single digits, right at 5-ish%. But I think the thing that is important to remember is you have some big markets that are suppressing that number, primarily those developed markets in Europe at this point in time and significant price pressure as it applies to Japan, in particular, at this point in time. And so these procedures are getting deferred in Europe and the developed markets to be sure, and those are going to come back at some point in time. And so you will see some procedural uptick from that dead middle single digits. Furthermore, I think that we continue to believe that there is mixed opportunity on top of that procedural growth. And we think that, that mixed opportunity, as we've discussed in the past, if you want to put numbers to it is, is in a range of say 1% to 3%. So right now, we would suspect that in general, those mixed opportunities are washing out the downward price pressure, pure price pressure.

With respect to the performance, we've got a nice cadence, a new product flow. We have a really good leadership team in place that understands that business and is making great progress and strengthening the depth of knowledge throughout all levels within that division. They're very focused on growing their business. They see a great opportunity in that market as we do, notwithstanding what's transpired over the last couple of years. And so it's a stabilizing market at this point in time. I wouldn't describe our performance as probably being market-level performance. I would suspect that our growth rate is above market growth rate. I would suspect that, that market growth rate is probably flat to slightly positive, a couple three points of growth that we'll see as the much larger players report out what their results look like and gain greater visibility to that. And again, the fundamentals, we've got a good leadership team, a good product cadence, a focused sales force and they're executing quite well coming out of a difficult time period. So we're really optimistic about what we're going to be able to do with that business going forward. Spine, we're a click or two behind in those categories. But working in the right direction to be able to talk to you about our Spine performance in the same way that we sit here and talk here about the Dental performance in due time, making good progress on ramping up sales. o U.S., we think that we're sorting out the right priorities for our internal development product pipeline, and we've got a lot of good talent in the distribution network. It is not kind of largely integrated in any significant way, Matt, with our Reconstructive distribution channel. So it's quite dependent of that focus on Spine. And I think we have some good people there, and we need to get them a good opportunity with a full product bag to go out and compete. And so that's what we're working on, and I would expect to see our performance o U.S. improve within that Spine market in the second half of the year and then begin to stabilize at the end of the year within the United States market, and head into 2011 with good prospects to see some growth come out of the Spine division."

First of all, as we indicated or I indicated in my prepared remarks, Steve, inventory days on hand, which is how we measure sort of inventories, and we calculate that using a quarterly cost of goods so that it's somewhat sensitive to quarter-to-quarter changes in cost of goods. It came in 57 days below where we were in the second quarter of last year. At $886 million, the total investment in inventory dollars is down $10 million from the first quarter of this year, and that's in spite of significant pipeline build-out for the new product launches. So I would tell you that if anything, we're kind of ahead of where we would have expected to be at this point the year in terms of making progress on better managing our field inventory deployments. And it's one of the things, as I indicated, that's contributing to our stronger outlook for gross margin in the back half of the year. I would tell you, as far as the balance of the year, we typically see an increase in inventory days in the third quarter because of the slowdown in procedure volumes. And as we continue to build inventory through the summer months in advance of what ends up being a busier surgery schedule, busier schedule for surgeries in the fourth quarter, we would expect to see a bit of an increase on days on-hand in the third quarter and then have it come back down in the fourth quarter."

This morning, I'll review our third quarter 2010 results and provide some commentary on general market conditions. Jim will then discuss additional financial details. 
We delivered solid earnings and cash flow performance in the third quarter, notwithstanding challenging global economic conditions that negatively impacted procedure rates. Our performance reflects a focus on disciplined spending in executing our strategic plan. A core element of this plan involves a new product introductions across our businesses. These introductions will position us for an improved performance in the fourth quarter and accelerate growth beyond 2010 as the economy strengthens.
Net sales for the quarter were $965 million, a decrease of 0.5% on a constant-currency basis, and our earnings per share were $0.96 on an adjusted basis, an increase of 9.1% over the prior year period. For the quarter, our Americas and Europe, Middle East and Africa segments experienced constant currency sales declines of 0.4% and 3.8%, respectively, while the Asia Pacific region grew 4.2% constant currency.
Knee sales for the quarter decreased year-over-year 2.7% constant currency, reflecting negative volume and mix of 0.4% and negative price of 2.3%. Important advances for Zimmer Knees included a broader rollout of our Patient Specific Instruments and a limited rollout of our posterior referencing instruments. 
Moving into the fourth quarter and to a greater extent throughout 2011, we expect to see accelerating growth with these knee instruments being deployed broadly. A number of additional MRI centers have been certified to process our Patient Specific Instruments, and we have had continued commercial success based on the unique and differentiating features and benefits of our system. 
Meanwhile, early clinical feedback on our posterior referencing instruments have been very positive. Recent National Joint Replacement Registry data continues to demonstrate outstanding long-term clinical success of our NexGen and Natural-Knee product families, and we're confident that our enhanced instrumentation options will drive increased adoption globally.
Our Hip business performed above market in the Americas in the quarter with sales improving year-over-year, 2.7% on a constant-currency basis. Overall, our Hip sales increased 0.5% constant currency, reflecting positive volume and mix of 2.7% and negative price of 2.2%. 
We're encouraged that is volume and mix growth relative to market is verification of increasing momentum we're experiencing in the commercialization of our new Hip products. In particular, the Continuum Acetabular Cup System provide surgeons with the flexibility to select from alternative bearing surfaces to meet the diverse and unique needs of their total hip replacement patients.
The Continuum System has provided an important expansion to our hip portfolio. As we've described before, momentum from a new product introduction generally builds over the course of one or more operating periods as the implement instruments and related training are deployed. We're on track with our expectations for the stage rollout of the Continuum System.
The performance of our Hip business in the quarter was also supported by continued strong sales of Revision Hip products, a category in which Zimmer has achieved overall leading market share. We also saw growth in sales of our stem products, including the M/L Taper with connective technology, which offers a modular adjustable neck system that enables surgeons to personalize fit interoperatively for each patient. 
Extremities products posted sales growth of 3.6% constant currency for the quarter, which compares to a high 20.5% growth rate from the third quarter of last year. These results were again supported by sales of our Shoulder products, featuring Trabecular Metal Technology, including the TM Reverse Shoulder and TM Glenoid.
Continuing its solid performance for the year in a market heavily impacted by general economic conditions, Zimmer Dental sales increased 4.9% constant currency for the quarter. Our Dental business is generating broad-based sales momentum across implants, restorative components and regenerative products. 
Trauma sales in the quarter were up over the prior year period by 0.5% constant currency. We recently announced the 1,000th U.S. implantation of our Cephalomedullary Nail, a key component of the Zimmer Natural Nail System. Continued success in the commercialization of this new product bodes well for the rest of the Zimmer Natural Nail System, which features a wide range of lengths and diameters and in innovative anatomical design. We also announced the first implantation of the NCB Periprosthetic Plating system, a first of its kind solution for addressing complex femoral fractures that can occur around the knee or hip implant.
While Zimmer Spine reported an overall sales decrease of 7.4% constant currency in the quarter, European Spine sales experienced strong growth of 21.1% constant currency. In our Spine business, we continue to drive operational changes and pursuing aggressive new product development pipeline. 
In the third quarter, Zimmer Surgical, formerly known as Orthopaedic Surgical Products, experienced a solid 8.2% constant currency growth. We continue to see strong sales of our wound debridement devices and bone cement products. 
I'll now touch briefly on some operational developments and other topics. Operationally, we improved our sequential gross margin and cash flow to support corporate investments, including a new product development initiatives designed to accelerate our growth. While we increased spending on product development, our margins remain strong, with operating margins improving 160 basis points in the third quarter compared to the prior year. Cash flow remains at a high level, a point on which Jim will provide more detail. 
Consolidated pricing for the quarter was consistent with our expectations, decreasing slightly from the second quarter. Consolidated average selling prices in the third quarter were down 1.4% compared to the prior year period. We experienced negative pricing of 1.6% in the Americas, flat pricing in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region and negative pricing in the Asia Pacific region of 2.9%. We continue to anticipate consolidated price erosion of between 1% and 2% for the year. 
In the third quarter, the market experienced a slowdown in procedure volumes due to global economic conditions, unemployment and other factors. High unemployment has resulted in expiring health insurance and COBRA subsidies in the U.S., as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.  Demographic analysis suggests that these trends has had a particularly notable impact on the non-Medicare potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age. 
The balance of the slowdown in the U.S. is attributed to seasonality effects, which include a combination of slower surgery schedules and patients delaying care until high deductibles are met. Similarly, austerity measures are contributing to the overall slowed procedure volumes in Europe.
Now long-term indicators still point towards sustained growth, and we continue to believe that the knee and hip market should grow in the mid-single digits. That outlook is based on anticipated growth in developed markets with aging populations, as well as higher penetration rates in emerging markets in which increasing numbers of patients are gaining access to healthcare. 
Even with the economic pressures that we've seen over the last 18 to 24 months, healthcare providers and third-party payers recognize that these replacement procedures are cost effective. They take costs out of the system as opposed to continuing to manage the chronic conditions to which patients would otherwise be exposed. We remain committed to executing our strategic plan with the focus on disciplined financial performance. 
Jim will now provide further details on the quarter and on our updated sales and earnings guidance. Jim?"

I will review our third quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our 2010 guidance. As David mentioned, our total revenues for the quarter were $965 million, a 0.5% constant currency decline compared to the third quarter of last year. 
Net currency impact for the quarter was slightly negative, decreasing revenues by an additional 0.5% or $5.2 million. 
The unfavorable currency impact from our euro-denominated sales in the quarter was partially offset by a favorable currency impact from our Japanese yen and Australian dollar denominated revenues. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.3% for the quarter. The margin ratio is up 260 basis points compared to third quarter of 2009, an increase of 100 basis points compared with the second quarter 2010.
Improved management of our global inventories has resulted in lower excess in obsolescence expense compared with the third quarter of prior year. Additionally, prior year results reflect certain charges for scrap, idle plant and cleanup activities following the 2009 fire in our Warsaw manufacturing plant. 
Lastly, the improvement in gross margin also reflects the manufacturing network operating at higher levels of efficiency in 2010 compared with prior year. As outlined in the second quarter call, we expect our gross margin ratio to be between 76% and 76.5% for the full year, assuming that foreign currency exchange rates remain near recent levels. This includes a lower gross margin ratio in the fourth quarter due to less favorable hedge results. 
R&D expense as a percentage of sales was at 6%, and at $57.6 million for the quarter is 10% higher on a total dollar basis when compared to the prior year. This increase is in line with our strategy to focus more investment into new product development activities and clinical programs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $412 million in the third quarter, and at 42.7% of sales or 40 basis points above prior year. SG&A spending for the third quarter of 2010 in absolute dollar terms is slightly below the third quarter of the prior year. 
Acquisition, integration, realignment and other amounted to $5 million in the quarter. These expenses include integration costs from our pending acquisition of Beijing Montagne, a onetime cost stemming from distributor acquisitions in our Europe, Middle East and Africa segment, realignment of our global IT infrastructure and other of the prior period acquisitions. 
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased to $277 million. At 28.7%, our adjusted operating profit sales ratio is 160 basis points higher than the prior year third quarter due to improvements in gross margins that are partially offset by increased research and development expense.
Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $14.2 million compared to $4.2 million in the prior quarter. Similar to the last two quarters, the change is primarily due to the $1 billion senior unsecured notes offering we completed in November of 2009. 
Adjusted net earnings were $192 million for the third quarter, an increase of 2.2% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9.1% to $0.96 on a 199.7 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share includes above approximately $0.05 of share-based compensation. At $0.96, reported diluted earnings per share, which include the items reflected in acquisition, integration, realignment and other, increased to 37% over the prior year third quarter reported EPS of $0.70.
Our adjusted effective tax rate for quarter was 26.7%. We anticipate that 2010 full year tax rate will be approximately 27%. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.2 million shares at a total purchase price of $225.6 million. As of September 30, 2010, approximately $1.3 billion remained authorized under our $1.5 billion repurchase program, which expires at the end of 2013. The company had approximately 197 million shares of common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2010, down from 204 million as of December 31, 2009.
We continually review the best utilization of the cash that we generate. Our intentions with regard to use of free cash flow remain the same as we have indicated for some time. Our first priority is external development, when and it's the right opportunity to rise. There are technology products or business that strategically align with our focus on musculoskeletal health. We balance this priority with maintaining strong liquidity and continue to believe that share repurchases are an efficient and effective way to return excess free cash flow to our shareholders. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $320 million, down 9% from $352 million in the third quarter of 2009. Net inventories were $923 million at the end of the third quarter, $44 million less than third quarter prior year. Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 380 days, an increase of 27 days compared with the third quarter of 2009. This increase in days on hand is largely driven by the sensitivity of the calculation in year-over-year improvements and cost of goods sold. Our adjusted trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 67 days, an increase of four days over the third quarter of 2009.
Net receivables increased $14 million or 2% over prior year. Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter amounted to $84 million. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $256 million,  $47 million lower than the third quarter of 2009. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outflows for instruments and property, plant and equipment. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $64 million, including $50 million for instruments and $14 million for property, plant and equipment. Cash outlays associated with investing activities during the quarter include $2.5 million for certain international distributor acquisitions.
I'd like to turn now to our guidance for 2010. In our earnings release this morning, we provided  fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EPS guidance and updated our full year guidance. Fourth quarter revenues are expected to increase between zero and 2% on a constant-currency basis as we continue to gain momentum with new products and instruments. 
As a result, the company now expects 2010 full year revenues to increase approximately 2% on a constant-currency basis, which compares with prior guidance of between 3% and 5%.
Assuming foreign currency exchange rates remain near recent levels, the company estimates that foreign currency translation will decrease revenues by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter and increase revenues by 0.5% for the full year 2010. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.22. As a result, adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $4.24 to $4.29 for the full year 2010.
David, I'll turn the call back over to you."

So it looks like Europe perhaps took another step down maybe in the market as a whole, certainly for your sales this quarter after seeing a couple of quarters of somewhat weak but stable growth. Two questions related to that. Was there anything that changed over this past quarter to result in that? And then secondly, as you think about the budgets getting reset for 2011 and the austerity measures being put in place, what it in your mind is the risk of kind of another step down in procedure volumes or another step down in sort of healthcare spending pressure that would pressure procedure volumes coming from new budgets being put in place in 2011?"

So I think that some of the austerity measures in the macroeconomic conditions created environment where the was a more profound element of seasonality to the business. It's always a slow market in the third quarter within Europe due to the holiday schedules, but it was exacerbated by the economic conditions. I would tell you, with respect to looking forward in that market, I think that one of the limitations as to how aggressive people can push in managing these procedure rates down is a political one. At some point, the known success of these procedures among the patient base and the recognition by the payors with these national healthcare systems is that it's not a cost effective move to differ these procedures in any extended form. And frankly, it becomes politically untenable at some point. And I think that you have to that bear in mind as you look forward and anticipate what those markets would look like in the future. Now the majority of our business is in the five or six most developed markets, and those slowdowns that we saw were more profound market-wise, it seems, in hips than in knees and we obviously have a significant market share in those European markets. And so that impacted the quarter to an extent. And then finally, if you're looking at our performance within Europe sequentially, you'll note that we picked up a billing day in Q2 and lost a billing day in Q3.

There's been greater emphasis in the global businesses than there was that five-year time period previous.

Notably, we've emphasized a great deal of investment in the Trauma area and the Natural Nail line is rolling out now that we're seeing some good early clinical success with is an example of what we intent to do on those product categories. Again, those are markets that are very attractive markets. The skill sets that it takes to compete effectively in those markets are very transferable from the core recon business and in instances, the distribution channels overlapped as well. So we can create a lot of value with growth in those global businesses. And going back sometime, we started to enhance our investment to drive that opportunity."

I think that there's going to continue to be a market out there for the Metal-on-Metal, but it's going to be less significant. And that was not a segment that we were heavily penetrated in prior to the market turning the way that it has. So we didn't have much business in that category, and I think that those that had a lot of business in that category are seeing the mix of that business turn probably likely more towards polyethylene solutions at this point in time.

So again, up and down the continuum of care on the recon side in emerging markets. And then beyond that, we have excellent opportunities in these other product categories. And I think that as early in the fourth quarter, you're going to start seeing some progress to be made in one or two of those other business units. Coming back to your Spine question, I think that, that's one that is to win there, we're going to have to do well both on internal as well as external development to ensure that we've got the right kind of product pipeline. So we've got a pretty significant commitment at this point in time on internal development. And just recently, we launched on a limited basis an excellent MIS system, the Pathfinder system.

This morning, I'll review our third quarter 2010 results and provide some commentary on general market conditions. Jim will then discuss additional financial details. 
We delivered solid earnings and cash flow performance in the third quarter, notwithstanding challenging global economic conditions that negatively impacted procedure rates. Our performance reflects a focus on disciplined spending in executing our strategic plan. A core element of this plan involves a new product introductions across our businesses. These introductions will position us for an improved performance in the fourth quarter and accelerate growth beyond 2010 as the economy strengthens.
Net sales for the quarter were $965 million, a decrease of 0.5% on a constant-currency basis, and our earnings per share were $0.96 on an adjusted basis, an increase of 9.1% over the prior year period. For the quarter, our Americas and Europe, Middle East and Africa segments experienced constant currency sales declines of 0.4% and 3.8%, respectively, while the Asia Pacific region grew 4.2% constant currency.
Knee sales for the quarter decreased year-over-year 2.7% constant currency, reflecting negative volume and mix of 0.4% and negative price of 2.3%. Important advances for Zimmer Knees included a broader rollout of our Patient Specific Instruments and a limited rollout of our posterior referencing instruments. 
Moving into the fourth quarter and to a greater extent throughout 2011, we expect to see accelerating growth with these knee instruments being deployed broadly. A number of additional MRI centers have been certified to process our Patient Specific Instruments, and we have had continued commercial success based on the unique and differentiating features and benefits of our system. 
Meanwhile, early clinical feedback on our posterior referencing instruments have been very positive. Recent National Joint Replacement Registry data continues to demonstrate outstanding long-term clinical success of our NexGen and Natural-Knee product families, and we're confident that our enhanced instrumentation options will drive increased adoption globally.
Our Hip business performed above market in the Americas in the quarter with sales improving year-over-year, 2.7% on a constant-currency basis. Overall, our Hip sales increased 0.5% constant currency, reflecting positive volume and mix of 2.7% and negative price of 2.2%. 
We're encouraged that is volume and mix growth relative to market is verification of increasing momentum we're experiencing in the commercialization of our new Hip products. In particular, the Continuum Acetabular Cup System provide surgeons with the flexibility to select from alternative bearing surfaces to meet the diverse and unique needs of their total hip replacement patients.
The Continuum System has provided an important expansion to our hip portfolio. As we've described before, momentum from a new product introduction generally builds over the course of one or more operating periods as the implement instruments and related training are deployed. We're on track with our expectations for the stage rollout of the Continuum System.
The performance of our Hip business in the quarter was also supported by continued strong sales of Revision Hip products, a category in which Zimmer has achieved overall leading market share. We also saw growth in sales of our stem products, including the M/L Taper with connective technology, which offers a modular adjustable neck system that enables surgeons to personalize fit interoperatively for each patient. 
Extremities products posted sales growth of 3.6% constant currency for the quarter, which compares to a high 20.5% growth rate from the third quarter of last year. These results were again supported by sales of our Shoulder products, featuring Trabecular Metal Technology, including the TM Reverse Shoulder and TM Glenoid.
Continuing its solid performance for the year in a market heavily impacted by general economic conditions, Zimmer Dental sales increased 4.9% constant currency for the quarter. Our Dental business is generating broad-based sales momentum across implants, restorative components and regenerative products. 
Trauma sales in the quarter were up over the prior year period by 0.5% constant currency. We recently announced the 1,000th U.S. implantation of our Cephalomedullary Nail, a key component of the Zimmer Natural Nail System. Continued success in the commercialization of this new product bodes well for the rest of the Zimmer Natural Nail System, which features a wide range of lengths and diameters and in innovative anatomical design. We also announced the first implantation of the NCB Periprosthetic Plating system, a first of its kind solution for addressing complex femoral fractures that can occur around the knee or hip implant.
While Zimmer Spine reported an overall sales decrease of 7.4% constant currency in the quarter, European Spine sales experienced strong growth of 21.1% constant currency. In our Spine business, we continue to drive operational changes and pursuing aggressive new product development pipeline. 
In the third quarter, Zimmer Surgical, formerly known as Orthopaedic Surgical Products, experienced a solid 8.2% constant currency growth. We continue to see strong sales of our wound debridement devices and bone cement products. 
I'll now touch briefly on some operational developments and other topics. Operationally, we improved our sequential gross margin and cash flow to support corporate investments, including a new product development initiatives designed to accelerate our growth. While we increased spending on product development, our margins remain strong, with operating margins improving 160 basis points in the third quarter compared to the prior year. Cash flow remains at a high level, a point on which Jim will provide more detail. 
Consolidated pricing for the quarter was consistent with our expectations, decreasing slightly from the second quarter. Consolidated average selling prices in the third quarter were down 1.4% compared to the prior year period. We experienced negative pricing of 1.6% in the Americas, flat pricing in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region and negative pricing in the Asia Pacific region of 2.9%. We continue to anticipate consolidated price erosion of between 1% and 2% for the year. 
In the third quarter, the market experienced a slowdown in procedure volumes due to global economic conditions, unemployment and other factors. High unemployment has resulted in expiring health insurance and COBRA subsidies in the U.S., as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.  Demographic analysis suggests that these trends has had a particularly notable impact on the non-Medicare potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age. 
The balance of the slowdown in the U.S. is attributed to seasonality effects, which include a combination of slower surgery schedules and patients delaying care until high deductibles are met. Similarly, austerity measures are contributing to the overall slowed procedure volumes in Europe.
Now long-term indicators still point towards sustained growth, and we continue to believe that the knee and hip market should grow in the mid-single digits. That outlook is based on anticipated growth in developed markets with aging populations, as well as higher penetration rates in emerging markets in which increasing numbers of patients are gaining access to healthcare. 
Even with the economic pressures that we've seen over the last 18 to 24 months, healthcare providers and third-party payers recognize that these replacement procedures are cost effective. They take costs out of the system as opposed to continuing to manage the chronic conditions to which patients would otherwise be exposed. We remain committed to executing our strategic plan with the focus on disciplined financial performance. 
Jim will now provide further details on the quarter and on our updated sales and earnings guidance. Jim?

I will review our third quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our 2010 guidance. As David mentioned, our total revenues for the quarter were $965 million, a 0.5% constant currency decline compared to the third quarter of last year. 
Net currency impact for the quarter was slightly negative, decreasing revenues by an additional 0.5% or $5.2 million. 
The unfavorable currency impact from our euro-denominated sales in the quarter was partially offset by a favorable currency impact from our Japanese yen and Australian dollar denominated revenues. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.3% for the quarter. The margin ratio is up 260 basis points compared to third quarter of 2009, an increase of 100 basis points compared with the second quarter 2010.
Improved management of our global inventories has resulted in lower excess in obsolescence expense compared with the third quarter of prior year. Additionally, prior year results reflect certain charges for scrap, idle plant and cleanup activities following the 2009 fire in our Warsaw manufacturing plant. 
Lastly, the improvement in gross margin also reflects the manufacturing network operating at higher levels of efficiency in 2010 compared with prior year. As outlined in the second quarter call, we expect our gross margin ratio to be between 76% and 76.5% for the full year, assuming that foreign currency exchange rates remain near recent levels. This includes a lower gross margin ratio in the fourth quarter due to less favorable hedge results. 
R&D expense as a percentage of sales was at 6%, and at $57.6 million for the quarter is 10% higher on a total dollar basis when compared to the prior year. This increase is in line with our strategy to focus more investment into new product development activities and clinical programs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $412 million in the third quarter, and at 42.7% of sales or 40 basis points above prior year. SG&A spending for the third quarter of 2010 in absolute dollar terms is slightly below the third quarter of the prior year. 
Acquisition, integration, realignment and other amounted to $5 million in the quarter. These expenses include integration costs from our pending acquisition of Beijing Montagne, a onetime cost stemming from distributor acquisitions in our Europe, Middle East and Africa segment, realignment of our global IT infrastructure and other of the prior period acquisitions. 
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased to $277 million. At 28.7%, our adjusted operating profit sales ratio is 160 basis points higher than the prior year third quarter due to improvements in gross margins that are partially offset by increased research and development expense.
Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $14.2 million compared to $4.2 million in the prior quarter. Similar to the last two quarters, the change is primarily due to the $1 billion senior unsecured notes offering we completed in November of 2009. 
Adjusted net earnings were $192 million for the third quarter, an increase of 2.2% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9.1% to $0.96 on a 199.7 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share includes above approximately $0.05 of share-based compensation. At $0.96, reported diluted earnings per share, which include the items reflected in acquisition, integration, realignment and other, increased to 37% over the prior year third quarter reported EPS of $0.70.
Our adjusted effective tax rate for quarter was 26.7%. We anticipate that 2010 full year tax rate will be approximately 27%. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.2 million shares at a total purchase price of $225.6 million. As of September 30, 2010, approximately $1.3 billion remained authorized under our $1.5 billion repurchase program, which expires at the end of 2013. The company had approximately 197 million shares of common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2010, down from 204 million as of December 31, 2009.
We continually review the best utilization of the cash that we generate. Our intentions with regard to use of free cash flow remain the same as we have indicated for some time. Our first priority is external development, when and it's the right opportunity to rise. There are technology products or business that strategically align with our focus on musculoskeletal health. We balance this priority with maintaining strong liquidity and continue to believe that share repurchases are an efficient and effective way to return excess free cash flow to our shareholders. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $320 million, down 9% from $352 million in the third quarter of 2009. Net inventories were $923 million at the end of the third quarter, $44 million less than third quarter prior year. Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 380 days, an increase of 27 days compared with the third quarter of 2009. This increase in days on hand is largely driven by the sensitivity of the calculation in year-over-year improvements and cost of goods sold. Our adjusted trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 67 days, an increase of four days over the third quarter of 2009.
Net receivables increased $14 million or 2% over prior year. Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter amounted to $84 million. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $256 million,  $47 million lower than the third quarter of 2009. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outflows for instruments and property, plant and equipment. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $64 million, including $50 million for instruments and $14 million for property, plant and equipment. Cash outlays associated with investing activities during the quarter include $2.5 million for certain international distributor acquisitions.
I'd like to turn now to our guidance for 2010. In our earnings release this morning, we provided  fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EPS guidance and updated our full year guidance. Fourth quarter revenues are expected to increase between zero and 2% on a constant-currency basis as we continue to gain momentum with new products and instruments. 
As a result, the company now expects 2010 full year revenues to increase approximately 2% on a constant-currency basis, which compares with prior guidance of between 3% and 5%.
Assuming foreign currency exchange rates remain near recent levels, the company estimates that foreign currency translation will decrease revenues by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter and increase revenues by 0.5% for the full year 2010. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.22. As a result, adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $4.24 to $4.29 for the full year 2010.
David, I'll turn the call back over to you.

So it looks like Europe perhaps took another step down maybe in the market as a whole, certainly for your sales this quarter after seeing a couple of quarters of somewhat weak but stable growth. Two questions related to that. Was there anything that changed over this past quarter to result in that? And then secondly, as you think about the budgets getting reset for 2011 and the austerity measures being put in place, what it in your mind is the risk of kind of another step down in procedure volumes or another step down in sort of healthcare spending pressure that would pressure procedure volumes coming from new budgets being put in place in 2011?

For us, the pricing environment didn't change much from the second quarter to the third quarter. So I think that some of the austerity measures in the macroeconomic conditions created environment where the was a more profound element of seasonality to the business. It's always a slow market in the third quarter within Europe due to the holiday schedules, but it was exacerbated by the economic conditions. I would tell you, with respect to looking forward in that market, I think that one of the limitations as to how aggressive people can push in managing these procedure rates down is a political one. At some point, the known success of these procedures among the patient base and the recognition by the payors with these national healthcare systems is that it's not a cost effective move to differ these procedures in any extended form. And frankly, it becomes politically untenable at some point. And I think that you have to that bear in mind as you look forward and anticipate what those markets would look like in the future. Now the majority of our business is in the five or six most developed markets, and those slowdowns that we saw were more profound market-wise, it seems, in hips than in knees and we obviously have a significant market share in those European markets. And so that impacted the quarter to an extent. And then finally, if you're looking at our performance within Europe sequentially, you'll note that we picked up a billing day in Q2 and lost a billing day in Q3. And so that explains a bit of the sequential performance difference from Q2 to Q3 for us.

And as David indicated, we're still early into the launch for those instrument systems. The fact those instruments will not really necessarily have an impact on that metric, so until we launch new devices within the Knee franchise, we're not likely going to see much of an increase in new product revenue within the Knee franchise.

And what we reported out as being essentially flat pricing in Europe is indicative of what we're seeing right now. But it could be the case that in some of those jurisdictions, price gets pushed a bit harder as they free up the procedure rates.

On the Hip side, as you mentioned, the Continuum system as well as the MMC system were launches that were initiated the very end of last year. And so those launches are under way. We're starting to see the productivity of those launches, particularly on the Continuum side. I will tell you that the MMC Cup is a less significant launch in light of what's happened in that Metal-on-Metal category. I think that there's going to continue to be a market out there for the Metal-on-Metal, but it's going to be less significant. And that was not a segment that we were heavily penetrated in prior to the market turning the way that it has. So we didn't have much business in that category, and I think that those that had a lot of business in that category are seeing the mix of that business turn probably likely more towards polyethylene solutions at this point in time. But the Continuum system is a very encouraging launch for us. You can see what it's allowed us to do and even at downmarket over the course of a slow summer within the U.S. business and step up to above market growth rates. So continue to be very encouraged, and I think that there is more runway out in front of us on that launch

And so you can see that we've announced an acquisition in China that is pending at this point in time, and that's consistent with our growth strategy for the recon market. So again, up and down the continuum of care on the recon side in emerging markets. And then beyond that, we have excellent opportunities in these other product categories. And I think that as early in the fourth quarter, you're going to start seeing some progress to be made in one or two of those other business units. Coming back to your Spine question, I think that, that's one that is to win there, we're going to have to do well both on internal as well as external development to ensure that we've got the right kind of product pipeline. So we've got a pretty significant commitment at this point in time on internal development. And just recently, we launched on a limited basis an excellent MIS system, the Pathfinder system. It was well received. We think that we're going to make good progress in that category and have an excellent overall portfolio with MIS solutions within the Spine business. But to continue to make progress on that market, it's a big market. It's one that we think we can create a lot of value win for the shareholders and provide some good solutions for patients. The success rates are much lower at this point in time, so there is a lot of room for innovation that can make a difference for patients in that category.

This morning, I'll review our third quarter 2010 results and provide some commentary on general market conditions. Jim will then discuss additional financial details. 
We delivered solid earnings and cash flow performance in the third quarter, notwithstanding challenging global economic conditions that negatively impacted procedure rates. Our performance reflects a focus on disciplined spending in executing our strategic plan. A core element of this plan involves new product introductions across our businesses. These introductions will position us for an improved performance in the fourth quarter and accelerated growth beyond 2010 as the economy strengthens.
Net sales for the quarter were $965 million, a decrease of 0.5% on a constant-currency basis, and our earnings per share were $0.96 on an adjusted basis, an increase of 9.1% over the prior year period. For the quarter, our Americas and Europe, Middle East and Africa segments experienced constant currency sales declines of 0.4% and 3.8%, respectively, while the Asia Pacific region grew 4.2% constant currency.
Knee sales for the quarter decreased year-over-year 2.7% constant currency, reflecting negative volume and mix of 0.4% and negative price of 2.3%. Important advances for Zimmer Knees included a broader rollout of our Patient Specific Instruments and a limited rollout of our posterior referencing instruments. 
Moving into the fourth quarter and to a greater extent throughout 2011, we expect to see accelerating growth with these knee instruments being deployed broadly. A number of additional MRI centers have been certified to process our Patient Specific Instruments, and we have had continued commercial success based on the unique and differentiating features and benefits of our system. 
Meanwhile, early clinical feedback on our posterior referencing instruments has been very positive. Recent National Joint Replacement Registry data continues to demonstrate outstanding long-term clinical success of our NexGen and Natural-Knee product families, and we're confident that our enhanced instrumentation options will drive increased adoption globally.
Our Hip business performed above market in the Americas in the quarter with sales improving year-over-year, 2.7% on a constant-currency basis. Overall, our Hip sales increased 0.5% constant currency, reflecting positive volume and mix of 2.7% and negative price of 2.2%. 
We're encouraged that is volume and mix growth relative to market is verification of increasing momentum we're experiencing in the commercialization of our new Hip products. In particular, the Continuum Acetabular Cup System provide surgeons with the flexibility to select from alternative bearing surfaces to meet the diverse and unique needs of their total hip replacement patients.
The Continuum System has provided an important expansion to our hip portfolio. As we've described before, momentum from a new product introduction generally builds over the course of one or more operating periods as the implants, instruments and related training are deployed. We're on track with our expectations for the stage rollout of the Continuum System.
The performance of our Hip business in the quarter was also supported by continued strong sales of Revision Hip products, a category in which Zimmer has achieved overall leading market share. We also saw growth in sales of our stem products, including the M/L Taper with connective technology, which offers a modular adjustable neck system that enables surgeons to personalize fit interoperatively for each patient. 
Extremities products posted sales growth of 3.6% constant currency for the quarter, which compares to a high 20.5% growth rate from the third quarter of last year. These results were again supported by sales of our Shoulder products, featuring Trabecular Metal Technology, including the TM Reverse Shoulder and TM Glenoid.
Continuing its solid performance for the year in a market heavily impacted by general economic conditions, Zimmer Dental sales increased 4.9% constant currency for the quarter. Our Dental business is generating broad-based sales momentum across implants, restorative components and regenerative products. 
Trauma sales in the quarter were up over the prior year period by 0.5% constant currency. We recently announced the 1,000th U.S. implantation of our Cephalomedullary Nail, a key component of the Zimmer Natural Nail System. Continued success in the commercialization of this new product bodes well for the rest of the Zimmer Natural Nail System, which features a wide range of lengths and diameters and in innovative anatomical design. We also announced the first implantation of the NCB Periprosthetic Plating system, a first of its kind solution for addressing complex femoral fractures that can occur around the knee or hip implant.
While Zimmer Spine reported an overall sales decrease of 7.4% constant currency in the quarter, European Spine sales experienced strong growth of 21.1% constant currency. In our Spine business, we continue to drive operational changes and pursuing aggressive new product development pipeline. 
In the third quarter, Zimmer Surgical, formerly known as Orthopaedic Surgical Products, experienced a solid 8.2% constant currency growth. We continue to see strong sales of our wound debridement devices and bone cement products. 
I'll now touch briefly on some operational developments and other topics. Operationally, we improved our sequential gross margin and cash flow to support corporate investments, including new product development initiatives designed to accelerate our growth. While we increased spending on product development, our margins remain strong, with operating margins improving 160 basis points in the third quarter compared to the prior year. Cash flow remains at a high level, a point on which Jim will provide more detail. 
Consolidated pricing for the quarter was consistent with our expectations, decreasing slightly from the second quarter. Consolidated average selling prices in the third quarter were down 1.4% compared to the prior year period. We experienced negative pricing of 1.6% in the Americas, flat pricing in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region and negative pricing in the Asia Pacific region of 2.9%. We continue to anticipate consolidated price erosion of between 1% and 2% for the year. 
In the third quarter, the market experienced a slowdown in procedure volumes due to global economic conditions, unemployment and other factors. High unemployment has resulted in expiring health insurance and COBRA subsidies in the U.S., as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.  Demographic analysis suggests that these trends have had a particularly notable impact on the non-Medicare potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age. 
The balance of the slowdown in the U.S. is attributed to seasonality effects, which include a combination of slower surgery schedules and patients delaying care until high deductibles are met. Similarly, austerity measures are contributing to the overall slowed procedure volumes in Europe.
Now long-term indicators still point towards sustained growth, and we continue to believe that the knee and hip market should grow in the mid-single digits. That outlook is based on anticipated growth in developed markets with aging populations, as well as higher penetration rates in emerging markets in which increasing numbers of patients are gaining access to healthcare. 
Even with the economic pressures that we've seen over the last 18 to 24 months, healthcare providers and third-party payers recognize that these replacement procedures are cost effective. They take costs out of the system as opposed to continuing to manage the chronic conditions to which patients would otherwise be exposed. We remain committed to executing our strategic plan with the focus on disciplined financial performance. 
Jim will now provide further details on the quarter and on our updated sales and earnings guidance. Jim?"

I will review our third quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our 2010 guidance. As David mentioned, our total revenues for the quarter were $965 million, a 0.5% constant currency decline compared to the third quarter of last year. 
Net currency impact for the quarter was slightly negative, decreasing revenues by an additional 0.5% or $5.2 million. 
The unfavorable currency impact from our euro-denominated sales in the quarter was partially offset by a favorable currency impact from our Japanese yen and Australian dollar denominated revenues. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.3% for the quarter. The margin ratio is up 260 basis points compared to third quarter of 2009, an increase of 100 basis points compared with the second quarter 2010.
Improved management of our global inventories has resulted in lower excess in obsolescence expense compared with the third quarter of prior year. Additionally, prior year results reflect certain charges for scrap, idle plant and cleanup activities following the 2009 fire in our Warsaw manufacturing plant. 
Lastly, the improvement in gross margin also reflects the manufacturing network operating at higher levels of efficiency in 2010 compared with prior year. As outlined in the second quarter call, we expect our gross margin ratio to be between 76% and 76.5% for the full year, assuming that foreign currency exchange rates remain near recent levels. This includes a lower gross margin ratio in the fourth quarter due to less favorable hedge results. 
R&D expense as a percentage of sales was at 6%, and at $57.6 million for the quarter is 10% higher on a total dollar basis when compared to the prior year. This increase is in line with our strategy to focus more investment into new product development activities and clinical programs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $412 million in the third quarter, and at 42.7% of sales or 40 basis points above prior year. SG&A spending for the third quarter of 2010 in absolute dollar terms is slightly below the third quarter of the prior year. 
Acquisition, integration, realignment and other amounted to $5 million in the quarter. These expenses include integration costs from our pending acquisition of Beijing Montagne, a onetime cost stemming from distributor acquisitions in our Europe, Middle East and Africa segment, realignment of our global IT infrastructure and other of the prior period acquisitions. 
Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased to $277 million. At 28.7%, our adjusted operating profit sales ratio is 160 basis points higher than the prior year third quarter due to improvements in gross margins that are partially offset by increased research and development expense.
Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $14.2 million compared to $4.2 million in the prior quarter. Similar to the last two quarters, the change is primarily due to the $1 billion senior unsecured notes offering we completed in November of 2009. 
Adjusted net earnings were $192 million for the third quarter, an increase of 2.2% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9.1% to $0.96 on a 199.7 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share includes above approximately $0.05 of share-based compensation. At $0.96, reported diluted earnings per share, which include the items reflected in acquisition, integration, realignment and other, increased to 37% over the prior year third quarter reported EPS of $0.70.
Our adjusted effective tax rate for quarter was 26.7%. We anticipate that 2010 full year tax rate will be approximately 27%. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.2 million shares at a total purchase price of $225.6 million. As of September 30, 2010, approximately $1.3 billion remained authorized under our $1.5 billion repurchase program, which expires at the end of 2013. The company had approximately 197 million shares of common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2010, down from 204 million as of December 31, 2009.
We continually review the best utilization of the cash that we generate. Our intentions with regard to use of free cash flow remain the same as we have indicated for some time. Our first priority is external developments, when and it's the right opportunity to rise. There are technology products or business that strategically align with our focus on musculoskeletal health. We balance this priority with maintaining strong liquidity and continue to believe that share repurchases are an efficient and effective way to return excess free cash flow to our shareholders. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $320 million, down 9% from $352 million in the third quarter of 2009. Net inventories were $923 million at the end of the third quarter, $44 million less than third quarter prior year. Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 380 days, an increase of 27 days compared with the third quarter of 2009. This increase in days on hand is largely driven by the sensitivity of the calculation in year-over-year improvements and cost of goods sold. Our adjusted trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 67 days, an increase of four days over the third quarter of 2009.
Net receivables increased $14 million or 2% over prior year. Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter amounted to $84 million. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $256 million, $47 million lower than the third quarter of 2009. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outflows for instruments and property, plant and equipment. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $64 million, including $50 million for instruments and $14 million for property, plant and equipment. Cash outlays associated with investing activities during the quarter include $2.5 million for certain international distributor acquisitions.
I'd like to turn now to our guidance for 2010. In our earnings release this morning, we provided fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EPS guidance and updated our full year guidance. Fourth quarter revenues are expected to increase between zero and 2% on a constant-currency basis as we continue to gain momentum with new products and instruments. 
As a result, the company now expects 2010 full year revenues to increase approximately 2% on a constant-currency basis, which compares with prior guidance of between 3% and 5%.
Assuming foreign currency exchange rates remain near recent levels, the company estimates that foreign currency translation will decrease revenues by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter and increase revenues by 0.5% for the full year 2010. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.22. As a result, adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $4.24 to $4.29 for the full year 2010.
David, I'll turn the call back over to you."

So it looks like Europe perhaps took another step down maybe in the market as a whole, certainly for your sales this quarter after seeing a couple of quarters of somewhat weak but stable growth. Two questions related to that. Was there anything that changed over this past quarter to result in that? And then secondly, as you think about the budgets getting reset for 2011 and the austerity measures being put in place, what it in your mind is the risk of kind of another step down in procedure volumes? Or another step down in sort of healthcare spending pressure that would pressure procedure volumes coming from new budgets being put in place in 2011?"

For us, the pricing environment didn't change much from the second quarter to the third quarter. So I think that some of the austerity measures in the macroeconomic conditions created environment where there was a more profound element of seasonality to the business. It's always a slow market in the third quarter within Europe due to the holiday schedules, but it was exacerbated by the economic conditions. I would tell you, with respect to looking forward in that market, I think that one of the limitations as to how aggressive people can push in managing these procedure rates down is a political one. At some point, the known success of these procedures among the patient base and the recognition by the payors with these national healthcare systems is that it's not a cost effective move to differ these procedures in any extended form. And frankly, it becomes politically untenable at some point. And I think that you have to that bear in mind as you look forward and anticipate what those markets would look like in the future. Now the majority of our business is in the five or six most developed markets, and those slowdowns that we saw were more profound market-wise, it seems, in hips than in knees and we obviously have a significant market share in those European markets. And so that impacted the quarter to an extent. And then finally, if you're looking at our performance within Europe sequentially, you'll note that we picked up a billing day in Q2 and lost a billing day in Q3. And so that explains a bit of the sequential performance difference from Q2 to Q3 for us."

There are competitive systems out there with new, more modern instruments. Our response to that is both the new PSI instruments as well as the posterior referencing instruments. And as David indicated, we're still early into the launch for those instrument systems. The fact those instruments will not really necessarily have an impact on that metric, so until we launch new devices within the Knee franchise, we're not likely going to see much of an increase in new product revenue within the Knee franchise.

And some of new product launches are what's driving that continued engagement within the sales force, obviously. On the Hip side, as you mentioned, the Continuum system as well as the MMC system were launches that were initiated the very end of last year. And so those launches are under way. We're starting to see the productivity of those launches, particularly on the Continuum side. I will tell you that the MMC Cup is a less significant launch in light of what's happened in that Metal-on-Metal category. I think that there's going to continue to be a market out there for the Metal-on-Metal, but it's going to be less significant. And that was not a segment that we were heavily penetrated in prior to the market turning the way that it has. So we didn't have much business in that category, and I think that those that had a lot of business in that category are seeing the mix of that business turn probably likely more towards polyethylene solutions at this point in time. But the Continuum system is a very encouraging launch for us. You can see what it's allowed us to do and even at downmarket over the course of a slow summer within the U.S. business and step up to above market growth rates. So continue to be very encouraged, and I think that there is more runway out in front of us on that launch."

Again, within the recon space, we think that we have great opportunities and some of this can lead to informing our views as to what external development might look like to move up and down that continuum of care as well as emerging markets. And so you can see that we've announced an acquisition in China that is pending at this point in time, and that's consistent with our growth strategy for the recon market. So again, up and down the continuum of care on the recon side in emerging markets. And then beyond that, we have excellent opportunities in these other product categories. And I think that as early in the fourth quarter, you're going to start seeing some progress to be made in one or two of those other business units. Coming back to your Spine question, I think that, that's one that is to win there, we're going to have to do well both on internal as well as external development to ensure that we've got the right kind of product pipeline. So we've got a pretty significant commitment at this point in time on internal development. And just recently, we launched on a limited basis an excellent MIS system, the Pathfinder system. It was well received at NAS. We think that we're going to make good progress in that category and have an excellent overall portfolio with MIS solutions within the Spine business. But to continue to make progress on that market, it's a big market. It's one that we think we can create a lot of value win for the shareholders and provide some good solutions for patients. The success rates are much lower at this point in time, so there is a lot of room for innovation that can make a difference for patients in that category.

This morning, I'll review our third quarter 2010 results and provide some commentary on general market conditions. Jim will then discuss additional financial details.
 We delivered solid earnings and cash flow performance in the third quarter, notwithstanding challenging global economic conditions that negatively impacted procedure rates. Our performance reflects a focus on disciplined spending in executing our strategic plan. A core element of this plan involves a new product introductions across our businesses. These introductions will position us for an improved performance in the fourth quarter and accelerate growth beyond 2010 as the economy strengthens.
 Net sales for the quarter were $965 million, a decrease of 0.5% on a constant-currency basis, and our earnings per share were $0.96 on an adjusted basis, an increase of 9.1% over the prior year period. For the quarter, our Americas and Europe, Middle East and Africa segments experienced constant currency sales declines of 0.4% and 3.8%, respectively, while the Asia Pacific region grew 4.2% constant currency.
 Knee sales for the quarter decreased year-over-year 2.7% constant currency, reflecting negative volume and mix of 0.4% and negative price of 2.3%. Important advances for Zimmer Knees included a broader rollout of our Patient Specific Instruments and a limited rollout of our posterior referencing instruments.
 Moving into the fourth quarter and to a greater extent throughout 2011, we expect to see accelerating growth with these knee instruments being deployed broadly. A number of additional MRI centers have been certified to process our Patient Specific Instruments, and we have had continued commercial success based on the unique and differentiating features and benefits of our system.
 Meanwhile, early clinical feedback on our posterior referencing instruments have been very positive. Recent National Joint Replacement Registry data continues to demonstrate outstanding long-term clinical success of our NexGen and Natural-Knee product families, and we're confident that our enhanced instrumentation options will drive increased adoption globally.
 Our Hip business performed above market in the Americas in the quarter with sales improving year-over-year, 2.7% on a constant-currency basis. Overall, our Hip sales increased 0.5% constant currency, reflecting positive volume and mix of 2.7% and negative price of 2.2%.
 We're encouraged that is volume and mix growth relative to market is verification of increasing momentum we're experiencing in the commercialization of our new Hip products. In particular, the Continuum Acetabular Cup System provide surgeons with the flexibility to select from alternative bearing surfaces to meet the diverse and unique needs of their total hip replacement patients.
 The Continuum System has provided an important expansion to our hip portfolio. As we've described before, momentum from a new product introduction generally builds over the course of one or more operating periods as the implement instruments and related training are deployed. We're on track with our expectations for the stage rollout of the Continuum System.
 The performance of our Hip business in the quarter was also supported by continued strong sales of Revision Hip products, a category in which Zimmer has achieved overall leading market share. We also saw growth in sales of our stem products, including the M/L Taper with connective technology, which offers a modular adjustable neck system that enables surgeons to personalize fit interoperatively for each patient.
 Extremities products posted sales growth of 3.6% constant currency for the quarter, which compares to a high 20.5% growth rate from the third quarter of last year. These results were again supported by sales of our Shoulder products, featuring Trabecular Metal Technology, including the TM Reverse Shoulder and TM Glenoid.
 Continuing its solid performance for the year in a market heavily impacted by general economic conditions, Zimmer Dental sales increased 4.9% constant currency for the quarter. Our Dental business is generating broad-based sales momentum across implants, restorative components and regenerative products.
 Trauma sales in the quarter were up over the prior year period by 0.5% constant currency. We recently announced the 1,000th U.S. implantation of our Cephalomedullary Nail, a key component of the Zimmer Natural Nail System. Continued success in the commercialization of this new product bodes well for the rest of the Zimmer Natural Nail System, which features a wide range of lengths and diameters and in innovative anatomical design. We also announced the first implantation of the NCB Periprosthetic Plating system, a first of its kind solution for addressing complex femoral fractures that can occur around the knee or hip implant.
 While Zimmer Spine reported an overall sales decrease of 7.4% constant currency in the quarter, European Spine sales experienced strong growth of 21.1% constant currency. In our Spine business, we continue to drive operational changes and pursuing aggressive new product development pipeline.
 In the third quarter, Zimmer Surgical, formerly known as Orthopaedic Surgical Products, experienced a solid 8.2% constant currency growth. We continue to see strong sales of our wound debridement devices and bone cement products.
 I'll now touch briefly on some operational developments and other topics. Operationally, we improved our sequential gross margin and cash flow to support corporate investments, including a new product development initiatives designed to accelerate our growth. While we increased spending on product development, our margins remain strong, with operating margins improving 160 basis points in the third quarter compared to the prior year. Cash flow remains at a high level, a point on which Jim will provide more detail.
 Consolidated pricing for the quarter was consistent with our expectations, decreasing slightly from the second quarter. Consolidated average selling prices in the third quarter were down 1.4% compared to the prior year period. We experienced negative pricing of 1.6% in the Americas, flat pricing in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region and negative pricing in the Asia Pacific region of 2.9%. We continue to anticipate consolidated price erosion of between 1% and 2% for the year.
 In the third quarter, the market experienced a slowdown in procedure volumes due to global economic conditions, unemployment and other factors. High unemployment has resulted in expiring health insurance and COBRA subsidies in the U.S., as well as a decline in enrollment in private health plans.  Demographic analysis suggests that these trends has had a particularly notable impact on the non-Medicare potential patient base for joint replacement procedures, those between 45 and 65 years of age.
 The balance of the slowdown in the U.S. is attributed to seasonality effects, which include a combination of slower surgery schedules and patients delaying care until high deductibles are met. Similarly, austerity measures are contributing to the overall slowed procedure volumes in Europe.
 Now long-term indicators still point towards sustained growth, and we continue to believe that the knee and hip market should grow in the mid-single digits. That outlook is based on anticipated growth in developed markets with aging populations, as well as higher penetration rates in emerging markets in which increasing numbers of patients are gaining access to healthcare.
 Even with the economic pressures that we've seen over the last 18 to 24 months, healthcare providers and third-party payers recognize that these replacement procedures are cost effective. They take costs out of the system as opposed to continuing to manage the chronic conditions to which patients would otherwise be exposed. We remain committed to executing our strategic plan with the focus on disciplined financial performance.
 Jim will now provide further details on the quarter and on our updated sales and earnings guidance. Jim?

I will review our third quarter performance in more detail and then provide additional information related to our 2010 guidance. As David mentioned, our total revenues for the quarter were $965 million, a 0.5% constant currency decline compared to the third quarter of last year.
 Net currency impact for the quarter was slightly negative, decreasing revenues by an additional 0.5% or $5.2 million.
 The unfavorable currency impact from our euro-denominated sales in the quarter was partially offset by a favorable currency impact from our Japanese yen and Australian dollar denominated revenues. Our adjusted gross profit margin was 77.3% for the quarter. The margin ratio is up 260 basis points compared to third quarter of 2009, an increase of 100 basis points compared with the second quarter 2010.
 Improved management of our global inventories has resulted in lower excess in obsolescence expense compared with the third quarter of prior year. Additionally, prior year results reflect certain charges for scrap, idle plant and cleanup activities following the 2009 fire in our Warsaw manufacturing plant.
 Lastly, the improvement in gross margin also reflects the manufacturing network operating at higher levels of efficiency in 2010 compared with prior year. As outlined in the second quarter call, we expect our gross margin ratio to be between 76% and 76.5% for the full year, assuming that foreign currency exchange rates remain near recent levels. This includes a lower gross margin ratio in the fourth quarter due to less favorable hedge results.
 R&D expense as a percentage of sales was at 6%, and at $57.6 million for the quarter is 10% higher on a total dollar basis when compared to the prior year. This increase is in line with our strategy to focus more investment into new product development activities and clinical programs.
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were $412 million in the third quarter, and at 42.7% of sales or 40 basis points above prior year. SG&A spending for the third quarter of 2010 in absolute dollar terms is slightly below the third quarter of the prior year.
 Acquisition, integration, realignment and other amounted to $5 million in the quarter. These expenses include integration costs from our pending acquisition of Beijing Montagne, a onetime cost stemming from distributor acquisitions in our Europe, Middle East and Africa segment, realignment of our global IT infrastructure and other of the prior period acquisitions.
 Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased to $277 million. At 28.7%, our adjusted operating profit sales ratio is 160 basis points higher than the prior year third quarter due to improvements in gross margins that are partially offset by increased research and development expense.
 Net interest expense for the quarter amounted to $14.2 million compared to $4.2 million in the prior quarter. Similar to the last two quarters, the change is primarily due to the $1 billion senior unsecured notes offering we completed in November of 2009.
 Adjusted net earnings were $192 million for the third quarter, an increase of 2.2% compared to the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9.1% to $0.96 on a 199.7 million average outstanding diluted shares. These adjusted earnings per share includes above approximately $0.05 of share-based compensation. At $0.96, reported diluted earnings per share, which include the items reflected in acquisition, integration, realignment and other, increased to 37% over the prior year third quarter reported EPS of $0.70.
 Our adjusted effective tax rate for quarter was 26.7%. We anticipate that 2010 full year tax rate will be approximately 27%. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.2 million shares at a total purchase price of $225.6 million. As of September 30, 2010, approximately $1.3 billion remained authorized under our $1.5 billion repurchase program, which expires at the end of 2013. The company had approximately 197 million shares of common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2010, down from 204 million as of December 31, 2009.
 We continually review the best utilization of the cash that we generate. Our intentions with regard to use of free cash flow remain the same as we have indicated for some time. Our first priority is external development, when and it's the right opportunity to rise. There are technology products or business that strategically align with our focus on musculoskeletal health. We balance this priority with maintaining strong liquidity and continue to believe that share repurchases are an efficient and effective way to return excess free cash flow to our shareholders.
 Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to $320 million, down 9% from $352 million in the third quarter of 2009. Net inventories were $923 million at the end of the third quarter, $44 million less than third quarter prior year. Adjusted inventory days on hand finished the quarter at 380 days, an increase of 27 days compared with the third quarter of 2009. This increase in days on hand is largely driven by the sensitivity of the calculation in year-over-year improvements and cost of goods sold. Our adjusted trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding finished the quarter at 67 days, an increase of four days over the third quarter of 2009.
 Net receivables increased $14 million or 2% over prior year. Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter amounted to $84 million. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $256 million,  $47 million lower than the third quarter of 2009. We define free cash flow as operating cash flow less cash outflows for instruments and property, plant and equipment.
 Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $64 million, including $50 million for instruments and $14 million for property, plant and equipment. Cash outlays associated with investing activities during the quarter include $2.5 million for certain international distributor acquisitions.
 I'd like to turn now to our guidance for 2010. In our earnings release this morning, we provided  fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EPS guidance and updated our full year guidance. Fourth quarter revenues are expected to increase between zero and 2% on a constant-currency basis as we continue to gain momentum with new products and instruments.
 As a result, the company now expects 2010 full year revenues to increase approximately 2% on a constant-currency basis, which compares with prior guidance of between 3% and 5%.
 Assuming foreign currency exchange rates remain near recent levels, the company estimates that foreign currency translation will decrease revenues by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter and increase revenues by 0.5% for the full year 2010. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.22. As a result, adjusted diluted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $4.24 to $4.29 for the full year 2010.
 David, I'll turn the call back over to you.

In summary, our third quarter performance reflected solid bottom line performance in a climate of macroeconomic pressures. The outlook for the remainder of the year anticipates continued progress with recent product and instrumentation launches, supported by a full offering of medical education and training programs.
 Our organization retains a broad sense of optimism about the potential for our industry. The long-term positive indicators for our sector are compelling. In the face of heightened scrutiny about healthcare costs, our increasingly diversified portfolio of early and late-stage intervention musculoskeletal products provide cost-effective solutions for the patients and global healthcare systems we serve.
 And now I'd like to ask Celeste to begin the Q&A portion of our call.

So it looks like Europe perhaps took another step down maybe in the market as a whole, certainly for your sales this quarter after seeing a couple of quarters of somewhat weak but stable growth. Two questions related to that. Was there anything that changed over this past quarter to result in that? And then secondly, as you think about the budgets getting reset for 2011 and the austerity measures being put in place, what it in your mind is the risk of kind of another step down in procedure volumes or another step down in sort of healthcare spending pressure that would pressure procedure volumes coming from new budgets being put in place in 2011?

For us, the pricing environment didn't change much from the second quarter to the third quarter. So I think that some of the austerity measures in the macroeconomic conditions created environment where the was a more profound element of seasonality to the business. It's always a slow market in the third quarter within Europe due to the holiday schedules, but it was exacerbated by the economic conditions. I would tell you, with respect to looking forward in that market, I think that one of the limitations as to how aggressive people can push in managing these procedure rates down is a political one. At some point, the known success of these procedures among the patient base and the recognition by the payors with these national healthcare systems is that it's not a cost effective move to differ these procedures in any extended form. And frankly, it becomes politically untenable at some point. And I think that you have to that bear in mind as you look forward and anticipate what those markets would look like in the future. Now the majority of our business is in the five or six most developed markets, and those slowdowns that we saw were more profound market-wise, it seems, in hips than in knees and we obviously have a significant market share in those European markets. And so that impacted the quarter to an extent. And then finally, if you're looking at our performance within Europe sequentially, you'll note that we picked up a billing day in Q2 and lost a billing day in Q3. And so that explains a bit of the sequential performance difference from Q2 to Q3 for us.

And so that's a big opportunity for us because those are instrument sets that are differentiated in the case of PSI, and accommodating in the case of PRI of surgical philosophies that many competitive surgeons come to the table with. So we have one of the best-performing knee systems and now a set of instruments that's going to accommodate that particular surgeon customer, and I think that it's going to be a great growth opportunity for us. But the third quarter marked the point where we introduced those PRI instruments only on a limited basis. And again, it takes some time for those sets to get deployed for surgeons to train, to trial and to work through the sales process.

There are competitive systems out there with new, more modern instruments. Our response to that is both the new PSI instruments as well as the posterior referencing instruments. And as David indicated, we're still early into the launch for those instrument systems. The fact those instruments will not really necessarily have an impact on that metric, so until we launch new devices within the Knee franchise, we're not likely going to see much of an increase in new product revenue within the Knee franchise. What we're really looking for to drive performance there again is the launch of the new instrument systems.

And some of new product launches are what's driving that continued engagement within the sales force, obviously. On the Hip side, as you mentioned, the Continuum system as well as the MMC system were launches that were initiated the very end of last year. And so those launches are under way. We're starting to see the productivity of those launches, particularly on the Continuum side. I will tell you that the MMC Cup is a less significant launch in light of what's happened in that Metal-on-Metal category. I think that there's going to continue to be a market out there for the Metal-on-Metal, but it's going to be less significant. And that was not a segment that we were heavily penetrated in prior to the market turning the way that it has. So we didn't have much business in that category, and I think that those that had a lot of business in that category are seeing the mix of that business turn probably likely more towards polyethylene solutions at this point in time. But the Continuum system is a very encouraging launch for us. You can see what it's allowed us to do and even at downmarket over the course of a slow summer within the U.S. business and step up to above market growth rates. So continue to be very encouraged, and I think that there is more runway out in front of us on that launch

And our fundamental strategy launching due to the experience that we have in the third quarter of this year. We're going to continue to focus on executing our plan. Again, within the recon space, we think that we have great opportunities and some of this can lead to informing our views as to what external development might look like to move up and down that continuum of care as well as emerging markets. And so you can see that we've announced an acquisition in China that is pending at this point in time, and that's consistent with our growth strategy for the recon market. So again, up and down the continuum of care on the recon side in emerging markets. And then beyond that, we have excellent opportunities in these other product categories. And I think that as early in the fourth quarter, you're going to start seeing some progress to be made in one or two of those other business units. Coming back to your Spine question, I think that, that's one that is to win there, we're going to have to do well both on internal as well as external development to ensure that we've got the right kind of product pipeline. So we've got a pretty significant commitment at this point in time on internal development. And just recently, we launched on a limited basis an excellent MIS system, the Pathfinder system. It was well received. We think that we're going to make good progress in that category and have an excellent overall portfolio with MIS solutions within the Spine business. But to continue to make progress on that market, it's a big market. It's one that we think we can create a lot of value win for the shareholders and provide some good solutions for patients. The success rates are much lower at this point in time, so there is a lot of room for innovation that can make a difference for patients in that category. And we want to be one of the companies providing those solutions going forward.
