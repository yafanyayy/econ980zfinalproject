Let me begin just by acknowledging with sadness the passing of Ed Linde, the Chief Executive Officer for many, many years and was for 41 years, my close friend and colleague. We started the company togeth",1059,"Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us. Let me begin just by acknowledging with sadness the passing of Ed Linde, the Chief Executive Officer for many, many years and was for 41 years, my close friend and colleague. We started the company together and had a wonderful fit of personalities and abilities, and is somebody whom I shall miss enormously. It's hard really to imagine the boy that he leaves after all these many years.We will all try and make up for the work, which he did for the company, expanding our various duties Doug, myself and a number of others. But he was truly a remarkable man and a remarkable businessman, and a remarkable friend and a remarkable colleague. So with that, if I may say just one or two things about the company and the environment in which we work.I think we had a very difficult patch as an industry over the last several years. All of you I know are familiar with what's been going on. I must say that I think we, in a sense, have had for a very long time a basic strategy that I think demonstrated its relevance and viability in the past 18 months in particular. And that is we have stayed in by and large supply constrained markets, and we have concentrated on the very upper end of those markets. And I think we found this with perhaps more particularly illustrative in New York City, where this is a perfect sort of a illustration of this, how it works. We have been very successful, I might say, in leasing all of the space, which we had available mostly because of bankruptcies, Lehman Brothers and Heller Ehrman and General Motors, et cetera. And the reason is implicit in the thinking that went into this strategy, which is that these kinds of buildings we feel do better in good markets, but much better relatively in difficult markets. And the reason is that in different markets when rents go down and they had gone down, and we are not immune to that, a lot of people who want to be in the best buildings take advantage of these lower rents and move into them. And that's exactly what we have found. So I think we will be in a position to have remarkably high occupancy rates compared to the overall market in New York, compared to other cities, in part because we have found that tenants really are anxious to go into the buildings that we have. And this is particularly true of buildings like 399 Park Avenue, the General Motors building, 601 Lexington, but formerly what we used to call the Citigroup building. We have really had a very, very good experience in terms of filling up those buildings to the extent that we had vacancies. And not that the rents as they used to be, but the rents have been fairly good and they have been firming up. So we think the strategy that we have does give us some protection against the kind of headwinds that the commercial office building market has encountered in many, many areas of the country.So I think we go into this coming period, the next year, frankly feeling fairly good about the business. I don't want to underestimate the fact that, as many of you probably know from what I've said and what I've written, that I have not been a bull over the last two years but I've been much more bearish than most, and I have to say that it is the pessimist who have been proven right. And I still think we are facing headwinds on the employment front. Nevertheless, in the financial area of the office market, I think there has been a major turnaround. That industry has stabilized and has grown. The intense freeze up of various aspects of the financial markets has become thawed for all kinds of reasons, not the least of which is the actions that the Federal Reserve Board. And if I ever have any advice to any of you who want to express political opinions, believe me, support Ben Bernanke for the Chairman of the Federal Reserve because he came up with some of the most innovative programs to make sure that the financial system has liquidity and credit when the normal ways of feeding the channels just got all blocked up by the fact that the major banks and the minor banks had such incredibly difficult loan books and credit losses that they were looking at. So anyways, whatever was the mix, I think the mood has changed. There is more confidence in the operations of the financial world. I'm not saying there's necessarily unanimity in terms of the views of the economy. I still think that most people are a little bit more bullish than am I. But I hope they are right, and I hope I'm wrong. But I think most people within the financial world feel that the real crisis in the financial world is pretty much behind us. And we reflect some of that in terms of the tenants that we have in our various markets. It feeds us well into the legal world, which is another big source of tenancy for firms like ours. But I'll give you another sort of demonstration of why I think this is the case. Most of the people in the financial world cannot do without their Bloombergs. And I can tell you that Bloomberg has been leasing a lot more machines as a lot of people have spun out of the larger financial firms and started up new firms, or other people have gone into the financial world because they feel that there is an opportunity. So I think we, in that regard, are benefiting from the fact that we have these very high quality buildings in some very good markets. The Washington market itself is strong, and some of our other markets are still strong. And some of them are weaker, particularly those out in the suburbs, but I'll leave that to others to comment on. And with that, I'll end my comments and ask Doug to take over the description to you of Boston Properties and its progress in the last year and its prospects for the next year. Doug?"

Personally and on behalf of my family and Boston Properties family, I wanted to express my thanks for all the calls and letters that we've received over the past few days. Listening to people speaking of the messages",3162,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everybody. Personally and on behalf of my family and Boston Properties family, I wanted to express my thanks for all the calls and letters that we've received over the past few days. Listening to people speaking of the messages they've left and reading what people have written about how my father made an impact on their lives. And just the unique personal connection he was able to make with so many people has really been a really wonderful tribute to him. His presence is going to be missed, but the values that he instilled, his approach to running our business and the example he set for how everybody at Boston Properties should conduct themselves and interact with their tenants, our contractors, our vendors, public officials, industry colleagues, lenders, analysts and investors is really the foundation of everything we are and everything we do at Boston Properties. Ed was incredibly proud of the organization that he and Mort founded more than 40 years ago. The opportunities that came when we transition to a public company back in 1997, really allowed Boston Properties to capitalize on its expertise and to grow and in most importantly, strengthen its management team and provide an enduring platform.  Ray Ritchey, Mitch Norville, Peter Johnston, Robert Selsam, Bob Pester, Bryan Koop, Micky Landis and Mike LaBelle, all have unique skills and talent but they all also have the opportunity and good fortune to be lead and mentored by Ed for many years ensuring that his legacy is going to live on. And we have a lot to look forward to, and a lot to be thankful for.Let me get to the real estate markets now. In some ways, the markets really have come a long way over the past 12 months. Leasing activity was largely non-existent when we were talking to you last year at this time, but we ended 2009 with significantly more activity than anybody projected including ourselves, particularly in New York City as Mort have suggested where, we actually leased 1 million square feet in 2009. The leasing activity is also becoming more consistent than our other markets, as tenants have begun to act on the new level of lease economics and they appear much less constrained about investing capital in their premises. During the fourth quarter, we completed 573,000 square feet of leases in Washington, D.C., 400,000 square feet in Boston, 290,000 in New York, 125,000 square feet in San Fransisco, for a total of 1.4 million. So our total portfolio leasing in 2009 was 3.6 million square feet and that was after just 250,000 square feet of leasing in the first quarter. And as a point of comparison in 2007 and 2008, we completed about 4.6 million square feet. So things really deal like they have come back and there is velocity.A year ago, there was basically no capital for real estate assets. Yet today, equity capitals are readily available from the public REITs have all recapitalized, foreign sources that are actively trying to invest equity in U.S. properties, and from private equity groups that have either uncommitted closed funds or believe they have the financial partners that will write big checks. Appropriately structured secured debt is being offered to well-regarded operators at attractive pricing levels, from life insurance companies and commercial banks be they foreign and domestic, and even the investment banks are starting to aggregate loan again, with an expectation of completing securitized scarce [ph] and I'm going to say this, CMBS deals. And Mike's going to discuss the success we are having at rolling over our JV property-secured debt in his remarks. Now this is all balanced by the measure of rent levels and concessions, vacancy and absorptions and the fact that the office markets do continue to struggle. Our second-generation leasing transaction this quarter were down 13%, and they're a pretty good indicator of the decline over the last year in rental rate economics in our markets. The data this quarter represents 98 leases, the majority were negotiated in 2009, and it does include 114,000 square feet of the former Lehman space that Mort discussed, where the rent was just about $100 per square foot. Now if you look at Washington, D.C., you'll sort of see the exceptions to the rule where we actually had a positive mark-to-market, and that was really led by a 200,000 square feet renewal we did with the GSA at 1301 New York Avenue. The availability space in conjunction with the absence of meaningful new tenant expansion has clearly led to a significant change in lease economics. Rents have declined and transaction cost have increased. Now every transaction is different and tenants may be looking for a higher lien low [ph] contribution or no contribution, so the overall level of rents can vary greatly. Tenant improvement cost and I want to spend a minute or two of giving you a sense of where they are. For new long-term deals and high-quality CBD assets are in the 60s in Boston, New York, and San Francisco and they're probably 10% to 50% higher in Washington, D.C. which is probably one of the reasons why the rent levels have held up better there. Suburban cost for TIs are more variable, since lease length tend to be shorter and can run anywhere from 10 to -- as much as $50 a square foot in a market like suburban Virginia. Historically, our blended transaction costs have been close to $30 a square foot, given that we do, do a number of renewals each quarter. And that particular is the case when we have a lots of activity in New York City. This quarter, we were lower. We were $25 a square foot, and our average lease by this quarter for the leases that we signed was 6.3 years. The market rents we use when we compute our mark-to-market are always based on long-term deals with the full market transaction cost package. And let me just give you a sense of where we see market rents, and you know there's some variability but I'll give you the ranges. In New York City, gross rents today probably are from the low 60s to the mid-80s in our portfolio. Now the exceptions there are Two Grand Central, where rents are a little bit lower. They probably start in the low 50s. And then again in the General Motors building, where things are much higher. Rents have been, at the bottom of the building, are in the high 80s and can reach over $140 a square foot at the top. In Boston, in our CBD, the rents are between the mid-40s and the high 50s, again and these rents were all gross. In San Francisco, between the high 30s and the mid-50s. And in D.C., between the mid-30s and the high 50s but those are on a net basis. And operating expenses for a high-quality building in D.C. are somewhere between $20 and $22 a square foot. The Greater Waltham suburban market is in the mid-20s to the low 30s, again gross. Cambridge is the high 30s to the mid-40s. Reston Town Center where we have a pretty significant presence, low 30s to the low 40s. Suburban Maryland from the low 30s in Rockville, to the low 50s in Chevy Chase, and the Princeton rents are pretty constant in the low 30s. So this leads to a mark-to-market including our share of our JVs of a negative $1.74 per square foot today. In 2010, our average expiring lease is $39.68 and using this figure that I just described, our market rent is about $36.85. And in 2011, the average expiring went a lot higher, it's $45.81 versus a market rent of $39.03. And again I think I've said this before but it really is -- it's about San Francisco in 2011, where have 200,000 square feet of space rolling over at close to $100 per square foot. Overall, our peak rents were in the second quarter of 2008 and since then, they have come down across our entire portfolio of about 20% on a gross basis, with New York City being down the most because they were the highest there, about 35% and they are pretty flat in DC.Mort published his macro perspective in the Journal last week, and I'm sure there will be some questions about that in our Q&A. And it's a pretty good reminder that while there are signs that the economic conditions are improving, but the labor markets do in fact remain challenged, and it's pretty hard to predict any improvement in real estate economics over the next 12 months. But this doesn't mean we're not going to either renew our expiring leases or fill our vacant space. As Mort described in 2009, we experienced some pretty significant tenant defaults in our New York City portfolio. And today, we have leased 87% of that space, and that includes three out of the four floors at the Citigroup Center, 601 Lexington Avenue that General Motors gave back.Transaction velocity continues at a very strong cleft [ph]. New York City has clearly worked. It's most strong, and that's where we derived 42% of our net operating income. We have negotiations ongoing on the remaining 50,000 square feet at 399. The last available floor is 599 Lex (Lexington). As I've said, we've leased three out of the four floors that were left vacant by GM at 601, and that's to an expanding tenant by the way. We're in an active discussion for all of our available space in all of our 2010 expirations at the General Motors building where, as reported, we did complete lease at the top of the building at economics that reflected the quality of the space in the building. It was a big number. And we are in dialogue with prospective tenants on much of our 2012 rollover at 125 West 55th Street. While many of the larger financial institutions are still rationalizing the space needs, the recovery of the financial services industry has clearly led to the formation of new companies, as Mort described, and there is new demand and we are seeing this first-hand in our leasing transaction. Our new term exposure in New York City is really limited. We have about 100 square feet at 601 Lex and 187,000 square feet at Two Grand Central Tower and that includes 80,000 square feet of the bottom of that building that we're going to get back because the U.S. mission to the U.N. is moving to an owned building in the middle of August.  Statistically, the East End market in Washington, D.C. is our strongest market and they have a direct vacancy of about 9.3%, but that's up from 6% three  years ago. So even Washington, D.C. is feeling the challenges of the labor markets. This is probably the highest vacancy we've seen in decades there in the district. The other challenge in Washington, D.C. continues to be the availability of the space in those secondary markets, North Capitol, which is really southeast, southwest and the ballpark waterfront areas. Practically speaking, the only tenants for those buildings of the GSA were government users and given the significant availability, it's actually about 4 million square feet of fully-completed vacant new product in that market. Gross rents are only in the high 30s, gross rents, with CPI escalations and full tenant improvement allowance. And since the government is the primary expanding user in the district, clearly slower than anybody I think anticipated, from as the GSA completes existing lease expirations, it is becoming a little bit less inclined to take prime locations, which it might have done in the past. And so that's having some issues of the overall economics in D.C. But our portfolio is 99% leased, and we have 285,000 square feet of expiration in 2010 and 11 combined. We were able to complete 120,000 square feet lease and extension expansion with one our major tenants at Market Square North this quarter, and that covered a major portion of our near-term rollover. We continue to make progress at 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue, and we are now negotiating our second largest lease in that building. Our efforts in suburban D.C. continue to be focused on early renewals. We documented the first of the many leases we have with the GSA were the direct contractors that have expired and yet the users are all in the space and have every intention of remaining. We have about 700,000 square feet of similar expired leases in our Northern Virginia portfolio that are included our 2010 expiration schedule, where we expect to complete leases of between two and five years, extensions with these to GSA or the GSA contractor. In Reston, we are actively working on our 2011 and 2012 rollover. We competed our first extension this last quarter, and 80,000 leased at One Discovery Square, and we're in active dialogue in all of the remaining rollover at Two Discovery, One Overlook, and One Freedom Square. In San Francisco, which is probably our slowest market, leasing activity was lower that the other places. Yet we still completed the two-floor relocation and expansion with an existing law firm. They've actually been adding partners as other firms have been disbanding. And we are in leased negotiations with the replacement tenant to back fill their space, which is a full-floor in one of the other buildings when it comes vacant in April. In addition, we did complete 13 other smaller transactions in the Embarcadero Center, which is really where the market seems to be most focused today, small 5,000 to 10,000 square-foot deal.The Silicon Valley is probably the weakest market that we are in the country. Availability is over 20%, and just to give you a perspective, this 46 million square feet of available space and about 15 million square feet of that space is Class A, and that includes 3 million square feet that was delivered in 2009. So the Silicon Valley has quite a long way to go before things start to feel even poor. Our single-storey Mountain View product continues to have somewhat good activity and we've completed another 17,000 square-feet deal this quarter, bringing our total activity in 2009 to about 92,000 square feet, as of 600,000 square feet of property. In the Western Boston suburbs, we are continuing see a pretty consistent flow of small, medium and some large requirements, and I would define large as a tenant over 30,000 square feet. And there continues to be a handful of expanding technology and pharmaceutical tenants that are taking advantage of the recent pullback to upgrade their premises. But there also have been a number of mergers and there has been some additional space delivered, which has led to an increase in available space in suburban Boston. And unfortunately, as we've previously discussed, our largest uncovered exposure next year is really in the Greater Waltham market, where we have about 525,000 square feet of available space. Some of it currently vacant, and some of it is no [ph] vacancy. The good news is our 350,000 square foot fully-leased development in Weston is going to be put into service in the second quarter, fully leased, and can give a major boost to our suburban revenues.There continues to be a little bit of optimism in Cambridge, as it clearly become the critical R&D location for many of the leading technology and biotech companies, and we are actually in discussions with two office technology companies that are considering meaningful expansions. The Boston CBD have seen an increase in activity this quarter, but that's really lease expiration not growth. Active law firm renewals are up, seemed to be accompanied by a reduction in the leased area. There a number of 2011 and 12 and 13 expiration law firm tenancies that are currently in the market. We did complete a 12-year, 188,000 square-foot renewal with our largest law firm at 111 Huntington Avenue this quarter. But as part of that, they gave back two floors. We also completed the 40,000 square-foot extension with another law firm and that one had no concessions. We continue to focus on renewing our tenants with 2011 lease expirations have approved, and we have begun to actively market the remaining space to be delivered at the base of Atlantic Wharf, which was recently repermitted as office space, and Mike will talk a little bit about that. I would summarize our outlook as follows. Rents have declined, but leasing velocity is becoming much more. In markets where ownership is stable, lease economics are firming and tenants are taking advantage of the repricing of high-quality space. In addition to lease expiration-driven transactions, there are pockets of tenant expansion both in our portfolio and in the market, which require incremental real estate. So there are some signs of life. I am not suggesting we're going to see positive absorption but the expansion activity is certainly not absent. Expanding tenants care about the future and they also care about underwriting ownership, which I think really bodes well for Boston Properties. Our strategy has been to own and operate the highest quality assets in our markets. Again reiterating what Mort started out the conversation with, the design buildings and tenant space is suited to our customers needs, and continue and most importantly invest and upgrade these assets. Our assets are not going to be capital starved. This will give us an advantage as we fight, and we will be fighting for tenants in the challenging market. For all the headlines about the burden of problem real estate assets, lender-led foreclosures or discount in note sales, they have really been the exception not the rule today. There is very little office product on the market today. It's unclear whether the various parties involved in upside down real estate properties were either confused, absentee or unmotivated ownership have an appreciation for the current level of lease economics, tenant demand and the significant capital necessary to operate office properties. Operating a partial-leased building, judging how long it will take to stabilize, developing the right plan to position into the marketplace, including making speculative capital investments and then executing is challenging and management-intensive. We believe we are in an era in the office building business where investors are going to have to operate assets, not trade assets, and then over time, this is going to provide us with opportunities to make acquisitions. Our critical component will be our judgment of the underwriting real estate fundamentals, and we eat the cooking everyday. It's hard to predict when we're going to be able to deploy our capital for productive growth, but we are staying in touch with the market and we are actively seeking out opportunities and it's just as important as keeping our portfolio leased and managing our financial requirements. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike."

I want to start with a little bit of a discussion about what's going on in the debt capital markets. We're working on several sizable mortgage refinancings now and we're continuing to see positive momentum in this",3013,"Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everybody. I want to start with a little bit of a discussion about what's going on in the debt capital markets. We're working on several sizable mortgage refinancings now and we're continuing to see positive momentum in this market. Overall, we have a strong capital position, with cash balances of $1.4 billion, and a comfortable leverage position. So we are not necessarily seeking to raise additional funds now, but simply replacing existing debt. However, if we see opportunities, we are confident that we could successfully raise significant new capital at attractive long-term rates. The unsecured markets have continued their tightening trend with our spreads in another 100 basis points in the last several weeks. Today, we could raise 10-year, senior unsecured debt in the mid-5% range, 30 to 50 basis point lower than the 5.88% coupon from our $700 million October offering. REIT spreads continue to be wide of other comparable corporates, pointing to the potential for further improvement. We are also tracking the convertible debt markets, which have come back to life after a near-death experience less than 12 months ago. We are now seeing convert pricing with sub 2% coupons for five years, and a 20% to 25% premium. We're currently in the market with three opportunities to refinance expiring mortgages on our joint venture assets. These three buildings, consisting of 125 West 55th Street, Two Grand Central Tower and Metropolitan Square, are high-quality CBD buildings in New York City and Washington, D,C. And we have found considerable interest from traditional life insurance bank and pension fund lenders that are willing to underwrite loans into $150 million to $200 million size range. We have executed a commitment on one of these deals, and have attractive term sheets on the others. As we've mentioned before, we expect to make a paydown on the two New York City properties, albeit a smaller one at $14 million than our prior expectation reflecting the improvement in this market. We anticipate our own additional proceeds at Metropolitan Square, so that refinancings will be closed to cash neutral for us. Coupons in the secured mortgage markets have come in by 150 to 200 basis points and are now in the low 6% range on a long-term fixed rate basis.During 2010, we expect to pay off our other pending maturities including our loans on several buildings at our Carnegie Center project in Princeton and at Eight Cambridge Center, which have a total outstanding balance of approximately $80 million. We also have several inexpensive LIBOR-based construction loans expiring at the end of the year, where we have short-term extension options that we may exercise. These consist of loans on South of Market, Democracy Tower and our share of Annapolis Junction, and totaled $267 million. Although the market has substantially improved, underwriting standards and particularly available leverage, continues to be front and center for lenders. Valuations are very conservative and the ability to use junior financing is highly discouraged if not completely prohibited. We believe that currently over leveraged assets in the markets will still be forced to inject significant equity to obtain refinancing. Otherwise, there will continue to be a standoff between lenders and borrowers. These situations may still garner short-term extensions, but only if the cash flow of the building support debt service payments.Turning to our earnings for the fourth quarter. We reported fourth quarter Funds From Operations of $1.04 per share, and full-year FFO of $4.59 per share, both within our guidance range. Our core operating performance exceeded our budget by $2.5 per share. There were no real significant individual drivers of our portfolio outperformance but a lot of small items that added up including on the expense side of the ledger, where our expense reduction programs initiated over the last couple of quarters are starting to flow through and positively impact our earnings. In total, we realized savings of $500,000 in net operating expenses this quarter. We produced about $1.7 million of unbudgeted rental revenue, a good piece of which came in New York City where we executed another new lease at 399 Park Avenue for 60,000 square feet that commenced straight-line rental revenue in the quarter. As with most of our leasing in New York City, the tenants are completing their own tenant improvement work, so they have three rent periods of six to 12 months. This will show up in our 2010 revenue where our straight-line rent will be higher than typical.Our hotel exceeded its projections for the second consecutive quarter by $575,000, with RevPAR up by 5% due to higher-than-expected occupancy. Pressure on room rates, however, remains a factor as is reflected by year-over-year decline of 14% in our average daily room rate. Outflows of temporary cost related to the suspension of our work at 250 West 55th Street were delayed, because temporary cost have no long-term value for the project. They are expense as incurred, and the delay resulted in $700,000 of savings for the fourth quarter. These costs will roll into and be incurred in the first quarter of 2010. We did complete all of the permanent work related to the suspension in the fourth quarter and as of December 1, 2009, we have ceased the capitalization of interest and wages for the project. As we mentioned before, this will result in a $25 million incremental increase in our interest expense until we restart the project. We also recategorized this project from construction and progress into land, which is the reason our land investment on our balance sheet increased this quarter.Our G&A was in line with our projections. On a year-to-year basis, G&A was higher than the fourth quarter of 2008, but this was due to the impact of our voluntary deferred compensation plan, which incurred losses endemic to the equity markets last fall, while this year we have experienced gains. These gains and losses run through our G&A line, but they have no impact on our bottom line, as they are offset in gains and losses and investments as our plan is fully funded.On the non-operating side of our P&L, we are taking a $6.2 million non-cash impairment charge to our carrying value for the California assets held in our value-added fund. As Doug mentioned, the market in the Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Peninsula has been negatively impacted by both an increase in speculative supply space and  a weakness in demand. The bulk of the impairment is associated with our Circle Star buildings in San Carlos, of which we own a 25% interest. At Circle Star, which will be fully vacant in February, leasing activity continues to be challenging and rents have declined significantly. Our carrying value is now below the amount of our non-recourse mortgage loan on the property.GAAP accounting group requires that we separately evaluate the building for impairment, and record any reductions independent of financing. The loan expires in 2013 and has cash escrows in place to fund the interest expense and carrying costs through mid-2010. We are currently in discussions with the lender to modify this loan, but if we unable to work out the modification, we could record a gain offsetting the portion of this impairment charge. Our remaining equity value and the Value-Added Fund is $12 million. Now I want to spend a few minutes on our projections for 2010. As we discussed in detail last quarter, there are several non-operating items that impact our FFO in 2010 and are important for you to understand. We raised both debt and equity capital in 2009 to put us in an advantageous position to quickly act on new opportunities. The majority of this new capital remains in cash and is currently dilutive as it is invested in low-yielding, short-term liquid investments. The impact of the increased share count from our equity offering is a reduction in 2010 FFO of $0.22 a share, and the interest expense associated with our bond offering as an incremental interest expense of $31 million, reducing our FFO by $0.17 per share, net of interest earnings. This puts us $0.39 per share behind our 2009 results off the bat. We have not projected any new acquisitions in our forecasts, so our guidance assumes that our cash remains dilutive for the full year.Looking at the portfolio, on a same-store basis, we continue to expect moderate declines due to the impact of negative leasing spreads from expiring leases over the next few years based on current market rents combined with generally flat occupancy rates. Our current occupancy at 92.4% is up from last quarter, which reflects the positive leasing activity in New York City. We are now back above 95% leased in Midtown, up nearly 45 basis points since June. While our supplemental accurately defines our 400,000 square feet of immediately available space and just over 400,000 square feet of rollover exposure in 2010, as Doug discussed, we are in active dialogue on much of this space. Our 2010 rollover has in place rents of $73 a foot, in alignment with the market rents that Doug spoke off, and as such we expect any roll down on this space that we experienced to be more muted in 2010.In Washington, D.C., we have minimal vacancy other than our Maryland portfolio, where we have 160,000 square feet available, net of a 56,000 square-foot tenant that took occupancy in January. And in Reston, Virginia we have 100,000 square feet. We now have only 50,000 square feet left in our South of Market development, where we signed an additional 15,000 square feet of leases this past quarter.In San Francisco, we had positive absorption in the fourth quarter, but we're really cautious about our ability to gain any meaningful improvement in our 460,000 square feet of current vacancy, a little less than half of which is in Embarcadero Center. Our largest exposure in 2010 is at our Zanker Road business park project, where a 544,000 square-foot lease expires on the last day of the year. This is a relatively low-rent building, midteens per square foot, and we currently expect a renewal in 50% of the space but there will be no impact in 2010.  Other than at Zanker Road, our rollover exposure is pretty light in 2010, with only 188,000 square feet or 5.6% of our leases expiring in Embarcadero Center. In Boston, as we have mentioned on previous calls, the expected increase in our vacancy has occurred, and we lost over 100 basis of occupancy, almost all of it in the suburbs and in the fourth quarter. We had some high-quality available space, including close to 300,000 square feet at 200 West Street, Waltham Weston Corporate Center, CityPoint and Reservoir Place. Additionally, our 2010 rollover in Boston is nearly 700,000 square feet, with 430,000 square feet in the suburbs, 125,000 square feet in Cambridge, which includes 80,000 square feet when Biogen relocates to Weston in the second quarter and 130,000 square feet at the Pru [Prudential Center]. Given the overall market supply and demand, we are not expecting any meaningful additional revenue in 2010 and may end up losing occupancy this year in the Boston region. Our lease termination income was a relatively large component of our 2009 portfolio revenue at $17.5 million. We traditionally see substantially lower amounts, and are projecting $4 million for 2010. Overall, and as I touched on a minute ago, we expect our same-store results to be moderately down with GAAP same-store NOI down 1% to 2%, and cash same-store NOI down 3.5% to 4.5%. These ranges exclude the impact of termination income due to the change in its run rate from year-to-year. On a GAAP basis, this is an improvement from our view last quarter owing to our stronger leasing velocity.Straight-line rents for our in-service portfolio will be up from last year, and we project $60 million to $70 million in straight-line rents in 2010. This is up from $46 million last year. The major drivers behind the difference, which is also a key factor in our projected same-store cash NOI decline are the three rent periods contained within the almost 500,000 square feet of leases that we completed at 399 Park Avenue and 601 Lexington Avenue, in addition to the 485,000 square-foot Ropes & Gray at the Prudential Tower that commences this month, but has a 12-month free-rent period to provide time to build out this large space.Our development properties will add an incremental $18 million to $20 million in 2010 with the full year impact of our 2009 pipeline including Democracy Tower, 701 Carnegie Center and Wisconsin Place, which are collectively 96% leased, as well as the delivery this summer of Weston Corporate Center, which is 100% leased to Biogen. At our Atlantic Wharf development, we've received final approval to convert a portion of the residential-leased zone space to office. With the conversion, we have increased the office square footage by 200,000 square feet, with the denominator factor resulting in a decrease in our leasing percentage to 58% although there's no actual change in leasing of the project. We have also increased our budget by $50 million to reflect the tenant improvement and leasing commission costs necessary to lease this space, as well as the cost to build out the residential interior for the 70,000 square feet of remaining residential space. The conversion is not expected to materially change our overall return expectations for the project.We expect our joint ventures to contribute $130 million to $140 million to our FFO in 2010. The overall contribution is down from 2009 due to the burn off of $15 million of non-cash FASB 141  income. Our 2010 JV contribution is better than we discussed last quarter, due to the leasing we have competed at the GM building combined with additional activity we are seeing in Washington, D.C. Our hotel is showing signs of stabilizing, but we are still projecting it to be down by roughly $1 million to a projected contribution of approximately $6 million to $6.5 million in 2010. Our development and management services fee income is projected to also be lower than in 2009, with the roll off of several large development projects, including the completion of 20 F Street in the first quarter and Wisconsin Place in mid-2009. We are in approximately $7.5 million on these projects in 2009 that will not recur in 2010. We have had some success in obtaining this additional fee work but not at a scale that will approach our activity in 2009. We're currently projecting $24 million to $27 million in fee income for 2010.Our G&A expense is projected to be $81 million to $83 million. This is up from 2009, primarily due to $4.5 million of incremental investing of non-cash stock compensation. Also impacting our G&A is a significant reduction in our capitalized wages, down 22% or $2.5 million. For 2010, we continue to have $5 million in non-cash expense related to our OPP plan. Our net interest expense is expected to be $355 million to $365 million consistent with our prior guidance. This is $46 million higher than 2009 due to the incremental expense associated with our October bond offering I mentioned earlier, and a reduction in capitalized interest associated with the suspension of 250 West 55th Street. These negative items are offset by slightly higher interest income on our cash balances. The additional capitalized interest associated with projected spending at Atlantic Wharf, 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue and Weston Corporate Center and the $80 million in debt repayment that I discussed earlier. As detailed in our press release, we have reached a settlement agreement of the lease termination related to our 250 West 55th Street project. We have accrued $20 million for this cost in the second quarter of 2009 and have now settled for $12.8  million. We will recognize this previously unbudgeted $7.2 million difference as FFO in the first quarter on 2010. Taking all of these assumptions into account, results in our increasing our full year 2010 FFO guidance range to $4.10 to $4.25 per share. For the first quarter, we project Funds From Operations of $1.02 to $1.04 per share. Our first quarter FFO was positively impacted by the $7.2 million non-recurring lease termination settlement at 250 West 55th Street. This is offset by a similarly sized one-time increase to our G&A that relates to the acceleration of vesting of long-term compensation associated with the passing of Ed. Our first quarter FFO run rate is lower than last quarter due to the seasonality of our hotel, which is down $0.02 per share, and the additional two months this quarter where we are not capitalizing interest on 250 West 55th Street equating to a $0.03 per share reduction.Overall, we're pleased with the improvement in our leasing velocity, although we still have a long way to go to reach a landlord-friendly leasing environment. Despite one of the most challenging economic periods with widespread market weakness and rental rate declines, we are able to project a stable portfolio NOI for 2010, net of the changes in termination income and non-cash FASB 141 amortization. Not only does this point to the quality of our assets, our team and the length of our lease terms, but it's due to the quality of our leasing and property management teams, we have aggressively achieved positive leasing in New York City and maintained our occupancy levels in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. We also have the benefit of our development pipeline that is consistently delivered well leased, strong-yielding projects, such as Weston Corporate Center, which delivers this summer in our Boston region providing a double-digit unleveraged return with no leasing risk.As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, we continue to hold $1.4 billion invested in short-term cash investments that is dilutive to our earnings. The incremental FFO that we can achieve if we're successful investing this capital into income-producing real estate can be substantial and have a meaningful impact on earnings.  That's all of our prepared remarks. So I believe we're ready to open up the lines for questions."

So that's sort of big picture how we're thinking about it. We also look at, if we're putting our money in at a rate of return where would we beyond a basis when the building is ""fully stabilized"" and how do we feel about that basis relative to where market rents are and where market rents might be going for a reasonable period of time because you may feel more comfortable in the market where you think there is a lot of opportunity for growth to be at a higher relative basis, which will allow you to have a higher cost of capital imputed in that.

As I've said in the past, Jordan, the issue with think is going to -- the rubber is going to meet the road when capitals in fact required to be invested in these buildings because the lenders are not going to invest capital unless they know they have an ownership interest. And the equity owner is not going to invest capital unless they have done a workout with the lender to at least perfect [ph] a priority for any additional capital that's put into the asset. And guess what? Tenents aren't going to wait around. And so there is a natural evolution of chains that is going to have to occur.

We don't think that there are opportunities to put money to work at 18% leverage returns. We don't see it. There's too much capital out there and we just haven't -- you can't put enough leverage on the asset to provide yourself with a large-enough spread on whatever you think the overall return on a cash-on-cash basis is going to be to get yourself out there. So anybody who has that type of an expectation, in our mind, is looking at very tertiary type of real estate and  tertiary types of product. They're not looking at high-quality CBD buildings in Washington DC, San Francisco, New York City and Boston. I mean, that's just not where they look, those things don't seem to go together, at least in our opinion. To date, the capital that is interested in pursuing those types of assets I think is trying to find an asset or two to bid on in which to determine whether or not they're prepared to make the investment, and there just hasn't been any product of any consequence in the market to sort of really determine where those numbers are going to come out. I think, as I've said before, my view is that if a high-quality well-leased New York City office building were on the market and the leases were at current market terms or modestly above that, that somebody would be prepared to pay a going-on and going-in basis, a return that is probably close to 6% and maybe even lower. I guess that's the sense that we get from the conversations that we're having with the people who come and talk to us about wanting to make investments in those types of assets in a market like New York City. Unfortunately, there hasn't been  any evidence because there hasn't been any products to sell. And on a risk-adjusted basis for property where there's a lot of operating risk, I don't think that same capital is interested in it because I don't think it has either the patience or the stomach for the risk associated with it."

I think if a deal gets done at the types of economics that we're at hearing about, and I'm not going to talk about with someone else, have somebody else chooses the lease space. I think there will be a surprise at the level of those economics. In terms of it being higher than people might have anticipated. And I think that speaks to the lack of available large blocks of space with the ability to grow in Midtown Manhattan. And I think that in itself, it pretense well for 250 West 55th Street. The one thing that I would caution is that the size of the tenancy has dramatically changed, at least from what we've heard, in terms of how large that lease rates. And so the size at which a large user really does have to think seriously about new product is probably is smaller than you might have imagined. It's not 600,00 square feet, it's probably 350,000 square feet of space because those blocks are very, very hard to come by. But for our purposes at 250 West 55th Street, starting 1 million square feet building, with that guided 50,000 square feet tenancy, I think would be hard for us because you have to lease the other 650,000 square feet of space. And knowing how long it's good to take a lease that space and at what economic terms, is going to determine whether or not we're comfortable starting that building at whatever those high rates might be and I'm not sure at the moment if it makes incremental sense. But if tenant was large enough, I think it would be something that we would seriously consider."

And free rent is really a more market pointed concession tool.

It used to be eight months and now it's 10 to 12 months. In the other markets, free rent has really not been a major tool that's been used, other than by landlords in the past who have attempted to increase the face rent on a particular property. Because perhaps they might want to sell that property and at some point in the future. And in doing so, increase the cash flows to see where the property and sort of basically recognize that they have a better chance of recapitalizing their asset in terms of evaluation by having a higher face rent, which has obviously a higher potential value. The basic economics for most tenants are really what's are driving things.

On the capital expenditure side, in general on an annual basis, it's somewhere around $30 million annually. It has been a little bit higher than that in a couple of the last few years because we did some pretty big individual capital jobs, for example, we did the entire lobby at the Prudential Tower. We did the new entrants in the lobby at 6/01 Lexington Avenue, both of which cost that to be a little bit higher. The other item is the tenant improvement in the leasing cost associated with the leasing that we plan to do. And we expect our occupancy in 2010 to be relatively static. We have a little over3  million square feet of space that is expiring in 2010. And as Doug mentioned, the tenant improvement in leasing costs that we've been experiencing range from tenant $25 to $30 a foot on that space.

And quite frankly, that means there will be more business formations and more opportunities for modern site tenants to fill our buildings as opposed to large tenants were looking for mega projects in order to sort of rationalize their ability to grow in a market like New York City. So if the Morgan Stanley decides to sell off its private equity businesses, then those private equity businesses are going to go located in other places in the town Manhattan, and they will become tenants as opposed to Morgan Stanley being a tenant, there will be front range or one of the other entities that are currently there. I don't think it signals a decline in the opportunities that tenants are growing in New York City. the deck a little bit and the size of the chairs might be different."

Because I don't believe that there is enough incremental demand to really effectuate any sort of significant change in absorption. And therefore, I think where we are is where we're going to be, that's in the overall market. We may in fact be able to have some pricing power in a particular building, because, I'll give an example, 399 Park Avenue, that they had been part of a new 10000 square feet on the 15th floor and 40,000 square feet on the sixth floor. And I would say that we are being more aggressive with our responses to tenants because we don't have much exposure and the building has really demonstrated that it's a very highly sought-after product. And so we've been able to push rents. I would say for the across Park Avenue, there are still deals being done in a similar price point that you'd feel comfortable where rents are but you don't really see much in a way of significant improvement. And I don't think we're good to see that the strong market and a weaker markets. I just think things are going to continue to sort of decelerate but still head down in a very modest way, because as much as we would like it, there are weaker landlords in various markets and there are people who are taking the perspective that some income is better than no income. They just simply want to cover debt service or if they have and they have no cash flow and they are taking some desperate actions. And those desperate actions unfortunately, do have a psychological impact on the marketplace. And so to the extent that you have a weaker market and they have those types of activities going on, it's hard to negate what those effects are and they tend to have a detrimental impact also on where rents are and where concessions are going. And so we really do start to see serious incremental demand, I think that's going to continue to be the case for the next 12 months."

The economy in general as we all know has been through a very, very difficult patch and the recovery I suspect will be slower than the typical recovery from a different kind of recession, this being a recession that was obviously provoked by a financial crisis that came about as a result of the collapse of the housing market and what it all did to the securitization, the world of securitization and through that the world of finance.
As all of the serious studies of these kinds of recessions that are provoked by a financial crisis indicate recoveries from this kind of recession is longer and slower than the typically recovery from the kinds of recessions we have had since the end of World War II.  I guess that’s one reason why this is going to be called the great recession and let’s just hope it’s just a recession and I still think it will just be a recession.  We are certainly in an area of the economy that has been affected by it in this sense in that a lot of office building activities of the American business world, the corporate life of America has been under the cost controls and concerns about over expansion I think was spread throughout the business economy.  
Nevertheless, I think as I’m sure you’ve heard from us before and probably have heard from other people who are in this world of commercial office space before.  We are in the same markets that we have underscored before, namely supply constraint markets.  Supply constraint for difference reasons, in Washington it’s because of a height limit, in New York because of the lack of available sites, in Boston because of an unbelievably complicated approval process and in Cambridge because there are no sites, etc. was a lot less difficult to deal with and the demand situation has been affected by the fact that there has been a drop in rents and when these buildings, the better buildings become available at somewhat lower prices there are a lot of tenants that say, “Well, I couldn’t afford it before but I can afford it now.”  
I think this is particularly true in our New York activities where we are really in the range of 98% occupancy in terms of either lease space or space that we’re just drawing leases on so we’re in very, very good shape in that market in part because the buildings that we have and if we had more space of that kind I suspect we would continue to do very well with it.  If we could add a couple of hundred thousand square feet to any number of our buildings in New York we could lease that space within a matter of a few months.
In that sense, I think we are fairing quite well.  We are also trying to position ourselves to take advantage of what opportunities we think will be coming down the pike over the next year or 18 months.  Amongst other things, to do this we have been very diligent in terms of trying to take advantage of where we think the financial markets provide very good financing opportunities for us.  As you all may know we raised $700 million several weeks ago on what we thought were very, very good terms, just shy of 11 years of maturity and I think the basic rate was somewhere around 5.6% to 5.5%.
Now, the reason why this is valuable for us is I am sure obvious to all of you but I’ll just repeat it, it does give us the opportunity to be in the market for certain opportunities that will be coming forth.  That gives us a cost of money that makes it possible for us to get some decent leverage or positive leverage when we can finance them at the kinds of yields that we were able to do on a corporate financing.  We really have close to $3 billion in effect in one form or another of available equity to use for activities.  
We hope that we will be able to put a good chunk of that money to work over the next year.  I think this will be advantageous to the company’s growth over the medium term and over the longer term.  So we are I think not in the strongest market we’ve ever been, to put that mildly.  There are certain markets as you will hear from subsequent reports which are not as good as say the New York area or the Washington area but frankly we believe that these markets are steadily firming up.  
One of the things that is going to contribute to that is that there is very, very, very much reduced new supply coming on the market over the next several years.  I would say that the new construction of the kind of office space that is competitive with us has probably dropped at least 80% if not more and I think it will be very difficult for a lot of companies to finance new construction.  I think we are going to be in an improving market as demand slowly, slowly begins to increase relative to the amount of available space and the supply is just going to be virtually non-existent.
So we are fairly comfortable, maybe even modestly optimistic about the next several years and what it will mean for us in terms of occupancy and rentals.  With that, I will turn this over to Doug who will give you a specific report on the company and then we can have a Q and A afterwards when we’ve given you a detailed report on the company.  Thank you all very much for listening.

I think there are clearly signs that there is top line revenue growth across a pretty broad spectrum of the economy and everybody’s commentary, including Mort’s this morning I think, is a much more positive tone.  We are actually seeing some isolated announcements of renewed hiring.
A year ago I think everybody was just keeping everything in check because there were so many job reductions and we had rising unemployment and we were having lots of personal and corporate distress and while I think Mort would clearly say unemployment is still a pretty high number and we still do have this foreclosure issue, but it feels like business sentiment and consumer confidence is really starting to look through these negatives.  While we are not yet seeing any consistent hiring trends from our customers, our tenants, there is clearly a change in psychology and velocity is starting to pick up.
If I bring you back to last year in the first quarter of 2009, Boston Properties completed 250,000 square feet of leasing transactions.  In the first quarter of 2010, we completed over 1.8 million square feet in 71 separate transactions.  730,000 of it was in Washington, 212,000 in Boston, 437,000 in New York City and another 400,000 in San Francisco.  It is by far the most active quarter we’ve had in the last few years and if we even adjust for those one large 500,000 square foot transaction which was really a set of short term extensions with Lockheed Martin Reston, we are still more than 50% greater than our average first quarter activity.
Our second generation leasing statistics felt at least when you looked at them more like 2006 than 2009.  We showed double digit increases in net rents.  Now, I have to say that’s a little bit of an anomaly and it’s largely because of the aggregate numbers are really more a historical representation than an actual representation and I do want to clarify what’s going on there.  
This quarter you have to adjust for three things, one is that the Ropes & Gray lease at the Prudential Center, that’s the replacement of Gillette, that’s 480,000 square feet, that kicks in this quarter.  Remember that was completed in ’07.  We’ve had about 91,000 square feet that we did in 2008 in New York City where a tenant took additional space and again, that clicked in this quarter and then we did a short term deal with Lockheed Martin for a 264,000 square foot, one of the leases of that 500,000 square feet that I referred to a moment ago, and if you exclude those, second generation statistics are pretty similar to where they were last quarter.  We’re down about 9% on a gross basis and about 15% on a net basis which feels right for where we are today.
Even with the headwinds from significant available space in all the markets, we really are seeing velocity continue to build though.  Tenants are more confident, they’re seeing availability of the best space declining and there is clearly growing consensus that overall rental levels have bottomed out and that there really is not much in the way of value in delaying a leasing decision.  It’s time to sort of move on because things are not going to get much lower.  
It doesn’t mean that the lease negotiation leverage has suddenly shifted to the landlords or that we’re even predicting strong rental rate growth and declining concessions but there are a few green shoots in the portfolio.  Let me give you a couple of example of some encouraging signs.  In the Boston suburbs and that includes Cambridge which are dominated by technology, healthcare and biotech life sciences companies we are seeing expansion, actual expansion from tenants such as Shire Pharmaceuticals, Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Google, Microsoft, IrObex, Dassault Systemes, Constant Contact, Lincoln Labs and A123.
Now the optimism has to be tempered by the fact that there’s overall availability in [Center 128] in Cambridge in excess of 20% and there are some tenants that are actually still going to be reducing their headcount because they have reduced jobs over the past several year and they are going to be resizing their facilities.  While we don’t expect the market to make a quick recovery, there is clearly visibility on growth which is something we haven’t really been able to see up to this date.
In New York City which Mort was describing, where again we derive almost 42% of our net operating income, the best space in the best buildings that was in move in conditions is really rapidly shrinking.  Leasing velocity in the first three months was at 94% of the historical levels over the last five years.  The quarterly volume of signed leases in midtown was 3.4 million square feet against a five year average of 3.6 million.  Clearly, the velocity continues at a very strong clip. 
While many of the larger financial institutions are still rationalizing their space needs, the recovery and the changing landscape of the financial services industry has led to the formation or growth of smaller organizations and we are seeing this first hand in our leasing transactions.  We’ve now completed the leasing of all the remaining office space at 399 Park.  We’ve completed two renewal expansions at the General Motors building and availability in that asset is now limited to two 9,000 square foot suites that expire later this year.  We completed 175,000 square foot renewal at 125 W 55th Street and we’re in discussions with tenants on all of the remaining 2012 rollover in that building.
Our overall availability in top buildings in midtown Manhattan which we sort of characterize as about 34 buildings and about 40 million square feet dropped this quarter by 100 basis points and it’s about 12% and our portfolio is just over 96% leased right now at the end of the quarter with existing leasing transactions that are completed, it will be a little bit higher than that at the end of the next quarter.  
Tenants in all of our markets have begun to act on the new level of lease economics and clearly appear much less constrained about investing capital in their premises.  Now, clearly one obstacle to growth we have, and I think this is important to think about, is that in the CBD markets, we do have a predominance of legal industry participants and the legal industry has in fact contracted over the last couple of years and as law firms today look at their premises they do have excess space.
So as law firms renew over the next few years, we expect that there will be an accompanying reduction in the amount of leased area that they take but they will continue to be a very important part of the CBD office markets and their demand will be a driver of rental rate appreciation but we’re going to have to adjust to a smaller base in the short term.  
In DC, the two primary drivers are the law firms and the GSA, the government.  We have clearly begun to see the GSA growth predominately from the financial services side of the government.  The Treasury and SEC are actively hiring and searching for additional office space and the law firms are actually hiring lawyers to staff their government regulatory practice groups which is no surprise.  
The government is actually using recovery money from the last act that was passed by Congress to refurbish buildings and this is actually translating in to additional leasing activity because they’re moving tenants out of GSA buildings in to swing space for the next few years and when the government moves someone in to another building it’s not for six months or nine months, it’s generally for two, to three, to five years at a time.
The short term challenges in the district will continue to be the availability of space in the secondary markets in the North Capital, Southwest and Ballpark Waterfront areas and practically speaking the only tenants for those buildings are the GSA or other government associated users and there is pretty significant availability still, probably close to four million square feet and rents on those buildings are going in the high 30s with CPI escalations and full tenant improvement allowances.  So we expect that is where the GSA is going to focus, it’s not going to focus on the primary locations in the east end in the CBD although certain specific users, for example Treasury who’s going to want to locate their people closer to Treasury’s headquarters and so there may be some additional expansion in the GSA’s use in the east end and the CBD from them.
Our DC portfolio is 98% leased.  We have about 225,000 square feet expiring in 2010 and 2011.  We’ve completed another lease at 2200 Pennsylvania and we have pretty strong interest in the remainder of that space.  Now, I want to mention the 500,000 square foot holder over renewal that we completed with Lockheed Martin.  Lockheed’s contract with NGA is being relocated as part of [BRACK] and we will be getting back these buildings plus another 180,000 square feet in 2010.  
The good news is that we are actively competing for another government user to back fill the space.  We’re also actively working on our 2011 rollover in Reston which totals 445,000 square feet and we’re in lease negotiations with a 180,000 square foot user for a late 2011 lease expiration and active dialog with two other tenants, one about 105,000 square feet and the other 90,000 to take the predominate amount of that square footage that is rolling over.
While the toll road market continues to struggle we are clearly the beneficiary of tenants that are upgrading both their location and the quality of their premises to Reston Town Center.  Highly marketable space in the highest quality buildings has the best chance to be successful in a difficult market and once again we are seeing that loud and clear.  
In San Francisco, leasing activity was pretty modest but tour activity has truly started to pick up in the last few months and we completed another two full floor transactions.  In the Peninsula and Silicon Valley, those are tough, tough markets still.  Genentech has continued to expand in our Gateway project in South San Francisco and our occupancy there has reached 87%.  Unfortunately, in the Silicon Valley, Lockheed Martin renewed on only half, 270,000 square feet of our Zanker Road Business Park in north San Jose so we are going to be stuck with about 270,000 square feet of additional vacancy there.  The good news is the rents in those buildings are about $1 a square foot per month to the economic impact is not terribly significant.  
Leasing activity is picking up in the Valley, but again remember there is a lot of availability, there’s just that overhang that is in the market.  It’s probably 15 million square feet of Class A space, a lot of it which was developed and delivered in 2009 that is remaining vacant.  So, it’s going to be challenging for a while but we are seeing again additional demand.  Google and Intel have both announced hiring objectives and we are seeing expansion from some of our smaller start up tenants that occupy our Mountain View Research Park.
Overall, our mark-to-market as you probably would expect remains negative.  It’s actually improved slightly, about 5% from last quarter, down to $1.65 from $1.74 and remember that the rents we are providing are starting rents so there’s always an increase during the term but those aren’t reflected in the mark-to-market.  We actually have raised our rents modestly in New York City over the past few months in concert with what we’re talking about in terms of the demand there and it’s literally largely due to the fact that we just don’t  have any meaningful inventory.
In New York City, our gross rents ranged from the  high 60s to the high 80s with the exception of 2 Grand Central where they start a little bit lower, in the low 50s and at the General Motors Building where rents start in the low 90s now and probably reach over $140 a square foot.  The rents in the rest of our market really remain pretty stable.  In 2010 the average expiring office rent is about $42.75, it’s about 9% higher than the overall market and in ’11 it’s $49.14, about 14% higher.  Again, we’ve talked about this in the past, we have a lot of rollover of very high rents in the [inaudible] that are impacting our 2011 numbers.  
The highlights in our press release this quarter were clearly dominated by capital raising activity.  While it’s certainly possible that interest rates and credit spreads may continue to tighten, we’ve looked at the absolute level of borrowing costs and the potential dilution that comes from holding large capital balances and made the judgment that it was an appropriate time to borrow.   We have opportunistically repaid or purchased a portion of our near term maturities and we might continue to consider these activities as well.
But, as we look forward we believe the environment to create value through acquisitions is improving.  In the last 60 days the transactional opportunities have clearly started to accelerate.  We’ve seen broadly marketed fee interest in some CBD office buildings in San Francisco, 303 2nd Avenue and 333 Market and in New York City with 600 Lex, 340 Madison and 125 Park and potentially controlling debt positions that are actively being marketed at One Federal Street in Boston and 885 3rd Avenue in New York City.  
The point is that the financial institutions that hold controlling debt in many instances are recovering.  Debt and equity capital is very available and the various participants in these over leveraged real estate assets and portfolios are beginning to push for resolutions.  The participants in the capital stack are getting more realistic about the current level of lease economics, tenant demand and the significant capital necessary to operate office properties.  At the same time, potential buyers are getting more aggressive about expectations for a recovery, there is a meeting of the mind that is starting to come through.
In some cases, we are actually seeing things slowly but surely making their way down the capital stacks through the various tranches with each successive participant passing on the opportunity to invest additional capital.  In other cases borrowers are seeking to make interest payments, pushing assets in to special servicing and in other situations lenders are simply saying, “We’re done.  We’re moving on.  Let’s just throw this out as a discounted debt sale.”  In the more complicated transactions, the one constant, and this is important for us is that the potential deterioration in the value of the assets over time continues.
Without capital tenants are making decisions to move on or in the best case being offered a discounted rental agreement in exchange for foregoing those capital improvements.  Any capital expenditures on the base building side, other than emergency repairs are being deferred.  Tenant brokers are advising clients of the issues surrounding the ownership of these assets which is affecting demand so the tenants and the buildings which have challenged capital situations are in fact feeling the impact of that environment.
During the last cycle of appreciation, investors were able to make money through cap rate compression and rapidly rising rental rate expectations.  We believe we are in an era in the office building business where investors are going to have to operate, not trade assets.  Identifying the opportunities and challenges inherent in the individual assets and developing the right plan to position them in the marketplace including making speculative capital investments and then executing is going to be challenging and it’s going to be management intensive.  
While the plethora of capital available today may reduce the potential returns we can earn, we are optimistic that Boston Properties is going to be able to use its operational and its financial strength to create a lot of value for our shareholders as we move forward.  With that, I’m going t turn it over to Mike to talk about the results for the quarter.

As you can see from our press release we had a productive couple of months in the debt markets.  We successful closed three major secured financings on our joint venture properties including a $207 million loan at 125 W 55th, $180 million loan at 2 Grand Central Tower and $175 million loan on Metropolitan Square.  As we look back on how we expected these financings to go earlier this year, it’s clear how far the secured markets have progressed.
Last summer we anticipated that these loans would have been sized at only 75% of what we ultimately achieved and at rates between 7% and 8%.  Today, we were able to place reasonable leverage with secured financings at debt yields of 10% to 11% and pricing on new 10 year loans in the high 5% range.  The life insurance companies and banks are offering very aggressive pricing for high quality buildings and in addition the CMBS originators are in the market offering slightly higher leverage and pricing although we haven’t seen evidence that they have actually originated a material amount of new loans yet.
We have covered the majority of our 2010 debt maturities and expect to pay off a couple of smaller loans due later this year at maturity.  One in Cambridge in a portfolio within Carnegie Center in Princeton which combined totals $80 million.  We’re also preparing to enter the market to refinance our Market Square North joint venture mortgage that matures in December and are still evaluating our low floating rate bank loans on our Reston development and on Annapolis Junction, each of which has an extension option.  
Our billion line of credit expires in August and we anticipate exercising a one year extension moving its maturity to August of 2011.  We’re also looking at our medium term debt maturities and to date we’ve repurchased approximately $150 million of our exchangeable debt that is redeemable in 2012 at slight discounts to par.  
As Mort mentioned, we accessed the unsecured bond market this month with the successful $700 million debt issuance for 10.5 years at an effective yield of 5.64%.  As you will see in our guidance, this capital in addition to the cash we raised last October will be dilutive to our earnings in the short term until it is deployed.  We believe taking advantage of the current low interest rate environment and positioning our balance sheet with a long term low cost debt capital will benefit us over the next couple of years.
Last week we announced the institution of an aftermarket equity program of $400 million.  Given our cash position of nearly $1.8 billion today, we have no immediate plan to use this program.  However, it could be a useful tool to raise moderate amounts of equity in a price efficient manner down the road.  
Now, I want to talk about our first quarter earnings performance.  We announced first quarter funds from operation of $1.07 per share.  This exceeded our guidance by $0.04 per share or approximately $6.5 million at our guidance midpoint and would have been even greater if not for the impact of a $2.2 million, $0.015 per share charge associated with our debt buyback activity.  The performance of our portfolio beat our expectations by approximately $3.5 million, about $1.5 million of this was on the expense side as we continue to aggressive purse expense savings. 
Portfolio revenue was modestly higher due to stronger percentage rent from 2009 sales at the Prudential Center and a variety of leasing successes throughout the portfolio plus some holdover rent from a vacating tenant in Boston.  Our hotel continues to earn market share with occupancy up 8.5% compared to the same period last year and exceeded its budget by $400,000.  Unfortunately room rates remain stagnant at recession period levels so RevPAR is not improving significantly.  
Our joint venture properties outperformed by about $1.4 million, the result of expense savings, higher work order income and approximately $800,000 of unbudgeted termination income.  The termination fees primarily related to two tenants, one in the GM building and one at 540 Madison where in both cases we have re leased the space.  We generated fee income of approximately $2 million in excess of our budget, the largest piece coming from our joint venture portfolio where we completed an early renewal of 175,000 square foot tenant at the base of 125 W 55th Street and earned a significant leasing commission.
We also generated 400,000 in cost savings at our 20 F Street development job in Washington DC and the remaining outperformance is from work order income and incentive management fees in New York City.  We had interest expense savings of $1.3 million in the quarter, this is due to the combination of lower than projected LIBOR rates on our floating rate debt, our use of cash in lieu of funding our construction loans at Atlantic Wharf and Wisconsin Place and the impact of the smaller principle balance outstanding on our exchangeable notes given our debt buybacks. 
Offsetting a portion of the positive performance is a $2.2 million non-cash charge associated with the buyback of $53 million of our exchangeable debt during the quarter.  At inception the debt was bifurcated in to a debt and equity component pursuant to GAAP based upon market conditions at issuance.  Upon early retirement, GAAP requires us to allocate the purchase price based on current market conditions and given the relative near term maturity and an exchange price of $142 per share, the security is deemed to have no equity value today so we’ve allocated the purchase price solely to the debt component with the debt on our books at below its par value at roughly $0.95, we ended up taking a non-cash GAAP loss.
Just a couple of other items I want to cover for the quarter.  At our 250 W 55th Street site we completed all of the remaining work for the suspension of development and this quarter we expensed $350,000 of suspension costs.  We anticipate future expenses for taxes, insurance and securities at this site of approximately $2 million a year.  In addition, and as we disclosed in our press release, we settled a lease termination obligation related to the project for $12.8 million.  We have previously recorded an obligation of $20 million so this resulted in a $7.2 million positive adjustment this quarter.  This was included in our prior guidance and is not a variance.
Also, you will see our G&A is higher than in prior quarters due to the onetime acceleration of vesting of the long term compensation for [Ed Linde].  This cost was also budgeted in our prior guidance and going forward the run rate will be lower as I will discuss in a minute.  I do want to go through our FAD for the quarter because it has been significantly impacted by the strengthen of our leasing activity.  This quarter we have over two million square feet of leases commencing, more than double our normal activity and due to the location and length of the lease terms, our transaction costs are higher than typical.  
The cost per lease year of $4.27 per square foot, is actually lower than our 2009 average so the lease term length is really the driver.  Some key examples include the 480,000 square foot lease with Ropes & Gray at the Prudential Tower.  This is a 20 year lease for virtually all of the space that had been leased to Gillette since the building was built thus requiring an relatively high TI work letter.  Also, we have over 400,000 square feet of leases in New York City including two leases totaling 210,000 square feet at 601 Lex and a 15 year 175,000 square foot lease at 125 W 55th.   With tenant improvement costs running $40 to $60 per square foot and leasing commissions for 10 to 15 year leases of $35 to $45 per square foot in New York City, these deals meaningful impact our reported lease transaction costs for the quarter.
If you strip these four deals out of the statistics, the average transaction costs for the remaining 1.1 million square feet of leasing was only $25.75 per square foot, more in line with our historical average.  Our straight line rent also affects our FAD and is higher than normal due to many of the same leases plus the other new leasing that we did in the third and fourth quarter of 2009 at 399 Park.  As we’ve mentioned before, the Ropes & Gray lease has a 12 month free rent period to complete the build out of the space and is going to impact our straight line rent for all of 2010.  The free rent on the other deals starts to burn off in the second half of the year.  
Turning to our projections for 2010, the biggest change to our previously provided guidance will be the near term dilution associated with our bond offering this month.  The interest cost of this debt net of anticipated interest earnings is projected to be approximately $0.16 per share in 2010.  We’re not assuming any new acquisitions in our projections for the year so this cash is assumed to remain dilutive for the full year.
In the same store portfolio, we anticipate flat to moderate decline in year-over-year GAAP NOI with the negative mark-to-market that Doug discussed.  We’ve had some terrific leasing successes in the past six months and our occupancy climbed nominally this quarter.  Though much of that leasing was projected and we continue to anticipate occupancy for the rest of the year averaging in the 92% area.  
In New York City in particular we have increased occupancy by nearly 100 basis points this quarter.  At quarter end we had just over 300,000 square feet of vacancy and another 350,000 square feet of space expiring later this year.  We expect positive absorption for the remainder of the year in 601 Lex and at 399 Park Avenue where as Doug mentioned, we have recently signed an additional lease bringing to near full occupancy.  
However, in our joint venture portfolio we have the GSA rolling out of 80,000 square feet at 2 Grand Central Tower which will mute our absorption for the region.  In Washington we expect occupancy to remain relatively stable this year as nearly all of our million square feet of 2010 expires are projected to renew.  In San Francisco Embarcadero Center has about 300,000 square feet of current vacancy and 140,000 square feet of leases expiring this year.  As Doug mentioned, San Francisco has showed an uptick in activity but overall leasing velocity remains slow and competition is tough. We’re projecting our occupancy at Embarcadero Center to remain in the 90% area throughout the year.
In our suburban portfolio the only significant new exposure we have is Zanker Road Business Park in San Jose where we signed an extension with the existing tenant for 270,000 square feet this quarter but have an additional 270,000 square feet expiring on December 31, 2010.  This space is leased in the mid teens per square foot so its impact on the bottom line is less and it has no affect on 2010.
Our largest leasing exposure is in Boston with 900,000 square feet of vacancy and nearly 600,000 square feet of leases expiring this year. This 1.5 million square feet is comprised of 200,000 square feet at the Prudential Center, 275,000 square feet in Cambridge and just over one million square feet in the suburbs.   We are seeing a pickup in activity in both the suburban and Cambridge markets as Doug detailed and much of our space is very high quality.  
However, excluding our fully leased new development in Weston that comes on line midyear, we still expect to lose between 250 and 350 basis points of occupancy in 2010.  With this backdrop, we expect our 2010 GAAP same store NOI to be approximately 100 basis points above our prior estimates at flat to down 1% from 2009 and -3% to -4% on a cash basis.  Again, our cash NOI is impacted by the free rent associated with the Ropes & Grays lease and the new leases in New York City.
Taking a look at our quarter-over-quarter projections for the remainder of 2010, the first quarter NOI after adjusting for one million of non-recurring items is a good run rate for the remainder of the year with growth of zero to 1%.  We’ve excluded termination income from our same store comparison as in 2009 we had an unusually large $17.5 million of termination income.  We’re projecting $3.2 million in termination income for the rest of the year and that includes $1.2 million of fees already received in the second quarter from a small retail tenant in New York City where we have already got another tenant committed for the space.
We’re projecting straight line rents of $75 to $80 million for the full year.  This is up from last quarter due to the new leases signed in New York.  Additionally, we signed an amendment of a lease with 180,000 square foot government related tenant in Reston Virginia that triggered a restoration payment provision in the lease increasing our straight line rent by $3.5 million per year through the lease expiration in May 2012.  This is part of the 700,000 square foot three building complex that Doug mentioned where we expect the tenant to vacate in 2012.
We will deliver our Weston Corporate Center this summer.  The project is 100% leased to Biogen for its corporate headquarters and we expect it to have roughly a 10% unleveraged GAAP NOI return.  We should also benefit from the full year impact of our 2009 development deliveries which are virtually fully leased.  This includes our 120,000 square foot Princeton University build to suit, our Democracy Tower project in Reston Town Center which is 100% leased and our Wisconsin Place Building in Chevy Chase Maryland, now 96% leased with the signing of another 16,000 square feet this month.  In total our development is projected to add an incremental $18 to $20 million to our 2010 NOI.   
We expect the contributions to FFO from joint ventures to be slightly better than our guidance last quarter at $135 to $140 million in 2010.  It’s important to note that our first quarter results contain over $4 million of non-cash FASB 141 income that has now burned off.  Our hotel has exceeded its budget the last couple of quarters due to occupancy improvements but we continue to be conservative regarding the prospects for any near term meaningful turnaround.  We’re projecting the hotel’s contribution to FFO to be approximately $6 to $6.5 million in 2010.  
Development and services fee income is expected to be $25 to $30 million up from last quarter due to the out performance in the first quarter and we have no change in our G&A projections for 2010 and expect the full year G&A to be approximately $81 to $83 million.  Our net interest expense projections is impacted by the interest expense from our bond offering this month net of interest earned on our increased cash balances.  
Offsetting this is the reduced interest expense owning to our bond buyback activity.  In the first and second quarters we repurchased approximately $150 million of debt that was incurring a GAAP interest expense of 5.6%.  We now expect net interest expense of between $380 and $390 million for 2010 an increase of approximately $25 million from last quarter.  This number includes the non-cash charges of $2.2 million and $4.7 million in the first and second quarters related to our buy back activity.  Our projections do not assume any additional debt repurchases in 2010.
Combining all of these assumptions results in a revised 2010 guidance range for our funds from operations of $4.06 to $4.16 per share.  Our recent capital markets activities have a short term dilutive impact on our earnings guidance.  Stripping our all of the projected net interest expense changes from our new debt offering and the repurchases, we’re actually increasing our range by about $0.13 per share at the low end reflecting the improvement in our operating portfolio projections. 
For the second quarter we are projecting funds from operation of $0.97 to $0.99 per share.  As I mentioned our second quarter guidance includes a $0.03 per share or $4.7 million non-cash charge on our debt repurchases, a partial quarter of interest expense associated with our recent bond offering and lower contribution from our joint ventures with the burn off of non-cash FASB 141 [inaudible].
Overall, our portfolio continues to perform well in the current environment.  Our occupancy is stable and as evidenced by the 1.8 million square feet of leases we signed in the quarter, our portfolio is attracting its share of the available tenant demand.  The success of our development program continues to be a difference maker enabling us to demonstrate modestly positive portfolio NOI growth year-over-year despite the difficult fundamentals in the leasing markets.  
In early 2011 we expect to deliver both our Atlantic Wharf and 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue developments representing nearly $1 billion of invested capital.  Our balance sheet is in terrific shape with $1.8 billion of cash and we’re poised to make smart investments.  Until we invest however, our cash will be dilutive and its currently costing us roughly $0.60 per share annually.  We believe the short term cost of holding this capital is well worth the benefits it can deliver over the longer term.
That completes our formal remarks so operator you may open the line up for questions.

The upper end of the market, the higher quality space we believe will do a lot better.  I mean, just look in New York, there’s no space available in our buildings and as we now go in to further renewals or whatever limited space we have left, we’re continuing to step up the rents.
Now, this will reflect itself even more strongly I believe when there is a stronger economic recovery.  So I think in terms of making acquisitions we are still comfortable with taking a longer term view and we do believe that three, four, five years out we’re going to be very happy that we had the cash today to buy the kind of high quality assets or invest in the type of high quality assets that has been our basic strategic space since we started the business.
We’re really as always frankly, really looking to a longer term perspective in the types of investments or developments that we will undertake and we still think that those kinds of developments will do well.  It may not do extremely well in the shorter term but in the medium term and the longer term we think they’ll do very well.  So, that’s still our basic sort of analytic structure as we look at investments and whether they be acquisitions or developments.  
We do think that yes, there is capital but as Doug pointed out there’s a combination that is needed.  It’s not just capital, it’s also operational ability and here is where we think we have a competitive advantage in terms of understanding what we can and what we cannot do.  So, we obviously are at this point modestly bullish.  I don’t want to over state anything until we can actually announcement some things.  But, I do think we are modestly bullish about what we can do with the additional capital.  
Again, we’re not trying to pretend that this is going to have a huge uptick from day one although we will have the uptick in the sense of the alternative investment of capital.  We’re clearly going to do better than what we’re currently able to invest the capital in so we’ll have that short term benefit.  But, in terms of the longer term investment on the assets that we either buy or begin to develop, we think that will work out very well for us.

As many times is the case they’re a little bit behind schedule and have to extend the leases to maintain occupancy in our core buildings out there and we were the core beneficiary of a very nice hold over.  However, they are looking to relocate down to Springfield.  That will free upwards of 700,000 square feet and Reston and we are already in an intensely competitive process right now to try and secure another defense contracting government agency to backfill the 520,000 square feet which is the core of the campus.
We think that is extremely important besides the obvious of replacing the income.  We also are restoring another major demand generator to that Dulles corridor.  So we’re going after it aggressively, we’re very optimistic of success but obviously there’s no guarantees.  If they take the 520,000 the remaining 180,000 which is a brand new fully compatible building relative to defense and intelligent standards, will be available for either additional government leasing or private sector camp followers wishing to be right next to that agency.
But, more importantly, we’ve also taken a very aggressive position down in Springfield where the NGA is going.  We have, as you may remember, secured a campus of upwards of one million square feet atop the Springfield metro.  Not only does it have metro but hard rail access down to Quantico.  It’s got direct access to the pentagon via public transportation and is the closest owned major office campus to the new NGA facility.  
In addition to that we have our [VI95] Park which we’ve owned for nearly 30 years where we have upwards of 800,000 square feet of very competitive space that is literally within walking distance of the NGA campus.  So we think while we’re facing a short term challenge to backfill the NGA campus in Reston that our barter strategy is really fully formed and in place to be very response to this changing situation.

I do think it’s going to have some effect in terms of the kind of leverage in particular that has been available for a number of these funds, particularly for the library large hedge funds.  I don’t really think it’s going to effect - if this doesn’t get in to a very nasty political fight, what has been going on and I’ve been very critical of this publically on television and in writing, it is an attempt really to demigod the financial industry as far as I am concerned and make it look as if it is the financial world that is responsible for the great recession that we are in.  That is just unfair. 
The financial world is responding primarily to the collapse of the housing market and what that meant for the securitization market.  There were some excesses in terms of lending without question and maybe in terms of investing but it was fundamentally these programs that were initiated I might add, by the Congress in mandating Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac and the FHA to really do a lot of things that I think they would regret and frankly a lot of banks made a lot of credit card lines available that have been cut back dramatically.
So we are in a transition period in that regard.  I expect again in the short run it’s going to have some affect.  But, I’ll say this about New York and I said it after 9/11 and I said it many times before, the great strength of New York is that it has the most talented people of world of finance working here.  I don’t mean this to disparage anybody in any other city but if you want to take it not just pound for pound but just in terms of both quantity and quality, this is a city that attracts talent because it nourishes talent, welcomes talent, celebrates talent and rewards talent and that’s the key to the future of these businesses.
You can get the most talented people in so many different industries.  I mean I was just at a conference that involved 50 or 60 CEOs from major Chinese businesses.  This is their first destination and it’s not just finance, it’s finance related businesses and other businesses so I do think that frankly whatever the short term bump may be, and it will be something, I don’t know how serious it will be but it will be something, I do think that New York’s major assets really are vested in the people that these kinds of firms can hire when they have their offices there in New York.
Of all the markets we are in I have to say I think we have seen how well New York City has performed and I think it’s going to continue to perform very, very well over the intermediate term and certainly over the long term.  As I said, the one thing that is remarkable at New York at this stage of the game is there is virtually no new construction going on with any kind of available space.  This has been typical of the kind of roller coaster issues of supply and demand but it’s also typical of a market that is really constrained in terms of the availability of sites.  So, I find myself feeling quite bullish about New York and I do think that New York therefore will frankly do as well as any other market over any kind of reasonable length of time in the real estate business.

There have been no decisions made about that but I will tell you this, we have a unique structure, this is $3 trillion development.  At this stage of the game nobody - it is going to be the dominate building downtown both for the city but particularly for international tenants.  We will have a very, very limited investment that will be less than 5% of that total cost, less than 4% of that total cost in fact and it will be in a preferred position.  
Frankly, there are some projects you do not just to maximize the financial return but also to establish another layer of the creditability of this firm.  We will be very happy to do that transaction under the circumstances that we have proposed to the various public authorities.  It is not an accident that four of the major firms in this city entered in to that competition.  I can understand why they’re doing it and I can certainly understand why we are doing.  Again, because of confidentiality I really can’t talk too much about it but I think we will all be very comfortable all of the different elements that go in to being involved in a transaction like that.
What I don’t want you to come away with is a feeling that we’re treating this as a normal development, we are not and nobody can.  It is a project of an incredible cost and will be an incredible icon for the city of New York.  But, the vast, vast bulk of all of the funding and financing is going to be put up by the public authorities.

You want to talk about",843,"Let me just deal with the first reference, I must  say this situation in Greece is really critical for Europe in a sense because it leeches in to the banking system since the European bank holds so much of the Greek sovereign debt. You want to talk about a too big to fail situation, in a way they are too big to fail, too small as a country and too big as debtor to fail.  
I do think sooner or later they’re going to work something out that is a standoff between Germany and the countries it represents and the Greek government which of course doesn’t want to introduce the kind of tax increases or cost of government reductions in various government programs.  They’ve got to work something out and they both know it and they’re playing chicken at this stage of the game and I just hope nobody plays that game for that one step too late and I doubt if they will because it is just impossible to let this whole thing to go under.  It would be terrible for Greece and terrible for Europe and they both know it.  
But, it would have international consequences, there’s no doubt about that.  I think it’s a scary situation.  As far as we concerned here in this country I really do not think that we are going to - let me put it this way, I don’t think there are any inflationary pressures in this economy and there will not be inflationary pressures of anything significant for several years to come.  Therefore, I think the feds have no choice but to be very careful about what they do with interest rates. 
Nobody quite knows what’s going to happen going forward.  I mean we’ve been, and I am happy to say we were much more pessimistic than most people several years ago and acted on it and we are still if not pessimistic cautious and the reason for that is fairly simple.  We are in an unprecedented situation and it being unprecedented, it is unpredictable.  Everybody can make different judgments about how it’s going to go, we’ve taken a more cautious view of it and I’m frankly very happy that we did.
I will also tell you that I think we have done better than one would have thought even given how serious the recession was.  But, I will remind you that the Queen of England when this whole thing exploded addressed a group of economists gathered by the Economist Magazine and famously said to them, “How come none of you saw this was coming?”  Well, the reason why most of them did not was it is unprecedented and therefore unpredictable and as we work through it, it is still unpredictable.
There are still a lot of problems.  There could be another serious drop in housing prices.  State and local governments are under terrible, terrible pressures financial and fiscal pressures and there’s going to be a continuing erosion of employment in that sector.  There is I think a large drop in investment spending, capital spending overall though in some sectors it is beginning to show some form of life.  You could go through a whole list of things where you could say they could go in either direction.  
I am worried about the fact that a lot of companies have realized that they can operate quite successfully with fewer employees and to my great dismay, with less advertising.  This is something that is going to come back but it is going to come back quite slowly.  I do think though that we are on a positive trend now.  I do think it’s not just that we avoided thanks frankly to Ben Bernanke, rather than to the government’s stimulus program although that helped, we avoided a major financial crisis.
I think we’re pretty much beyond that concern although there are still a lot of issues that still have to be resolved that is going to keep the financial world in a fairly cautious posture.  But, having said that I still think we are now on a positive uptrend.  I may not be as bullish as others but I still think it’s positive and frankly, I’m open so I do think interest rates are going to stay fairly low for quite a period of time.  They are certainly going to be low by historical standards.  They may be up a little bit from where they are now but I still think those are very, very attractive financial markets for people like us who are borrowers.
I think the more difficult thing is in this kind of economy is as we estimate it is are we going to be able to find the kind of investments that make this kid of funding appropriate.  We think we will have a competitive advantage, not an overwhelming one but a good enough so that we’ll be able to do fairly well with it given the level of interest rates that we think we are looking at and looking forward to.

We are certainly being marketed by multiple different banks who have started up programs.  The debt yields that they have been talking about have moved pretty quickly.  Now, I would say the debt yields in the overall market have moved pretty quickly as well and I think they believe that they’re competitive advantage seems to be that they’ll provide 75% leverage where the traditional whole loan lenders are still kind of holding on to a little bit lower leverage than that.
They’re trying to get a little bit more rate.  They’re out there marketing these programs.  I think one of the institutions has made some loans.  Another institution that we spoke with said they had a significant number of applications that they had signed but they hadn’t made any loans yet but, all of them are all out there marketing clearly.  Where size was a constraint before, I would say size is less of a constraint now.  Six months ago when we first started talking about the CMBS market coming back it was they’ll do $50 to $75 million loans really looking for a lot of diversity.
Now, they’re asking us if they can bid on our Market Square North financing that we’re coming out with for example.  They seem to be willing to size loans that are in $150, $200 , $250 million maybe even higher.  So I think it’s improved pretty significantly from that point.

A lot of that is renewals as we talked about and I mentioned the DC market where we have almost a million square feet of renewals coming.  I think that our transaction costs associated with that two million square feet of leasing is going to be significantly less than our transaction costs were in the first quarter.  
So, I would expect to be more in line with kind of what our typical is which is $25 to $30 a foot on that space for TI costs.  Then, for kind of traditional cap ex and maintenance cap ex, we also had a pretty low first quarter where we only I think had $1 million or so of cap ex.  That was really related to two things, one we came off some pretty big jobs last year like the 601 Lex lobby and we haven’t really started some of the 2010 jobs yet and we still expect somewhere between $25 and $30 million of that type of cap ex for the year.

Economic sense means rental rates get to a point where they justify new construction and starting with a project where you have to buy land from somebody and then build a building the question is whether or not those lines will cross sooner rather than later.  If you said predict where you would start a building which might have some speculative leasing associated with it, there are clearly three places where that could happen in my mind.  New York City is obviously one of them.  
The second would be the District of Columbia, not in 2010 or 2011 but in 2013 or 2014 because there is literally nothing of quality being built right now and as buildings in DC are limited by their size, as tenants have to grow and look overall at their footprints out three or four years, they’re going to run out of options to have big continuous blocks of space so I think there’s an opportunity potentially there and we happen to have this building which we purchased from NPR which is a development site that we’re going to start drawing probably sometime later this year or next year so that we’re in a position to accommodate those tenants. 
Then, there’s an interesting phenomena going on in some of our suburban markets and particularly Boston where there are tenants who are looking at the available inventory and are saying, “The stuff that is out there is not the stuff that we really want and we may be willing to pay a premium to go in to a new building that is constructed with more of an amenity base, a better floor plan, a better window line, with better materials that may have a more energy efficient sustainable quality to it.”
Those are sort of I would say the three areas where I would say there is a chance for a building to be built other than the built to suit in a Princeton or northern Virginia when the GSA or some corporate user comes along and says, “We want a building for ourselves.”

368278,109469706,70036,"Boston Properties Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-28-2010",2010-07-28,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everybody. We are happy to be able to rejoin you this quarter for number of reasons, not the least of which is that, we have frankly been really pleased by the response to the real estate we have and in the markets that we are in. Obviously,",507,"Good morning, everybody. We are happy to be able to rejoin you this quarter for number of reasons, not the least of which is that, we have frankly been really pleased by the response to the real estate we have and in the markets that we are in. Obviously, it’s been a stressful time for the economy in general. There is very little progress on the unemployment front. There is lot insecurity in the business community.
Nevertheless, I think we are pleased with the ability that we’ve had in the space that we have to continue a fairly successful leasing program, and frankly being quite energetic in the prospects of making some acquisitions, which we are working on, but which we have not concluded in any specific way, but we do feel that we are in a position to be serious and to hopefully be successful in that area.
In terms of the existing real estate the number of markets that we are in, that are doing very well or relatively well is, I think, a direct reflection of the strategy we have followed for many years. It reflects two things.
One is, these are supply constrained markets that we are in and we are either building or owning real estate at the very upper end of that market. This is not the first time, this has happened, although this is probably the most difficult economic downturn that we’ve had to work our way through, but essentially when you have vacancies in the buildings that we have and in the markets that we have, and you have a downturn in rents, a lot of people want to go into the kinds of buildings we’ve had or we have.
In this regard we have frankly done very well in terms of keeping our occupancy up or rebuilding our occupancy. We’ve lost some tenants to bankruptcies or other things. So, we are actually feeling quite bullish about the prospects that we have.
I have to say just in terms of macroeconomic conditions, we are in an unprecedented kind of economic stress, and therefore, it is unpredictable. We have not been in anything like this since the end of World War II. It’s called The Great Recession.
This is a recession, though, that has been provoked by a financial crisis, which is the first one we’ve had really since 1929, and the times of recession generally take a lot more time to resolve the inherent problems of them and to get back to the growth that the economy of the United States has been accustomed to.
We’re still in, I think, a fairly slow level of recovery. As I say, the good news for us is that we are in, we think, the best markets in this country with the best real estate, and not that everything is perfect, but I think we are really quite pleased with the effectiveness and the results that we have had.
With that, I’d like to turn it over to Doug for operations. Doug?

368278,109469706,70036,"Boston Properties Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-28-2010",2010-07-28,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mort. Good morning, everybody. So, Mort began the discussion talking about the economy, and it’s clear that, as an overall economy, we haven’t seen much in the way of change in the unemployment. Obviously, we’re in the office business, and w",2608,"Thanks, Mort. Good morning, everybody. So, Mort began the discussion talking about the economy, and it’s clear that, as an overall economy, we haven’t seen much in the way of change in the unemployment. Obviously, we’re in the office business, and when people hire, they need more office space, and if you get really strong increases in office demand, that gives us the opportunity to see rapid improvements in the economies of our business.
I don’t think we’re suggesting that we’re seeing that, but we have seen dramatic improvements in the condition of the financial system. We’ve seen that massive corporate cost cutting over the last two years has led to pretty big margin improvements. Most recently, there’s really been some top line growth across a broad array of industries and that’s given corporations a whole lot of cash.
In the overall economy and the business world my sense of it is that there is a tug of war between austerity and spending. At the moment, we seem to be experiencing a stalemate, but it looks like austerity has got the edge at least today.
In our industry, the leading indicator is leasing transaction activity, and I use 2005 as our benchmark because that’s really when we started seeing the last major recovery in the office business Boston Properties has averaged about 4.3 million square feet of leasing per year and about 1.6 million square feet in the first six months of any one of our calendar years. So, to-date in 2010, we’ve completed 2.5 million square feet of leasing; obviously, way above trend.
This quarter we had 77 transactions; we had 71 last quarter. Again, a slight increase, but it’s really the pace of activity that appears to be pretty steady, which is, I think, and something that’s giving us some comfort. We continually discuss the importance of looking at specific markets and specific locations and building characteristics and not the broad real estate statistics when you are evaluating real estate investments.
Our strategy, as Mort said, continues to be to own and operate the highest quality assets in our selective submarkets, to design buildings and tenant spaces suited to customer’s current needs and to continue to invest and invest and upgrade those assets.
But even in the better submarkets, the individual characteristics of the location and the building really matter. You can have two buildings across the street from each other in a great submarket and one can be 100% leased and the other 100% vacant.
I’m going to add one other critical component to our strategy, which also acts in concert with everything else we do, and that’s our customers. Many of the companies that value the physical attributes of our buildings, our operating expertise, our financial strength and our stability are also businesses that think about expansion or consolidation in our assets during challenging economic environments. Let me give you some examples of that.
Towers Perrin is 44,000 square feet tenant that moved into the Prudential Tower last year in a relocation from 111 Huntington Avenue. They recently merged with Watson Wyatt. Watson Wyatt happened to be located on Route 128 in Wellesley. A few weeks ago Watson Wyatt exercised a termination option at its 128 location and signed a 33,000 square feet 10-year expansion consolidating, as approved.
In Cambridge, Microsoft, Google and EMC are all expanding in our buildings today. Microsoft recently signed a lease starting out at 21,000 square feet in September, they’re going to grab 30,000 square feet more in January and another 62,000 square feet as we can deliver it to them over the next three years.
Comcast recently completed a 24,000 square feet sublease, and then we did a stub period on that in Reston. This quarter they exercised their rights and took another 24,000 square feet.
In New York City over the past few quarters, Citadel, which is at 601 Lexington Avenue, has expanded by more than 77,000 square feet; Perella Weinberg leased an additional 38,000 square feet growing by 58% at 767 Fifth Avenue, the GM Building; and two of our new tenants in 399 Park are now negotiating for the last remaining square footage in the building, its 25,000 square feet that happens to be in the sublet space from Legg Mason.
Premier quality assets, selective submarket, continued investment and strong customers give us the best opportunity for success today and in the future. There is a growing consensus in all our markets that overall rental levels have bottomed out, eliminating the value of delaying leasing decisions for our customers. This doesn’t mean that lease negotiation leverage has suddenly shifted to us or that we’re predicting spikes in rents or greatly reduced concessions.
The fact of the matter remains that we still have significant available space in all of the markets in which we operate, and as long as there are extensive opportunities for our tenants to consider, it’s going to be hard to push rents or lower concessions dramatically. However, as individual building vacancy declines and there is competing interest for available space in those buildings we will start to be able to improve our pricing power in individual locations.
We had a second strong quarter of very strong second generation leasing statistics with an outside increase from New York City, but also strong results in Washington, D.C. and Boston. Now, in D.C. the results are skewed by the first of a series of short-term renewals with Lockheed Martin in Reston. We highlighted that last quarter, and if you exclude that transaction, second generating statistics in D.C. are essentially flat.
The story behind the numbers in New York City is at 767 Fifth where we did a renewal with CBS on the space of the base of the building and a renewal with General Motors, which both impacted the numbers. These were new market leases; no story behind them.
You may recall that when we purchased 767 Fifth two years ago, we discussed the embedded upside in the asset as one of the attractive attributes of the investment. In the face of a major decline in office rents in Midtown Manhattan and a reduction in percentage of rent from Apple, we have seen a 9% increase in the property cash NOI since our purchase in 2008.
We’ve made the point over the last few quarters that our mark-to-market over the next few years is going to continue to show a modest roll down, led by the lease expirations originally signed in 1999 and 2000 at Embarcadero Center Four, which roll in 2011 and 2012. This quarter, the mark-to-market on lease expirations in Embarcadero Center was negative 14%, which is consistent with what we would expect. Our overall mark-to-market is still negative $1.62, which is basically flat from last quarter.
Now, remember, the rents when we do our mark-to-market are starting rents under 2010 market conditions, so there is no growth in those rents, even though the current rents in some of our buildings may not be expiring for 10 years or 15 years and there is almost always an increase in those rents during the lease terms that are not reflected in the mark-to-market.
For the remainder of the year, our average expiring office rent is about $40.10, which is about 8% higher than our current market on that same square footage, and in 2011, the average expiring rent is about $48.96, 12% higher.
Changes in our portfolio of vacancy also have a significant impact on our income. At an average rent on our vacant portfolio; so this is the vacant space that we have, each 1% of occupancy translates into about $11 million of gross revenue increases.
Last quarter we had described the positive activity we were seeing in suburban Central 120 Boston and Cambridge, including expansion from tenants, such as Shire Pharmaceuticals and Google and Microsoft and iRobot and Dassault Systèmes and Lincoln Labs and A123.
Each of these tenants has either completed its expansion or is moving to complete the search. In our portfolio, we got the benefit of a 90,000 square foot transaction with A123 that’s going to start at the end of the year and a 113,000 transaction with Microsoft that I just described.
In the CBD of Boston, we’re negotiating about 100,000 square feet of additional leasing at Atlantic Wharf; that’s the building that will come online in the beginning of 2011, in the Back Bay we have some really good activity on the space we’ll be getting back in late 2011 from Bain Capital at 111 Huntington.
I’d like to also highlight the activity we’re seeing in Western Virginia. In 2011 we’re going to have 450,000 square feet of lease expirations in our Town Center portfolio stemming from consolidations from acquisitions by Oracle and Northrop Grumman that occurred after our original leases were executed about more than five years ago.
In addition, Sallie Mae, which is headquartered in Reston, has announced that it’s relocating their headquarters to Delaware and they’re going to add another 221,000 square feet to the available market.
We are in the midst of three separate transactions totaling 360,000 square feet to release our future availability and there are two tenants in discussion with Sallie Mae about occupying its entire building and there are three other users in excess of 100,000 square feet considering a move to Reston Town Center as we speak.
Now, while most of this activity is a result of our relocation and in upgrades of better assets in superior locations away from total commodity buildings, there is some incremental growth in each of these requirements.
In Maryland, we completed a lease with the GSA for 47,000 square feet at Annapolis Junction to bring that building located just outside the gate of the Fort Meade to 100% occupied.
In the district, we have our third major lease out for signature at 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue, which will bring our office pre-leasing to 74%. In addition, we’re negotiating leases on almost 100% of the retail space. Now, both 2200 Penn and Atlantic Wharf are mixed used projects and have four rent apartment components.
We’re building 333 units in Washington DC and 80 units in Boston. Each of these buildings will be delivered during the middle of 2011. We’ve engaged third-party management agencies to assist us with the lease-up and operation, and next quarter we’ll provide you with some expectations on the yields associated with these new developments.
In addition, you’ll note in our press release that we purchased a loan and subsequently did a deed in lieu on a parcel in Western Virginia. We now own a 2.5 acre site, which is the last remaining undeveloped land in the urban core, which is also directly adjacent to all of our new developments in Reston Town Center.
The property is currently zone for 360 apartments. We’re undertaking a review of the highest and best use for this site and we may in fact develop additional apartments on this parcel in the very near future.
Transaction velocity continues at pretty strong clip in New York City. Second quarter leasing activity was slightly above the five-year historical average and our overall vacancy in the portfolio is at 2.9%. Now, our immediate focus, given where we are with our leasing, has really shifted to smaller tenant demand given the type of product we have available on the portfolio today.
This quarter we completed 16 transactions in New York City and only one was above 20,000 square feet. Typically these suites are pre-built or refurbished by the landlord and rents range from the low fifties at Two Grand Central to the high sixties to mid-eighties at 599 and 540 Madison, to over $90 a square foot at 601 Lex and 399 Park, and well over a $100 of square foot at 767 Fifth. We have also begun making presentations to tenants at 250 West 55th Street this quarter, and there are some large users exploring the marketplace.
In San Francisco, activity continues to lag the other markets, but we have seen an increase in tour activity, and we have issued over 400,000 square feet of proposals to eight separate tenants, ranging from a full floor to a 150,000 square feet during the last quarter for that availability of EC4 that’s coming up at end of 2011 and early ‘12. We have one lease out for signature on a floor, and we are negotiating a second lease today. Rents at EC4 are in the high 40s to low 60s.
Leasing activity is also picking up in terms of smaller suites in the Embarcadero Center. In the Valley, leasing activity is still slow and given that availability is 20% plus the landlords are still being very aggressive in quoting tenants. Nonetheless, there are signs of some positives there as well.
Google has removed space from the sublet market in Mountain View, where availability has dropped to 16% and activity in Palo Alto has really picked up significantly, and those are the two markets that are the leading indicators of a Silicon Valley recovery.
I do want to take a minute to give you our impressions of the acquisition market as well. While on a historical basis there is still very limited activity, there has been a significant pickup in the number of potential investments we’re reviewing and underwriting.
Many of these transactions are assets we have been tracking for the last 15 months, where it appears the combination of the seller view on pricing, their motivation and ability to sell are starting to become aligned with new capital availability.
While there are certainly no lot’s of these simple sales, there are also significant structured investments including mortgages and mezzanine debt as well that we are looking at.
There is an abundance of capital seeking high quality investments in our markets, and it is clearly resulting in pricing that is exceeding expectations from both a value per square foot and a cap rate basis than any one might have expected. Return expectations both current and total are being lowered by the current interest environment and the lack of alternate investments.
As Michael described, attractive debt is again available for high quality assets in our markets and even double-digit availability has not seem to mute investors’ expectations regarding rental rate growth.
We are focusing our attention on assets where there is inherent risk and opportunity in the operating issues of the asset, and where we’ll be able to use our operational and financial strength to create value for our shareholders. Cases in points are the land parcels that we just purchased in Western Virginia and the JV we’re doing at 500 North Capitol.
During the last cycle of appreciation, investors were able to make money simply through holding assets and watching cap rates compress and rental rates rise rapidly. We may be operating in an economy with limited job growth through an extended period of time. In this environment, we can’t count just on dramatic market rental rate growth and market occupancy gains to create value.
We believe we are in an era in the office building business where investors are going to have to operate not trade assets. Identifying the opportunities and challenges inherent in the asset, developing long term relationships with the right tenants, current and future, developing the right plan to position a building in the changing the market is what we do every single day and we are optimistic that we are going to be able to execute on these types of investments over the coming quarters.
With that, I’ll let Mike talk about our results for the quarter.

368278,109469706,70036,"Boston Properties Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-28-2010",2010-07-28,"Earnings Calls","BXP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks Doug. Good morning, everybody. I want to start with just a quick discussion about our balance sheet. Last quarter, we were very active in refinancing the majority of our 2010 debt exposure and we raised additional capital in an attractive bond mark",2851,"Thanks Doug. Good morning, everybody. I want to start with just a quick discussion about our balance sheet. Last quarter, we were very active in refinancing the majority of our 2010 debt exposure and we raised additional capital in an attractive bond market, and today our balance sheet is highly liquid with a $1.7 billion of cash and full availability under our $1 billion line of credit.
Our liquidity, combined with our moderate leverage position, provides us with a good amount of dry powder to act on new investment opportunities. As Doug mentioned, the opportunities that we are tracking in our pipeline continue to grow and we prepared our balance sheet to quickly capitalize on those opportunities that we find attractive.
Our other short-term capital needs are very manageable. We have only $365 million of expiring debt, including our share of joint venture debt, remaining in 2010, with three of these loans totaling $270 million containing short-term extension options that we currently expect to exercise.
This month we paid off our $56 million loan on Carnegie Center and the remaining loan, an $80 million loan, on our 50% owned Market Square North joint venture expires in December. We’ve recently executed an application and locked our interest rate with a life insurance company on this property for $130 million, 10-year refinancing at an interest rate of 4.85%.
We anticipate closing this loan sometime in the late third or early fourth quarter of 2010. This is a good representation of where the secured markets are to-date for reasonably leveraged high-quality office buildings, such as those in our portfolio, and it demonstrates a 90 basis point reduction in pricing from the rate on our Metropolitan Square loan, which we locked in the spring.
Credit spreads have tightened by about 30 basis points over this timeframe, while the majority of the compression has come from the rallying treasuries as the 10-year treasury rate has dropped by about 60 basis points.
The secured market has now moved inside the unsecured market, with our unsecured spreads still hovering around 200 basis points. We could issue a new 10-year unsecured bond today in the very low 5% range. In the convert market, we could issue at a coupon in the 1% to 1.5% area for five years with the spread price premium of 20%.
In 2011 our maturities are also quite reasonable with approximately $680 million of maturing debt, the largest of which is a $460 million loan on 601 Lexington Avenue that expires in May. This loan has a pretty high coupon of 7.19% and is significantly underleveraged at a loan of $275 per square foot.
In addition, we have to fund the remaining $140 million of equity to complete our development pipeline. Overall, the portfolio is generating positive cash flow after funding all of its capital needs plus our dividend. So, again, we’re in a great position with moderate capital requirements and strong cash flows.
We’re also looking at our medium-term maturities and bought back another $133 million of our exchangeable notes that are callable in 2012 in the second quarter. We’ve now repurchased a total of $186 million, all at slight discounts to par. Lastly, we exercised our right to extend the maturity of our $1 billion revolver to August of 2011.
Getting into our second quarter results, we had a solid quarter and reported funds from operations of $181 million or $1.12 per share. This significantly exceeded our expectations by about $0.14 per share or $23 million. However, much of the performance, roughly $15 million, was due to non-recurring items.
The biggest impact was from the acceleration of the deferred management fee for 280 Park Avenue totaling $12.2 million. When we sold 280 Park Avenue for $1.2 billion or $1,000 a square foot in 2006, we entered into a master lease that was associated with about 75,000 square feet of space as well as the below market 10-year management agreement. A portion of the management contract was recorded as deferred revenue and reduced our gain on sale at the time by $16.6 million.
This past quarter the leasing of the building surpassed the requirements in the master lease, which included payments by us of $4.1 million over the last four years. We now have no future obligation under the lease, but the owner gained the right to cancel the management agreement early, which they’ve done. We’ve taken the remaining balance of the deferred revenue into income this quarter and the loss of the management agreement will reduce our fee income by $2 million annually going forward.
We also earned $2.6 million of termination income in excess of our budget and total termination income of $4.2 million for the quarter. 90% of this termination income relates to three tenants, two are in New York City and one in Boston, where we proactively negotiated terminations because we had replacement tenants committed to this space. $1.8 million of this came from our joint venture buildings.
Our core operations exceeded our projections by about $8 million. Approximately $5 million came from the portfolio with a lot of small leasing wins, the delivery of Weston Corporate Center a month early, which generated $1.4 million for the quarter and operating cost savings of just over $3 million.
Half of the expense savings were in utilities, which is hard to believe given the heat wave we’ve been dealing with in the Northeast, and we expect to get some of the savings back this quarter. We’ve also pushed off some repair and maintenance projects, which we also expect to move into later in the year as well.
Our development team did a terrific job and we delivered our Biogen headquarters development at Weston Corporate Center a month earlier than expected and also with significant cost savings. Based on its final cost, we expect Weston Corporate Center to deliver an unleveraged NOI return of over 11%, exceeding our original budget by nearly 200 basis points.
Our Hotel in Cambridge was up by $600,000 and it has now beat its budget for the fourth consecutive quarter, demonstrating stronger occupancy and enabling us to push room rate. The second quarter is typically a good quarter for our hotel with the demand from college graduation activities boosting occupancy.
Excluding the $1.8 million of termination income that I already mentioned, the contribution from the JV portfolio was higher by just over $1 million. Late in the quarter we achieved the lease-up of the remaining 47,000 square feet of space at our 50-50 Annapolis Junction joint venture project, and as Doug mentioned, we’re now 100% leased. We also saw better retail sales in our joint venture properties resulting in higher percentage rent this quarter.
In addition to the one-time fee at 280 Park Avenue, our development and management services income was about $600,000 above budget, with increases in our work order requests in New York City, Boston and San Francisco, plus commissions that we earned on the completion of several leases within the New York City joint venture portfolio.
Our G&A expense for the quarter was right in line with expectations. We’ve reported non-cash $6.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the buyback of our exchangeable notes. Now, we talked about this last quarter and in accordance with GAAP, these notes were bifurcated into a debt and equity component at issuance and roughly 96% of the face amount is currently reported as debt.
Given that we’re buying them back at closer to par and the value was virtually 100% debt today, GAAP math shows that we’re paying a premiums and results in a paper loss. We had projected all but $1.3 million of this loss as we completed most of the buybacks before we reported last quarter.
The remaining negative variance was offset by a reduction of interest expense associated with the repurchased exchangeable notes, plus savings on our floating rate debt, where LIBOR has remained low and our debt balances are lower than projected as well as we’re using cash rather than borrowing under these faculties.
On the interest income side, we generated approximately $750,000 more than we expected as we were able to maintain our earnings rate for the quarter where we had projected some decline.
As we had guided last quarter, our FAD returned to a more normalized rate this quarter at 66% after spiking due to the high volume of leases that hit in the first quarter. We had 1.1 million square feet of second generation leases commence this quarter, more in line with our historical experience and transaction costs were in line as well at $23.18 per square foot for an average cost per lease year of $4.28 per square foot.
We still have an inordinately large amount of straight line rent impacting our FAD and over the next two quarters a good piece of this will convert to cash rent, reducing our straight line run rate by approximately $10 million quarterly by the fourth quarter.
Going the other way, we haven’t spent much of our capital expenditure budget yet, but still expect to end the year around $20 million with only $3 million spent to-date.
Turning to our projections for the rest of 2010, as Doug detailed, we’ve not seen a significant change in the rents or velocity of leasing in our markets, and things are pretty steady. As a result we’ve not made many changes to our leasing projections and expect to end the year at an occupancy rate in the mid-92% range.
We experienced positive absorption of about a 100 basis points this past quarter in New York City and are now 97% leased, with about 257,000 square feet of vacancy.
140,000 square feet of this availability is in upper floors of 601 Lexington and 599 Lexington Avenues where we’re seeing good activity. We do have an 80,000 square foot vacancy coming in the third quarter at the bottom of Two Grand Central Tower. This vacancy will offset our other projected leasing gains and overall we expect our occupancy rate to remain pretty stable in New York City.
As we’ve discussed before our occupancy in Boston is declining and we expect it to continue to drop modestly with just under 300,000 square feet rolling in next two quarters.
We’ve seen improved activity at the Prudential Center and in Cambridge, but most of it is for 2011 or later occupancy, and in the interim we’ve taken back 50,000 square feet from a recent renewal and contraction of 101 Huntington and 80,000 square feet in conjunction with Biogen’s relocation out of Four Cambridge Center to Weston Corporate Center this quarter
In Washington, we are well leased at 97% and our occupancy has been creeping up over the last couple of quarters with a continued lease-up at South of Market, Wisconsin Place and Annapolis Junction and One Preserve Parkway. We expect to continue to see steady absorption of the remaining 100,000 square feet available in these projects, particularly at South of Market and Wisconsin Place where we’ve deals in the works.
The activity at One Preserve, where 50,000 square feet of this availability resides, is still pretty slow. We have over 900,000 square feet of leases expiring in Washington over the next six months. Virtually, all of it is in the process of renewals, so our speculative exposure remains light.
Our occupancy in San Francisco is pretty stable in the 91% range and we expect to maintain this through year end. Our rollover for the rest of the year is manageable at 380,000 square feet with the only large exposure being the 270,000 square foot vacancy that will be created in North San Jose when Lockheed Martin downsizes in December. This vacancy has no impact on 2010 and it will reduce 2011 earnings by less than $4 million assuming it remains down all year as it’s a relatively low rent lease.
In Princeton, we recently signed a full floor list for Tower Center, the first positive leasing we have had there in over a year. Activity in Carnegie Center has also picked up recently with several larger users looking at our vacancy and our 2011 rollover. We have minimal additional exposure in 2010 and anticipate occupancy to remain in the 90% range for Carnegie Center.
In summary, in similar to last quarter’s report, we expect our 2010 same-store GAAP NOI to be flat to down 1% and on a cash basis to be negative 3% to negative 4% compared to 2009.
As we stated before, our cash NOI is lower in 2010 due to the free rent associated with many of our large new leases that commenced earlier this year and late last year, including 475,000 square feet in New York City and 480,000 square feet at the Prudential Center in Boston. All of these leases will be cash paying by early 2011.
On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we expect our second quarter same-store top line revenue to be a good proxy for the next two quarters, while our margins will deteriorate slightly by 100 basis points to 200 basis points due to the seasonality of energy costs and the deferral of some expenses into the second half of the year.
We project full year straight line rents of $80 million to $85 million, which is up slightly from last quarter. We do not include termination income in our same-store numbers and are projecting $1 million for the fourth quarter in the wholly-owned portfolio.
Given our hotel’s continued improved performance over the past few quarters, we’re increasing our projections and now expect that it will generate $7 million to $7.5 million of NOI for the full year 2010.
Buildings that aren’t in the same-store portfolio include our 2009 developments with Princeton University, Democracy Tower and Reston Town Center and Wisconsin Place, which, in addition to Weston Corporate Center, are collectively 99% leased.
Looking at all four of these recent deliveries with a total investment of $335 million, their weighted average unleveraged GAAP NOI return is 10.8%, demonstrating our ability to deliver superior returns through the development process.
We also added 500 North Capitol Street to the portfolio this quarter, and in total, our developments in 500 North Capitol are projected to add an incremental $20 million to $22 million to our 2010 NOI.
The contribution to FFO from our joint ventures is projected to be $145 million to $148 million in 2010. This range has increased by $8 million from last quarter apportion due to our outperformance in the second quarter of nearly $3 million. We also leased, as I said, the remaining space in Annapolis Junction, which added $1.5 million to the year and are projecting some additional leasing at Two Grand Central Tower.
Lastly, this month we negotiated a settlement agreement and received $1.75 million, representing our share from a tenant that terminated its lease back in 2008. Our joint venture projections include $82 million of FASB 141 income for the year.
Our development and management services income will be lower over the next few quarters as we’ve recently completed several fee-oriented projects, such as 20 F, and now will no longer earn the $2 million annual management fee at 280 Park Avenue.
On the positive side, we’re seeing progressively more activity from our tenants for work orders and other services after a moribund 2009. We project our 2010 development and management services income to be $39 million to $42 million. Our projection is up from last quarter solely due to the impact of the $12.2 million acceleration of the 280 Park Avenue management fee this quarter.
We’re projecting our G&A to be $82 million to $84 million for the full year. Our net interest expense projection did not change significantly. We are not budgeting any additional debt buyback activity and our quarterly run rate for interest income is expected to be $2 million to $2.25 million, similar to the second quarter results.
Our net interest expense, including interest income, is projected to be $380 million to $385 million for the full year, including the one-time non-cash charges associated with our buybacks.
Considering all of these assumptions in addition to our second quarter results, we’re increasing our 2010 full year guidance and now project funds from operation of $4.24 to $4.29 per share. This is an increase in our range of $0.18 per share at the low end, resulting primarily from the outperformance in the second quarter. For the third quarter, we’re projecting funds from operation of $1.01 to $1.03 per share.
We haven’t included any earnings from new investment activity in our projections. As Doug discussed, we’re actively underwriting multiple opportunities, have seen our pipeline of potential deals grow and are hopeful that we will be successful on making acquisitions in this environment.
Our cash balances of $1.7 billion are currently earning approximately 50 basis points and are dilutive to our earnings. For every $500 million that we invest at a 6% return, our annual earnings would increased by $27.5 million or $0.17 per share.
That completes our formal remarks. Operator, you can open the line up for questions.

Many of the projects that we have become involved with are mixed-use in their focus largely because that appears to be where office tenants want to be locating. We believe that developing mixed-use products under the right economic scenario in the right locations could be a pretty significantly accretive use of our capital and where we can create some value. So, in those circumstances, I think we would certainly look to explore alternative uses in those locations.
So, if you think about what we’ve done or what we might do, we’re talking about Downtown Boston associated with their office building retail complex. We’re talking about infill Northwest Washington D.C. next to our office building with almost 100,000 square feet of retail as a part of the same development, and in Reston Town Center where we have 3.5 million square feet of office space and a couple of 100,000 square feet of very successful retail space doing a residential project in that kind of a context.
I wouldn’t want to give you the impression that we are out there looking to do stick-frame residential or standalone urban residential right now. We’re really sticking to the types of projects and the types of environments that we’ve been very successful in. And just thinking about whether or not it makes sense as a developer right now to be the owner of those assets and whether there’s enough value creation there to make sense for us to deploy our capital, and to-date, the answer has been yes.

We are still going to be focused on the highest end commercial real estate developments and this is what we are looking at.

That is still the combined forces that have shaped our strategy and we’re not going to give up on that.

Now, I have to say to you that we have not been too successful in some of the things that we have been trying because the market for these assets is stronger than frankly we would have anticipated.

We have seen countless examples of law firms who are signing new leases and/or doing early renewals givebacks in both Boston, in San Francisco, in Washington, D.C. We haven’t yet seen that in New York City largely because I just don’t think those leases have rolled over, although if we looked at what Proskauer fundamentally signed as they are leased at 11 Times Square and what they were talking to us about when we were doing our development conversation with them at 250 West 55th Street, it’s a pretty proximate change in terms of what this total square foot is. So, big picture, we have seen a clear change, and largely that’s due to two things.
One, it’s due to changes in the way law firms use their space. There are obviously law firms that 10 years ago had one assistant for every partner, one assistant for every associate and had lots and lots of space for file rooms and lots of conference rooms spread out throughout their space for their clients have changed the way they work. They don’t have that need for the hard file space any longer. They are creating conference centers where they are consolidating all their conference rooms. There are far fewer administrative professionals working in these firms. Then all of them laid off either lawyers or up council associates over the past year or so and they have yet to start hiring back those people. So that’s from the legal perspective.
On the financial regulatory side, we have not seen any of the firms, at least, that we do business with in New York City, making changes to their footprints based upon the changes to the regulatory reforms. Interestingly, I go back every quarter and look at the financials when bulge-bracket firms put the results out, and many of them actually show you what their hiring is on a worldwide basis.
I think to every one of them there was some incremental growth in employment between the end of the first quarter and the end of the second quarter as well as from the comparable period second quarter of 2009 to comparable period 2010, and that includes firms under tremendous scrutiny, like a Goldman Sachs. If you go to their financials, they will show you what their overall headcount is. So, we have not seen any changes on the downside.
What we have seen and I think we have been the beneficiary of it is that some of the professionals that have found that the business strategies that they were pursuing might not be aligned 100% with where they were, were doing them at the investment banking firms, have just decided to take their shops into elsewhere and we’ve seen some of the hedge funds and some of the smaller investment banks growing; a.k.a. Avenue Financial at 399; Mullis at 399, Citadel at 601 Lexington Avenue, Perella at 767 Fifth Avenue. That’s what going on here, but in total, the headcount of the actual large firms hasn’t really declined to-date.

It’s sort of on the margin. In all of our other markets I think the concessions have been consistent. Depending upon the market, concessions have actually widened out, but the rents never came down.
As an example, in Washington D.C., tenant improvement allowances probably have increased, but the base rental rate has been maintained. So you’re still getting $40 to $50 triple net rent, depending upon where you’re located, but you might have increased your tenant improvement allowance from $60 square foot to $70 square foot to $75 a square foot. So I don’t think we have seen any type of a sign that concessions have come down and/or that the landlord has been able to exert influence overall because the market has strengthened to the point where they can do that.

I think that there are lots of high quality institutional investors as seen as market environment-oriented and saying to themselves, there is an opportunity potentially for some upside in this asset, in this stream of cash flows over a period of hold and I am satisfied investing my capital. The number that people are using as the average out there is in the mid 5s to low 6s. That’s where the D.C. and the New York City assets seem to have been trading on a cap rate basis.
My guess is in many of those cases the rents are either at or slightly above markets. So there is probably not much in the way of short-term pickup in overall cash flow that would occur there. So, my assumption is that those IRRs are in 7% to 8% range. That’s where people are looking at high quality real estate in the kinds of markets that we operate in.

We have close to 1 million square feet at the top of the building leased to two major tenants, Weil Gotshal being one and Estee Lauder being another. Those rents are so far below the market that we knew when we went in that that would be the major inflection point in terms of yield. But even without that and even in this difficult market, I have to say we were helped, I confess, by the introduction of the iPad and the Apple start, which you just can’t imagine how successful it has been, and we have a modest participation rent. Generally speaking, we have been able to lease up the space that we have. The building is doing extremely well. If we had another 200,000 square feet today, we could lease it.
The most important and transforming event in that asset will be when those two leases roll over. I don’t know, five years, just give or take a short period of time, maybe six years. That’s always been a critical element of this thing, which is not fully appreciated, but we basically have as a velocity a long-term hold view of the assets that we try and buy. When you take those numbers and those increases and they are in the 60s and 70s, and this is at the top of the building, by doing the research on that space, but when you take those increments that we will definitely get and you assume that that gets wrapped into whatever the residual value of that building is, you will understand why we said at that time and we’ll say again, that in terms of an IRR that was the most attractive investment I’ve seen by way of acquisition in the years I’ve been in the business.

We don’t believe there are any major pockets of space in our portfolio that aren’t on the sublet market that are underutilized by our tenants, particularly in our suburban portfolio. In our urban portfolio, where we have law firms that have, again, signed leases in 2005 or 2006 and their headcount is changed, I’m sure they are sitting on unutilized space. The fact that they haven’t chosen to put any of that space on the sublet market leaves me to two conclusions.
One is it’s so disjointed in the capital investment associated with moving people around and so significant that it’s not worth them to spend the energy and capital and doing that and putting the space in the sublet market, or they have a view that they are going to grow back into that space over time. There are tenants that do have space on the sublet market in all of our markets. They are few and far between, but it’s generally our law firms. I’d say the preponderance of them are in San Francisco and in Washington, D.C., but they are limited, and we have not seen any change in those types of characteristics quarter-to-quarter.
On the other side, financial services companies, not our particular tenants, but overall in the marketplaces, we’ve seen a reduction in sublet space on the market in Manhattan and we have seen a reduction of space on the tech side, as I spoke before, in places like Mountain View where Google had space on the sublet market that they’ve taken off.

If anything, they were much more intense about this concern than I was and I wasn’t exactly low key in my concerns.
When I talk to them, the word ‘demonize’ is a word which I’ve used, and I think it does affect when they are making decisions. It’s not the only thing that affects them, obviously, but I think it would be a lot of easier for them to think about making investment decisions if they didn’t feel somehow rather that this is an environment which is hostile to business. It’s not the decisive factor in most cases, but it is certainly a part of the culture of business today. It is very widespread. Just this editorial that I just had in the Financial Times yesterday, I can’t believe the number of people, many of whom are household names in business, who wrote me, e-mailed me, and called me about it. So there is that out there and I do think it affects the business environment.
As I say, I don’t want to overstate it either, I think the business environment is as much as anything else affected by their sense of what the economic future is in their particular businesses and in their particular industries and what their own financial capabilities are to go ahead. Right now, I think there is a lot of uncertainty. Part of that uncertainty I have to say is also created by new regulations, costly regulations and a sense of an unfriendly environment in Washington.
By the way, the Obama people don’t feel that way, of course. I’ve had conversations with them as well. They seem to contact me primarily after I write the editorials, not before. I do think it’s quite widespread and I have to say as I’ve written I think they are doing it for political reasons. They want to find somebody to blame for the very poor economic performance in response to their stimulus program, in particular, which I have to say I wrote at the time I didn’t think was adequate and nor do I think it was properly structured to create jobs. It preserves some jobs, mostly public service, union jobs I might add, but that’s a part of the problem. They didn’t ask for anything in return from the public service unions.
So I just think the whole policy structure that they have put forward is it’s not working and I don’t know whether they are going to change their policy because I think it’s remarkably driven by their perception of what the politics of the issues are rather than what the economic interest. I got a call, I have to tell you, from several governors and they are Democratic governors, and they said to me, they agreed with me, I might add, but they can’t have any impact apparently on the Obama administration.
And as one of them said just within the last 48 hours, he said, I have already found the best politics is the best government and if you make your policies work, your politics will work up, but here the politics seems to be so disassociated from their politics. I literally don’t understand it, so I’m just puzzled by it. They seem to be on a perpetual campaign and the governing is different from campaigning. I think that’s what the country senses and that’s certainly what the business community senses, so I think it’s a real issue.
Now, I do think that the financial side of it, which is something that has been affected, it’s too early to tell whether or not sort of the financing for large companies is going to be affected. Large companies have accumulated a lot of financing, have access to financing, have accumulated a lot of cash, but the growth in jobs comes from the smaller companies. That’s probably 70%, 75% of job growth which is so critical to the economy.
Here I would tell you there is something called the birth/death series in the Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers unemployment. This refers to the number of jobs that are created by new companies, these are births, whom they can’t measure since they only measure somewhere between 60,000 and 100,000 and there are millions of companies out there. And the death series are the companies that have gone under and lost jobs. This is a historical extrapolation from earlier years. I would bet you to-date they have assumed that there are probably close to a million jobs created out of the (inaudible) which is 150,000 jobs a month to 200,000 jobs a month.
Those are the numbers that they have. I don’t believe they exist. If you do that, if 50% of them exist it will be a miracle. They write them down; they wrote them down last year, but that means we’re virtually in a situation when no jobs are being created in this economy. That’s very, very serious and nobody has an answer. It’s an unprecedented kind of economic condition and therefore the consequences are unpredictable and nobody knows what policy is going to work.
So there has been a shift because the country now thinks a stimulus program didn’t work. If you look at the numbers on that, now the political numbers or polling numbers, they are very tough for the administration. I don’t know, there doesn’t seem to be any sort of change of course on their part. So I don’t know how to explain it. To be honest, I’m really astounded by it. I think it is going to affect everything. I don’t how much it’s going to affect it and I think there is a much better mood today that in the sense that nobody thinks the bottom is going to fall out, but we don’t know. We don’t see the bottom falling out.
The one thing that is interesting, this is not my number, I got it from somebody who really studies it very carefully, is that, if you multiply house prices by interest rates and you figure out what the occupancy cost is, it’s down to on average 15% of incomes. Now, that’s a historic low. I mean it got to close to 30%. So if housing prices as an percentage of income, housing occupancy prices given the low financing rates, that may begin to stimulate A, housing and B, prices and that will increase the home equity of lot of people in this country who don’t feel that their home equity isn’t there any longer or at least it’s still shrinking.
So I don’t know that may have an opportunity to turn around the economy in ways that nobody has anticipated, but it’s all up in the air. I don’t know, as I say, the reason why I say I’ll take it back to Boston Properties and I am sorry for going on for so long, but the reason why we are sort of in this position is because there is still always some companies that are doing well, some companies that are growing and in most of the markets we are in they would be rather be in the best buildings.
Now, the two cities that we are in, Cambridge, even Boston, but certainly New York and Washington, those are cities that have been relatively unscathed through all of this. I mean there was a brief period when everything seemed to be dropping through the floor, but it’s come back quite constructively as far as we are concerned and I think that’s going to continue.

Where it does show up I think is in corporate investment, and there we’ve had a dramatic drop in corporate investment. Where it does show up is in corporate hiring and there you’ve seen very little corporate hiring as they say on a net basis. I think virtually, non-existent and in fact part of that is because I think two things play a role here.
One is people realize they didn’t need as many people as they had and two is that they have found that by the use of technology they can replace people partly through offshore manufacturing and investment, but really even here. So those are the areas where corporate decision making really begins to have consequences. In terms of space occupancy, as Doug has described, it affects some law firms. You take the financial world, what we have seen is a whole host of new smaller financial companies have emerged and are taking space and they want to be in the best building and they are very well capitalized.
So, we are, I think, in that sense, benefiting a little bit from it. It’s not the greatest market we’ve ever been in, if not the worst, but I do think if you’re going to look for where corporations do focus in terms of their concern about the future, it’s on employment and basically the expansion of their capital plan, and there I think you see the effects.

Even if we did have a double dip, in my judgment, it wouldn’t be the kind of decline that we saw before. It would be a nominal decline of 0.5% to 1%. I think the other, probably 50-50 in macroeconomic terms, it will probably be a slow improvement rather than a slow decline.
The one thing that worries me is that the federal stimulus program is winding down. The stimulus is going to stop stimulating; I’ll put it that way. Of course, the state and local governments are in for a blood bath in terms of the decline of their finances and the need that they’re going to have to let go people. Again, we’re in an unprecedented time. I don’t know how they are going to cope, I don’t know how many people are going to be laid off and I don’t know what it will to the general mood of the consumer.
If you look at the consumer sentiment, consumer confidence, it dropped by 10 points in the last month. So we’re just in an unprecedented time. I think it will be in a very narrow range, though. I think this will continue for a while. I just don’t see yet American business really hiring and investing in a way that’s going to grow the economy, particularly since, as I say, the job growth really comes out of small startup companies, and they have traditionally got their financing from three sources; their credit card lines, home equity loans or bank loans, and these three are all under great, great pressure. So the financing is really difficult for startup companies.
What is more, as I say, you’ll have many fewer startup companies and a lot of smaller companies are going to go under. So I just don’t know how to measure that because it’s just unprecedented. I would just put it this way; there’s reason to be cautious.

One banker quoted to me a few weeks ago that with their left hand they’re doing a workout with somebody, with the right hand they are marketing them. There is some pressure for them to start making loans again. Now, I am talking about large scale high quality real estate loans versus small new business loans for startups, so maybe a little bit different for the startups.
From what we’re seeing is there is clearly an uptiering of borrower quality that the banks are looking for, I think if you see some of the banks, some of the REITs that have been going to the market with their line renewals, the success that they are having in terms of being able to get the size of the line they want, even being able to start to push pricing a little bit, it’s happening. We are seeing that as well and we expect to see that continuing to happen.
One of the reasons that we’ve decided to defer and push out our line is that we believe when we renew and start our renewal talks later this year and early next year that we’re going to be able to do better in pricing than we are doing now. We’re starting to see a trend of that. I think that the bank pricing was a little more sticky than we saw on the life company market and some of the other markets, and it’s just now starting to come in a little bit. So that’s a good sign for us.

Northrop Grumman was really focusing on establishing a new presence in Washington. As you know, they are existing tenant of ours and we negotiated with them for over a year and they elected not to renew in Reston, but to consolidate back into Tysons. I think they also wanted to be inside the Boulevard for operational purposes. And we didn’t have land inside the Boulevard, as we turned out they bought an existing building, Fairview Park and the existing building I think they bought that for two reasons; first of all, the commitment to the State of Virginia to make a major investment as quickly as possible, certainly in the 2011, 2012 timeframe, which a protracted builder suite would not permit. They also wanted to move people quickly. And lastly this site is in close proximity to a recently announced GSA deal.
So, I think all those things were the factors towards them buying. I also think to your point that the new financial regulations regarding the treatment of leases did force them to take a much longer and harder look at buying the buildings as opposed to long-term lease.

I’m going to start just sort of by touching on the macro economy and then sort of getting to the areas where Boston Properties is engaged in the economy.We’ve had a very, very, very problematic",1594,"Good morning, everybody. Thank you all for joining us. I’m going to start just sort of by touching on the macro economy and then sort of getting to the areas where Boston Properties is engaged in the economy.
We’ve had a very, very, very problematic recovery, if you want to put it that way, from the very precipitous drop in our GDP in the very steep part of the recession. If there was any great optimism about a quick recovery, something which I have to say I did not share, as you all know, I think that optimism has been dashed. Now the question is where do we go from here, and on the general theory that we are in unprecedented kind of economy and therefore one which is unpredictable, I will just cover what I think are the major risks.
We have seen virtually no recovery, I might add, in unemployment, and the real unemployment numbers are much worse than the headline unemployment number. Headline unemployment numbers are around 9.6, 9.7 but that restricts itself to people who have applied for job within four weeks.
If you take the household unemployment, which includes people who’ve applied for a job within six months and people who are working part-time, who want to work full-time, it’s 17.1%, but that doesn’t take into account the 1.5% of the workforce, and that’s a minimum number who’ve just dropped out of the workforce, nor does it take into account the following.
We’ve gone from residential construction of 1,600,000 units to somewhere in the range of 500,000 units. So that’s 1,100,000 fewer units than we were building in 2007, 2006.
Now, the minimum number of people who are, shall we say, working on each job is five, and it’s generally on average between five and 10. But none of these numbers account for 5.5 million people to take the minimum number and multiple it by the 1.1 million homes fewer that we are now constructing. The reason for that is that many of those people were frankly working illegally here in the United States, and they don’t show up in the employment rolls and they don’t show up in the unemployment rolls, but when they lose their jobs, they do show up in the form of reduced income to spend on consumption, and consumption has been just basically bumping along at the bottom.
The biggest risk it seems to me for this economy, in addition to the fact that there is very little confidence, especially in the business community towards this administration. It’s the most unprecedentedly unanimous hostility and lack of confidence in the administration that I’ve ever seen in business, and that’s going to have an effect on what business does, but the biggest risk it seems to me is the vulnerability of home prices.
While they have gone down quite a bit, there are now something 11 plus million homes where the mortgages exceed the value of the homes. Another 8 million homes where the mortgages are within 5% of the value, so the 8 million homes have mortgages between 95% and 100% of value.
And if home prices drop here, and you get an unplugging of the foreclosure pipeline, which is going to happen sooner or later, and it’s going to raise the prospect of shall we say a lot of homes coming on to the market in a market where the only way to clear the market is through lower prices. That is the biggest exposure that I think this economy has in the short-run and nobody knows what’s going to happen there frankly. Again I’m on the slightly pessimistic side.
So we’re just looking at very, very troubled economic times, and it’s hard for me to predict when we’ll pull out of it. I just don’t think that we’re going to pull out of it in the short-run.
Now the interesting thing is that there are discontinuities here. The Corporate America has done extraordinarily well in this time. They have cut their costs. They have found an excuse to cut costs. They couldn’t do it while the earnings were very, very strong, but given the conditions we are in the last couple of years, they have found ways to cut cost in unprecedented ways and increase productivity.
But of course a big part of cutting cost is letting go people and not hiring, which is the flipside of what’s going on today because very few in Corporate America are hiring. And the other issue there is that not only are they not hiring, but their profits have gone up a lot.
And in an environment in which interest rates are being held very, very low as a result of federal reserve policy and the QE2, the Quantitative Easing 2, which is I’m sure going to be announced after the election will continue to keep interest rates low.
It is a real stimulus to Corporate America and to particularly the stock prices, and the hope is that somehow really some of the wealth that is being created in the stock markets will feed into economy and stimulate the economy. That remains to be seen.
Let me give you one other reason why the unemployment numbers are worse than they look. There is something in these numbers called the birth/death series. The birth/death series refers to an assumption every month as to the number of new companies that are created and the number of companies that shutdown.
Generally speaking, the assumptions are that a lot of jobs are created in this category. They of course have had to take down these assumptions last year and again when they measured it from March to March they took it down at the rate of about 360,000 jobs.
So even the jobs that they project, frankly, are going to be reduced in my judgment when they get to the final estimates of the birth/death series, because startup companies are financed in three ways - home equity loans, credit card loans, or bank lines or bank loans, and neither of those three categories are available anywhere near to the degree they were 18 months ago, and therefore the financing for startups are really, really being constrained and constricted.
All of this just goes to show that we’re not in a booming period. Nevertheless, in the markets that we are in, we’re doing a lot better than what you would think the economy is because the markets that we are in are really kind of special. They are all supply constrained markets as a practical matter, Washington and the Upper East Side of New York, Boston itself, Cambridge, Massachusetts, et cetera.
And as we will see when we get specific reports on the performance, we’ve done actually quite well in this market now or in these markets. Now don’t get me wrong.
It is not that rents haven’t gone down, because they have gone down, but what we have found in the category of these markets that we are in, to it that we are in the upper end of the markets in terms of quality, that a lot of companies chose to move into the best buildings when the rents drop, so that even though we had a number of bankruptcies like Lehman Brothers and General Motors, etc., we have basically filled up virtually all of this space because companies have wanted to move into them, since they are good buildings and since the rents did go down.
So, in that sense, I think we have been very pleased that our strategy has worked, because it has been something we have experienced over and over again that we do relatively well in good times because almost everybody does well in good times, but we do much better relatively in bad times, because people want to move into the best buildings and particularly in supply constrained markets. So, I think we’re very, very pleased with the performance of the company over the last couple of years as it really justifies the degree of risk that we believe we have been able to manage and reduce through the strategy of staying. A, at the upper end of the market; and B, in supply constrained locations.
Nevertheless, as I say, we are in unchartered waters here, nobody knows what the consequences could be. We think we can manage our way through it. We think it will present us with a lot of unique opportunities for acquisitions.
As many of you know, we have made some acquisitions, some of which we’ve been working on for several years like the John Hancock building in Boston, which we know very well, because it’s directly across the street from Prudential Center which we also own, so it gives us an enormously strong position in that market.
And 510 Madison Avenue in New York, which is a brand new building in what is called the Plaza District in New York, which is an absolutely first class building that we think we’ll do very well with.
We are still on the lookout for additional acquisitions, and we think they don’t happen in any kind of regular sequence. Sometimes they just happen in a bunch, but we are continuing to work that particular mine, and I think we will be successful in adding to our acquisitions here again of the buildings, and at the quality that we are looking for over the next year.
With that, I think I’ll conclude my remarks, and ask Doug, if he would take over?

So, as Mort indicated, the last 90 days have been really, really active for Boston Properties. We’ve completed some very exciting and important leasing transactions involving our existing assets.And as Mort start",2993,"Thanks, Mort. Good morning, everybody. So, as Mort indicated, the last 90 days have been really, really active for Boston Properties. We’ve completed some very exciting and important leasing transactions involving our existing assets.
And as Mort started to describe, we think we’ve created some terrific opportunities for value creation with the acquisition of 510 Madison, Midtown Manhattan, and the pending acquisitions of John Hancock Tower in Boston’s Back Bay, and also the Bay Colony office campus, which is a million square foot campus in Waltham.
We’re going to spend sometime this morning discussing the acquisitions, but I thought I’d begin my comments discussing our existing portfolio first. This quarter, we completed another 1.7 million square feet of leasing transactions. So to-date, we are at 4.3 million square feet through three quarters. Since 2005 we’ve averaged about 4.3 million square feet per year, and during the last five days we’ve completed another 510,000 square feet of leasing just in our Boston portfolio.
This quarter we had 79 transactions compared to 77 last quarter and 71 during the first quarter. But even in the best submarkets the individual characteristics of the location and the building, sponsorship, commitment to investing capital, attention to building operations, and focusing on meeting your customers needs, all have to be put together to give you a chance to be successful, particularly one as Mort described overall job growth is measured, and the market-wide demand is still pretty static from an office requirement basis.
So, while Boston Properties’ pace of activities appears to be steady, I just want to temper your expectations that we should assume that we are seeing broad market recoveries because we’re not seeing that.
But let me get into the specifics of our portfolio. Last week, we completed a 280,000 square foot lease with Mass Financial Services to move into 111 Huntington Avenue. They’ve leased the entire premises that Bain Capital is going to vacate at the end of 2011, as well as an additional 73,000 square feet.
As part of the transaction, we’re going to have to relocate an existing tenant at 111 Huntington Avenue into 53,000 of availability at the Prudential Tower, where that tenant is going to extend for an additional 10 years, and we’re swapping space with another tenant at 111 Huntington Avenue who also is committed to expand by additional floor in 2012 and extend its 100,000 square foot lease until 2024.
Earlier in the quarter, we completed a 33,000 square foot expansion with Towers Watson at the Prudential Tower, and we completed a 10 year expansion and extension for another full floor tenant at 111 Huntington Avenue. Our availability at the Prudential Center, that includes 111, Pru Tower and 101 Huntington Avenue is under 4%.
So, in contrast, the overall Boston CBD market, that’s the Financial District and the Back Bay has a vacancy rate of about 11% and an availability rate of close to 18%, and there are 11 blocks of over 100,000 square feet and some very high quality building still available. Pretty different perspective in terms of what we’re experiencing and what we’re seeing in the market.
In our new project at Atlantic Wharf, we’ve completed an 82,000 square foot lease for two floors in our waterfront building and we have three other office transactions and four retail spaces under lease negotiations that total 95,000 square feet, which will bring the project’s current leasing to 79%, and we have an anticipated yield of about 7% at that development when its fully leased in 2012.
In Cambridge, we have a number of large office technology companies that continue to expand along with the biotech and life sciences industry which is also located very much in Cambridge.
At 1 Cambridge Center, Microsoft just took over 21,000 square feet of availability in September. They’re going to add another 30,000 square feet in January and yet another 62,000 square feet over the next three years as other leases expire, and we’re also in discussions with three other tenants to expand in Cambridge Center.
Dropping down to Washington D.C., in the CBD, we’ve completed the additional leasing at 2200 Pennsylvania, so the office space is now 73% leased and we have commitments for an additional 43,000 square feet, and there is 70,000 square feet of retail which is 93% leased and a 100% committed.
The yield on this project, the office and retail piece is expected to be about 9%, inclusive of the effect of an average ground rent over the next 58 years. So, on a cash basis, we’re significantly higher than that.
Earlier this year, we announced our acquisition of 30% interest at 500 North Capitol, and our plan to convert that building to a market ready speculative product for smaller users that had a desire to work in close proximate to the Capital.
Our D.C. marketing and development team also created an alternative redevelopment plan with an additional floor and a more expensive redevelopment of the building with a goal of attracting a larger private sector tenant.
Well, guess what? We’ve signed a letter to intent to lease a minimum of 165,000 square feet or 75% of that space. The new project is going to have cost us about $120 million, including our existing investment and an expected return of over 9% when it’s delivered in 2012.
In Northern Virginia, we’ve been highlighting the eventual relocation of National Geospatial Agency out of our 700,000 square foot complex. The two original buildings are over 25 years old and are currently use a skiff space.
In September, we executed 523,000 square foot 20-year lease with the Defense Intelligence Agency, so as soon as NGA vacates, in fact, we’re going to ask them to vacate early, and Michael will talk about the impact of that later, they are going to vacate the first building in July of 2011 and then in early May of 2012.
We’re going to invest another $130 million in the redevelopment of these building with an expected return in excess of 8% on that new capital, when the buildings are delivered in ‘12 and ‘13.
There’s one other building on that campus which is the 188,000 square foot building and that was built by us in 2002 for NGA. It will be available in 2012 and given the proximity to DIA and the modern and flexible design, we’re confident we’re going to see strong interest from related defense users for that that building.
Just to the east of these buildings is Reston Town Center. In 2011, we’ll have 445,000 square feet of lease expirations in our Town Center portfolio due to consolidation from acquisitions by Oracle and Northrop Grumman which actually occurred almost 10 years ago when we did the original deals at Discovery Square (inaudible).
This quarter, we completed over 300,000 square feet of leases in our Reston portfolio and we’re finalizing the lease for an additional 80,000 square feet. Now, while most of this activity is a result of a relocation and an upgrade to better assets and superior locations away from total commodity buildings, there is still some incremental growth in each of these requirements.
Again, our experience in Northern Virginia is not indicative of the broad market recovery. The overall vacancy rate on the outside of the beltway continues to be in excess of 16.5%.
Transaction volume continues to be pretty good in New York City too. Overall vacancy in our portfolio is just about 2.4% and our immediate attention continues to be the smaller tenant market given our product availability which has taken on an even greater focus with the addition of 510 Madison Avenue.
This quarter, we completed 14 transactions in New York City and only one was over 20,000 square feet, which was a 15 year lease for 108,000 square feet at 601 Lex. Our pre-built suites have rents that range from a low to mid-50s at 2 Grand Central Tower and Times Square Tower to the high 60s to mid 80s at 599 and 540 Madison to over $90 a square foot at 601 Lex and 399 Park, and well over $100 at 767 Fifth. At 510 Madison, the new building, we expect pricing will start in the very high 80s to low 90s at the base of the building and rise from there into the triple digits.
Overall activity in San Francisco continues to lag our other markets. Tour activity in Embarcadero Center is pretty constant and we’re feeling a little bit better about the activity since we’ve issued eight separate tenant proposals from a full floor to 150,000 square feet on the space that we are going to be having available at the end of this year in EC4, and we did sign a full floor tenant deal this month with average rents of $58 for 10 years for space in the top third of Embarcadero Center 4, so rents there, our view, is low 40s to as much as $60 a square foot at the very top.
Leasing activity is slowly - and I use the word slowly very cautiously picking up in the Valley, but availability is still in excess of 20% and landlords are being very aggressive in quoting tenants. But there is some good news, Google seems to be expanding again in Mountain View, kicking tenants out of sublet space and looking for additional requirements, and we’re hearing about deals in the Palo Alto and Mountain View downtown market where rents on a triple net basis are in excess of $5 or $6 per square foot monthly. These markets are the leading indicators of a Silicon Valley recovery.
Our partner projects at 2200 Penn and Atlantic Wharf is on schedule, and those are going to both be brought into the service in the middle of 2011. We’ve engaged third-party management agencies to assist us with the lease-up and operation of these assets. Our expectations on the yield associated with these new developments are 6% for the $47 million we’re investing in Atlantic Wharf, and 7% for the $150 million investment at 2200 Penn, those are initial yields.
I would note that in the last week, we also signed a contract for the sale of $12 million of historic tax credit at Atlantic Wharf, which is reflected in our overall cost and return calculations there.
We continue to move forward with plans for $140 million in new project in the Urban Core of Reston Town Center, another apartment building, that’s going to have 360 units and 30,000 square feet of additional retail space. Our groundbreaking could be as early as December 2011.
So in total, since our last call we have advanced new redevelopment and development projects in Washington, D.C., including DIA, 500 North Capitol, and the new apartment project in Reston, that’s going to allow us invest about $300 million between late 2011 and 2013.
For the better part of the year and in some cases more than a year, we have been focusing our attention on specific assets in our markets where we view the risks and opportunities, and our operational and financial stakes can come together to create some pretty interesting value for shareholders, but this again is set within the context of an economy that may have limited job growth for an extended period of time.
In this environment, you can’t simply count on dramatic market rental rate increases or dramatic market occupancy increases simply to create value. You have to do it yourself.
When we underwrite these assets, we apply a pretty realistic view of current market economics and we complete a whole bunch of scenario analyses. We believe that under a conservative set of assumptions, these new investments that we’re going to talk about should deliver high-single digit unlevered IRRs, if not better.
510 Madison, this is a 347,000 square foot, newly-constructed, soon to be LEED Gold certified building located in the heart of the Plaza District that has been ignored by the leasing market for the past 24 months due to its ownership status.
The location, the design, the glass line, the building systems, the availability of power, supplemental cooling, and generator capacity, the health club and now our sponsorship will make it one of preeminent boutique buildings in Manhattan, again our asking rents start in the high 80s to low 90s at the base of the building and work their way up into triple digits.
We anticipate that operating expenses in taxes upon stabilization are going to be somewhere in the high 20s to the low 30s, and we’re going to deliver a yield on cost in the low to mid 6% based upon a cost including all tenant improvements, brokerage commissions and carry of about $375,000 million.
Bay Colony; Bay Colony has been as the people in Boston refer to it on ice from a leasing perspective for the past two years. Ownership has transferred four different times and there has been no capital investment in the project or availability of any money for tenant improvement dollars.
For all intents and purposes, leasing brokers would not bring new tenants to the project. Last week we made two presentations to users of excess of 50,000 square feet, and we’re on the shortlist for one of them.
In 2005 the project was sold for $270 million. In 2006, it was sold again for $365 million. It’s now 35% vacant. We intend to invest between $40 million and $50 million of capital repositioning and re-tenanting the project over the next 3 to 5 years.
Our underwriting assumes a prolonged lease up at rents in the high 20s to the mid 30s over the next few years, no growth. On the other side of 128 at the same interchange, we purchased 230 CityPoint in 2005 for $211 a square foot, and surprise, surprise, it was 67% leased. We repositioned that asset, it’s now 98% leased with current rents in the low to mid 30s.
Operating and taxes are approximately $11 a square foot in Waltham, so if we’re able to achieve average rents in the low 30s, our stabilized unleveraged yield on this asset should be in the high single digits. If there is rental rate growth in Waltham we’ll do even better. As a point of reference, replacement costs for new construction in Waltham excluding land is in excess of $300 a square foot, again excluding land.
When the market recovery does in fact happen, Bay Colony has over 500,000 square feet of additional development capacity. We’re working through the transfer of the CMBS fund now, and hope to close this in early December.
John Hancock Tower; the John Hancock Tower is one of the most iconic skyscraper in the United States. It has outstanding rectangular floor-plates that are suited to tenants focused on preventing light and air and window line to their employees and it happens to sit in the Back Bay office market, which has become the strongest submarket in the CBD of Boston.
Boston Properties will own about 40% of the class A office tower market in the Back Bay, which gives us the opportunity to have more products to meet our customers demand, and it appears that this is where customers want to be. The asset is 95% committed, with the recent lease to Bain Capital.
There are three floors available today, and there is strong activity on those floor. The building totals 1.7 million square feet and has parking for 160 cars in it, when the renovation is completed on the lower levels earlier this spring.
In addition, the acquisition includes a 2,100 space parking structure. So, if you attribute $60,000 per stall, just to the cars in the parking structure. The price per square foot of the tower including the new underground parking spaces is $475 per square foot.
There is no doubt there are going to be new buildings that are going to be in Boston. In fact, Liberty Mutual broke ground last week, on a 600,000 square foot, 22 storey building in the Back Bay, where we expect replacement costs including land is in excess of $700 a square foot for this new construction in Boston.
Our expected GAAP yield of Hancock Tower is 6.7%, that includes FASB 13 and FASB 141. On a cash basis, the unlevered yield in 2011 is 4.3%. Why is it so low? Bain’s rent on 15% of the building doesn’t commence until January of 2014, creating a very large FASB 13 balance.
Current rents in the building on a mark-to-market basis yield about $6.25 per square foot, so the building is grossly under-leased from a rental rate perspective as well.
Each of these recent acquisitions was for sale because of the aggressive financial structure that was used to purchase them during the last cycle. There is however an abundance of capital seeking high-quality investments in our markets and it’s resulting in pricing that some may perceive as exceeding expectations from either a value per square foot or cap rate basis.
I have to tell you, we haven’t changed our view on what we are anticipating for the types of returns we’re looking for. We never expected to see double-digit unlevered yields on the kind of assets, the high-quality buildings in sub-markets that we are looking for.
Now, each of our assets that we’re buying have unique risks and opportunities. Identifying those opportunities and challenges, developing long-term relationships with the right tenants; current and future, developing the right plans to reposition buildings, using our sponsorship and spending every day, working these markets is what we do, and it gives us great confidence that we’re going to be able to execute on these new investments and optimistic that, as Mort said, we will be able to find some other assets in the mind that we’re looking for today.
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike who is going to talk about our financial results.

As Doug detailed, we’ve been pretty busy this quarter and have uncovered several terrific opportunities to use some of our cash.

As Doug detailed, we’ve been pretty busy this quarter and have uncovered several terrific opportunities to use some of our cash. I thought I’d start my comments walking through the impact on our liquidity.
After expending approximately $310 million for the acquisition of 510 Madison, our cash position at quarter end is $1.3 billion. We will deploy an additional $330 million upon the closing of the Hancock Tower and Bay Colony deals, and we anticipate repaying another $325 million of mortgage debt in the fourth quarter.
After the completion of this activity, our remaining liquidity, including cash of approximately $600 million and full availability under our $1 billion line of credit provides the capacity to fund the completion of our development pipeline and to continue to be opportunistic in the event we uncover additional acquisitions.
In addition to maintaining our strong balance sheet position, we have good access to a consistently improving and broad range of capital markets. Availability in both the secured mortgage market and unsecured bond markets has been prevalent and we believe we have strong access to each.
This quarter we closed on $130 million mortgage loan on our Market Square North building in Washington D.C. at a 4.85% coupon for 10 years. This reflected a credit spread of about 180 basis points.
Since that time, treasury rates have continued to drop and credit spreads have remained pretty stable in the 175 to 200 basis point area or 65% to 70% leveraged mortgages on high quality buildings. Our bond spreads are also tracking in this range and our current borrowing cost for 10 years in both markets is hovering around 4.5%.
Convertible bond investors are also clamoring for investment opportunities in a market where there has been limited supply of new transactions. We believe we could access the convert market for five to seven year term at coupons of 1% to 1.5% and a premium of 20% to 25% above our current stock price.
Looking at our capital raising opportunities, we have $250 million and $800 million of maturing debt in 2010 and 2011 respectively. As I mentioned, we expect to prepay $325 million of these mortgages by November 1, and the remainder we expect to refinance.
Our largest maturity is our $450 million mortgage at 601 Lexington Avenue that has an above market coupon of 7.2%. This property is significantly under leveraged and we anticipate raising an additional $200 million to $250 million of capital through a refinancing at market rates.
There are two other capital markets transactions that I want to discuss. First, we’ve acquired and refinanced a $267 million mortgage loan for 510 Madison Avenue. This loan in addition to being secured by a mortgage is secured by cash, and it’s a reason for the increase in our cash held in escrows.
The earnings impact of this loan is negligible as the interest income and interest expense are basically at watch and the transaction serves to preserve the mortgage tax that has been already paid in case we complete another refinancing.
The second is an update on our Circle Star building in San Carlos, California. As you’ll recall, this property was owned by our Value-Added Fund and our share was 25%. This summer, after conducting discussions on a loan modification, our lenders elected to sell the Circle Star loan. The new investor, who had a limited appetite for any type of debt restructure, was seeking to buy the property.
Given our view the building which has remained vacant, with current leased economics in the market providing little support for new capital investment, we’ve agreed to transfer the building to the new lender in lieu of the debt.
Now, I would like to shift to our third quarter earnings. We had a strong quarter and reported funds from operations of $1.07 per share, exceeding our prior guidance by approximately $9 million or $0.05 a share.
The portfolio outperformed our expectations by $1.6 million with $1 million emanating from leasing activities with several new leases in New York City, including the 108,000 square foot lease that Doug had mentioned at 601 Lex.
Our parking revenue was up by about $500,000 primarily due to the transient activity at the Pru, and we had higher than expected percentage rent across the portfolio from our retail tenants.
Our termination income for the quarter exceeded our budget by $3.35 million. $3 million of this resulted from transactions where we have worked with tenants that have shadow space in our buildings and successful leased this excess space to existing tenants looking to expand.
This consisted of taking a floor back from one of our larger tenants in our Weston portfolio, and a half a floor back from a law firm at 599 Lexington Avenue. Both of these situations demonstrate how we proactively and cooperatively work with our tenants to maximize the use of our space.
Our joint venture portfolio exceeded expectations by $1.9 million, results came from a mix of better than projected leasing activity in our smaller suite at 540 Madison and Two Grand Central Tower and higher percentage rent primarily from Apple at the GM Building, whose quarterly sales have been well publicized and positively impacted us as well.
Our hotel outperformed again this quarter by $600,000 with average daily room rates and occupancy exceeding projections. REVPAR was up 22% over last year this time. We experienced some savings in our G&A line item coming in roughly $2.3 million below expectations.
The primary driver for this is higher than projected capitalized wages with a substantial quarter of leasing activity with over 1.7 million square feet of lease assigned and our increase in capitalized wages reflects the time our leasing professionals spent on these successful transactions.
Interest expense came in $1 million lower than plan emanating from the early repayment of a $56 million mortgage at Carnegie Center, and higher capitalized interest due to faster outflows on our development projects and the inclusion of 510 Madison Avenue to our development pipeline.
We expected capitalized interest associated with 510 Madison Avenue at our average corporate borrowing rate as we complete the final stages of the base building and tenant improvements bringing the property into service incrementally and ceasing capitalized interest as tenant build out is completed.
Lastly we incurred $1.9 million of unbudgeted acquisition costs. In accordance with new accounting guidance issued in 2009, acquisition costs are expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as had been the practice previously. These costs primarily relate to 510 Madison with a small portion due to the initial legal and diligence cost on John Hancock Tower and Bay Colony.
For the remainder of 2010, we’re not expecting any meaningful changes in the portfolio. Our full year guidance has been increased by the outperformance in the third quarter, some of which such as our New York City leasing will also positively impact the fourth quarter and additionally the capitalization of interest at 510 Madison and the unbudgeted repayment of $250 million of debt will reduce our interest expense.
We don’t expect the closing of the Hancock Tower and Bay Colony to occur until early December at best given the time it takes to assume the CMBS loans, so they will not have a real impact on our earnings this year.
To summarize, excluding termination income, our same-store projections for 2010 are up slightly and now are expected to be up 1% to 2% over 2009 with the improvement coming from the stronger than expected leasing in New York City. These leases are in free rent periods for the rest of 2010, so our cash same-store projections continued to be negative 2% to negative 3%.
Again as we have stressed before we have a substantial amount of free rent in 2010 associated with our leasing program in New York City and at the Prudential Center that will become cash paying late this year and in 2011.
On a quarter-over-quarter basis including the impact of our development placed in service, we expect the third quarter to be good run rate for our fourth quarter GAAP NOI while our cash NOI will improve slightly as free rent burns off. We project our straight line rent for full year 2010 to be $98 million to $99 million including our share of joint ventures and our developments placed in service this year.
Our hotel is expected to come in at $7.5 million to $8 million given the outperformance this past quarter and we’re increasing our full year projection for the 2010 contribution to FFO from our joint ventures to a $147 million to $149 million.
On the G&A side, we expect full year G&A to be $80 million to $81 million. In addition we’re projecting fourth quarter acquisition expenses of $1 million. Our net interest expense projections have improved slightly with the unbudgeted payoff of some of our mortgage debt and the capitalized interest from 510 Madison offset by the reduction in interest income from our lower cash balances. We’re projecting $380 million to $382 million of net interest expense for the full year.
If you combine all of these assumptions, it results in our increasing our guidance for funds from operations for 2010 to $4.35 to $4.38 per share. We expect our fourth quarter FFO to be $1.09 to $1.12 per share. This is the time of the year that we start to discuss 2011 in more detail and I’d like to spend a few minutes providing some insight into our leasing assumptions and our current projections.
As you’ve heard Mort discuss, we’re not expecting fundamental improvements in the economy in the near-term. We expect to continue to operate in a highly competitive environment and while we’ve had a very successful 2010, our leasing projections are cautious as we consider the location and timing of revenue from expiring leases and availability in 2011. Our rental rate projections for 2011 are flat versus current market rents.
Overall, we’re projecting same-store GAAP NOI to decline by 2.5% to 3.5%. On a cash basis, we expect improvement and project cash NOI to be up 4% to 5%. This is an increase of $35 million to $40 million in cash earnings over 2010.
Our same-store cash NOI is increasing substantially in both Boston and in New York City due to the burn off of the free rent associated with Ropes & Gray’s 450,000 square foot lease at the Prudential Center plus the more than 500,000 square feet of space that we leased in New York City at 399 Park and 601 Lexington Avenue.
Our 2011 GAAP same-store projections are being driven by an expected decline in occupancy in Boston and San Francisco, and the negative mark-to-market in San Francisco.
In addition, we will take the first of our Lockheed Martin buildings in Reston that Doug talked about out of service in the summer of 2011. This removes 260,000 square feet of income producing property and results in nearly $4 million of lost income next year.
Our portfolio is currently 93.4% leased. We expect to renew the vast majority of our remaining 2010 exposure. However, we do have 270,000 square feet of uncovered rollover at our Zanker Road property in San Jose, which expires on December 31 of this year.
We expect this space which is currently generating net rents in the mid teens per square foot to remain vacant for an extended period given the slow market conditions in San Jose. This space will impact our occupancy by 75 basis points, and we expect to start 2011 with occupancy in the mid 92% area.
In our existing portfolio, we expect our occupancy to average approximately 92% during 2011. The addition of our acquisitions will dampen our occupancy temporarily by about 45 basis points due to the under leased status of Bay Colony.
Our 2011 expirations are manageable at 8% on the portfolio. In Boston, where we have 840,000 square feet expiring, we expect some modest negative absorption in the suburban portfolio and when Bain Capital vacates approximately 200,000 square feet in October of 2011, we may have a short downtime period prior to the MFS lease commencing.
Our portfolio mark-to-market is negative at $1.19 per square foot. More pertinent than that is our space expiring in 2011, where the mark-to-market exposure is more significant at down 9% or $4.36 per square foot with the majority of this exposure being at Embarcadero Center in San Francisco.
We’ve had the benefit of collecting average rents of over $90 a square foot on 200,000 square feet at Embarcadero Center for the past 10 years.
Unfortunately, these leases, which are the last remaining vestiges from the dotcom boom, are expiring next year. This is some of the highest quality space in the market with replacement rents of about $60 a square foot, but we anticipate experiencing a vacancy period, negatively impacting the contribution from San Francisco.
The straight-line rent associated with our same-store portfolio will be $9 million to $14 million next year. This is down from over $80 million projected for 2010, further demonstrating the increase in our cash revenue next year. We don’t include termination income in our same-store and are projecting $4 million of termination income for 2011, down significantly from $13 million that we expect for 2010.
We will deliver a good portion of our development pipeline next year. We will complete Atlantic Wharf deliver to Wellington its 450,000 square feet of space or 56% of the building in the first quarter and we have another 82,000 square feet of signed leases and 95,000 square feet of letters of intent that will be delivered in the second through fourth quarters, almost 80% of the space.
The residential consists of only 86 units and will be ready for occupancy in the summer of 2011, leasing up over the following nine months to 12 months. 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue is projected to deliver at the end of the first quarter. The two largest tenants totaling 250,000 square feet will take occupancy in the second and third quarters with the remainder later in the year.
We are just commencing the marketing for the 335 unit residential building, which will be delivered late second quarter and likely take 12 to 15 months to stabilize.
Lastly, we have added our 510 Madison Avenue acquisition to our development pipeline. We will complete the base building work later this year and have started the leasing program. Our team is seeing strong activity with multiple tours daily and we believe that the unique amenities that Doug pointed out will result in strong acceptance as a premier plaza district building.
We expect lease-up s to occur incrementally over 2011 and 2012. In aggregate, we’re projecting our development delivery, including the full year for Weston Corporate Center to contribute $40 million to $45 million of NOI in 2011.
A sizable portion of the revenue will be in the form of straight-line rent as many of the leases contain pre-rent periods. 2011 is a lease-up year for each and we don’t expect these properties to achieve stabilization until 2012 or 2013.
In our hotel, we’re projecting that it will maintain its current level of operations and are projecting a contribution of $7.5 million to $8 million to our NOI. For our acquisitions, the John Hancock Tower has stabilized, while Bay Colony will be approximately 65% leased at year end with our projections for full lease-up taking several years.
In 2011, these two properties are projected to contribute an aggregate of $70 million of NOI. The contribution to FFO from our joint ventures is expected to decline in 2011 for two primary reasons. First, the burn off of FASB 141 income in our New York properties of $8 million, and second, the decline in occupancy at 2 Grand Central Tower, due to the vacancy by the GSA of approximately 80,000 square feet this past month.
Overall, the FFO contribution from our joint ventures is projected to be $127 million to $135 million, including FAS 141 income of $70 million. We’re projecting development and management services fee income of $18 million to $23 million in 2011.
And our G&A expense is projected to be $80 million to $83 million, excluding some one-time non-cash expenses relating to our stock compensation plans, our core G&A is expected to be up by 3% next year.
Our net interest expense will be higher next year with the decline in our cash balances from funding the acquisitions and development pipeline, the full year impact of our April bond offering, adding $12 million of additional expense and the inclusion of interest expense from our new acquisitions of $37 million.
Our capitalize interest will be lower by $7 million to $10 million as the interest associated with 510 Madison and our other new developments is less than the amount that drops off as projects are placed in service.
On the positive side, we do have savings associated with our debt repayment activity. Overall, we project our net interest expense to total $425 million to $435 million.
It is important to note that there were a number of one-time income items that we experienced in 2010. These include $12 million of accelerated management fee recognition at 280 Park Avenue and termination income of $9 million above our budget. These items totaled $0.13 a share that we don’t project recurring in 2011.
In conclusion, after putting all of these assumptions together, we project our full year 2011 funds from operation to range from $4.20 to $4.40 per share. Two takeaways are that the development pipeline and our new acquisition, which start to show on our numbers in 2011 have inherent growth as the assets stabilize that will be felt in 2012 earnings and beyond. Second, our conservative absorption projections result in an occupancy rate in the low 90s, providing for future potential growth as economic conditions and demand improves.
That completes our formal remarks. Operator, you can open up the lines for questions.

Mike, you went through it very thoroughly, but without sort of plugging in all your exact figures, just bigger picture. It sounded like you did $1.07 in the quarter with, let’s say, $1.05 if you back out the lease term fees and the acquisition cost that offset one another somewhat, annualizing the $4.20.
And then you’ve got investments vis-à-vis 510 Madison, with the capitalized interest coming on; Hancock, Bay Colony, some contribution of FFO from each as you’ve laid out, and then some new financing contribution related to stuff you’ve already paid down both quarter end. So when I run those numbers together I am getting about a $0.32, I’m getting to $4.20 plus $0.32, $4.52, and you’ve still got $600 million of cash on hand or so. I understand, you’re not layering any additional acquisitions, but just looking at your the bigger items, what am I missing that’s driving the numbers down so significantly off of the run rate you did in 3Q?

I guess, new capital and incremental capital are one way to think about this, replacement capital is other. We have maturities of debt that are going to occur between 2010 and 2012, which we’re trying to take care of. It’s a very low interest rate environment, as Mort suggested, and to the extent that we are able to make sense out of refinancing as much as we possibly can refinance over the next two or three years early, we’re going to think about doing that. And we’ve been thinking about doing that for quite some time, and good news is knock on wood interest rates have gone in our favor, so not having done something hasn’t hurt us yet.
With regards to our overall capital structure, we are looking at our balance sheet, our overall leverage position, and feel really good about where we are today, doesn’t mean that when we add the debt that’s going to be part of the acquisitions that we’re currently doing, that we aren’t sensitive to where our leverage might be on a pro forma basis.
As Mike suggested, we paid some debt down, in anticipation of some of that, but overall, I think that running around with an EBITDA multiple in high 6s to the high 7s is a very comfortable place for us. Now if there was an opportunity to do something additional on the investment side or we thought it was the right opportunity to sell an asset or do a joint venture or do some other kind of capital raise, we would certainly consider those things as well, but we feel pretty good about what our current status is.

So that’s how we kind of calculated what the additional proceeds are.

The reason that we are focusing on smaller tenants is because for better or worse we don’t have any blocks of space available for large tenants. So that’s really where our exposure lies and where the market from our perspective is really at the heart of our current configuration of space. There are some larger requirements that are out in the marketplace. I mean, as an example, Wells Fargo is a tenant that is actively in the marketplace for a consolidation or a time and a re-leasing of its space that’s coming due between 2012 and 2014 or 2015. There are a number of law firms in the 200,000 to 300,000 square foot range, who have leases expiring between 2012 and 2014 on Sixth Avenue and on Park Avenue that are in the market today. One of the new tenant of ours at 399 Park Avenue, Wilmer Cutler. So there are users like that that are very much on a consistent basis with lease expiration driven requirements that are in and about the market.

I mean, it’s really interesting to review the experience that we’ve had in the last couple of years in what has clearly been a very difficult market for the financial world, and New York has come through really remarkably well in part because the financial industry was and will be shall we say assisted by the federal reserve policy and by government policy to make sure there weren’t any crashes, but those days are behind us.
I think you’re going to see a steady growth of activity coming out of this city and my sense is that there will be as Doug was saying there will be a number of tenants who are growing more rapidly than their space availability would support and who are going to be looking for a big blocks of space, and we’re not buying sites on a spec basis at this stage of the game, but they are, we believe, and we still believe the Midtown market is going to be the strongest market in this city. If there are opportunities that come up, we will look at them very carefully. We are not bearish about the longer term perspectives of New York City, nor indeed any of our other markets I mean.
But, if you just look at what’s happened in say just to pick two, Washington and New York. Those are two markets that are going to continue to do very, very, very well we believe over the medium-term, over the long-term, you name it, and the real question is, can you get the best sites available. You see what we did with the site we’re doing on 22nd, and forgot the street name. I mean our project there is doing phenomenally well. We started that project basically on spec, but we were so comfortable about the market and we’ve proven it out and frankly if we could find another site like that, we’d do the same thing all over again.

Well, first of all I think it’s important to note that we have never been big on Tyson because we believe there is no there, there, if you know what I mean? There is no sense of place. There is no common element that draws everybody to a point of activity, whereas, we have exactly opposite out in Reston. There is a significant portion of the tenant population who’ll gravitate toward Tyson because of its adjacency to suburban Maryland and downtown.
However, given that Northern Virginia tenants have got the choice and can go either to Reston or to Tyson. I think the fact that we have developed nearly 3 million square feet of space over the last 10 years to 12 years and stood there today with less than 1% or 2% vacancy in our current portfolio. Whereas the Tyson’s market, including some of the best building there have a vacancy in 5, 10, 15, 20% range really speaks to the differential. Never mind the rental rate premiums we get in Reston.
It goes to what Mort has always talked about over the last 30, 40 years is the fight to quality, barriers to entry, live, work play area, and what we’re seeing that the tenants are consolidating and getting smaller, they now have any opportunity to upgrade and we see in tended to maybe declining by 30% or 40% the space they actually consume, and they will come to us and pay 15%, 20% 30% more they put there all offices in a location where they can recruit, retain and motivate the best and brightest

It has a vibrant financial world, it’s had its ups and downs as we all know, but it’s a very stable political and legal environment in which to invest. It is close to a lot of the European and Russian investors. So it doesn’t surprise me that it has done well. I do think though that if I had to choose, it’s not that I want to diminish the London market, if I had to choose between the vibrancy of the markets that we are in just to take New York and Washington, I would actually choose New York and Washington before London. We also frankly are very interested in looking outside the United States for a diversification on a number of reasons. We are frankly going to look at the opportunity to really put in sort of long-term growth plan for the company and we want to be in a position to do this on several levels.
One of the things that are important is if you’re in other market is to understand, as I say the political and legal structure, and language is a big issue for us. So, we would like to stay within some parameters. We’re not interested in being in every market not even in the United States obviously. So I can understand why people would go to London. If you were in Europe and if you were in Eastern Europe, and if you were in particularly in Russia, I would go to London in a big way. I think that’s a very big, very good market to be in and one that is very, very solid politically and legally. And that’s a big issue for those folks.
So I think that’s a factor that we have here as well, but the distance is an issue for a lot of people, and I think there is also a feeling that in many ways the New York or the U.S. markets are much more competitive, that it’s a much tougher market to really break into in a serious way. I don’t know more than that about the markets because we really haven’t spent a lot of time on the European markets. I have looked into London several times, and there is a different nature of the way they lease buildings there and how they measure. A lot of them are ground leases there so there are differences in the London market compared to where we are. We have operating platforms here in this country and that makes a very, very big difference in terms of where we want to invest money. And I think it applies to other people as well I mean so that’s why they would go to London rather than come here.

I think I heard you say that yours have remained flat, and as interest rates have come down and as you look at either deals that you haven’t won or in your discussions with institutions investors, are they holding their equity returns flat or are they bringing those down?

But the transactions that we are looking at are generally centered in our core markets. They are generally centered on properties as Mort would describe as Class A assets, the best buildings in our market places, not just another building to add to our market exposure in any of those markets.
I would say, we think there is more opportunity where there is some challenge with regard to the operations of those assets because that gives us an ability to underwrite and use our market clout to think about ways to reposition and re-tenant building that maybe different from someone else’s which may allow us to be more competitive, i.e., pay more than another people in a particular asset. So that’s sort of the type of assets we are looking at.
With regards to our other investors, I think that, overall, core investors are looking for unleveraged returns that are probably, maybe 100 basis points lower than where we would prefer to be which is i.e., 6.5% to 7.5%, and move up from there. I will tell you that the way we approach this is we take a pretty conservative view of what we think is going to happen which honestly is predicated on our macro view which Mort has expressed pretty eloquently about the overall recovery of the economy and our ability, in the buildings that we are taking a position or an interest in, being able to improve our share of market, not our improvement in market conditions.
If we can generate high single digit IRRs, we think we’re doing real well and then you layer in leverage on a moderate basis, be it on a corporate or on a property level basis in the 4.5% to 5.5% range, which is where things are, we think we can get to low double-digit returns on equity which quite frankly is what we think is a very smart way to invest capital given our portfolio and the risk tolerance that we have and our shareholders should have.

I think that there is a whole serious group of investors who are also looking for security as well as return. I am not saying they are not looking for return but I think they have a different balance between security and return for all kinds of internal reasons in their home countries, and this is where I think we have also a comparative advantage because of the recognition of the assets we have and the record of the company and the confidence they have in the management of the company.
And so we are frankly quite regularly approached by people who would like to invest with us in individual buildings, and if anything, this has increased in the last year, and this is something we’re going to look at quite seriously because this is a way of, in a sense, leveraging our management platform and our operating platform as well.
So, as I say, it’s not just yield that I think drives these investors. For a lot of them it’s just having the long-term confidence in the asset and in the markets that these assets are placed, and that’s where we think quality assets really make a difference, and people will accept, shall we say, lower returns, more competitive returns in order to have these other qualities in terms of long-term values and the security of the market, the partner, the country, etc.,

We pay this as much as we had to pay and as little as we had to pay to purchase the asset, so we weren’t looking to pay more or less than we otherwise would have had to. We made the clear decision that owning space in the Back Bay on a long-term basis would be a great thing for Boston Properties and that there are lots of synergies from a tenant perspective with and an operating perspective with our existing portfolio of 1.2 million square feet (inaudible) and 900,000 square feet at 111 Huntington Avenue, and 500,000 square feet at 101, and the fact that we now have 100% of the space above the 23rd floor on any building or 24th floor on any building in the Back Bay, and that there won’t be any new buildings that are build under.
Our expectations are maybe higher than that, and from a replacement cost perspective will be so much more expensive that, we’d have a great, great basis in the property. We are buying 2,100 additional parking spaces and a great garage structure that is well located in the Back Bay, and on a long term basis we think that our platform will be great because we are going to be able to drive more people to live, play and work, and most importantly in the Back Bay market.
So having more product in that marketplace is a great thing to have, and when it happens to be in one of the most iconic buildings in the United States, with terrific floor-plates, with vision glass from ceiling to toe, and views that knock everyone’s socks off, we think it’s just a phenomenal asset to add to the portfolio and we think we are going to do really, really well with it over an extended period of time, and we’ve recognized that the overall return in the next few years because of leasing, is what it is.
I mean to be honest with you had the rents been higher or the rent commenced earlier our expectation would have been that we would have to pay significantly more for this asset than we ultimately ended up paying. So I guess we are the beneficiaries of the leasing in the building as well as having to deal with their returns in the short term.

I just don’t see that things are going to improve much and they maybe even deteriorating somewhat, not in a major rate but at minor levels for several years. I mean, if you look at all the academic studies about what we should call it, recessions that were initiated by a financial crisis, they go on for at least twice as long as the recessions indicated or provoked by excess inventory of either inventories or plant and equipment spending.
It’s going to be a very difficult time in my judgment, politically and economically for several years. And I don’t think there is much of a chance that interest rates are going to be changed. Bernanke is already talking about QE 2, and what the real message is, we’re going to have interest rates at very low levels for quite a long time.
The reason for that of course is that fiscal policy is more or less blocked by politics, and if you get, as it is almost a highly predictable outcome, the Republicans dominating either one of the houses, you will not get any fiscal stimulus of any significant through this Congress for at least two years, and given the weakness of the economy which I think the Fed understands better than most, anything that happens is going to be through monetary policy and that means they are going to flood the country, I don’t know with how much, they are going to probably announce how much they are going to be spending on QE 2, but it’s going to be in the hundreds and hundreds of billions. That’s going to keep liquidity flowing through this system at very low rates for a quite a long time. I mean; I’ll say a minimum of two years.

That is to say, we can get forward commitments on financing, and secondly, we have the great advantage of being a public company where we have access to the public market, and I think we want to take advantage of all of these things whichever seems to be comparatively the best options we’re going to pursue, and we’re going even though it might not be the way to absolutely enhance our short-term earnings, we want to have the availability not just to finance existing buildings but to make additional acquisitions because we think the next several years are going to be a wonderful opportunity to do just that as Doug was saying at costs that are way, way below replacement cost.
The Hancock building is way, way below the replacement cost, and that is an absolutely first class asset, almost a dominant asset in the best part of the City at Boston. It supplements our position because it’s right next door to the Prudential Center. It gives us a phenomenal place in that market. We would do that again if we could find a similar situation, and we intend to be very active, at least in looking, if not in finding, and we’re certainly going to make sure that we have the financial wherewithal to do that because sooner or later we believe we’ll get those opportunities. I mean, they don’t work in any kind of regular basis.
You just have to be out there in the market and talking to people and we have a lot of credibility in that marketplace when it comes to acquisitions and the recent number of acquisitions, I mean, the Hancock building, I’d be looking to Hancock building for several years, and we’re very happy to have that asset in our portfolio, extremely happy and there are others that we would like to have and we’ll just have to see whether there is a time when we can strike. We want to be in a position to strike and strike quickly, I mean, the 510 Madison Avenue, we did that in a nanosecond because we had the financial wherewithal to do it. We didn’t worry about that we would be able to pay off the first mortgage, and what is called the senior mezz, it used to be in the good old days.
You had a first, second and third mortgage, but these days we call the first mortgage as senior mezz and a junior mezz. It’s a much more elegant way of describing it, but that’s basically where we were. We just went in and we were prepared to pay $0.100 on the $1, and that’s what made it possible for us to make that deal.
There will be other situations similar to that and we will not hesitate to move on that basis. In fact there is another transaction in New York that just took place on a similar basis, where they stepped in until the third position and basically said, we’re going to pay off the mortgage, and that gives you control of the building. It’s a different way of acquiring buildings. First time, we have ever done it that way, but it really worked.

The other thing I would point out is that our straight line rent is going to be down pretty dramatically, so our cash spend is going to up, so our cash flow above our dividend should be higher in 2011 than in 2010.
The other non-cash items we have that are significant are the FAS 141, which from the JV is about $70 million and then it’s about $8 million from the new acquisitions. And non-cash interest expense, which is APB 14-1 that’s associated with our exchangeables, that’s going to be about $30 million. It’s actually coming down a little bit, because of the Hancock building and Bay Colony have above market debt. But basically we would expect our cash flow above our dividend to be somewhere in the $100 million and $125 million range.
