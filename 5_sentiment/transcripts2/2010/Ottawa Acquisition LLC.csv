As we reported in our press release this morning, preliminary first quarter 2010 diluted earnings per share were $1.33 compared to $0.96 per share for the same period in 2009.
Let me now turn things over to Rick, for the discussion of our first quarter results, and our annual outlook for the 2010 earnings.

Compared to 2009, first quarter 2010 diluted earnings per share reflect higher operating income at our gas distribution and other energy-related businesses, as well as improved corporate results, partially offset by lower operating results at our shipping business. The first quarter comparisons also reflect lower pre-tax equity investment income, and a higher effective income tax rate in 2010.
As expected, our first quarter 2010 gas distribution operating income was up compared to 2009. First quarter comparisons reflect the benefit of the rate release approved [ph] in 2009, partially offset by the decreased natural gas deliveries, due to 5% warmer weather in 2010 compared to 2009. Regarding the weather variance, while both years were colder than normal, 2009 was just more so.
Gas distribution operating results were also impacted by lower operating and maintenance cost, including lower bad debt expense, and lower company use in storage-related gas costs. As a result of the Illinois Commerce Commission’s approval of the bad debt tracker in February 2010, Nicor Gas recognized a $31.7 million pre-tax benefit attributable to 2008 and 2009’s net under-recovery of bad debt expense. As we mentioned in last quarter’s call, the benchmark against which 2010 actual bad debt expense will be compared is approximately $63 million.
The key takeaways from an economic perspective versus the bookkeeping that you will see with respect to bad debt is that in 2010, we received $32 million pre-tax in the benefit for 2008 and 2009, I just mentioned, and that our 2010 annual cost, net of rider billings and excluding the $32 million, will be $63 million. Finally, first quarter 2010 gas distribution operating income compared to 2009 reflected higher depreciation expense.
Nicor Gas’ annual outlook for 2010 operating results remains in line with our earlier expectations, which as we indicated in our February call, we expect to be higher than last year’s levels.
Moving to our shipping segment, Tropical’s first quarter 2010 operating results were lower than 2009, due to the effects of continued challenging market economics on shipping revenues. While Tropical’s 2010 first quarter shipping volumes were essentially unchanged year over year, rates in the first quarter were soft.
In February’s call, we indicated Tropical’s 2010 results were expected to be comparable to 2009. Tropical’s quarterly results did come in less than anticipated. Management is working to offset the negative impact of these lower revenues in a number of ways. We have stepped up our revenue enhancement efforts including selective rate increases, and specific customer targeting. In addition, Tropical is implementing additional cost containment initiatives such as headcount reductions, elimination of an additional charter vessel, alteration of shipping schedules, and completion of the consolidation of certain warehousing operations. These efforts are in addition to the aggressive steps Tropical took last year to respond to lower shipping volumes we saw in 2009.
Since economic challenges began impacting its business in mid 2008, Tropical has significantly reduced its overall headcount and made operational adjustments focused on asset utilization that have reduced operating cost to reposition this business for the current economy. We believe these efforts will reduce but may not totally offset the negative effect of lower than expected revenues in 2010.
Our other energy ventures first quarter 2010 operating income was up compared to last year, due primarily to higher income at our retail products and services business, partially offset by lower results at our wholesale natural gas marketing business. We currently estimate that both businesses will perform in line with earlier expectations. First quarter 2010 corporate operating results compared to 2009 were up primarily due to the weather related impact associated with certain of our retail utility bill management products.
Finally, first quarter 2010 comparisons reflected the absence of the gain recorded in the first quarter of 2009 on the sale of the company’s equity stake in a joint venture EN Engineering of approximately $10 million pre-tax or $6 million after tax.
Moving to our 2010 earnings guidance, we estimate 2010 diluted earnings per common share will be in the range of $3.10 to $3.30. This range is the same as our guidance provided in our earnings call on February 24. Consistent with prior guidance, our annual outlook excludes among other things, any future impacts associated with the ICC’s performance-based rate plan and purchase gas adjustment reviews, other contingencies of further changes in tax laws.
Our estimate also does not reflect the additional variability in earnings due to fair value accounting adjustments, and other impacts that could occur because of future volatility in the natural gas markets. Our estimate for Nicor Gas assumes normal weather for the final three quarters of the year. As a reminder, we will provide updates to our annual earnings outlook only as part of our quarterly and annual earnings releases.
With that, now let me turn things back to Russ for a wrap up.

First of all, our consolidated Q1 financial results were solid and in line with our prior expectations. At Nicor Gas, our continued focus on managing cost and enhancing our already industry-leading operating efficiency metrics will enable us to remain on track to meet our full-year outlook for this business.
As Rick mentioned however, Tropical shipping continues to face challenges given the economic conditions in its service territories. We are actively managing our costs and we are right-sizing this business. We are taking actions on all fronts including addressing headcount, look at all hiring charters, and reducing sale links [ph] to certain quarters. It is important to remember that first quarter volumes were right where we expected them to be, but that we still have work to do on rates. Looking ahead for our other energy-related businesses, we continue to expect full-year operating results will be in line with our earlier expectations.
Finally, let me reiterate that Nicor remains very strong financially with credit ratings that are the highest in the industry. Our cash flows remain strong and enable us to continue to pay a solid dividend to our shareholders, something we have done now for 56 consecutive years. And with those closing remarks, we will now be happy to take your questions.

Good morning everyone. Excluding the mercury item that Kary just mentioned, Q3 2010 diluted earnings per share compared to 2009 reflected higher operating income at our gas distribution and other energy related businesses, partially offset by lower operating income at our shipping businesses and lower corporate operating results. For the year to date period 2010 versus 2009 comparisons, excluding the aforementioned mercury item, reflected higher operating income at our gas distribution and other energy related businesses, as well as improved corporate operating results partially offset by lower operating income at our shipping business. The nine month ended comparisons also reflected lower pretax equity investment income and a higher effective income tax rate in 2010.
Gas distribution operating results for the Q3 and year to date 2010 periods were up compared to 2009. Year to date comparisons reflected the benefit of the rate relief approved in 2009, partially offset by decreased natural gas deliveries due to 10% warmer weather in 2010 compared to 2009, and lower interest on customer balances. Year to date gas distribution operating results were also impacted by lower operating and maintenance costs including lower company use and storage related gas costs, lower pension expense, and lower reported bad debt expense. As we’ve mentioned in previous calls, a bad debt tracker was approved in February, 2010, allowing Nicor Gas to recognize a $31.7 million pretax benefit in the Q1 of 2010 attributable to 2008’s and 2009’s net under-recovery of bad debt expense. The benchmark against which 2010 actual bad debt expense will be compared to is approximately $63 million.
The key takeaways from an economic perspective versus the bookkeeping that you will see for bad debt is that in 2010 we received $32 million pretax benefit for the years 2008 and 2009 as I just mentioned, and our 2010 annual costs net of (inaudible) revenue and excluding the $32 million will be $63 million. Finally, year to date 2010 gas distribution operating income, compared to 2009, reflected higher depreciation expense.
Nicor Gas’ annual outlook for 2010 operating results remains in line with our earlier expectations, which as we indicated in our August call, we expect to be higher than last year’s levels. With Illinois difficult economy, we have seen modest declines versus our budget and weather-normalized demand, but we have managed our costs effectively through the first nine months of the year in order to mitigate this negative impact. As a result, we continue to expect a solid performance by Nicor Gas.
Moving on to our shipping segment, Tropical had Q3 operating income lower than 2009 and lower than our earlier expectations. As we have discussed in previous calls, we are seeing softness in our volumes and rates due to the effect of the challenging market economics in the Caribbean and the Bahamas. While we believe we are generally maintaining our market position, overall demand appears to be down. Tropical’s management implemented a number of initiatives in 2009 and 2010 focused on revenue enhancement, asset utilization, and reduction of controllable costs to offset the negative impact of lower than anticipated results. These initiatives have partially but not entirely reduced the negative bottom line effect of lower than expected revenues. As a result, we currently estimate that Tropical’s full year 2010 after tax earnings will be approximately $18 million.
Our attention remains on efforts to both minimize the short-term impacts of this economic environment and to position Tropical to enhance its long-term value. We took another step in this effort last month when we acquired the assets of VI Cargo Services. While this acquisition was small in relation to Tropical’s total volumes, it continues the strategic expansion that we have seen over the past couple of years of our footprint in the Caribbean region for less-than-container-load volumes.
Moving on to our other energy ventures, our other energy ventures year to date 2010 operating income was up compared to last year due to higher operating income at our retail products and services business and at our wholesale natural gas marketing business. We currently estimate that our other energy ventures will perform in line with our budget, even though our current estimates for the Q4 gas prices push about $3 million of previously anticipated 2010 GAAP net income out in the future years. Year to date 2010 corporate operating results compared to 2009 were up due to the weather related impact associated with certain of our retail utility bill management products. Finally, year to date 2010 comparisons reflected the absence of the gain recorded in the Q1 of 2009 in the sale of the company’s equity stake in a joint venture, Ian Engineering, of approximately $10 million pretax or $6 million after tax.
Moving now into our earnings guidance, we currently estimate 2010 diluted earnings per common share will be in the range of $3.00 to $3.10 versus the $3.10 to $3.30 guidance from the Q2. As I previously mentioned, Tropical’s lower than anticipated operating results were the driver for this revision. Consistent with prior guidance, our annual outlook excludes among other things any future impact associated with the ICC’s performance-based rate plan and purchase gas adjustment review, other contingencies, or further changes in the tax law. Our estimate also does not reflect the additional variability in earnings due to fair value accounting adjustments and other impacts that could occur because of future volatility in natural gas markets. Our estimate for Nicor Gas is based on historical weather patterns. As a reminder, we will provide updates to our annual earnings outlook only as part of our quarterly and annual earnings releases.

First, Nicor’s consolidated financial results for the first nine months of 2010 were modestly less than we had originally anticipated, but they were good considering the current overall economic environment, especially in the markets that Tropical serves. At Nicor Gas, we delivered year to date results that were modestly ahead of budget as our tight cost controls and intense focus on operating efficiencies helped to offset the impact of lower gas deliveries due to warmer weather and the weakened economy. These continued efforts are expected to enable us to achieve our full year outlook for this business.
Tropical Shipping faced challenging market economics in its service territories throughout the first nine months of the year. Progress has been made on revenue enhancement and on cost containment strategies that we believe help reposition Tropical for the current economy. We continue to focus on aggressively managing controllable costs to offset the negative impacts of lower revenues in this business. And in particular in the Q3, we took additional steps towards improving our performance with selected rate increases operational adjustments focused on asset utilization. Also, as Rick mentioned, the purchase of VI Cargo Services was another addition to our strategic expansion of the more profitable less-than-container-load business in the Caribbean. This acquisition, though relatively small, further demonstrates Tropical’s ability to take advantage of opportunities, even in the current downturn. Our other energy related businesses continued to perform well, and we expect full year operating results will be in line with our budget. We’re also pleased to have received approval last month from the CPUC for our Central Valley gas storage project in Northern California. That was an important step in our plan to develop these storage assets to serve the West Coast markets, and we look forward to starting construction on this process at the beginning of the coming year.
In closing, let me reiterate that Nicor remains very strong financially with credit ratings that are the highest in our industry. Our cash flow remains strong and enables us to continue to pay a solid dividend to our shareholders, something that we have now done for 56 consecutive years.
