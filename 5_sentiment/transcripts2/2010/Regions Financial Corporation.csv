We appreciate all of you joining Regions for our fourth quarter earnings conference call. In the fourth quarter, we took further aggressive actions to improve the risk profile of Regions' balance sheet, which resulted in a loss of $0.51 per fully diluted share. Throughout 2009, we have taken steps to proactively recognize and reserve for credit related problems, improve our operating efficiency, bolster our net interest margins and strengthen customer service and relationships. As a result, Regions is centering 2010 with a stronger foundation and a more effective and competitive business model.I'm confident about Regions future and the opportunities but acknowledge that we, along with our industry, still face some near-term credit and economic challenges. There is no better person I believe than Grayson Hall to guide Regions through the new decade and ensure that Regions is fully prepared to realize its attractive profit potential once these current headwinds dissipate. As you know, I'll be retiring at the end of this first quarter, at which time Grayson will become the Chief Executive Officer of Regions.During his 30 years with Regions, Grayson has played an instrumental role in growing and reshaping this company. His excellent leadership skills, along with a strong senior management team and a very talented and hard-working group of associates, make me confident that Regions will prosper for years to come.

We are obviously not pleased with either fourth quarter or full-year 2009 earnings loss but believe that actions we've taken to be prudent and in the best interest of Regions over the long-term. Our immediate focus is to best position our organization for a prompt return to profitability and we're taking aggressive and appropriate actions to make this happen. As part of our effort to reduce balance sheet risk, we have charged off an appropriate reserve for problem credits. Our example, we increased the allowance for credit losses by a net $1.3 billion in 2009 with approximately $500 million in the net increase to reserve occurring in the fourth quarter. To put this in perspective, loan-loss provision and OREO cost totaled $1.2 billion or $0.65 a share in the fourth quarter alone and $3.7 billion or $2.33 per share, full-year 2009.Credit-related costs, while remaining elevated should begin to decline in 2010, given our 2009 proactive stance towards credit-loss recognition and prudent reserve build.Non-performing asset growth and gross non-performing loan inflow have slowed for the past two quarters albeit at an elevated level, and investor interest in problem-asset purchases appears to be increasing. These improvement suggest non-performing assets have the potential to peak and start to decline towards the middle of this year. This economy, and in particular, its impact on employment and commercial real estate, will largely determine the level and timing of the peak of non-performing assets.We are encouraged by some of the recent trends but remain cautious about the pace and substance of improvement. We clearly see improvement in our credit quality metrics but remain measured in our forecast regarding the pace of improvement.Later in today's discussion, Irene and Bill will provide more details on credit quality. But in summary, let me say we're making steady progress in derisking Regions' balance sheet and in positioning the company for a prompt return to profitability.In 2009, we also reduced interest rate risk and were first [ph] Regions' multi-year net interest margin decline. Fourth quarter marked the second consecutive period of stabilized net interest margin and the actions we have been taking on loan and deposit pricing should produce an improving margin throughout 2010. While we don't anticipate an interest rate increase until later this year, rising short-term interest rates could meaningfully benefit Regions' margin, positively affecting our future net interest income growth. We are not satisfied with our net interest margin performance and continue to focus our efforts and attention on improvement opportunities. We are targeting a net interest margin at or above 3% by the end of this year.Improving deposit mix, fueled by a strong, low-cost deposit growth has been and continues to be a significant contributor to our margin stabilization. Average low cost deposits grew over 3% linked quarter and were up nearly $8 billion or 14% year-over-year. We are taking market share in virtually all of our major markets with an increased share at 15 to 16 states where we operate. At the same time, our deposit costs have steadily fallen, dropping by 11 basis points linked quarter, or 66 basis point since the fourth quarter of 2008. Our deposit gains reflect the success we've had in improving customer service, deepening customer loyalty and attracting new customers.For example, in the fourth quarter alone, we added over 246,000 new consumer and business checking accounts, beating our full-year goal of 1 million new accounts. And today, we have 4.3 million active checking accounts at Regions. From a lending perspective, we are actively making prudent loans to credit-worthy customers. In 2009, we made 167 new and renewed loans to businesses and individuals, totaling $65 billion. We are making $250 million in new and renewed loans every business day and we are actively seeking new relationships and strengthening existing ones as we take advantages of disruptions in this market place. Nevertheless, the economic backdrop remains challenging, and generally speaking, loan demand has reflected the economy at large and still remains weak. We are experiencing record loan pay offs and historically weak line usage [ph] more than offsetting our efforts at the originations. As a result, net loan outstanding climbed quarter-over-quarter. However, the good news is the majority of our loan declines have been in the commercial real estate outstandings and has have a favorable impact on our overall risk profile. We are focused on growing earning assets, in particular, small business lending where we're starting to see an improvement. Earning asset growth may prove to be more challenging in 2010 and gives us every reason to focus on loan growth where opportunities exist primarily in small business and in commercial lending.Breaking business performance down from a wide business perspective, consumer services had a solid year, with customer satisfaction scores ending in the Top 50 of large U.S. banks as measured by Gallup. Not only do we crest the 1 million new account thresholds, a 27% improvement year-over-year, but we significantly improved our consumer checking household retention rate to above 90%. To focus on sales and customer service, support is strong checking household and deposit growth. In fact, consumer households increased on a net basis by 6% this year to over 3 million consumer checking households.Deposits generated through our retail branches grew accordingly, increasing 5% during the past year including $4 billion or 10% in low-cost deposits. In addition, we held over $8 billion of primarily high-cost certificate of deposits maturing in the first quarter and giving us an opportunity to further improve our deposit mix.This shift to a greater proportion of low cost deposits has helped drive a 69-basis-point improvement in retail deposit cost and our average deposits per branch has improved to $52.1 million. To maintain this momentum, we continue to invest in our technology and infrastructure. We have one of the technology projects in the company's history that will provide the latest generation of technology in our branches and positions us to take advantage of the competitive opportunities in the marketplace and provide even more efficiency in higher loans and sales and service. Our strategic focus is on growing the consumer line of business and making sure our consumer teams have the best tools in the industry. Now let me move to mortgage lending. In mortgage lending, we had a record year with production of $9.6 billion compared to the previous year's $5.4 billion of production. Our number one ranking in customer satisfaction among primary mortgage servicing companies when J.D. Power and Associates attest our Straight N [ph] on our commitment to this important core consumer product. We continue to believe that our mortgage loan relationship leads to an opportunity to further expand in other profitable bank products.Our Business Services line of business continues to focus on profitability. Looking more closely than ever at structure, terms, upfront fees and interest rates spreads. To that end, commercial loan ongoing spreads continue to expand in the fourth quarter, up 98 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2008 and now stands at 254 basis points above LIBOR. Today, 76% of the business services loan portfolio with its variable rate base, the majority tied to LIBOR which has been challenging in the interest rate environment we faced in 2009, but positions us well for the eventual rise in rates.We have been implementing rate floors on new loans but currently only have 12% of our business loans paying at the floor and this will not prove to be a material drag on earnings when rates rise. Specific to small-business lending, we're particularly encouraged by our progress and prospects as Regions was recently recognized as number one small-business lender among traditional lenders, as measured by the Small Business Administration. Plus, according to J.D. Power and Associates, we moved up more than any bank in the latest small business customer satisfaction survey [ph]. In fact, line utilization for small business stands at a strong 57%, as compared to commercial lines that appear to have stabilized at about 41%.Deposit growth from business relationships was tremendously strong in the fourth quarter and through 2009, up 4% this quarter and 12% annually. Deposit mix improved as well with interest-free deposits growing 7% linked quarter and 34% year-over-year. Mix improvement, combined with disciplined pricing and improved market conditions has led to a drop in business services deposit cost by 54 basis points during the past year.Now let me turn for a moment to Morgan Keegan. We continue to experience growth with Morgan Keegan at a challenging market. In 2009, we added over 80,000 new brokerage accounts and increased customer assets by $12.5 billion. Progress on new business has led to revenues of $337 million in the quarter, bringing annual revenues to just under $1.3 billion for the year, very respectable given the challenging market environment. The Fixed-Income business segment led the way this quarter, continuing its record-setting pace helped by institutional customers' demand for government mortgage-backed and municipal securities.  Retail brokers risk revenue also improved, driven by higher improving equity markets, as well as the addition of 18 new financial advisers. We continue to gain confidence and ability to grow our business at Morgan Keegan and to deliver consistent and improving profitability.Now let me shift my comments to actions taken to improve efficiency. In 2009, we made considerable headway in lowering our core expense base and anticipate additional efforts and improvements in 2010. Unusually high recession and credit-related costs such as higher OREO, professional fees and FDIC premiums are more than offsetting our expense-reduction efforts and this is likely to continue into 2010. But ultimately many of these expenses will revert to more normalized level. Meanwhile, we're continuing to diligently identify unnecessary expenses, [indiscernible] more efficient operating processes, continue to rationalize staffing models across our business units and aggressively review any consolidation opportunities. In many cases, we are continuing to invest capital and commit expenses to achieve a better business model for the future. But long-term we're building a more efficient business that will serve us well as the economy improves.During 2009, we reduced headcount by approximately 2,300 positions while maintaining record-high levels of service quality and record new account sales. All in all, I'm confident that we are on the right path to both proactively deal with our credit problems and improve the long-term earnings potential of this franchise. As the economy recovers and credit cost begin to moderate, we'll see improved bottom-line results and return to profitability at normalized levels.Now let me close my comments. But before I do, I want to personally recognize the contributions that Dowd Ritter has made to this organization, and the tremendous leadership he has provided over his 40-plus years of service to the company. His leadership has proven invaluable. It's an honor and a humbling challenge to be assuming his leadership role and responsibility for sustaining our direction. Regions has now a standing franchise in some of the best markets in the country, a dedicated and talented workforce and great customers, most of which can be attributed to Dowd's leadership and strong business vision, but most importantly, his focus on customers and disciplined execution of our business plans. I believe his attributes [ph] will consistently reward shareholders over the long term with solid returns. With that, I'll turn it over to Irene."

Fourth quarter's bottom line reflects the operating environment as well as continued effort to improve our balance sheet's risk profile. In addition and very importantly, we continue to make progress in improving the fundamentals of our organization.As shown on Slide 1, average low-cost deposits rose $2.1 billion linked quarter, driven by an approximate 5% pick up in non-interest-bearing deposits and a 3% increase in money market funds, but more than offset a drop in higher cost certificates of deposits, Earning assets rose 1% with security purchases more than offsetting a decline in average loans which continued to beadversely impacted by weak demand and line utilization. The net interest margin was steady as expected, with ongoing positive shift in funding mix, countered by the impact of maturing interest rate swaps. As a result, net interest income was up slightly.Fourth quarter non-interest income included the $96 million loss on sale of primarily non-agency securities, equivalent to $0.05 per share after tax. A $71 million gain related to leveraged lease terminations, it was slightly more than offset in income tax, lowering net income by about $3 million or less than $0.0050 per share.  Absent these items, non-interest income was down about 3%.Non-interest expenses adjusted for $41 million of branch consolidation and valuation related costs recorded in the third quarter and about $12 million in the fourth quarter, was relatively unchanged, although still elevated primarily due to a rise in professional and legal fee.Our capital position remains strong with Tier 1 Capital an estimated 11.6% and Tier 1 Common at 7.2%. As expected, credit costs remained elevated during the quarter as we recorded a $1.2 billion loan loss provision, exceeding net charge offs by $487 million.The net charge-off ratio was an annualized 2.99% of average loans, compared to third quarter's 2.86% with the increase driven by higher residential-related consumer losses. As a result of provisioning over charge offs, the period-end allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans increased by 60 basis points to 3.43%.Non-performing assets, excluding loans held for sale increased $376 million or 10% linked quarter, well below third quarter's $662 million increase and the lowest quarterly dollar increase in 2009.As anticipated, CRE was the most notable contributor to non-performing loans and charge offs. Importantly, both gross and net non-performing asset growth continued to moderate in the fourth quarter.  Loan-loss allowance average of non-performing loans stood at 0.9x at year-end, up from 0.82x last quarter.Bill will cover credit in more depth in a minute but let's first talk about the other aspects of our quarterly results. In terms of fourth quarter balance sheet changes, loan demand reflected the broader economy which was generally soft. More specifically, commercial and real estate construction demand was especially light with 2% and 15% portfolio drops, respectively. This slide illustrates that although our commitment levels remain high, commercial utilization rates were declining through the year-end and are substantially lower than in a normal environment. Nevertheless, we are beginning to see some stabilization and are continuing to search for and extend loans to credit-worthy customers. There is no doubt that we are poised to growth balances once the economy improves and demand returns to more normal levels.In terms of funding, growth of low-cost deposits continues to be strong across the board, including those from consumer, small business and commercial sources. Slide 3 illustrates the outstanding customer deposit growth we have achieved over the last five quarters, driven largely by interest free and money market accounts. Much of this success can be traced to new account openings. In fact, as Grayson mentioned, during 2009, we exceeded our company-wide goal of opening 1 million new checking accounts for consumers and small businesses.Our signature bundled product, Regions' LifeGreen Checking and Savings helped fuel that growth. Robust low-cost deposit growth has significantly benefited our overall funding mix, replacing higher-cost certificates of deposits.Improving new account generation and customer retention are increasing our deposit market share. The most recently released FDIC market share data showed that we had a great year in terms of market share gain. As indicated by the upper pointing arrows, we gained market share in 15 out of our 16 states, taking our state market share ranking higher and fixed of those 15 states.As expected, the fourth quarter net interest margin was flat to the prior quarter. Solid low-cost deposit growth, a catalyst to improving funding mix is positively impacting our net interest margin. However, in the fourth quarter, incremental benefits were largely offset by the impact of interest rate swaps that matured in the fourth quarter and higher non-performing assets.These items combined would have resulted in a 17-basis-point decline in the fourth quarter margin had it not been for the improved deposit cost and loan spread which brought us back to the forecasted stabilized margin.A steady net interest margin, combined with a higher level of investment securities produced fourth quarter net interest income of $850 million. Looking forward into 2010, we expect the margin to gradually improve throughout the year. Organic momentum in the form of CD repricing and continuous loan spread improvement will be the main drivers. Also inherent in this forecast is our expectation for a modest late-year rise in interest rates. Our goal is to reach a 3% or better NIM margin by year end.Reported non-interest revenues were 7% lower than third quarter. However, as mentioned earlier, fourth quarter revenues were impacted by $96 million loss on sale of primarily non-agency securities. A derisking measure as well as a $71 million leverage lease termination gain that was more than offset in income taxes. Excluding their effects, non-interest income was 3% lower, as higher brokerage revenue is driven largely by Morgan Keegan, as Grayson touched on earlier, were more than offset by lower hedge-affected mortgage revenues. The mortgage interest rate environment trended lower during the quarter, driving up origination volume of $2 billion, compared to third quarter's $1.8 billion. Refinanced activity represented 56% of originations, up from third quarter's level of 54%.During the quarter, we continued our efforts of eliminating credit risk from the balance sheet by selling $1.3 billion of investment portfolio securities, including commercial and residential non-agency mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds. We reinvested those proceeds into agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. As a result of these actions, as well as securities transactions completed earlier in the year, the investment portfolio now has very minimal risk to CMBS, non-agency mortgage-backed securities or municipal bonds and has shorter duration as well. Today, over 99% of our current investment securities portfolio is agency guaranteed. While we did record a loss this quarter, for the year, securities transactions resulted in a $69 million gain.Notably, total service charges were relatively unchanged third to fourth quarter. However, in October, we announced that we'll be modifying our dollar limit and daily occurrence caps related to existing NSF and OD policies during 2010. These modifications are expected to cost us $40 million to $50 million for the year 2010.  We continue to work on reining in our baseline non-interest expenses, excluding branch consolidation and valuation write-down costs, non-interest expenses were relatively flat linked quarter.  During the quarter, improved personnel efficiency was a catalyst to the $12 million or 2% drop in salaries and benefit costs. In 2009, we lowered headcount by approximately 2,300, including a fourth quarter reduction of nearly 500. In addition, through consolidating supplier relationships, negotiating better contracts and fine-tuning staffing models, we continue to control discretionary spending. Nevertheless, headwinds in the form of elevated FDIC and other real estate cost persist and are obscuring our progress to some extent. The good news here, as Grayson described, is that we expect many of these expenses to recede as credit-related issues return to more normalized levels.In 2010, we'll continue to work diligently to improve our cost structure, while continuing to make appropriate investments in developing our businesses. As you're aware, in the first quarter, we will consolidate 121 branches into existing locations at an expected annual pretax net savings of $21 million. We will seek other opportunities to pare back costs. Of course, environmental cost will have a significant bearing on this year's ultimate expenses. Let me wrap up with our strong quarter-end capital ratios. Our Tier 1 Capital ratio now stands at 11.6% while Tier 1 Common ratio is a very solid 7.2%. And now let me turn it over to Bill Wells to go over our credit metrics."

Let me start by sharing some context for this quarter's credit result. Since the merger of Regions and AmSouth in November of 2006, a part of our business strategy has been to accelerate the disposition of problem assets and take losses",1035,"Thank you, Irene. Let me start by sharing some context for this quarter's credit result. Since the merger of Regions and AmSouth in November of 2006, a part of our business strategy has been to accelerate the disposition of problem assets and take losses as soon as possible and to confront issues early from the company's long-term benefit.The moderation in credit metrics we are now seeing is, at least in part, a result of those actions. At the merger, we recognized that the new Regions had too much real estate and too much land. We put in place new credit policies that put moratoriums on commercial real estate, centralized credit approvals and sold the subprime mortgage company in March 2007. Shortly thereafter, real estate and the economy deteriorated significantly. We were among the first to segregate our homebuilder portfolio and discuss it publicly in January of 2008. Since then, we have aggressively disposed the problem real estate. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we sold our mark-to-market and moved to held for sale $1 billion of non-performing loans. We described them at that time as the worst of the worst, primary land and condos. We have continued to aggressively dispose the problem loans through 2009. These actions have helped produce a continuing decline in NPA migration and stabilization in charge offs.Now turning to the slide, charge offs stabilized with a $12 million increase from the third quarter. As you can see, the components reflect our active asset disposition program and record sales of NPAs shown in orange. Business service losses were driven by higher valuation charges of $215 million in the fourth quarter versus $191 million in the third quarter. Overall, consumer losses accounted for the linked-quarter rise which reflects continued high unemployment. You will recall, the SCAP stress test was $9.2 billion in losses for 2009 and 2010 cumulatively. For 2009, that would equate to $4.6 billion against our actual performance of $2.25 billion. Said it other way, 50% of the stress test period is over with actual results equal to 25% of what was expected.Consistent with our message at the investor conference last July, we are very pleased with the continued declining trend in NPA, especially the net number of $376 million versus $662 million in the third quarter. Our proactive sales program which included over $500 million this quarter, coupled with marks and transfers to help our sale, helped drive down the net NPA migration.During the fourth quarter, we only restructured approximately $50 million [ph] of non-performing loans. And looking forward, we had the opportunity to do substantially more in the first quarter and beyond.This is another look at non-performant [ph] migration. Land, condos, single family, what we have traditionally called home builder and condo, continues to decline. Income-producing commercial real estate is down notably since last quarter, a very important point. Furthermore, our condominium exposure is now under $600 million. This chart gives detail around our disposition program. During 2009's fourth quarter, we had a record sales of $510 million, and we moved an additional $133 million of non-performing loans to held-for-sale. The discounts on problem loan sales and loans that were marked to market were at 29% versus 34% last quarter. As illustrated in the chart, over the last five quarters, we had disposed of approximately $2.7 billion of problem assets. Our aggressive sales march [ph] and movement of loans to held-for-sale had helped us achieve the positive result in our NPA migration.Here I wanted to explain our troubled debt restructurings, because they are often misunderstood. The overwhelming majority of Regions' TDRs are residential first mortgages. In addition, over 97% of all consumer TDRs are accruing interest. TDR status is a function of our proactive customer assistance program, which allows customers who are having financial difficulty to make payments as low as interest only. We have also made less than $1 million in principal balance concessions since the start of our customer assistance program. We strongly believe that giving customer short-term relief, no matter how small, will prove beneficial for them as well as the company. While our strategy does lead to higher TDR levels under accounting guidance, the business results have been positive. Regions recidivism rate is just over 16%, much better than government-sponsored programs. And our foreclosure rate is less than half the national average.This slide summarize the credit costs we had discussed. During the fourth quarter. net charge offs stabilized. NPA migration continued to decline, and we had a record loan sales of over $500 million at lower discounts than in previous quarters. Additionally during the quarter, we've provided approximately $500 million over charge-offs with [ph] allowance for credit losses.Finally, over 90-day past dues were up only $45 million from the third quarter. Mortgages [ph] consumer accounted for $40 million of the growth, in line with rising unemployment. This slide shows a comparison of delinquencies and foreclosures. You could easily see the impact Florida has on the portfolio. Our lower foreclosure rates reflects the quality of our portfolio coupled with our proactive customer assistance program that I mentioned before.Given our substantial exposure to commercial real estate, we felt it only prudent to continue our reserve build in the fourth quarter to mitigate the risk. However, if our trend of declining migration of loans to a non-performing status continues on the current trajectory and the economy continues to mend, the need for continued reserve build may be over.Before I close, let me quickly touch on the topic that has gotten a lot of press recently. Potential exposure to loans originated and serviced for the GSEs [government-sponsored enterprises]. Unlike many of our competitors that have large post-sale and correspondent lending channels, virtually all of our mortgage loans originated in-house via retail channel to strict underwriting and documentation standards. In addition, we have comprehensive and effective controls in place to limit repurchases from the agencies. Audit procedures are performed monthly. And finally, our repurchase reserve is reviewed on a quarterly basis. Based on the nature of our portfolio, the rigor surrounding its management and based on our actual and forecast losses, we feel that we are appropriately reserved. With that, I'll turn the call back to Dowd for closing comments."

Earlier, Regions reported a first quarter loss of $0.21 per share. This loss is in line with our internal expectations and is a notable improvement from the $0.51 per share loss we repor",1975,"Good morning, and thanks everyone for your time and attention today. Earlier, Regions reported a first quarter loss of $0.21 per share. This loss is in line with our internal expectations and is a notable improvement from the $0.51 per share loss we reported in the first - or fourth quarter of 2009. We are encouraged by the continual - continued financial progress. But clearly, no one at Regions is satisfied with this performance. And we're focused on our efforts to return to a - and sustainable profitability. We did clearly see credit and recession related expenses, improved (inaudible). They do remain elevated and continued to more than offset our strong underlying core earnings.
I can assure you that my primary focus is returning the company to a level of sustained profitability. Getting back to profitability may not happen as promptly as any of us would desire, and we've got a lot of work yet to do. But I tell you today that I am convinced that we have the right team and we're taking the right actions to not only restore Regions' profitability, but more importantly, to build a stronger business model and a stronger franchise that will produce competitive long term financial performance.
We have strategic priorities that we are confident will return our company to profitability. We're keeping our business focused on the customer. We're building for our future. We're restoring our financial performance. And we're committed to executing with excellence. We are absolutely keeping our team focused on the customer by historically and expanding our customer relationships with valued products and excellent service, and retaining more customer relationships than ever before. These priorities are our business guidelines for how we operate.
We're building for our future by de-risking the balance sheet, aggressively addressing credit issues, and making sure our capital liquidity levels remain strong. And we will restore our financial performance by growing and diversifying our revenue base as well as improving our operating efficiency. The key factor to returning profitability is strong execution across the organization. And we have solid business plans for paying attention to the bills and driving for results with clear goals and accountability to prop results.
Looking beyond first quarter's bottom line, there's significant evidence that our priorities are being achieved. But keep in mind it may take some time to fully realize the benefit of these initiatives in a slow growth, higher unemployment operating environment. But more importantly, during the first quarter, we continued to de-risk our balance sheet by appropriately charging off and providing for problem threats, proactively liquidating foreclosed assets, and reducing exposure to higher risk loan portfolio segments. As a result, loan loss provision and OREO costs, including a $70 million net addition to our loan loss reserve totaled $812 million, impacting earnings on a per share basis of $0.42.
We continue to see a credit related costs elevated, but stabilizing and moderate. Assuming modest economic growth, we estimate that these costs may have peaked. In addition, we continue to forecast the absolute levels of non-performing assets will peak at mid-year. As anticipated and forecasted, gross in-flows and non-performing loans were down for the third consecutive quarter, an important factor in the continued trend of slowing net non-performing asset formation.
Of particular note is that internally risk-graded problem assets, a leading indicator of future non-performing assets, are showing much improvement. In fact, they have declined for the first time this quarter since 2006, an important milestone.
As Bill Wells will discuss in a few moments, non-performing asset levels are benefiting from our consistent charge-off policy as well as an active problem asset disposition program. First quarter problem asset dispositions were $689 million, including non-performing assets, exceeding fourth quarter $643 million in discounts have continued to improved as it clearly appears that investor demand for problem assets is improving, another encouraging sign for our future non-performing asset formation.
Additionally, we are disciplined in managing balance sheet risk with our pro-active approach to reducing high-risk portfolios. In the first quarter, we reduced investor real estate loans by $1.3 billion or 6% through sales charge offs and pay downs. Our ultimate target is to lower this portfolio to 15% of total loan portfolio. We fully acknowledge that our exposure to this lending segment has been elevated, but we were encouraged by the progress we achieved at aggressively reducing this exposure by $3.1 billion over the last five quarters. We fully expect our efforts to demonstrate strong improvement in the upcoming quarters. Of course, reducing investor real estate, combined with the general act of loan demand, has pressured overall loan balances, which is frankly one of our company's and our industry's most significant term - near term challenge. While we are disappointed in this quarter's contraction in our loans, let me assure you that we have an all out effort to grow balance where it's prudent to do so.
As a foundation and goal, we've made right progress in growing our customer base. In fact, we've increased market share in both small business and commercial lending. Further, recent consumer application volume has risen substantially. There's little doubt that once we get help from the economy, we are opposed - poised to grow our loans outstanding to customer. This focus on growing and retaining customer relationships is critical to our long term success.
The first quarter deposit metrics validate we remain on the right path. In fact, during the quarter, we opened 248,000 new business checking accounts. This puts us on track to exceed 2009's record-breaking phase. Customer retention continues to form well above industry norm. (inaudible) sales have improved up to 4% during the last year. And recent customer service surveys give us a high mark relative to our competitors, with customer loyalty metrics now surpassing the 90th percentile of competitors. Excellent service continuous to drive strong costumer private roads, which results in an average 2% for the first quarter. But more importantly, average low cost deposit increased over 6% in the first quarter, driving an ongoing positive shift in our funding mix, away from higher priced consumer CDs, and giving us confidence in future improvements in the net interest margin.
As expected, the core revenue was down slightly towards the first quarter, primarily due to seasonal factors, but also continued to reflect the slowing - slowly improving economy with weak loan demand and reduced customer transaction activity. But our net interest margin, as expected and as forecasted, grows five basis points late quarter. And we still remain confident in our ability to execute and to achieve a 3% percent margin by year 2010.
We have substantial improved in our deposit mix and that combined with better loan pricing has benefited our margin and will have strong re-impact in future orders. Throughout the first quarter, about eight-day analysis for higher rate CDs matured. With the bulk of these in these forms migrating in the lower cost instrument such as money market, RCDs, with an average ongoing rate of approximately 180 basis points, lower than the CDs you replacing. I will pointed out that the full impact of the shift will not be realized until next quarter as these instruments mature over the full duration of the first quarter.
Another $10 billion of higher cost CDs are scheduled to mature over the balance of this year. We continue to have clear focus on executing our plans to achieve a better interest margin for the future. David Turner will provide more details on revenues and loan finances a few moments. But I will note that line utilization levels appear to have stabilized both for commercial and small business customers, which is a first day afterwards ultimate growth and outstandings. And with the initiatives we have underway, I feel confident of our ability to take advantage, not only of the increased lending opportunities, but opportunities to leverage customer relationships to incremental sales across our franchise and our business units including brokerage, mortgage, cash management, insurance, and other lines of businesses.
I'm particularly encouraged our progress in control of operating expenses which on a quarter basis declined about 3% late quarter. As expected, the seasonal jump in payroll and benefits cost was more than offset by lower professional fees and reduced OREO expense. Credit and environmental expenses, such as professional fees can be volatile quarter-to-quarter, but we're nonetheless encouraged by first quarter reduced level.
Additionally as we had earlier indicated, we successfully completed the consolidation of the 120 branches in late first quarter. We should provide on a net basis $21 millions in cost savings, starting and fully anticipated in the second quarter. We continue to aggressively control day-to-day operating expenses and seek opportunities to further improve our efficiency. As an example, we have reduced headcount to 2,400 positions since this time last year, benefits of our cost control efforts should become increasingly evident over time the recession-related calls return to more normal levels.
Before I close, I just wanted to briefly touch with Morgan Keegan, which has been receiving a tremendous amount of media attention as of late. We have the right business plan in the place of Morgan Keegan. And I'm very pleased with our performance. Despite pressure on fix income revenues this quarter, they come in warranty and rose $7 million or 39% as compared to prior quarter. This result is largely driven by solid private clients, solid equity capital markets, and consistent trust revenues as well as overall reduced operating costs. Net new brokerage account openings increased 5% on a late quarter basis, reflecting of outstanding inter-company referrals, which are in the highest level in our history.
Total investment assets under administration now stand $149 billion, having grown 19.7% year-over-year, and 2.4% late quarter. That said, we are fully aware of the right to foreign legal challenges related to certain Regions Morgan Keegan select funds, which is a business we exited in 2008. Recently, as previously announced, the SEC and other regulatory state authorities have brought administrative proceedings against Morgan Keegan related to these fines. These actions at this point were of no surprise to us. We have been cooperating with the investigations for over two years now. We will continue to work to file these charges and any knowledge as raised by these irregularities as expeditiously and as prudently as possible.
Our commitment is to work cooperatively with our customers, with our regulators, and with our states to achieve a prompt and fair resolution. Most importantly, we're not letting this become a distraction or get in the way of our primary goal, which is building and retaining long term customer relationships.
In summary, the challenges aren't behind us, but I'm more convinced than ever that we got the right team and the right strategy to successfully execute Regions return to profitability and build a stronger franchise for the future. As we emerge from the economic recession now operating in a much different business model, regions are working hard to be part of the solution and rebuilding customers' trust and confidence in the financial services industry and in Regions' financial. As I said earlier, we understand that the growth of the business can be critical to stay focused on the customer, and as such, we've made this our top priority.
I'll now hand the call over to David Turner, our recent promoted Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional details about first quarter results. But before I do, I will make a quick introduction for those of you who aren't familiar with David and his background. David has been with us since 2005. Before coming to us, he was an audit partner with KPMG, working primarily on financial institutions. We are very fortunate to have someone on board with such extensive industry experience combined with in-depth knowledge of regions to this important position in our company. David?

Let's begin with the summary of results for the quarter on slide one. Although our first quarter results reflect the loss per the diluted share of $0.21, our core business showed further strengthening. We co",2003,"Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with the summary of results for the quarter on slide one. Although our first quarter results reflect the loss per the diluted share of $0.21, our core business showed further strengthening. We continued to improve the risk profile of our balance sheet. And importantly, our credit metrics are at or are closing in on thick levels. Net interest income, after adjusting for mortgage servicing rights hedge activity, was stable late quarter and was higher by $22 million or 2.8%, compared to the same period in the prior year.
We continued to achieve strong deposit growth, with average low cost deposits of $4.2 billion or 6.5%, helping drop total deposit costs down 15 basis points to 1%. The net interest margin increased to 2.77% as a result of the increase in net interest income as well as 2% decline in average earning assets.
Our targeted reduction in higher risk credits, such as investor real estate along with soft loan demand, caused a reduction in earning assets. First quarter non-interest income included a $59 million gain on sales plus CMO securities, compared to a $96 million loss in the fourth quarter. Additionally, non-interest income includes a $19 million gain related to leverage lease terminations, compared to a $71 million gain in the fourth quarter. Average lease gains - leveraged lease gains were essentially offset by income taxes in the respective quarters.
After securities transaction and leverage lease gains non-interest income declined approximately 1% late quarter, largely due to a $21 million decline in brokerage revenue and a 4% decline in service charges reflecting lower transaction activity as is typical during the first quarter of the year. Non-interest expenses declined 3% late quarter, after excluding a $53 million loss on early extinguishment of debt as well as branch consolidation cost of$8 million in the first quarter and $12 million in the fourth quarter.
Lower professional and legal fees drove the improvement by the economy approximately $42 million. From a credit perspective, we reported $770million loan loss provision, which exceeded a net charge offs by $70 million dollar. As a result, our allowance for loan losses increased 18 basis point late quarters to 3.61% of loans at March 31st. Net charge offs were essentially flat rising only to $8 million. The net charge off ratio grows to annualized 3.16% of average loans, compared to fourth quarter's 2.99 % primarily resulting from a decrease in average loans. Our charge offs continued to reflect our aggressive efforts to de-risk our balance sheet and dispose of problem assets. Our modest provision over charges the slowing of the increase in performing loans.
Now on performing assets, excluding loans held for sale, increased $221 million dollars or 5% late quarter. This marks the third consecutive quarterly decline in the level of in-flows to non-performing status. Our loan loss allowance coverage of the non-performing loans stood at 0.86 times at quarter-end compared to the year-end level of 0.89 times. Lastly, our capital position remains strong, with a Tier 1 capital at an estimated 11.7% and a Tier 1 common at an estimated 7.1%.
Let's take a deeper look into the quarterly results. In terms of first quarter balance sheet changes, slide two shows that loans declined $2.5 billion. As you can see, the main driver of this decrease was the investor real estate category, which as previously mentioned, is by design the result of our focused portfolio reduction efforts. The $1.1 billion late quarter decline in average outstandings reflects the fact that we haven't originated many new loans of this type for some time, coupled with continued pay downs and charge offs. Looking closer at commercial lending, slide three illustrates that commitment levels remained solid. And for the first time in several quarters, utilization rates have begun to level off, although at a substantially lower level than in a normal environment.
Despite the challenging environment, we continue to search for and extend loans to credit worthy customers. In fact, there in the first quarter, we originated an $11.6 billion of new and renewed loan commitments, including $2.2 billion to consumers, $1.5 billion to small businesses, and $7.9 billion to other commercial customers. There is no doubt that our customer base is strong and getting stronger. We are positioned to as grow balances as the economy improves and customers begin to refill the inventories, make new capital investments, and begin expanding their business.
On the liability side, we're especially pleased with the ongoing rapid growth in low cost deposits as shown on slide four, which is having a significant positive effect on our funding mix and cost. This growth allowed us to reduce higher cost certificates of deposit by $2.3 billion on average in the first quarter. Of note, liquidity is very strong with a ratio of loans to deposit of 90% at March 31st, down significantly from 102% one year ago.
Moving to slide five, there is no doubt that the environment has played a role in driving deposit balances as both businesses and consumers are holding on to more cash these days. But beyond that, we have grown our (inaudible) base with innovative products and retained existing customers with service and satisfaction levels that are higher today than at any point in our history. To reiterate Grayson's earlier comment, we opened over 1 million new checking accounts for consumers and small businesses in 2009, and then validated that after with an additional 248,000 new accounts in the first quarter of this year. These accounts are yielding substantial amounts of low cost funding. We are continuing to take advantage of disruptions in the marketplace to win new customers and expand the relationships with existing customers.
As noted on slide six, quarter pre-tax pre-provision net revenue, PTNR, was up this quarter, and the (inaudible) outlook is improving. The last few quarters' negative PTNR trend has been driven mainly by net income pressure largely a result of our assets and stiff interest rate position and rising non-interest expenses, primarily a result of increasing recession-related expenses. First quarter results indicate that these items impacting PTNR will improve going forward.
First quarter recession-related expenses, while still elevated, declined to 15% of core non-interest expense from fourth quarter 2009 18%. It is unlikely that it will return to 2007's pre-recession level of 6% anytime soon since costs such as elevated FDIC expenses are not likely to abate. However, we believe that they will continue to decline this year as non-performing assets decline and the economy continues to recover. Moreover, net interest expense - net interest income, the largest driver of PTNR, is also on track to substantially improve. Let's look at the details of that front.
As noted on slide seven, fully tax full equivalent net interest income of $839 million was essentially flat late quarter after adjusting for the impact of MSR hedge activity. As I previously noticed, this was achieved despite a lower earning asset base and is a result of our continuing efforts to change the mix and cost of our deposit base. Our resulting net interest margin expanded five basis points to 2.77%. Solid look at - low cost deposit growth and resulting improved deposit mix are positively impacting our net interest income and margin, and should continue to do so throughout 2010, particularly in the second half.
As Grayson mentioned, we re-priced over $8 billion of CDs, having an average rate of 3.26% in the first quarter, whereas the average going on rates new CDs was approximately 1.42%. We have approximately $10 billion of CDs maturing over the remainder of this year, which will be subjected to market rates as they mature.
From a loan yield standpoint, we have been successful on our efforts to raise our going-on loan rates. Although these efforts have yet to be fully realized, our loan yields increased three basis points from 4.27% in the fourth quarter to 4.30% in the first quarter of this year. We expect that further deposit mix, costs, and loan spread improvements will lift our net interest margin to 3% by year-end. This forecast does not assume any meaningful help from rising interest rates. In fact, as can be seen on slide eight, our current forecast doesn't call for rates to rise meaningfully until early next year. As a result, we put short term hedges in place that has temporarily reduced our asset sensitivity. However, as you can see in the slide, the substantial benefit of higher rates to net interest income in 2011 and beyond is not effective.
On slide nine, reported non-interest income was 13% higher than in the fourth quarter. However, excluding leverage lease termination gains and securities transactions, non-interest income declined 1%. The main driver was a $21 million decline in brokerage revenues owing largely to the pressure six-income revenues mentioned earlier. Non-interest income was also impacted by a 4% decrease in service charges, reflecting a seasonal drop off in transaction activity. Note that announced NSFOD policy changes related to the dollar limit and daily occurrence caps began to take effect on April 1st. In addition, policy changes associated with regulation E expected to take place in the third quarter will also impact service charge revenues.
These changes, along with other customer fees or reduced service charge revenue by approximately $70 million annually based on preliminary estimates. Mortgage income was essentially unchanged late quarter, excluding the effects of MSR hedging activity. Origination volume of $1.4 billion was still historically strong, but was down versus the prior quarters $2.0 billion with 45% representing new purchases in the first quarter, compared to 17% a year ago.
As I mentioned, we sold securities during the quarter, recording a $59 million gain in sales of $1.4 billion of shorter duration, collateralized mortgage obligations. Proceeds were reinvested into newer issue CMOs with a slightly longer duration.
Turning to non-interest expenses, slide 10 reflects a core non-interest expenses dropped approximately 3% late quarter due largely to lower legal and professional fees. Although overall levels continue to be inflated by recession-cost, we fully expect a substantial amount of these costs to subside as the economy recovers.
In the meantime, we continue to closely monitor and control discretionary spending, specifically, legal and professional fees decline $42 million late quarter driven by lower Morgan Keegan, and credit related costs. Additionally, other real estate expense declined $22 million late quarter. Other items of note include salaries and benefit expense, which increased only 2% for the first quarter as we remained focused on fine tuning staffing models and improving personnel efficiency. As Grayson touched on, we have reduced headcount by 2,400 or 8% in the last year alone. In addition, we have reduced discretionary expenditures, such as marketing and travel, by approximately $29 million or 46% relative to the fourth quarter of 2008.
We also prepaid about $1.5 billion of FATLP advances, realizing a $53 million loss reflected in other non-interest expense. With the expectation of this will be slightly accredited to the margin in 2010.
Slide 11 shows that capital ratios remained strong at quarter end. With the Tier 1 capital ratio that now stands at an estimated 11.7% and a Tier 1 common ratio estimated at a very solid 7.1%. Touching on capital planning, we have strengthened our capital planning process, which includes various scenario analyses, including stress testing under adverse conditions. This robust process includes the development of macroeconomic forecast, significantly improved credit modeling, and financial and capital or forecasting using various scenarios. These scenarios consider all types of risk that could affect the company over a given period of time. We believe this improved process has allowed us to better determine our capital requirement in a timely manner.
Wrapping up, we're clearly not satisfied with first quarter's bottom line results, but we are making substantial progress in our efforts to return Regions to profitability. And we are firmly committed to successfully executing our strategy.
Now I'll turn it over to Bill for a run through of credit.

Starting with slide 12, let's begin on revealing non-performing asset migrations. We expect non-performing assets to peak in the second quarter and decline thereafter. In fact, internally risk rated problem loans have declined late quarter,",817,"Thanks, David. Starting with slide 12, let's begin on revealing non-performing asset migrations. We expect non-performing assets to peak in the second quarter and decline thereafter. In fact, internally risk rated problem loans have declined late quarter, which is the first time that has happened since the end of 2006. This decline comes after considerable effort over the past year to improve the discipline and consistency of our risk rating across the franchise. This foundational component is how we manage our portfolio strategy as well as the loan loss reserve.
Based on sharp and continued recent declines of internally risk rated problem asset migration, which is the source of future non-performing loan formation, we feel confident that absolute levels of non-performing assets will peak in the second quarter. The land, condos, single-family grouping, which we have traditionally called homebuilder and condo, is still a driver of in-flows, but continues to decline. The performance of income-producing property loans has remained relativity stable as compared to last quarter. Results of our pro-active disposition program, detailed on slide 13, helped drive down the NPA migration.
During the first quarter we recorded problem asset dispositions totaling $689 million, which included $87 million of non-performing loans moved to held for sale. Continuing the trend, discount on problem loan sales and loans that were mark-to-market improved this quarter to 23% on average as compared to 29% last quarter. This reflects a combination of an improved market for loan sales as well as that focused on strategic bars, rather than bulk sales. As illustrated in the chart, over the last six quarters, we have disposed of $3.4 billion of problem assets.
Now, turning to charge offs. Our risk management strategy has been to confront issues early and accelerate the disposition of problem assets, primarily those secured by investor real estate and take losses as soon as possible. Partially, as a result of this strategy, charge offs have remained relativity stable as seen on slide 14 to the last three quarters and should begin to moderate as of second half of 2010.
Within total charge offs, business service losses were driven by lower valuation charges of $198 million in the first quarter versus $215 million in the fourth. Despite continued unemployment, consumer losses remained relativity stable, increasing just $5 million late quarter. Finally, the cost of non-performing loans sales in March dropped $5 million from the last quarter. We sold more for less.
Let me put net charge offs in terms of progress against the stress test, which is you might remember I said $9.2 million in combined losses for 2009 and 2010. Through bank quarters of the eight quarter stress test term, our losses represent 51% of the $5.75 billion projected in the supervisory capital assessment program. Said in different way, we're about two-thirds for the stress test period and only experienced a third of the losses. We continue to believe the guidance we gave quite a while ago in our investor day in July of 2009 still holds that we will be somewhat here at the midpoint of our $3.4 billion to $5.9 billion two-year loss range. The primary reason for the difference is that investor commercial real estate, while very stressed has not deposit as rapidly or with the long severity originally projected in the stress test.
On slide 15 as an update on our troubles at restructurings, these balances declined $302 million from the fourth quarter. As you may know, if TDRs performed as a new term for a six-month period crossover at year-end and yield the market right, they can be removed from the TDR classification. This was the driver of our late quarter decline. An important point to note is that 92% of rated TDRs are consumer real estate loan. In addition, 96% of all consumer TDRs are accruing interest. Nearly all of our consumer TDRs are a function of our pro-active customer assistance program, which has been beneficial to Regions and our customers alike. Of note, Regions' (inaudible) right is very low. And our foreclosure rate is less than half the national average.
Slide 16 points toward further improvement for 2010. A de-risking of the portfolio has occurred and evidenced by the reduction of our land, homebuilder, condominium, and overall real - investor real estate portfolios. Additionally, the construction loan portfolio has been reduced from $9 billion at the beginning of 2009 to currently at $4.7 billion. All of this de-risking has resulted in the decline of problem loans based on our internal risk rating. Given what we know today, we reaffirm our investor day, July 2009 guidance, and expect NPAs and charge offs to peak by the end of the second quarter and decline thereafter. Based on all of the above, we expect no further reserve bill on the second half of the year.
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Grayson for closing comments.

The pace at which we've been able to reduce that portfolio has exceeded our internal expectations. We're very encouraged by how we've been able to execute on that strategy. It is declining a little faster than we had anticipated. All of that is good news.
The second part is that it was our full intention to grow other lending product types at a pace that would offset that contraction in investor commercial real estate. I do think that what you see when you look at our lending activities that we have been able to keep commitments to our costumers very high. They've been very stable. Our commitments continue to expand and will continue to add costumers to each and every week. Unfortunately, utilization rates have continued to fall through all of last year. The good news is they have stabilized or appear to have stabilized at this juncture. And we got an opportunity to grow on earning assets going forward.
I do think, when you look at non-interest expense, the non-interest expense growth has been - has been largely due to credit-related, recession-related expenses. Our core expenses in terms of expenses that are being spent in our business units with our producers on the frontline, we've continued to manage those expenses down and feel very good about the lower operating efficiency that we'll be able to demonstrate once this credit starts to moderates. But this quarter, we saw some moderation in those expenses. The more of these problem assets we can move off the books, the less carrying costs we have with them. And so, we think once this trend line starts to improve, you are going to see our expenses really start to demonstrate what we've done to the company.

That's why we've been very aggressive in our disposition program. But what I'd also say, truth is when you look at our - we look at our internal pipeline, non-performing assets migration, we start to see that come down even more.
The other thing I would say is, when you keep these two things in mind when you look at it, look at our payments that we've had on non-accrual loans that went up quarter-over-quarter based from about $88 million to about $128 million. So you're still handling a good (inaudible) of payments coming in, so I think you're still wrestling around with a little bit of this performing, non-performing issue, which we think we'll continue to resolve.

And you’ll always get into a reflection point that in a cycle, are we getting close? We'll see if the credit metrics will do. We'll point it out. But there're a couple of things that we look at. One is the continued de-risking with investor real estate portfolio, especially the construction book as I mentioned earlier. What you're seeing under construction book moved from about $9 billion at the first of 2009 to a little under $5 million. That's starting to rake risk of one part out of the portfolio.
Our valuation charges continue to moderate, which is another positive trend. And as we really talk about our potential problems that we see coming to the pipeline, it's really the driver of what we see our reserve methodology should be. If and always, the discussion that you have internally, we're very focused on it. But we bill a lot. We have a very solid reserve and continue to feel that way.

Earlier, Regions reported a first quarter loss of $0.21 per share. This loss is in line with our internal expectations and is a notable improvement from the $0.51 per share loss we re",1949,"Good morning, and thanks to everyone for your time and attention today. Earlier, Regions reported a first quarter loss of $0.21 per share. This loss is in line with our internal expectations and is a notable improvement from the $0.51 per share loss we reported in the fourth quarter of 2009. We are encouraged by the continued financial progress, but clearly no one at Regions is satisfied with this performance, and we're focused on our efforts to return to a pawn of sustainable profitability. We did clearly see credit- and recession-related expenses improve link quarter. They do remain elevated and continue to more than offset our strong underlying core earnings. 
I can assure you that my primary focus is returning the company to a prompt level of sustained profitability. Getting back to profitability may not happen as promptly as any of us would desire, and we've got a lot of work yet to do. But I tell you today that I am convinced we have the right team, and we're taking the right actions to not only restore Regions' profitability, but more importantly, to build a stronger business model and a stronger franchise that will produce competitive long-term financial performance. 
We have strategic priorities that we are confident will return our company to profitability. We're keeping our business focused on the customer, we're building for our future, we're restoring our financial performance, and we are committed to executing with excellence. We are absolutely keeping our team focused on the customer by strengthening and expanding our customer relationships with valued products and excellent service and retain more customer relationships than ever before. These priorities are our business guidelines for how we operate. 
We're building for our future by de-risking the balance sheet, aggressively addressing credit issues and making sure our capital and liquidity levels remain strong. And we will restore our financial performance by growing and diversifying our revenue base as well as improving our operating efficiency. The key factor to returning to profitability is strong execution across the organization, and we have solid business plans, we're paying attention to details and driving for results with clear goals and accountability for prompt results. 
Looking beyond the first quarter's bottom line, there is significant evidence that our priorities are being achieved. But keep in mind, it may take some time to fully realize the benefit of these initiatives in a slow growth, higher unemployment operating environment. 
But more importantly, during the first quarter, we continued to de-risk our balance sheet by appropriately charging off and providing for problem credits, proactively liquidating foreclosed assets and reducing exposure to higher-risk loan portfolio of segments. As a result, loan-loss provision and OREO cost, including a $70 million net addition to our loan loss reserve totaled $812 million, impacting earnings on a per share basis of $0.42. 
We continue to see credit-related cost elevating but stabilizing and moderating. Assuming modest economic growth, we estimate that these cost may have peaked. In addition, we continue to forecast the absolute levels of non-performing assets will be at midyear. As anticipated and forecasted, gross inflows of non-performing loans were down for the third consecutive quarter, an important factor in the continued trend of slowing net non-performing asset formation. 
Of particular note, is that internally risk-rated problem assets, a leading indicator of future non-performing assets, are showing much improvement. In fact, they have declined for the first time this quarter since 2006, an important milestone. As Bill Wells will discuss in a few moments, non-performing asset levels are benefiting from our consistent charge-off policy, as well as an active problem asset disposition program. 
First quarter problem asset dispositions were $689 million, including non-performing assets exceeding fourth quarter's $643 million, and discounts have continued to improve as it clearly appears that investor demand for problem assets is improving, another encouraging sign for our future non-performing asset formation. Additionally, we are disciplined in managing balance sheet risk with our proactive approach to reducing high-risk portfolios. 
In the first quarter, we reduced investor real estate loans by $1.3 billion or 6% through sales, charge-offs and pay downs. Our ultimate target is to lower this portfolio to 15% of total loan portfolio. We fully acknowledge our exposure to this Lending segment has been elevated, but we are encouraged by the progress we achieved and aggressively reducing this exposure by $3.1 billion over the last five quarters. We fully expect our efforts to demonstrate strong improvement in the upcoming quarters. Of course, reducing investor real estate, combined with the general lack of loan demand, has pressured overall loan balances, which is frankly one of our company's and our industry's most significant near-term challenges. 
While we are disappointed in this quarter's contraction in our loans, let me assure you that we have an all-out effort to grow balance as where it's prudent to do so. As a foundation at goal, we've made great progress in growing our customer base. In fact, we've increased market share in both small business and commercial lending. Further, recent consumer application volume has risen substantially. There's little doubt that once we get help from the economy, we are poised to grow our loans outstandings to customers. This focus on growing or retaining customer relationships is critical to our long-term success. 
The first quarter deposit metrics validate we remain on the right path. In fact, during the quarter, we opened 248,000 new business and consumer checking accounts. This puts us on track to exceed 2009's record-breaking pace. 
Customer retention continues to perform well above industry norm, cross sell has improved up to 4% during the last year, and recent customer service surveys give us a high mark relative to our competitors, with customer loyalty metrics now surpassing the 90th percentile of competitors. 
Excellent service continues to drive strong customer deposit growth, which was up an average 2% for the first quarter. But more importantly, average low-cost deposits increased over 6% in the first quarter, driving an ongoing positive shift in our funding mix, away from higher-priced consumer CDs and giving us confidence in future improvements in the net interest margin. 
As expected, core revenue was down slightly for the first quarter primarily due to seasonal factors but also continued to reflect the slowly improving economy with weak loan demand and reduced customer transaction activity. But our net interest margin, as expected and as forecasted, rose five basis points link quarter, and we still remain confident in our ability to execute and to achieve a 3% margin by year end 2010. We have substantially improved our deposit mix, and that combined with better loan pricing, has benefited our margin and will have stronger impact in future quarters. 
Throughout the first quarter, about $8 billion of higher rate CDs matured. With the bulk of these funds migrating in the lower cost increments such as money market, our CDs, with an average ongoing rate of approximately 180 basis points lower than the CDs are repricing. I would point out that the full impact of the shift will not be realized until next quarter, as the used instruments matured over the full duration of the first quarter. 
Another $10 billion of higher cost CDs are scheduled to mature over the balance of this year. We continue to have clear focus on executing our plans to achieve a better net interest margin for the future. 
David Turner will provide more details on revenue and loan trends in a few moments, but I will note that line utilization levels appear to have stabilized, both for commercial and small-business customers, which is a first step towards ultimate growth in outstandings. And with the initiative we have underway, I feel confident about our ability to take advantage not only of the increased lending opportunities, but opportunities to leverage customer relationships to the incremental sale across our franchise and our business units, including brokerage, mortgage, cash management, insurance and other lines of businesses.  
I particularly encourage a progress in controlling operating expenses, which on a core basis declined about 3% link quarter. As expected, the seasonal jump in payroll and benefits cost was more than offset by lower professional fees and reduced OREO expense. Credit and environmental expenses such as professional fees can be volatile quarter-to-quarter, but we're nonetheless encouraged by first quarter reduced level. Additionally, as we had earlier indicated, we successfully completed the consolidation of 120 branches in late first quarter, which should provide on a net basis $21 million in cost savings starting and fully anticipated in the second quarter. 
We continue to aggressively control day-to-day operating expenses and seek opportunities to further improve our efficiency. As example, we have reduced headcount to 2,400 positions since this time last year. Benefits of our cost control efforts should become increasingly evident over time, recession-related cost return to more normal levels. 
Before I close, I just wanted to briefly touch on Morgan Keegan, which has been receiving a tremendous amount of media attention as of late. We have the right business plan in place at Morgan Keegan and are very pleased with our performance. 
Despite pressure on fixed-income revenues this quarter, net income at Morgan Keegan rose $7 million or 39% as compared to prior quarter. These results were largely driven by solid private client, solid equity capital markets and consistent trust revenues, as well as overall reduced operating cost. Net new brokerage account openings increased 5% on a link-quarter basis, reflecting of outstanding intercompany referrals, which are at the highest levels in our history. 
Total investment assets under administration now stand at $149 billion, having grown 19.7% year-over-year and 2.4%, link quarter. That said, we are fully aware of the regulatory and legal challenges related to certain Regions Morgan Keegan Select Funds, which is a business we exited in 2008. 
Recently, as previously announced, the SEC and other regulatory state authority have brought administrative proceedings against Morgan Keegan related to these funds. These actions, while disappointing, were no surprise to us. We have been cooperating with the investigations for over two years now. We will continue to work to resolve these charges and ending all issues raised by our regulators as expeditiously and as prudently as possible. Our commitment is to work cooperatively with our customers, with our regulators and with our states to achieve a prompt and fair resolution. Most importantly, we're not letting this become a distraction or get in the way of our primary goal, which is building and retaining long-term customer relationships. 
In summary, the challenges aren't behind us, but I'm more convinced than ever that we've got the right team and the right strategy to successfully execute Region's return to profitability and build a stronger franchise for the future. As we emerge from the economic recession and operate in a much different business model, Regions is working hard to be part of a solution in rebuilding customers' trust and confidence in the financial services industry and in Regions Financial. As I said earlier, we understand that to grow the business, it would be critical to stay focused on the customer, and as such, we've made this our top priority.
I'll now hand the call over to David Turner, our recent promoted Chief Financial Officer, to provide additional details about first quarter results. But before I do, let me make a quick introduction for those of you who aren't familiar with David and his background. 
David's been with us since 2005. Before coming to us, he was an audit partner with KPMG, working primarily on financial institutions. We're very fortunate to have someone on board with such extensive industry experience, combined with in-depth knowledge of Regions for this important position in our company. David?"

The net interest margin increased to 2.77% as a result of the increase in net interest income as well as a 2% decline in average earning assets. A targeted reduction in higher risk credits such as investor real estate, along with soft loan demand, caused a reduction in earning assets. 
First quarter non-interest income included a $59 million gain on the sale of CMO securities compared to a $96 million loss in the fourth quarter. Additionally, non-interest income included a $19 million gain related to leverage lease terminations compared to a $71 million gain in the fourth quarter. The leverage lease gains were essentially offset by income taxes in the respective quarters. 
Absent securities transactions and leverage lease gains, non-interest income declined approximately 1% link quarter largely due to a $21 million decline in brokerage revenue and a 4% decline in service charges reflecting lower transaction activity as is typical during the first quarter of the year. Non-interest expenses declined 3% link quarter after excluding a $53 million loss on early extinguishment of debt as well as branch consolidation cost of $8 million in the first quarter and $12 million in the fourth quarter. Lower professional and legal fees drove the improvement by declining approximately $42 million. 
From a credit perspective, we reported a $770 million loan-loss provision, which exceeded the net charge-offs by $70 million. As a result, our allowance for loan losses increased 18 basis points link quarter to 3.61% of loans at March 31. 
Net charge-offs were essentially flat, rising only  $8 million. The net charge off ratio rose to an annualized 3.16% of average loans compared to the fourth quarter's 2.99%, primarily resulting from a decrease in average loans. 
Our charge-offs continue to reflect our aggressive efforts to de-risk our balance sheet and dispose of problem assets. Our modest provision over charge-offs reflects the slowing of the increase in non-performing loans. 
Non-performing assets, excluding loans held for sale, increased $221 million or 5% link quarter. This marks the third consecutive quarterly decline in the level of inflows to non-performing status. Our loan-loss allowance coverage of non-performing loans stood at 0.86x at quarter end compared to the year-end level of 0.89x. Lastly, our capital position remains strong, with a Tier 1 Capital at an estimated 11.7% and a Tier 1 Common at an estimated 7.1%. 
Let's take a deeper look into the quarterly results. In terms of first quarter balance sheet changes, Slide 2 shows that loans declined $2.5 billion. As you can see, the main driver of this decrease was the investor real estate category, which as previously mentioned is by design, the result of our focused portfolio reduction efforts. The $1.1 billion link quarter decline in average outstandings reflects the fact that we haven't originated many new loans of this type for some time, coupled with continued pay downs and charge-offs. 
Looking closer at commercial lending, Slide 3 illustrates that commitment levels remain solid. And for the first time in several quarters, utilization rates have begun to level off, although at a substantially lower level than in a normal environment. 
Despite the challenging environment, we continue to search for and extend loans to creditworthy customers. In fact, during the first quarter, we originated an $11.6 billion of new and renewed loan commitments including $2.2 billion to consumers, $1.5 billion to small businesses and $7.9 billion to other commercial customers. There is no doubt that our customer base is strong and getting stronger. We are positioned to grow balances as the economy improves and customers begin to rebuild inventories, make new capital investments and begin expanding their businesses. 
On the liability side, we're especially pleased with the ongoing rapid growth in low-cost deposits as shown on Slide 4, which is having a significant positive effect on our funding mix and cost. This growth allowed us to reduce higher cost certificates of deposit by $2.3 billion on average in the first quarter. Of note, liquidity is very strong, with the ratio of loans to deposits of 90% at March 31, down significantly from 102% one year ago. 
Moving to Slide 5, there is no doubt that the environment has played a role in driving deposit balances higher, as both businesses and consumers are holding on to more cash these days. But beyond that, we have grown our customer base with innovative products and retained existing customers with service and satisfaction levels that are higher today than at any point in our history. To reiterate Grayson's earlier comment, we opened over 1 million new checking accounts for consumers and small businesses in 2009 and have validated that effort with an additional 248,000 new accounts in the first quarter of this year. These accounts are yielding substantial amounts of new low-cost funding. 
We are continuing to take advantage of disruptions in the marketplace to win new customers and expand the relationships with existing customers. As noted on Slide 6, core pretax pre-provision net revenue, PPNR, was up this quarter and the light outlook is improving. The last few quarters, negative PPNR trend has been driven mainly by net interest income pressure, largely a result of our asset-sensitive interest rate position and rising non-interest expenses, primarily a result of increasing recession-related expenses. 
First quarter results indicate that these items impacting PPNR will improve, going forward. First quarter recession-related expenses, while still elevated, declined to 15% of core non-interest expense from fourth quarter 2009's 18%. It is unlikely that we'll return to 2007's pre-recession level of 6% anytime soon, since costs such as elevated FDIC expense are not likely to abate. However, we believe that they will continue to decline this year as non-performing assets decline and the economy continues to recover. Moreover, net interest income, the largest driver of PPNR,, is also on track to substantially improve. 
Let's look at the details on that front. As noted on Slide 7, fully taxable equivalent net interest income of $839 million was essentially flat linked quarter after adjusting for the impact of MSR hedge activity. As I previously noted, this was achieved despite a lower earning asset base and is a result of our continuing efforts to change the mix and cost of our deposit base. Our resulting net interest margin expanded five basis points to 2.77%. 
Solid low-cost deposit growth and resulting improved deposit mix are positively impacting our net interest income and margin and should continue to do so throughout 2010, particularly in the second half. As Grayson mentioned, we repriced over $8 billion of CDs having an average rate of 3.26% in the first quarter or as the average going-on rates for new CDs was approximately 1.42%. We have approximately $10 billion of CDs maturing over the remainder of this year, which will be subjected to market rates as they mature. 
From a loan standpoint, we have been successful on our efforts to raise our going-on loan rates. Although these efforts have yet to be fully realized, our loan yields increased three basis points from 4.27% in the fourth quarter to 4.3% in the first quarter of this year. We expect that further deposit mix, costs and loans for improvements will lift our net interest margin to 3% by year-end. 
This forecast does not assume any meaningful help from rising interest rates. In fact, as can be seen on Slide 8, our current forecast doesn't call for rates to rise meaningfully until early next year. As a result, we put short-term hedges in place that has temporarily reduced our asset sensitivity. However, as you can see on the slide, the substantial benefit of higher rates to net interest income in 2011 and beyond is not affected. 
On Slide 9, reported non-interest income was 13% higher than in the fourth quarter. However, excluding leverage lease termination gains and securities transactions, non-interest income declined 1%. The main driver was a $21 million decline in brokerage revenues owing largely to the pressure fixed income revenues mentioned earlier. Non-interest income was also impacted by a 4% decrease in service charges, reflecting a seasonal drop off in transaction activity. Note that announced NSF OD policy changes related to the dollar limit and daily occurrence caps began to take effect on April 1. 
In addition, policy changes associated with Regulation E, expected to take place in the third quarter, will also impact service charge revenues. These changes, along with other customer fees will reduce service charge revenue by approximately $70 million annually, based on preliminary estimates. 
Mortgage income was essentially unchanged linked quarter, excluding the effects of MSR hedging activity. Origination volume of $1.4 billion was still historically strong, but was down versus the prior quarter's $2.0 billion with 45% representing new purchases in the first quarter, compared to 17% a year ago. As I mentioned, we sold securities during the quarter reporting a $59 million gain on sale of $1.4 billion of shorter-duration collateralized mortgage obligations. Proceeds were reinvested into newer issue CMOs with a slightly longer duration. 
Turning to noninterest expenses, Slide 10 reflects a core non-interest expenses dropped approximately 3% linked quarter due largely to lower legal and professional fees. Although overall levels continue to be inflated by recession-related cost, we fully expect a substantial amount of these cost to subside as the economy recovers. In the meantime, we continue to closely monitor and control discretionary spending. Specifically, legal and professional fees declined $42 million linked quarter, driven by lower Morgan Keegan and credit-related cost. Additionally, other real estate expense declined $22 million linked quarter. 
Other items of note includes salaries and benefit expense, which increased only 2% for the first quarter as we remain focused on fine-tuning staffing models and improving personnel efficiency. As Grayson touched on, we have reduced headcount by 2,400 or 8% in the last year alone. In addition, we have reduced discretionary expenditures such as marketing and travel by approximately $29 million or 46% relative to the fourth quarter of 2008. We also prepaid about $1.5 billion of FHLB advances, realizing a $53 million loss reflected in other non-interest expense, with the expectation that this will be slightly accretive to the margin in 2010. 
Slide 11 shows that capital ratios remain strong at quarter end. For the Tier 1 Capital ratio that now stands at an estimated 11.7% and a Tier 1 Common ratio estimated at a very solid 7.1%. Touching on capital planning, we have strengthened our capital planning process, which includes various scenario analyses, including stress testing under adverse conditions. 
This robust process includes the development of macroeconomic forecast, significantly improved credit modeling and financial and capital forecasting using various scenarios. These scenarios consider all types of risk that could affect the company over a given period of time. We believe this improved process has allowed us to better determine our capital requirements in a timely manner. 
Wrapping up, we're clearly not satisfied with first quarter's bottom line results. But we are making substantial progress in our efforts to return Regions to profitability, and we are firmly committed to successfully executing our strategy. 
Now I'll turn it over to Bill for a run-through of credit."
271409,99890038,56969,"Regions Financial Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2010",2010-04-20,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thanks, David. Starting with Slide 12, let's begin by reviewing nonperforming asset migration. We expect nonperforming assets to peak in the second quarter and decline thereafter. In fact, internally risk-rated problem loans have declined linked quarter,",812,"Thanks, David. Starting with Slide 12, let's begin by reviewing nonperforming asset migration. We expect nonperforming assets to peak in the second quarter and decline thereafter. In fact, internally risk-rated problem loans have declined linked quarter, which is the first time that it's happened since the end of 2006. This decline comes after considerable effort over the past year to improve the discipline and consistency of our risk ratings across the franchise. This foundational component is how we manage our portfolio of strategy as well as the loan-loss reserve. Based on sharp and continued recent declines of internally risk-rated problem asset migration, which is the source of future nonperforming loan formation, we feel confident that absolute levels of non-performing assets will peak in the second quarter. 
The land, condo, single-family grouping which we have traditionally called homebuilder and condo, is still a driver of inflows but continues to decline. The performance of income-producing property loans has remained relatively stable as compared to last quarter. Results of our proactive disposition program detailed on Slide 13, helped drive down the NPA migration. During the first quarter, we reported problem asset dispositions totaling $689 million, which included $87 million of non-performing loans moved to held for sale. Continuing the trend, discounts on problem loan sales and loans that were mark-to-market improved this quarter to 23% on average, as compared to 29% last quarter. This reflects a combination of an improved market for loan sales as well as our focus on strategic buyers rather than bulk sales. As illustrated in the chart, over the last six quarters, we have disposed of $3.4 billion of problem assets. 
Now turning to charge-offs. Our risk management strategy has been to confront issues early and accelerate the disposition of problem assets, primarily those secured by investor real estate and take losses as soon as possible. Partially as a result of this strategy, charge-offs have remained relatively stable as seen on Slide 14 for the last three quarters and should begin to moderate to the second half of 2010. Within total charge-offs, business service losses were driven by lower valuation charges of $198 million in the first quarter versus $215 million in the fourth. Despite continued high unemployment, consumer losses remained relatively stable, increasing just $5 million linked quarter. 
Finally, the cost of non-performing loan sales and marks dropped $5 million from the last quarter. We sold more for less. Let me put net charge-offs in terms of progress against the stress test, which as you might remember is the same $9.2 billion in combined losses for 2009 and 2010. During five quarters of the eight quarters stress test term, our losses represent 51% of the $5.75 billion projected in the supervisory capital assessment program. So a different way, we're about 2/3 through the stress test period and only experienced a third of the losses. We continue to believe the guidance we gave quite a while ago at our investor day in July of 2009 still holds. 
But we will be somewhere near the midpoint of our $3.4 billion to $5.9 billion two-year loss range. The primary reason for the difference is that investor commercial real estate, while very stressed has not dissolved it as rapidly or with the loan severity originally projected in the stress test. 
On Slide 15, as an update on our troubled debt restructurings, these balances declined $302 million from the fourth quarter. As you may know, the TDRs performed over the near-term for a six-month period crossed over at year end and yield the market rate, they can be removed from the TDR classification. This was the driver of our linked quarter decline. 
An important point to note is that 92% of Regions' TDRs are consumer real estate loans. In addition, 96% of our all consumer TDRs are accruing interest. Nearly all of our consumer TDRs are a function of our proactive Customer Assistance Program, which has been beneficial to Regions and our customers alike. Of note, Regions' recidivism rate is very low and our foreclosure rate is less than half the national average. 
Slide 16 points toward further improvement for 2010. A derisking of the portfolio has occurred as evidenced by the reduction of our land, homebuilder, condominium and overall investor real estate portfolios. Additionally, the construction loan portfolio has been reduced from $9 billion at the beginning of 2009 to currently at $4.7 billion. All of this derisking has resulted in the decline of problem loans based on our internal risk rating. Given what we know today, we reaffirm our investor day July 2009 guidance and expect NPAs and charge-offs to peak by the end of the second quarter and decline thereafter. Based on all of the above, we expect no further reserve build in the second half of the year. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Grayson for closing comments."

The pace at which we've been able to reduce that portfolio has exceeded our internal expectations. We're very encouraged by how we've been able to execute on that strategy and is declining a little faster than we had anticipated. All of that is good news. The second part is that it was our full intention to grow other lending product types at a pace that would offset that contraction and in investor commercial real estate. But I do think that what you see when you look at our lending activities is we have been able to keep commitments to our customers very high. They've been very stable. Our commitments continue to expand and we're continuing to add customers each and every week. Unfortunately, utilization rates have continued to fall through all of last year. The good news is they have stabilized or appear to have stabilized at this juncture and we got an opportunity to grow earning assets going forward. I do think when you look at noninterest expense, the noninterest expense growth has been largely due to credit-related, recession-related expenses. Our core expenses in terms of expenses that are being spent in our business units with our producers on the frontline. We've continued to manage those expenses down and feel very good about the level of operating efficiency that we'll be able to demonstrate once this credit cycle moderates. But this quarter, we saw some moderation in those expenses. The more these problem assets we can move off the books, the less carrying cost we have with them. And so we think once this trend line starts to improve, you're going to see our expenses really start to demonstrate what we've done to the company."

271409,108944950,69687,"Regions Financial Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-27-2010",2010-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Good morning, and thanks for taking the time to join our conference call. As announced earlier today, Regions reported a second quarter loss of $0.28 per share, which included a charge related to Morgan Keegan regulatory proceedings. Concerning this charg",2044,"Good morning, and thanks for taking the time to join our conference call. As announced earlier today, Regions reported a second quarter loss of $0.28 per share, which included a charge related to Morgan Keegan regulatory proceedings. Concerning this charge, as you may recall, administrative proceedings are brought against Morgan Keegan and Morgan Asset Management on April 7 by the SEC, FINRA and a joint state task force of security regulators. Although we have not reached final settlement, based on the current status of negotiations, we recorded a nontax deductible $200 million charge representing the estimate of probable loss. 
Excluding this charge, second quarter's loss was $0.11 per share, representing an improvement from first quarter's $0.21 per share loss, giving us additional confidence that we have the right strategy in place to return Regions to sustainable level of profitability. It just requires that we continue to focus on execution of our plans.
Although we are making progress, and we are even slightly ahead of our own internal forecast, we are clearly not satisfied. The economic environment, while slowly improving, is challenging and fragile and it is too soon to know the ultimate impact of the Gulf oil spill and regulatory reform legislation. But our focus is to improve our credit metrics, while managing aggressively our expenses. The slow nature of the economy requires that we remain cautious and prudent with our actions. We are encouraged by second quarter's core improvement. On a linked-quarter basis, total adjusted revenues grew 3%, adjusted noninterest expenses declined 4%, and our net interest margin and credit metrics both improved.  
Balance sheet risk was further reduced, and we continue to see solid low-cost deposit growth. Credit-related cost, while moderating, clearly remain elevated, with loan loss provision and OREO expenses having a $0.36 per share negative effect on second quarter's earnings. However, we believe that the earnings that are burdened from the elevated provision expense should begin to moderate going forward.
Our proactive efforts to recognize and resolve problem assets are providing a favorable impact. We are not anticipating nor are we forecasting a double dip recession for the economy, but the nature of the slow economic improvement has resulted in a much more conservative low-growth forecast for our business and requires that we exercise extreme care in the management of our credit risk. As many of you are aware, our focus on customers and cross-sell opportunities, along with strong customer service, has resulted in strong growth and new checking accounts and low-cost deposits. This continued in the second quarter. Average low-cost deposits rose 4% versus the second quarter, and we are on track to open approximately 1 million new business in consumer checking accounts again this year, matching or exceeding 2009's record level.
The ongoing positive shift in our deposit mix had resulted in a favorable improvement in funding costs driving our net interest income and resulting margin even higher. It should continue to do so. Second quarter's margin increased 10 basis points and is very much on target to reach our goals. Not surprisingly, there was a 3% decline in our loans outstanding near the second quarter, and balances are expected to remain challenged for the remainder of the year. We did experience an increase in loan production volumes in the second quarter, but it was substantially below normalized levels.  Reduced demand from credit-worthy borrowers, both consumer and businesses, and deleveraging from loan payoffs and pay downs are all contributing factors. Also, as been the case for several quarters now, average loan outstandings also reflect our disciplined efforts to reduce exposure to high-risk portfolio segments, specifically, investor commercial real estate. 
The Investor Commercial Real Estate portfolio declined $1.5 billion in the second quarter, bringing our total outstandings to $19 billion. This means that we've brought over the past 12 months a reduction of $4.7 billion to this portfolio. Our small business and middle-market bankers are trying to position ourselves to take advantage when loan demand returns. We're actively calling on existing customers and importantly, potentially new customers. Our strategy leverages our extensive branch network to aggressively call on the targeted Small Business Banking segment. We are also active in the Commercial Middle Market segment and we have recent success with specialized lending groups. 
Commercial line of credit commitments remained strong, but utilization rates have stabilized at historically low levels. Commercial lending pipelines are showing signs of strength, but have yet to materialize into increased outstandings.
On the consumer lending front, we are aggressively working to improve consumer loan volume production, while maintaining pricing discipline. Along those lines, we are increasing loan advertising, expanding direct-mail programs and extending preapproved point-of-sale offers and importantly, our sales plans are focused on properly priced and prudently underwritten loan production to drive these programs. Our second quarter total consumer loan production was up by 40% over first quarter, with our year-to-date yield on new home equity production is 171 basis points of our prime, but our loan production volumes across consumer segments are far below normalized levels, and we anticipate a slow growth economy with high unemployment and low interest rates.
Our customer demand has shifted from home equity to more direct loans and other consumer lending products. As such, we've made a strategic decision to re-enter the Indirect Auto Lending business with our activity in this business resuming in the third quarter. With the increased demand for auto loans as well as the loss rates in this sector performing better than expected during the economic downturn, this move will help us to diversify our consumer lending portfolio and improve our concentration mix and at the same time, providing dealerships with an avenue for their customers to finance their auto lending needs.
With respect to mortgage lending, second quarter production was up 31% linked quarter to $1.8 billion in originations. We continue to increase our market share, providing outstanding customer service and enhanced speed and simplicity of the entire mortgage process. Overall, consumer lending is showing signs of improvement that demonstrating a net increase in outstandings is proving difficult.
Moving on to a couple of other issues, I am confident about the clear strategy we have in place and our leadership team's commitment to successfully executing the strategy. However, two second quarter events, the Gulf oil spill and the financial regulatory reform legislation, added to our challenges. The Gulf oil spill is a tremendous environmental and economic challenge. We are carefully evaluating the potential impact to our business and developing the necessary risk mitigation strategies to lessen the financial impact to our customers and our financial performance. It is difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to accurately estimate the environmental and economic impact at this particular point in time. But it does appear that substantial progress has been made in stopping the flow of oil from the oil into the Gulf. 
We have confidence and the resilience in the individuals and the businesses located on the Gulf Coast as they have weathered a number of storms over the years. But we are proactively contacting our customers along the Gulf to determine how they're being impacted and how we may help in being part of the effort to restore the economies of these markets.  Regions has a strong history in dealing with environmental disasters and how they impact our customers and the communities that we serve.
When Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf, we were armed with a disaster response plan and went to work immediately. We are following that same proven and disciplined process now with the oil spill. And as the number one bank on the Gulf Coast, we are in a great position to assist many individuals and businesses. We have set up a task force dedicated at collecting on-the-spot reports and updates from Regions' team members and Regions' customers that live and work in the affected markets, and we are coordinating our efforts to quickly, clearly and confidently communicate to local customers and businesses about Regions' ability to help, as well as availability of Small Business Administration direct programs, state programs and BP assistance efforts  
With respect to potential exposure, we had to make a number of assumptions regarding the geographic impact area. First, we reviewed businesses and consumer lending relationships in a geographic area ranging from Lake Charles, Louisiana to just North of Tampa, Florida. The exposure area totals four Regions, $3.1 billion in loans outstanding and $8.4 billion in deposits.
We thoroughly analyzed exposures to high-risk industries including tourism, commercial fishing, sport fishing, hospitality, restaurants and condominium. Specific to consumer exposure, we stress tested all the residential mortgages within 25 miles of the coastline. We stressed these loans using two stress scenarios. One was a straightforward doubling of our highest historical loss rate and the other was even more adverse. It included shocking state employment levels for all impacted markets, as well as reducing residential home prices a further 20% from already existing low levels, while also reflecting negative GDP in these specific markets. Using this conservative methodology, we estimate total financial losses for Regions to be approximately $100 million in the most adverse case.
Let me point out that our loss estimate is conservative, and assumes no benefit from private insurance payments, government support or stimulus money that BP has committed, any of which would potentially reduce our forecasted losses. As a historic reference, using essentially the same discipline methodology, I'll note that we initially estimated our losses from Hurricane Katrina to be approximately $70 million. And at the end of the day, our losses turned out to be less than $10 million. When we made that estimate, we did not consider the amount of payment that we or our customers will receive from public or private sources. As you can be assured, we will continue to closely monitor our portfolio and actively work with customers to mitigate any possible negative financial impact. And furthermore, we anticipate that this financial impact will occur over an extended period of time.
Now let me speak directly to the other recent event, regulatory reform. We are assessing the potential impacts on our revenue, expenses, capital and our business models. And we're evaluating steps that we can take, adjustments that we can make to our business models to mitigate the business impact. We know for instance that the Durbin amendment will put downward pressure on interchange revenues, which in total for Regions is approximately $330 million annually. But the extent of the interchange pricing reduction is not currently defined, so before we can provide a valid estimate, we need to see clarity regarding exact rules, regarding interchange price setting. What we are promptly adjusting our business model is in anticipation of these revenue challenges to provide a substantial level of earnings impact mitigation, while still being committed to and providing products and services that our customers value. 
In addition, our expense base, we pressured from many regulatory provisions included in this legislation. Regardless, we will continue to consider and implement ways to improve our operating efficiency.
As for the capital implications of this reform, trust-preferred stocks, we phased out as an allowable component of Tier 1 capital. This change does not create a particularly challenging problem for Regions since trust prefers only represent $846 million or 86 basis points of our Tier 1 capital, which was a strong 12% at the end of the quarter. We, like all the financial institutions, we will face the challenge of a likely higher capital requirements once regulatory authorities work through the new guidelines. We believe that we are well prepared to handle any new capital requirements in a timely fashion.
In summary, I am confident that Regions remains firmly on the path to return to sustainable profitability. We are forecasting a slow but improving economic environment, modestly higher net interest income and a continued improvement in expense management. Our actions serve to offset the challenges post our revenue streams. Our core business fundamentals are strong. We have a solid franchise operating in good markets that will remain desirable over the long-term. Regions does have a potential for long-term success, and we are focused on the disciplined execution of our business plans.
So with that, David, I'll now turn the discussion to our second quarter financial details."

Let's begin with a summary of our second quarter results on Slide 1.As Grayson mentioned, our second quarter loss amounted to $0.28 per diluted share or $0.11 per share, excluding the regulatory charge. While we are not sati",1910,"Thank you, and good morning. Let's begin with a summary of our second quarter results on Slide 1.
As Grayson mentioned, our second quarter loss amounted to $0.28 per diluted share or $0.11 per share, excluding the regulatory charge. While we are not satisfied with the second quarter loss, we are pleased with another quarter of steady improvement in our core business, highlighted by improvements in pretax pre-provision net revenue or PPNR, and our improvements in asset quality metrics.
In summary, all three categories of our PPNR improved linked quarter. Net interest income increased $25 million, and the resulting net interest margin improved 10 basis points to 2.87%. Noninterest income increased $22 million or 3%, linked quarter, excluding first quarter's securities and leverage lease termination gains. And noninterest expenses decline $42 million or 4% first to second quarter, excluding the Morgan Keegan regulatory charge and first quarters' loss on early extinguishment of debt and branch consolidation charges.
Regarding credit quality, nonperforming assets, excluding loans held for sale, declined $297 million or 7% during the quarter, and is reflective of continued improvement in our credit quality trends. Our provision for loan losses decreased to $651 million from $770 million in the previous quarter, and was essentially equal to net charge offs. 
Now let's take a deeper look at the quarterly results beginning with credit. Slide 2 shows that net nonperforming assets not only declined $297 million, but gross inflows also declined, again, led by investor real estate. Our proactive sales program coupled with aggressive marks and transfers to held for sale have accelerated the decline in nonperforming assets. During the second quarter, we sold or transferred $779 million of loans and problem assets, bringing the total to over $4 billion over the last seven quarters. Discounts on problem asset sales and loans that were mark-to-market were a little changed at 24% on average this quarter, from the first quarter's 23% and fourth quarter 2009's 29%. 
The decline in NPA has exceeded our earlier expectations and reflect the first improvement in several quarters. While we are encouraged by this improvement, we remain cautious concerning the outlook for NPAs. Although our internally risk-rated problem loan trends remain favorable, the slow and fragile nature of the economic recovery requires that we remain cautious until we see clear signs of strength in this economy.
Net charge-offs declined $49 million to $651 million or an annualized 2.99% of average loans compared to first quarter's annualized 3.16%. The decline in net charge-offs continued to reflect efforts to derisk our balance sheet and dispose some problem assets. Given the improving credit quality trends, provision cost declined in the quarter. As you can see on Slide 3, our provision of $651 million essentially match net charge-offs, and declined $119 million in the second quarter, marking the second consecutive quarterly reduction.
Our loan-loss allowance to loans ratio increased 10 basis points, linked quarter, to 3.71% at June 30 due to a lower level of loans outstanding. As I stated earlier, we are being cautious, and our actual level of NPAs and provision expense will be dependent on our asset quality metrics, which will reflect economic conditions, especially unemployment and housing data. Further, while the Gulf oil spill will be a challenge, we believe it will be financially manageable. Having said that, we will be closely monitoring the situation and our provisioning will incorporate any deterioration in effective portfolios to the extent necessary.
Let me give you some detail on troubled debt restructuring or TDRs, and why despite the relatively large balance, they are not expected to translate into substantial losses. Keep in mind that nearly all of our consumer TDRs, which comprise about 89% of total TDRs, are a function of our proactive Customer Assistance Program. And very importantly, 95% of consumer TDRs are accruing interest.
Through our Customer Assistance Program, we proactively contact consumer borrowers even before they become delinquent, often making modifications to loan terms such as deferring a payment or reducing an interest rate. Any such concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty requires a loan to be classified as a TDR. While these concessions may not be significant, they have proven very helpful to borrowers in need. Importantly, the re-default rate has been very low as our foreclosure rate, which is less than half the national average.
These metrics and the monthly conversations we have with each and every borrower give us confidence that our program will continue to benefit borrowers and Regions alike over the long-term.
Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 5 breaks down this quarter's change in loans and deposits. Note that $1.5 billion of the $2.2 billion decrease in loans reflects our efforts to reduce investor real estate loans. However, new commercial lending remains challenging when utilization rates that were largely unchanged versus the previous quarter. Most commercial customers are still waiting on confidence in the sustainability of the economic recovery before drawing down lines. In any case, we remain positioned to grow balances as the economy improves, and customers begin to rebuild inventories, make new capital investments and start expanding their businesses. However, we are encouraged by the increases we have recently seen in June and July commitments.
On the liability side of the balance sheet, low-cost deposit growth mostly money market and interest rate balances were strong. Average balances were up $2.7 billion quarter-over-quarter. This reflects outstanding customer acquisition and retention, bolstered by service and satisfaction levels that are higher today than at any point in our history.
Average low-cost deposit growth allowed us to reduce higher cost time deposits by $2.8 billion in the second quarter. And as noted earlier, resulted in lower funding cost for the quarter. Importantly, opportunities exist for further improvement in our deposit mix and cost over the coming quarters.
Slide 6 provides a quick view of the relationship between growing low cost deposits and improving total deposit cost. Average time deposits as a percentage of total deposits declined from 30.3% in the first quarter to 27.5% in the second quarter. Coupled with our deposit pricing efforts, we lowered deposit cost 21 basis points this quarter to 0.79%. 
Looking closer at the top line, net interest margin and net interest income are significantly benefiting from the positively changing mix and cost of our deposit base. As noted on Slide 7, fully taxable-equivalent net interest income of $863 million was up nearly 3%, linked quarter, despite a lower earning asset base.
Our resulting net interest margin expanded 10 basis points to 2.87%.  Our emphasis on improving both deposit mix and cost will be a primary driver of the margin improvement. As a reminder, we have approximately $8 billion of CDs maturing over the remainder of this year, which will be repriced to market rates as they mature. These CDs currently carry an average 1.71 interest rate, implying a meaningful positive benefit to our overall deposit cost.
Pricing momentum will carry into next year too when we have another $4.1 billion of first quarter maturities, about $1.5 billion of which carry a 4.55% interest rate.
Before moving on, I want to make it clear, we currently expect interest rates to remain low until well into 2011. All else being equal, a persistently low rate environment will put pressure on the margin. In consideration of that, we have extended our short-term hedge position to help maintain the margin and net interest income in the event that rates do remain low well into next year. These hedges now mature in the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting a nine-month extension of the hedge period since our last earnings release.
Turning to Slide 8. We were able to grow adjusted noninterest revenues, 3%, while reducing adjusted noninterest expenses, 4%. The main noninterest income driver was an $18 million increase in brokerage revenues, owing largely to strong fixed income business, higher private client revenues, as well as strong investment banking activity. Noninterest income also reflects a 5% increase in service charges, primarily from higher interchange transaction activity. Note that NSF/OD policy changes related to the dollar limit and daily occurrence caps took effect on April 1. However, while these did reduce service charges, the effect was offset by an increase in customer transaction activity. 
Policy changes associated with Regulation E began in the second quarter, and will be fully implemented during the third quarter. The results of our program to educate customers on the impact to them regarding Regulation E are continuing. To date, we have successfully reached approximately half of the users of our standard overdraft service with 90% deciding to opt in or participate in our overdraft protection program, while 10% have opted out.
As you may remember, we originally estimated the impact of this legislative change would be a net reduction of service charge revenue of $72 million in 2010, and we continue to believe this is our best estimate. Mortgage income declined $4 million, linked quarter, primarily due to a reduction in benefits from hedging mortgage servicing rights. However, origination volume of $1.8 billion was up versus the prior quarters' $1.4 billion, with June representing the highest monthly volume this year. 
The pipeline remains strong as well, and in the second quarter, unclosed loans were up 40% versus the March 31 level. Also of note, 59% of second quarter volume represented purchases compared to 45% last quarter and just 24% a year ago.
As mentioned earlier, the decline in adjusted non-interest expenses was largely due to lower salaries and benefits costs as we remain focused on fine-tuning staffing models and improving personnel efficiency. In fact, we have reduced headcount by nearly 2,000 or 6.5% in the last year alone and approximately 300 since end of the last quarter.
Lower payroll taxes were also a factor, declining for first quarter's seasonally high level. We have an intense focus on expense management, and we will continue to control discretionary expenses and improve operating efficiency. However, certain headwinds, including higher FDIC premiums and credit-related costs, will continue to impact the bottom line for the foreseeable future. Having said that, given that many of these costs are tied to other real estate and workout costs, we believe the decline in non-performing assets serves as a leading indicator of an eventual decline in credit-related costs.
Let's finish up with capital. As you can see, capital ratios remain strong at quarter end, with a Tier 1 capital ratio that now stands at an estimated 12% and a Tier 1 common ratio estimated at a very solid 7.7%. In addition, we have provided a pro forma capital estimate, which excludes trust preferred securities from our capital. As Grayson mentioned earlier and as illustrated here, we do not have much trust preferred in our capital and are not as impacted by this legislation as others will be in the industry.
To sum up, we are pleased with Regions' second quarter progress, thanks to the effort of our hardworking team. And while we have a lot of hard work ahead of us, you can be assured that everyone at Regions remains firmly focused on returning the company to a sustainable level of profitability as promptly as possible, while continuing to improve our risk profiles. We have a strong franchise, with solid underlying business fundamentals as evidenced by this quarter's core results. We have high expectations for Regions and are committed to delivering for our shareholders, customers and associates. 
And with that, operator, we will now take questions."

The second component of our capital change was the decline in our risk-weighted assets of approximately $2 billion. And then the final fees, Matt, you mentioned on disallowed deferred tax assets was reduced about half this quarter. And it's important to note that this calculation is defined by regulatory rules and it differs from GAAP, from the view of GAAP when you're talking about realizing DTAs. So what we do is, we look out over the next 12 months of taxable income as defined by the regulatory rules to determine how much of our DTA is allowed versus disallowed. As our PPNR and credit metrics have improved, we make adjustments to that projection, and we will continue to do so each and every quarter. The pace at which that comes in is hard to determine because it's depending on our credit metrics. And while we, as you heard our prepared comments, felt good about where they're going, we do remain cautious there and we hate to forecast the timing of the return of the DTA in the capital. It is important to note, though, that, that is temporary. And that ultimately, as we show our return to profitability, that, that remaining DTA of well over $400 million will come in to capital."

Although we saw continued improvements in our core business performance this quarter, we have announced a third quarter loss of $0.17 per share due to still elevated credi",1861,"Good morning, and thank you for your time and participation in our conference call. Although we saw continued improvements in our core business performance this quarter, we have announced a third quarter loss of $0.17 per share due to still elevated credit expense, with an economy that is demonstrating a slow-paced recovery and actions that we've taken to accelerate the disposal of problem assets and reduce our balance sheet risk going forward. 
In addition to absorbing higher costs related to problem asset sales and loans transferred to held for sale, we also recorded a loan loss provision essentially equal to the elevated level of loan charge-offs. Loan loss provision, OREO and held-for-sale costs, in total, were an estimated $0.41 per share after-tax this quarter. We executed disposition of $1 billion in problem loans, including $709 million in distressed asset sales. We remain confident in our business plans and our determination to execute these plans and returning Regions to sustainable profitably as properly and prudently as possible. 
Our actions are moving Regions closer to the improvement needed to achieve a breakeven point. We are encouraged by this quarter's business progress that result in steps towards achieving our goal. While our credit teams are diligently working to resolve credit-related issues, majority of our associates have demonstrated a focus on profitably growing revenue and constraining operating expenses in our core businesses.
In the third quarter, net interest income rose 1% from second quarter, driven as expected by continued reduction in overall costs of deposits and a favorable shift in mix. And while fee-based revenues declined 1% versus last quarter, the drop was primarily driven by the impact from Regulation E on service charges. Notably, while the implementation of Reg E did negatively impact the quarter, that impact was less than we forecasted, and we continue to be encouraged by the efforts of our associates and our branches and our call centers to further mitigate the impact of this regulatory requirement as we assist customers in making the best decisions to accommodate their needs.
At the same time, operating expenses, while being closely managed, did unfortunately increase due to the impact of higher credit-related expenses. We remain confident in the progress we're making. In spite of the slow pace of economic recovery, our strategies are working. We're disciplined in our focus on customers, and we have developed strong accountability for execution and results. The operating environment does continue to be a challenge. The economy is gradually recovering, but growth is forecasted to be unfavorably slow for the next few quarters, with stubbornly high unemployment, a weak housing market and unusually low interest rates.
Today, economic recovery within our markets has been uneven. Residential home values have not stabilized in many of our markets, especially the markets within the State of Florida, where we can potentially experience another 10% or so decline relative to mid-2010 prices, depending on the ability of the banks and the courts to process foreclosures effectively and the amount of shadow inventory remaining in the system. With that in mind, we are careful when we're making general statements. It may prove to be inaccurate due to the inconsistent valuation from market to market. But we are starting to see what appears to be stabilization in some of our market.
Fortunately, the Gulf oil spill impact on individuals and business customers has been far less economically negative than initially forecasted. It's still a difficult situation for these markets but far less impactful than earlier feared. Regions' maximum loss potential is projected now to be $20 million or less, sharply less than our initial $100 million estimate. That being said, the long-term economic environmental impacts remain a concern, as the markets and businesses along the Gulf Coast recover very slowly.
Across all of our markets, I am convinced the economic conditions are improving, but the slow pace of recovery is weighing on borrowers' capacity and borrowers' willingness to continue to fulfill credit obligations, and thus has decreased the implied potential benefit of guarantor support on many of our credits. As such, we have become incrementally more cautious on our economic outlook, which was a driving factor in the increased gross migration of loans moving to nonperforming status.
I think it's important, however, to consider the composition of that migration. Of the $1.4 billion of third quarter gross nonperforming additions, approximately $390 million were disposed of during the quarter. But of the commercial loans remaining, $933 million, 62% or $575 million were current home payments. Overall, the percentage of nonperforming commercial loans that are current home payments has risen from 24% at the end of the second quarter to 36% at the end of third quarter, giving us more confidence and ability to manage the potential loss content and the potential to restructure in some cases.
It's also important to point out that our internally risk-rated problem loans declined on a linked quarter basis. Our early-stage and late-stage delinquencies have stabilized and are moderating. The lingering effects of the slow pace of economic recovery has not yet many [ph] of our borrowers, and we have acted cautiously and prudently, reassessing and modifying risk ratings as appropriate. We are focused on being very careful and accurate in assessing the financial condition of our borrowers and taking prompt action as required and as appropriate.
Protracted economic challenges have also reaffirmed our stance with regard to disposing of problem assets, as well as our strategies to reduce exposure to higher-risk loan portfolios, especially investor real estate. Investor real estate declined $1.5 billion, point to point, ending balance in this quarter, achieving $17.5 billion in Investor Commercial Real Estate. 
In terms of strategic growth, our customer focus remains a top priority as we strive to deepen existing relationships and acquire new customers. Our efforts continue to pay off in the third quarter as evidenced by further strengthening in new checking account sales. We remain on track, over, more than one million new business and customer checking accounts this year, exceeding 2009's record level. The addition of new relationships is fueling revenue across multiple lines of business for Regions. For example, in the third quarter, we processed 182 million debit card transactions, representing a 14% increase over the third quarter of last year. 
With respect to deposit balances, in line with our overall balance sheet strategy, overall deposit levels have declined. As many of you are aware, we have a sizable amount of higher-interest rate CDs maturing in the third quarter and forecasted some runoff as rates were reduced to market levels. Given the reduction in higher-cost deposits, Regions' funding mix and cost continued to improve, declining another nine basis points, driving third quarter's net interest income and net interest margin higher. We remain on track to reach our targeted 3% year-end margin.
Our liquidity remains solid, with a loan-deposit ratio of 89%. While maintaining a clear focus in reducing the overall cost of deposits, we are successful in proving our market position. According to the recently released data by the FDIC, the Summary of Deposits analysis, Regions deposit growth ranked first in our peer group and seventh among 25 largest U.S. banks. Furthermore, we grew market share in six of 16 states in which we operate and in 15 of our top 25 MSAs. 
Unfortunately, total average loans did decline in the third quarter, but importantly, at a slower pace than previous quarters and despite the continuing derisking efforts in the investor real estate portfolio. Generating good quality, profitable loans remained a challenge, but we're starting to see some encouraging signs, including a 2% linked-quarter, end-period Commercial & Industrial outstandings.  Within C&I, the growth story really is about our middle market segment, which represents about half of the outstandings. These balances grew 5% in the quarter despite low but stable line utilization.  Most of this production was related to capital expenditures and refinancing of existing debt. 
Small business lending is starting to get traction as well, but this is yet to materialize into growth in net outstandings, given generally light demand. Nevertheless, small business lending is a significant opportunity for Regions as we are the number three small business lender in the country, as ranked by the Small Business Administration.
On whole, we remain cautious but optimistic. Net production volumes will further strengthen in the fourth quarter, due to increasingly solid new business pipelines.
On the consumer side, we continue to emphasize residential first mortgage lending. Production was $2.3 billion for the quarter, a 31% increase over last quarter. We continue to incrementally adjust our business model to mitigate the unfavorable revenue impact of new regulation. In fact, we've already begun mitigation efforts, having eliminated free accounts for all customers, except students and seniors, and appraised balance and transaction hurdles, earned up [ph] labor of monthly service charges. 
We are closely monitoring performance on a new structure, and we will make further adjustments as necessary, taking into account both customer value provided and related cost of delivery. In all instances, we continue to focus on superior customer service, which we believe sets us apart and which customers highly value. We continue to provide many free account services for customers, but we'll incrementally adjust our pricing models over time to better rationalize the value proposition.
Please keep in mind that the actual impact of Regulation E changes is proving less negative than anticipated. Originally, we expected implementation to reduce service charge on revenues, $72 million during the second half of this year. Based on third quarter results, the second half impact is now expected to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million. This performance and the continued adoption of overdraft services indicate customers find value in these services. In terms of interchange revenue, like the rest of the industry, we are awaiting proposals from our regulators, so it's difficult to project final financial impact. We do have annual interchange fees of approximately $330 million, so any change in fee structure could be significant. But we are seeing a 14% increase in transactions activity year-over-year.
On Basel III, while still being finalized, we are not estimating it to have a significant impact on Regions. Our Tier 1 common ratio is currently in the solid 7.6%, and based on our understanding of these rules, is above Basel III's minimum of 7% guideline. Regions is also expected to meet Basel III's liquidity requirements in this current form. In any case, we will ensure that Regions' capital levels remain strong and fully compliant as the formal implementation of Basel III requirements are better known.
In summary, we are successfully executing our plan to return Regions to sustainable profitability. We are aggressively reducing credit risk, lowering our customer base, implementing productivity and efficiency initiatives and taking appropriate steps to ensure that we are positioned to fully capitalize on profitable revenue growth opportunities. At the same time, we recognize that environmental, economic and regulatory challenges persist, creating headwinds and caution on our part. But I am convinced that Regions has the right strategy and the right people in place to deliver on our commitment. 
David will now discuss third quarter financial results. David?"
271409,113915625,81845,"Regions Financial Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a summary of our third quarter results on Slide 1. As Grayson mentioned, our third quarter loss amounted to $0.17 per diluted share. Pretax pre-provision net revenue, or PPNR, amounted to $4",2160,"Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a summary of our third quarter results on Slide 1. As Grayson mentioned, our third quarter loss amounted to $0.17 per diluted share. Pretax pre-provision net revenue, or PPNR, amounted to $454 million, down about 7% linked quarter, due primarily to the impact of higher credit-related costs and Regulation E. Compared to the same period a year ago, adjusted PPNR was up 11%.
Within PPNR, net interest income continued to grow, increasing $12 million, which drove a nine basis-point improvement in the net interest margin. Non-interest revenues dipped 1% linked quarter, primarily driven by the impact of service charges from Regulation E, which I'll cover in just a minute.
Absent this impact, non-interest revenues were higher, primarily due to strong mortgage and fixed income brokerage revenue. Non-interest expenses increased $37 million or 3% second to third quarter, excluding second quarter's $200 million regulatory charge. Total non-interest expenses were negatively impacted by the rise in credit-related costs, primarily due to higher OREO and held-for-sale expenses related to the bulk sale of distressed assets.
Regarding credit quality, the level of nonperforming assets, excluding loans held for sale, was down $186 million this quarter to $3.8 billion. The provision for loan losses rose to $760 million from $651 million in the previous quarter and essentially equaled net charge-offs. The increase in charge-offs reflects about $233 million of charges associated with distressed asset sales and the transfer of loans to held for sale.
Let's now take a deeper look into the quarterly results, beginning with credit. As shown on Slide 2, nonperforming assets, excluding loans held for sale, were down 5% this quarter but remained elevated. And I'll reiterate what was said earlier. An increasing and substantial portion of the migration into nonperforming loans was attributable to loans that are paying as agreed. The sluggish and persistent nature of the economy necessitates that we remain cautious when internally risk-rating our portfolio. 
Despite that cautious stance, internally risk-rated problem loans did decline this quarter. However, factors like Florida unemployment, which has been greater than 10% since May 2009, and it's now over 12%, and pressured housing prices in parts of the state require that we not get ahead of ourselves and that we maintain a clear and objective view of the economic environment. To that end, we remain focused on derisking our portfolio.
Our proactive disposition effort remained a key element of our risk management strategy. This quarter, we sold or transferred to held for sale a total of $1 billion of troubled assets. This total reflects a broadened effort, as it included approximately $350 million of distressed asset sales on a bulk basis. These assets, which were predominantly land, included both nonperforming loans and OREO, and resulted in $108 million of associated charge-offs and $30 million in losses that are recorded in non-interest expense. 
While the markdowns were greater than we have previously experienced, we believe the long-term economics justify getting these assets off our books and behind us. Land is one of the most difficult assets to sell, and we were pleased to be able to dispose of these assets as opportunities arose during the quarter. We don't want to be in the property management business, and we'll make every reasonable effort to remove properties and risk from our books when it makes long-term economic sense.
As you can see on Slide 4, net charge-offs increased to $759 million for an annualized 3.52% of average loans and reflect our efforts this quarter to derisk our balance sheet and dispose of problem assets, which contributed $233 million in charge-offs.  Drilling down the main source of charge-offs continues to be our investor real estate portfolio. Our loan loss provision is essentially matching that charge-off this quarter and was up $109 million linked quarter. Our loan loss allowance to loans ratio increased six basis points linked quarter to 3.77%. As we've said at our Investor Day, we remain cautious about the economy when evaluating the loan portfolio, and our allowance methodology reflects this stance.
Turning to the balance sheet, Slide 5 breaks down this quarter's change in loans. Although investor real estate still accounts for a relatively high percentage of our loan portfolio, we have reduced this exposure substantially through the credit crisis. In fact, total investor real estate loans have declined by $6.5 billion over the last two years, and we continue to make solid progress in reducing this segment of our portfolio as shown by the current quarter reduction of $1.5 billion.
At the same time, targeted efforts to grow segments of our portfolio are getting traction. Most notably, Commercial & Industrial loan balances were 2% in the quarter, primarily through our energy and healthcare lending groups. Energy lending in Texas has been particularly strong. New client acquisition is driving this growth, as line utilization have remained about 40% over the last several months.
Furthermore, we continue to invest in specialized lending groups, including business capital, healthcare, transportation and franchise restaurant. 
Lastly, we are excited about the opportunity to leverage our small-business expertise through our extensive branch network. Our plan to grow consumer loans is multifaceted and includes increased emphasis on direct lending through leveraging the strength of our branch network. Also, on the consumer side, we are evaluating products targeted at the underserved customer segment, a large group with short-term funding needs.
This next slide shows changes in our deposit base this quarter. Ending time deposits declined $2.1 billion, reflecting  expected run-off of balances as we reduced maturing high-cost CD rates to market levels. Low-cost deposit growth was somewhat offsetting, with ending balances increasing $854 million or 1% in the quarter. Total deposit levels were also affected by our more disciplined approach to deposit pricing, with some customers choosing to pay down debt rather than hold deposits at current rates. Although customers are deleveraging and paying down their loans, our new checking account growth has helped offset this downward pressure on deposit balances.
Net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, rose $13 million linked quarter while the margins strengthened nine basis points, increasing to 2.96%. Improvements stemmed primarily from continued optimization of deposit costs and mix. For the quarter, deposit costs declined another nine basis points to 0.7% in the third quarter, and loan yields remained stable at 4.29%.
We expect to see continued improvement in deposit costs and expect to reach a 3% margin in the fourth quarter, as originally projected. In fact, we expected to reach our target of 3% this quarter, but the recent decline in long-term interest rates accelerated mortgage refinance activity and premium amortization within the investment portfolio, which had an adverse impact on net interest margin of around four basis points.
Driving further margin improvement, we have approximately $11.4 billion of CDs maturing over the next nine months, which will be repriced to market rates as they mature. These CDs currently carry an average 2.1% interest rate and should enable us to reduce our overall deposit costs. In addition, the drag to net interest margin associated with interest reversals in carrying excess cash at Fed [ph] will fade with time. These items were margin headwinds of 16 and eight basis points respectively on an annualized basis in the third quarter.
As an update, we have recently adjusted the hedges in place to support the margin in a prolonged low-rate environment. These now reduce our interest rate sensitivity through December 2012. Our emphasis on improving deposit mix and cost, combined with the projected impact of these hedges, is expected to result in modest margin improvement going forward in our most likely rate forecast scenario.
Let's now shift gears and look at non-interest revenue and expenses this quarter. Non-interest revenues were down by about 1% linked quarter, driven by an approximate $16 million impact of Regulation E. Absent this impact, non-interest revenues were higher, reflecting strong mortgage revenue, driven by heavy refinancing activity. In fact, we originated $2.4 billion of loans this quarter versus $1.8 billion last quarter. And refinance activity was much higher, representing 67% of current quarter originations, up from second quarter's 41%. Also contributing to non-interest revenues, Morgan Keegan's brokerage revenues were up 6% versus the prior quarter, reflecting continued private client and fixed income strength. Fixed income revenue was especially strong, increasing 13% linked quarter, driven higher by customer purchasing short-term securities.
In terms of non-interest expense, while credit-related costs continue to remain high, we continue to focus on containing other overall costs. Excluding prior quarters' regulatory charge, total non-interest expense was up $37 million or 3% linked quarter due to a $31 million linked quarter rise in OREO and held-for-sale costs. As I mentioned earlier, the rise in these costs reflects approximately $30 million resulting from a bulk sale of OREO during the quarter. In all, PPNR continues to be impacted by credit-related costs, which on a normalized basis, are impacting us by $75 million to $100 million per quarter.
We recognize in this economy to be successful, we have to be diligent in our efforts to manage expenses. It's going to be a low growth, low rate environment for an extended period of time. And we have to continue to target all areas of staffing, occupancy, discretionary spending and credit-related expenses. Rest assured that any changes we implement, we'll, at the same time, maintain focus on service quality and making sure that we are serving the needs of our customers.
Let me now discuss our capital liquidity. We continue to execute our disciplined capital planning process that we developed over the past year or so, which accounts as various scenario analyses, including stress testing under a range of adverse conditions. It begins with the development of macro economic forecast scenarios, which serve as a basis for our credit modeling. Our capital ratios remained strong, with a Tier 1 capital ratio that now stands at 12.1% and a Tier 1 common ratio at a very solid 7.6%. 
As we stated last quarter, the Collins Amendment will have little impact to our risk-based ratios since trust-preferred securities at about $846 million are fairly small part of our overall capital base.
Let me briefly touch on Basel III, which will be phased in over the next several years beginning in 2013. We continue to assess the impact and are awaiting the details, but we feel very good about our capital base as our Tier 1 common and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios are above the respective 7% and 8 1/2% minimums required on the Basel III. The proposed adjustments are expected to have a minimal impact on us. Similarly, Regions is well positioned with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio described under Basel III. In fact, we have been internally managing to a similar measure for some time.
Moving to the broader impact of recent regulatory reform, there is no doubt that recent sweeping legislative actions will ripple through banks' operations and financial statements from this point forward. But we are well-positioned to effectively manage any potential impact. In terms of Regulation E, with the August 12 full implementation date behind us, we now have good visibility into foreseeable financial ramifications. As Grayson noted earlier, the negative impact is proving less than our original forecast.
To date, roughly half of all of our customers who have overdrawn their account in the past year have chosen to opt in or link their account for overdraft protection. And 97% of customers who have made an election after experiencing a declined transaction are choosing to opt in or participate in overdraft protection. Clearly, customers are seeing the value in services that ensure their ability to make purchases.
The Durbin Amendment, which affects debit card interchange fees, will likely result in a revenue reduction as well. But keep in mind that final rules have not been established. They will be determined by the Federal Reserve as we head into next year, and we will make adjustments to our products and services as appropriate.
Lastly, unlike many of the larger money center banks or brokerage houses, regulatory reform will only minimally impact our brokerage revenues since Morgan Keegan does not engage in proprietary trading, has little to no private equity exposure and faces very minor impact to its derivatives business. Bottom line, while regulatory changes are certainly challenging from a revenue perspective, I'm confident that we will be able to make adjustments to minimize any long-term financial effect on Regions.
In summary, although we are not pleased with the loss this quarter, our associates remained focused on executing both our short-term and long-term goals. We continue to remain focused on returning the company to sustainable profitability as promptly as possible. And with this quarter's further derisking efforts, we are building a stronger company with an emphasis on improving our risk profile, which will ultimately benefit our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Grayson for closing comments."

Regions had a solid and tested foreclosure process in place to ensure the fairness for customers and compliance with the state and federal regulations. In cases where all options to avoid foreclosure have been exhausted, a committee of key managers approves the decision to proceed with foreclosure after a thorough review of loan documentation. Once a decision has been made to proceed, the process is the same where the loan is owned by Regions or by an investor that we service the mortgage for. In each case, department managers review and verify the accuracy of loan documents in states where a mortgage foreclosure affidavit or similar legal documentation is required. The document is completed and signed by the department manager in the presence of a notary employed by Regions.
Due to our foreclosure prevention efforts and a relatively small-sized Regions servicing portfolio, our foreclosure volumes have remained relatively low. Regions forecloses on approximately 100 loans that we own each month and 160 investor-owned loans each month. Staffing levels are sufficient to internally verify loan information and appropriately execute required documentation. Regions has a residential mortgage servicing portfolio of $41.2 billion. Of that, $16.3 billion are loans that we own while $24.9 billion are loans owned by government agencies or investors, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Our foreclosure rate for the entire portfolio, both owned and investor, is less than half the national average. Our ability to maintain low foreclosure rates is the result of proactive efforts to provide solutions to distressed customers. In late 2007, Regions began reaching out to customers at risk of falling behind on payments to our Customer Assistance Program. The program is available to customers whose loans we own and service. To date, we have helped more than 30,000 customers stay in their home. We pursue all available options to help homeowners avoid foreclosure, including loan modifications, rate reductions, short sales and Deed-in-Lieu of foreclosure.
Foreclosure is the option and last resort. When foreclosure does take place, evictions are rare, as many homes are second homes, investment properties or no longer occupied. Our focus on the customer has resulted in Regions' second consecutive year of ranking in the top five of J.D. Power and Associates customer satisfaction survey for primary mortgage servicers. That being said, we have directed our leadership in the business, in internal audit and in risk management to review and validate each process step to ensure full compliance with all laws and regulations and customer needs.
Operator, that concludes our remarks, and now we will open it up for questions."

Number one is that we do see some of our credit trends clearly moderating. Our early-stage and late-stage delinquencies appear to have stabilized and declining slightly. We do see internal risk-rated loans improving, as you saw in our numbers. However, the migration to nonperforming status clearly stands out this quarter. It was significantly up from last quarter. As we mentioned, last quarter, we were very cautious. One quarter does not make a trend. And as we look, loan portfolio, the pause in economic recovery, it really focused around Commercial Real Estate, and in particular, the guarantor. If you look at -- as the economy continues to have a slow recovery, the capacity and willingness of these guarantors comes into question. And as we look at what's migrated into a nonperforming status this quarter, as you saw the amount, we disposed of a significant amount of that migration, but we also retained quite a bit. And of what we retained, 64%, they're still paying as agreed. But there are already questions. Even though they're paying, there were question raised regarding the capacity or the willingness of those guarantors to continue. With that, I'll ask Bill to make a few comments."

Also, as we look at our valuations, that has caused us to be very conservative in how we've looked at our non-accrual call [ph], and that's what where the uptick in looking at our gross inflows. As Grayson mentioned, the one thing to talk about, while we're disappointed in the inflow, increase in inflow in migration, what we did notice is that a high percentage of ours, over 60% of the nonperforming loans that we had remaining at the end of the quarter were currently paying. But what the difference is, as Grayson mentioned, there were some question about the guarantors' willingness or capacity to pay, so we thought it was very prudent to put it on non-accrual. Having said that, we do think the loan severity is less than what we have seen before in earlier migrations and also gives us the ability to do more restructures, which in the past, we have not done a lot of restructuring. The other thing that Grayson mentioned is that as we see the gross migration coming in, we are continuing our efforts to aggressively derisk the balance sheet. We've seen that not only in the reduction in our investor real estate of $1.5 million over the quarter but also our ability to dispose of problem assets in our sales program, which continues to work very well for us."

And so in our pricing that we saw, we saw a little bit more discount than what we have been seeing in the past. That bulk sale discount was about 40% of the book balance that we had. The other thing that I would say is that on our additional sales, we were probably averaging in the low 20s.

Like I said earlier, we were hopeful to get to it in this past quarter, didn't get there for the prepayments I had mentioned on the mortgage-backed security portfolio. The ultimate net interest margin is going to be driven by the rate environment, and which is driven by the economy. We have positioned the balance sheet and the hedging strategy to protect us on the low side from a protracted low-rate environment through 2012. If, on the other hand, rates continue to go up and the economy rebounds, then we'll still participate in that rebound, just not as much as we otherwise without the hedges. And we think that, that means everything is getting that much better. So we're willing to take that risk to protect ourselves on the low side.

Although we saw continued improvements in our core business performance this quarter, we have announced a third quarter loss of $0.17 per share due to still elevated credi",1862,"Good morning, and thank you for your time and participation in our conference call. Although we saw continued improvements in our core business performance this quarter, we have announced a third quarter loss of $0.17 per share due to still elevated credit expense, with an economy that is demonstrating a slow-paced recovery and actions that we've taken to accelerate the disposal of problem assets and reduce our balance sheet risk going forward. 
In addition to absorbing higher costs related to problem asset sales and loans transferred to held for sale, we also recorded a loan loss provision essentially equal to the elevated level of loan charge-offs. Loan loss provision, OREO and held-for-sale costs, in total, were an estimated $0.41 per share after tax this quarter. We executed disposition of $1 billion in problem loans, including $709 million in distressed asset sales. We remain confident in our business plans and our determination to execute these plans and returning Regions to sustainable profitably as properly and prudently as possible. 
Our actions are moving Regions closer to the improvement needed to achieve a breakeven point. We are encouraged by this quarter's business progress that resulted in steps towards achieving that goal. While our credit teams are diligently working to resolve credit-related issues, majority of our associates have demonstrated a focus on profitably growing revenue and constraining operating expenses in our core businesses.
In the third quarter, net interest income rose 1% from second quarter, driven as expected by continued reduction in overall costs of deposits and a favorable shift in mix. And while fee-based revenues declined 1% versus last quarter, the drop was primarily driven by the impact from Regulation E on service charges. Notably, while the implementation of Reg E did negatively impact the quarter, that impact was less than we forecasted, and we continue to be encouraged by the efforts of our associates and our branches and our call centers to further mitigate the impact of this regulatory requirement as we assist customers in making the best decisions to accommodate their needs.
At the same time, operating expenses, while being closely managed, did unfortunately increase due to the impact of higher credit-related expenses. We remain confident in the progress we're making. In spite of the slow pace of economic recovery, our strategies are working. We're disciplined in our focus on customers, and we have developed strong accountability for execution and results. The operating environment does continue to be a challenge. The economy is gradually recovering, but growth is forecasted to be unfavorably slow for the next few quarters, with stubbornly high unemployment, a weak housing market and unusually low interest rates.
Today, economic recovery within our markets has been uneven. Residential home values have not stabilized in many of our markets, especially the markets within the State of Florida, where we can potentially experience another 10% or so decline relative to mid-2010 prices, depending on the ability of the banks and the courts to process foreclosures effectively and the amount of shadow inventory remaining in the system. With that in mind, we are careful when we're making general statements. It may prove to be inaccurate due to the inconsistent valuation from market to market. But we are starting to see what appears to be stabilization in some of our market.
Fortunately, the Gulf oil spill impact on individuals and business customers has been far less economically negative than initially forecasted. It's still a difficult situation for these markets but far less impactful than earlier feared. Regions' maximum loss potential is projected now to be $20 million or less, sharply less than our initial $100 million estimate. That being said, the long-term economic environmental impacts remain a concern, as the markets and businesses along the Gulf Coast recover very slowly.
Across all of our markets, I am convinced the economic conditions are improving, but the slow pace of recovery is weighing on borrowers' capacity and borrowers' willingness to continue to fulfill credit obligations, and thus has decreased the implied potential benefit of guarantor support on many of our credits. As such, we have become incrementally more cautious on our economic outlook, which was a driving factor in the increased gross migration of loans moving to nonperforming status.
I think it's important, however, to consider the composition of that migration. Of the $1.4 billion of third quarter gross nonperforming additions, approximately $390 million were disposed of during the quarter. But of the commercial loans remaining, $933 million, 62% or $575 million were current home payments. Overall, the percentage of nonperforming commercial loans that are current home payments has risen from 24% at the end of the second quarter to 36% at the end of third quarter, giving us more confidence in the ability to manage the potential loss content and the potential to restructure in some cases.
It's also important to point out that our internally risk-rated problem loans declined on a linked-quarter basis. Our early-stage and late-stage delinquencies have stabilized and are moderating. The lingering effects of the slow pace of economic recovery has not helped many of our borrowers, and we have acted cautiously and prudently, reassessing and modifying risk ratings as appropriate. We are focused on being very careful and accurate in assessing the financial condition of our borrowers and taking prompt action as required and as appropriate.
Protracted economic challenges have also reaffirmed our stance with regard to disposing of problem assets, as well as our strategies to reduce exposure to higher-risk loan portfolios, especially investor real estate. Investor real estate declined $1.5 billion, point to point, ending balance in this quarter, achieving $17.5 billion in Investor Commercial Real Estate. 
In terms of strategic growth, our customer focus remains a top priority as we strive to deepen existing relationships and acquire new customers. Our efforts continue to pay off in the third quarter as evidenced by further strengthening in new checking account sales. We remain on track, over more than one million new business and customer checking accounts this year, exceeding 2009's record level. The addition of new relationships is fueling revenue across multiple lines of business for Regions. For example, in the third quarter, we processed 182 million debit card transactions, representing a 14% increase over the third quarter of last year. 
With respect to deposit balances in line with our overall balance sheet strategy, overall deposit levels have declined. As many of you are aware, we had a sizable amount of higher-interest rate CDs maturing in the third quarter and forecasted some runoff as rates were reduced to market levels. Given the reduction of higher-cost deposits, Regions' funding mix and cost continued to improve, declining another nine basis points, driving third quarter's net interest income and net interest margin higher. We remain on track to reach our targeted 3% year-end margin.
Our liquidity remains solid, with a loan-deposit ratio of 89%. While maintaining a clear focus in reducing the overall cost of deposits, we are successful in proving our market position. According to the recently re-released data by the FDIC, the Summary of Deposits analysis, Regions deposit growth ranked first in our peer group and seventh among 25 largest U.S. banks. Furthermore, we grew market share in six of 16 states in which we operate and in 15 of our top 25 MSAs. 
Unfortunately, total average loans did decline in the third quarter, but importantly, at a slower pace than previous quarters and despite the continuing derisking efforts in the investor real estate portfolio. Generating good quality, profitable loans remains a challenge, but we're starting to see some encouraging signs, including a 2% linked-quarter, end-period Commercial & Industrial outstandings.  Within C&I, the growth story really is about our middle market segment, which represents about half of the outstandings. These balances grew 5% in the quarter despite low but stable line utilization.  Most of this production was related to capital expenditures and refinancing of existing debt. 
Small business lending is starting to get traction as well, but this is yet to materialize into growth in net outstandings, given generally light demand. Nevertheless, small business lending is a significant opportunity for Regions as we are the number three small business lender in the country, as ranked by the Small Business Administration.
On whole, we remain cautious but optimistic. Net production volumes will further strengthen in the fourth quarter, due to increasingly solid new business pipelines.
On the consumer side, we continue to emphasize residential first mortgage lending. Production was $2.3 billion for the quarter, a 31% increase over last quarter. We continue to incrementally adjust our business model to mitigate the unfavorable revenue impact of new regulation. In fact, we've already begun mitigation efforts, having eliminated free accounts for all customers, except students and seniors, and appraised balance and transaction hurdles, earned a [ph] (00:17:25) waiver of monthly service charges. 
We are closely monitoring performance on a new structure, and we will make further adjustments as necessary, taking into account both customer value provided and related cost of delivery. In all instances, we continue to focus on superior customer service, which we believe sets us apart and which customers highly value. We continue to provide many free account services for customers, but we'll incrementally adjust our pricing models over time to better rationalize the value proposition.
Please keep in mind that the actual impact of Regulation E changes is proving less negative than anticipated. Originally, we expected implementation to reduce service charge on revenues, $72 million during the second half of this year. Based on third quarter results, the second half impact is now expected to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million. This performance and the continued adoption of overdraft services indicate customers find value in these services. In terms of interchange revenue, like the rest of the industry, we are awaiting proposals from our regulators, so it's difficult to project final financial impact. We do have annual interchange fees of approximately $330 million, so any change in fee structure could be significant. But we are seeing a 14% increase in transactions activity year-over-year.
On Basel III, while still being finalized, we are not estimating it to have a significant impact on Regions. Our Tier 1 common ratio is currently in the solid 7.6%, and based on our understanding of these rules, is above Basel III's minimum of 7% guideline. Regions is also expected to meet Basel III's liquidity requirements in this current form. In any case, we will ensure that Regions' capital levels remain strong and fully compliant as the formal implementation of Basel III requirements are better known.
In summary, we are successfully executing our plan to return Regions to sustainable profitability. We are aggressively reducing credit risk, rolling our customer base, implementing productivity and efficiency initiatives and taking appropriate steps to ensure that we are positioned to fully capitalize on profitable revenue growth opportunities. At the same time, we recognize that environmental, economic and regulatory challenges persist, creating headwinds and caution on our part. But I am convinced that Regions has the right strategy and the right people in place to deliver on our commitment. 
David will now discuss third quarter financial results. David?"
271409,113915625,81902,"Regions Financial Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a summary of our third quarter results on Slide 1. As Grayson mentioned, our third quarter loss amounted to $0.17 per diluted share. Pretax pre-provision net revenue, or PPNR, amounted to $4",2158,"Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a summary of our third quarter results on Slide 1. As Grayson mentioned, our third quarter loss amounted to $0.17 per diluted share. Pretax pre-provision net revenue, or PPNR, amounted to $454 million, down about 7% linked quarter, due primarily to the impact of higher credit-related costs and Regulation E. Compared to the same period a year ago, adjusted PPNR was up 11%.
Within PPNR, net interest income continued to grow, increasing $12 million, which drove a nine-basis-point improvement in the net interest margin. Non-interest revenues dipped 1% linked quarter, primarily driven by the impact of service charges from Regulation E, which I'll cover in just a minute.
Absent this impact, non-interest revenues were higher, primarily due to strong mortgage and fixed income brokerage revenue. Non-interest expenses increased $37 million or 3% second to third quarter, excluding second quarter's $200 million regulatory charge. Total non-interest expenses were negatively impacted by the rise in credit-related costs, primarily due to higher OREO and held-for-sale expenses related to the bulk sale of distressed assets.
Regarding credit quality, the level of nonperforming assets, excluding loans held for sale, was down $186 million this quarter to $3.8 billion. The provision for loan losses rose to $760 million from $651 million in the previous quarter and essentially equaled net charge-offs. The increase in charge-offs reflects about $233 million of charges associated with distressed asset sales and the transfer of loans to held for sale.
Let's now take a deeper look into the quarterly results, beginning with credit. As shown on Slide 2, nonperforming assets, excluding loans held for sale, were down 5% this quarter but remained elevated. And I'll reiterate what was said earlier. An increasing and substantial portion of the migration into nonperforming loans was attributable to loans that are paying as agreed. The sluggish and persistent nature of the economy necessitates that we remain cautious when internally risk-rating our portfolio. 
Despite that cautious stance, internally risk-rated problem loans did decline this quarter. However, factors like Florida unemployment, which has been greater than 10% since May 2009, and it's now over 12%, and pressured housing prices in parts of the state require that we not get ahead of ourselves and that we maintain a clear and objective view of the economic environment. To that end, we remain focused on derisking our portfolio.
Our proactive disposition effort remained a key element of our risk management strategy. This quarter, we sold or transferred to held for sale a total of $1 billion of troubled assets. This total reflects a broadened effort, as it included approximately $350 million of distressed asset sales on a bulk basis. These assets, which were predominantly land, included both nonperforming loans and OREO, and resulted in $108 million of associated charge-offs and $30 million in losses that are recorded in non-interest expense. 
While the markdowns were greater than we have previously experienced, we believe the long-term economics justify getting these assets off our books and behind us. Land is one of the most difficult assets to sell, and we were pleased to be able to dispose of these assets as opportunities arose during the quarter. We don't want to be in the property management business, and we'll make every reasonable effort to remove properties and risk from our books when it makes long-term economic sense.
As you can see on Slide 4, net charge-offs increased to $759 million for an annualized 3.52% of average loans and reflect our efforts this quarter to derisk our balance sheet and dispose of problem assets, which contributed $233 million in charge-offs.  Drilling down, the main source of charge-offs continues to be our investor real estate portfolio. Our loan loss provision essentially matched net charge-offs this quarter and was up $109 million linked quarter. Our loan loss allowance to loans ratio increased six basis points linked quarter to 3.77%. As we've said at our Investor Day, we remain cautious about the economy when evaluating the loan portfolio, and our allowance methodology reflects this stance.
Turning to the balance sheet, Slide 5 breaks down this quarter's change in loans. Although investor real estate still accounts for a relatively high percentage of our loan portfolio, we have reduced this exposure substantially through the credit crisis. In fact, total investor real estate loans have declined by $6.5 billion over the last two years, and we continue to make solid progress in reducing this segment of our portfolio as shown by the current quarter reduction of $1.5 billion.
At the same time, targeted efforts to grow segments of our portfolio are getting traction. Most notably, Commercial & Industrial loan balances were 2% in the quarter, primarily through our energy and healthcare lending groups. Energy lending in Texas has been particularly strong. New client acquisition is driving this growth, as line utilization have remained about 40% over the last several months.
Furthermore, we continue to invest in specialized lending groups, including business capital, healthcare, transportation and franchise restaurant. 
Lastly, we are excited about the opportunity to leverage our small-business expertise through our extensive branch network. Our plan to grow consumer loans is multifaceted and includes increased emphasis on direct lending through leveraging the strength of our branch network. Also, on the consumer side, we are evaluating products targeted at the underserved customer segment, a large group with short-term funding needs.
This next slide shows changes in our deposit base this quarter. Ending time deposits declined $2.1 billion, reflecting expected run-off of balances as we reduced maturing high-cost CD rates to market levels. Low-cost deposit growth was somewhat offsetting, with ending balances increasing $854 million or 1% in the quarter. Total deposit levels were also affected by our more disciplined approach to deposit pricing, with some customers choosing to pay down debt rather than hold deposits at current rates. Although customers are deleveraging and paying down their loans, our new checking account growth has helped offset this downward pressure on deposit balances.
Net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, rose $13 million linked quarter, while the margins strengthened nine basis points, increasing to 2.96%. Improvements stemmed primarily from continued optimization of deposit costs and mix. For the quarter, deposit costs declined another nine basis points to 0.7% in the third quarter, and loan yields remained stable at 4.29%.
We expect to see continued improvement in deposit costs and expect to reach a 3% margin in the fourth quarter, as originally projected. In fact, we expected to reach our target of 3% this quarter, but the recent decline in long-term interest rates accelerated mortgage refinance activity and premium amortization within the investment portfolio, which had an adverse impact on net interest margin of around four basis points.
Driving further margin improvement, we have approximately $11.4 billion of CDs maturing over the next nine months, which will be repriced to market rates as they mature. These CDs currently carry an average 2.1% interest rate and should enable us to reduce our overall deposit costs. In addition, the drag to net interest margin associated with interest reversals in carrying excess cash at Fed [ph] (00:29:06) will fade with time. These items were margin headwinds of 16 and eight basis points, respectively, on an annualized basis in the third quarter.
As an update, we have recently adjusted the hedges in place to support the margin in a prolonged low-rate environment. These now reduce our interest rate sensitivity through December 2012. Our emphasis on improving deposit mix and cost, combined with the projected impact of these hedges, is expected to result in modest margin improvement going forward in our most likely rate forecast scenario.
Let's now shift gears and look at non-interest revenue and expenses this quarter. Non-interest revenues were down by about 1% linked quarter, driven by an approximate $16 million impact of Regulation E. Absent this impact, non-interest revenues were higher, reflecting strong mortgage revenue, driven by heavy refinancing activity. In fact, we originated $2.4 billion of loans this quarter versus $1.8 billion last quarter. And refinance activity was much higher, representing 67% of current quarter originations, up from second quarter's 41%. Also contributing to non-interest revenues, Morgan Keegan's brokerage revenues were up 6% versus the prior quarter, reflecting continued private client and fixed income strength. Fixed income revenue was especially strong, increasing 13% linked quarter, driven higher by customer purchasing short-term securities.
In terms of non-interest expense, while credit-related costs continue to remain high, we continue to focus on containing other overall costs. Excluding prior quarters' regulatory charge, total non-interest expense was up $37 million or 3% linked quarter due to a $31 million linked quarter rise in OREO and held-for-sale costs. As I mentioned earlier, the rise in these costs reflects approximately $30 million resulting from a bulk sale of OREO during the quarter. In all, PPNR continues to be impacted by credit-related costs, which on a normalized basis, are impacting us by $75 million to $100 million per quarter.
We recognize in this economy to be successful, we have to be diligent in our efforts to manage expenses. It's going to be a low growth, low rate environment for an extended period of time. And we have to continue to target all areas of staffing, occupancy, discretionary spending and credit-related expenses. Rest assured that any changes we implement, we'll, at the same time, maintain focus on service quality and making sure that we are serving the needs of our customers.
Let me now discuss our capital liquidity. We continue to execute our disciplined capital planning process that we developed over the past year or so, which accounts as various scenario analyses, including stress testing under a range of adverse conditions. It begins with the development of macro economic forecast scenarios, which serve as a basis for our credit modeling. Our capital ratios remained strong, with a Tier 1 capital ratio that now stands at 12.1% and a Tier 1 common ratio at a very solid 7.6%. 
As we stated last quarter, the Collins Amendment will have little impact to our risk-based ratios since trust-preferred securities at about $846 million are a fairly small part of our overall capital base.
Let me briefly touch on Basel III, which will be phased in over the next several years beginning in 2013. We continue to assess the impact and are awaiting the details, but we feel very good about our capital base as our Tier 1 common and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios are above the respective 7% and 8 1/2% minimums required under Basel III. The proposed adjustments are expected to have a minimal impact on us. Similarly, Regions is well-positioned with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio described under Basel III. In fact, we have been internally managing to a similar measure for some time.
Moving to the broader impact of recent regulatory reform, there is no doubt that recent sweeping legislative actions will ripple through banks' operations and financial statements from this point forward. But we are well-positioned to effectively manage any potential impact. In terms of Regulation E, with the August 12 full implementation date behind us, we now have good visibility into foreseeable financial ramifications. As Grayson noted earlier, the negative impact is proving less than our original forecast.
To date, roughly half of all of our customers who have overdrawn their account in the past year have chosen to opt in or link their account for overdraft protection. And 97% of customers who have made an election after experiencing a declined transaction are choosing to opt in or participate in overdraft protection. Clearly, customers are seeing the value in services that ensure their ability to make purchases.
The Durbin Amendment, which affects debit card interchange fees, will likely result in a revenue reduction as well. But keep in mind that final rules have not been established. They will be determined by the Federal Reserve as we head into next year, and we will make adjustments to our products and services as appropriate.
Lastly, unlike many of the larger money center banks or brokerage houses, regulatory reform will only minimally impact our brokerage revenues since Morgan Keegan does not engage in proprietary trading, has little to no private equity exposure and faces very minor impact to its derivatives business. Bottom line, while regulatory changes are certainly challenging from a revenue perspective, I'm confident that we will be able to make adjustments to minimize any long-term financial effect on Regions.
In summary, although we are not pleased with the loss this quarter, our associates remain focused on executing both our short-term and long-term goals. We continue to remain focused on returning the company to sustainable profitability as promptly as possible. And with this quarter's further derisking efforts, we are building a stronger company with an emphasis on improving our risk profile, which will ultimately benefit our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Grayson for closing comments."

Regions had a solid and tested foreclosure process in place to ensure the fairness for customers and compliance with the state and federal regulations. In cases where all options to avoid foreclosure have been exhausted, a committee of key managers approves the decision to proceed with foreclosure after a thorough review of loan documentation. Once a decision has been made to proceed, the process is the same where the loan is owned by Regions or by an investor that we service the mortgage for. In each case, department managers review and verify the accuracy of the loan documents. In states where a mortgage foreclosure affidavit or similar legal documentation is required, the document is completed and signed by the department manager in the presence of a notary employed by Regions.
Due to our foreclosure prevention efforts and a relatively small-sized Regions servicing portfolio, our foreclosure volumes have remained relatively low. Regions forecloses on approximately 100 loans that we own each month and 160 investor-owned loans each month. Staffing levels are sufficient to internally verify loan information and appropriately execute required documentation. Regions has a residential mortgage servicing portfolio of $41.2 billion. Of that, $16.3 billion are loans that we own while $24.9 billion are loans owned by government agencies or investors, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Our foreclosure rate for the entire portfolio, both owned and investor, is less than half the national average. Our ability to maintain low foreclosure rates is the result of proactive efforts to provide solutions to distressed customers. In late 2007, Regions began reaching out to customers at risk of falling behind on payments through our Customer Assistance Program. The program is available to customers whose loans we own and service. To date, we have helped more than 30,000 customers stay in their home. We pursue all available options to help homeowners avoid foreclosure, including loan modifications, rate reductions, short sales and Deed-in-Lieu of foreclosure.
Foreclosure is the option of last resort. When foreclosure does take place, evictions are rare, as many homes are second homes, investment properties or are no longer occupied. Our focus on the customer has resulted in Regions' second consecutive year of ranking in the top five of J.D. Power and Associates customer satisfaction survey for primary mortgage servicers. That being said, we have directed our leadership in the business, in internal audit and in risk management to review and validate each process step to ensure full compliance with all laws and regulations and customer needs.
Operator, that concludes our remarks, and now we will open it up for questions."

Number one is that we do see some of our credit trends clearly moderating. Our early-stage and late-stage delinquencies appear to have stabilized and declining slightly. We do see internal risk-rated loans improving, as you saw in our numbers. However, the migration to nonperforming status clearly stands out this quarter. It was significantly up from last quarter. As we mentioned, last quarter, we were very cautious. One quarter does not make a trend. And as we look, loan portfolio, the pause in economic recovery, it really focused around Commercial Real Estate, and in particular, the guarantor. If you look at -- as the economy continues to have a slow recovery, the capacity and willingness of these guarantors comes into question. And as we look at what's migrated into a nonperforming status this quarter, as you saw the amount, we disposed of a significant amount of that migration, but we also retained quite a bit. And of what we retained, 64%, they're still paying as agreed. But there are already questions. Even though they're paying, there were question raised regarding the capacity or the willingness of those guarantors to continue. With that, I'll ask Bill to make a few comments."

The first thing, we talked about last quarter about being very cautious about where we were with the economy, the slow growth economy. And what we saw in our migration really is a reflection of what we've seen in the economy. Also, as we looked at our valuations, that has caused us to be very conservative in how we've looked at our non-accrual call [ph] (00:42:42), and that's what was the uptick in looking at our gross inflows. As Grayson mentioned, the one thing to talk about, while we're disappointed in the inflow, increase in inflow in migration, what we did notice is that a high percentage of ours, over 60% of the nonperforming loans that we had remaining at the end of the quarter were currently paying. But what the difference is, as Grayson mentioned, there were some question about the guarantors' willingness or capacity to pay, so we thought it was very prudent to put it on non-accrual. Having said that, we do think the loan severity is less than what we have seen before in earlier migrations and also gives us the ability to do more restructures, which in the past, we have not done a lot of restructuring. The other thing that Grayson mentioned is that as we see the gross migration coming in, we are continuing our efforts to aggressively derisk the balance sheet. We've seen that not only in the reduction in our investor real estate of $1.5 billion over the quarter but also our ability to dispose of problem assets in our sales program, which continues to work very well for us."

And so in our pricing that we saw, we saw a little bit more discount than what we have been seeing in the past. That bulk sale discount was about 40% of the book balance that we had. The other thing that I would say is that on our additional sales, we were probably averaging in the low 20s. So an average for us, when you take the bulk sale and what we did on the note sales, was a discount rate on our dispositions of about 31% as opposed to what we did last quarter of 24%."

And as we progressed into the third quarter, we're disappointed by the amount of migration that occurred. But nevertheless, that's where the economics of our customer base took us in that review. We are, as I've said earlier, we see encouragement in some of the trends in terms of early-stage and late-stage delinquencies. We didn't see any surprises on the consumer side. Consumer side, while still elevated, continues to modestly improve a little, but really tracks very closely to our forecast. The disappointment this quarter was all around Investor Commercial Real Estate, that continues to be the problem segment in our portfolio. We do believe that the aggressive stance that we took on guarantor support is reflected in these numbers. But in terms of trying to give guidance on where this goes in the fourth quarter, I'm reluctant to do that."

We have positioned the balance sheet and the hedging strategy to protect us on the low side from a protracted low-rate environment through 2012.

Although we saw continued improvements in our core business performance this quarter, we have announced a third quarter loss of $0.17 per share due to still elevated credi",1862,"Good morning, and thank you for your time and participation in our conference call. Although we saw continued improvements in our core business performance this quarter, we have announced a third quarter loss of $0.17 per share due to still elevated credit expense, with an economy that is demonstrating a slow-paced recovery and actions that we've taken to accelerate the disposal of problem assets and reduce our balance sheet risk going forward. 
In addition to absorbing higher costs related to problem asset sales and loans transferred to held for sale, we also recorded a loan loss provision essentially equal to the elevated level of loan charge-offs. Loan loss provision, OREO and held-for-sale costs, in total, were an estimated $0.41 per share after tax this quarter. We executed disposition of $1 billion in problem loans, including $709 million in distressed asset sales. We remain confident in our business plans and our determination to execute these plans and returning Regions to sustainable profitably as properly and prudently as possible. 
Our actions are moving Regions closer to the improvement needed to achieve a breakeven point. We are encouraged by this quarter's business progress that resulted in steps towards achieving that goal. While our credit teams are diligently working to resolve credit-related issues, majority of our associates have demonstrated a focus on profitably growing revenue and constraining operating expenses in our core businesses.
In the third quarter, net interest income rose 1% from second quarter, driven as expected by continued reduction in overall costs of deposits and a favorable shift in mix. And while fee-based revenues declined 1% versus last quarter, the drop was primarily driven by the impact from Regulation E on service charges. Notably, while the implementation of Reg E did negatively impact the quarter, that impact was less than we forecasted, and we continue to be encouraged by the efforts of our associates and our branches and our call centers to further mitigate the impact of this regulatory requirement as we assist customers in making the best decisions to accommodate their needs.
At the same time, operating expenses, while being closely managed, did unfortunately increase due to the impact of higher credit-related expenses. We remain confident in the progress we're making. In spite of the slow pace of economic recovery, our strategies are working. We're disciplined in our focus on customers, and we have developed strong accountability for execution and results. The operating environment does continue to be a challenge. The economy is gradually recovering, but growth is forecasted to be unfavorably slow for the next few quarters, with stubbornly high unemployment, a weak housing market and unusually low interest rates.
Today, economic recovery within our markets has been uneven. Residential home values have not stabilized in many of our markets, especially the markets within the State of Florida, where we can potentially experience another 10% or so decline relative to mid-2010 prices, depending on the ability of the banks and the courts to process foreclosures effectively and the amount of shadow inventory remaining in the system. With that in mind, we are careful when we're making general statements. It may prove to be inaccurate due to the inconsistent valuation from market to market. But we are starting to see what appears to be stabilization in some of our market.
Fortunately, the Gulf oil spill impact on individuals and business customers has been far less economically negative than initially forecasted. It's still a difficult situation for these markets but far less impactful than earlier feared. Regions' maximum loss potential is projected now to be $20 million or less, sharply less than our initial $100 million estimate. That being said, the long-term economic environmental impacts remain a concern, as the markets and businesses along the Gulf Coast recover very slowly.
Across all of our markets, I am convinced the economic conditions are improving, but the slow pace of recovery is weighing on borrowers' capacity and borrowers' willingness to continue to fulfill credit obligations, and thus has decreased the implied potential benefit of guarantor support on many of our credits. As such, we have become incrementally more cautious on our economic outlook, which was a driving factor in the increased gross migration of loans moving to nonperforming status.
I think it's important, however, to consider the composition of that migration. Of the $1.4 billion of third quarter gross nonperforming additions, approximately $390 million were disposed of during the quarter. But of the commercial loans remaining, $933 million, 62% or $575 million were current home payments. Overall, the percentage of nonperforming commercial loans that are current home payments has risen from 24% at the end of the second quarter to 36% at the end of third quarter, giving us more confidence in the ability to manage the potential loss content and the potential to restructure in some cases.
It's also important to point out that our internally risk-rated problem loans declined on a linked-quarter basis. Our early-stage and late-stage delinquencies have stabilized and are moderating. The lingering effects of the slow pace of economic recovery has not helped many of our borrowers, and we have acted cautiously and prudently, reassessing and modifying risk ratings as appropriate. We are focused on being very careful and accurate in assessing the financial condition of our borrowers and taking prompt action as required and as appropriate.
Protracted economic challenges have also reaffirmed our stance with regard to disposing of problem assets, as well as our strategies to reduce exposure to higher-risk loan portfolios, especially investor real estate. Investor real estate declined $1.5 billion, point to point, ending balance in this quarter, achieving $17.5 billion in Investor Commercial Real Estate. 
In terms of strategic growth, our customer focus remains a top priority as we strive to deepen existing relationships and acquire new customers. Our efforts continue to pay off in the third quarter as evidenced by further strengthening in new checking account sales. We remain on track, over more than one million new business and customer checking accounts this year, exceeding 2009's record level. The addition of new relationships is fueling revenue across multiple lines of business for Regions. For example, in the third quarter, we processed 182 million debit card transactions, representing a 14% increase over the third quarter of last year. 
With respect to deposit balances in line with our overall balance sheet strategy, overall deposit levels have declined. As many of you are aware, we had a sizable amount of higher-interest rate CDs maturing in the third quarter and forecasted some runoff as rates were reduced to market levels. Given the reduction of higher-cost deposits, Regions' funding mix and cost continued to improve, declining another nine basis points, driving third quarter's net interest income and net interest margin higher. We remain on track to reach our targeted 3% year-end margin.
Our liquidity remains solid, with a loan-deposit ratio of 89%. While maintaining a clear focus in reducing the overall cost of deposits, we are successful in proving our market position. According to the recently re-released data by the FDIC, the Summary of Deposits analysis, Regions deposit growth ranked first in our peer group and seventh among 25 largest U.S. banks. Furthermore, we grew market share in six of 16 states in which we operate and in 15 of our top 25 MSAs. 
Unfortunately, total average loans did decline in the third quarter, but importantly, at a slower pace than previous quarters and despite the continuing derisking efforts in the investor real estate portfolio. Generating good quality, profitable loans remains a challenge, but we're starting to see some encouraging signs, including a 2% linked-quarter, end-period Commercial & Industrial outstandings.  Within C&I, the growth story really is about our middle market segment, which represents about half of the outstandings. These balances grew 5% in the quarter despite low but stable line utilization.  Most of this production was related to capital expenditures and refinancing of existing debt. 
Small business lending is starting to get traction as well, but this is yet to materialize into growth in net outstandings, given generally light demand. Nevertheless, small business lending is a significant opportunity for Regions as we are the number three small business lender in the country, as ranked by the Small Business Administration.
On whole, we remain cautious but optimistic. Net production volumes will further strengthen in the fourth quarter, due to increasingly solid new business pipelines.
On the consumer side, we continue to emphasize residential first mortgage lending. Production was $2.3 billion for the quarter, a 31% increase over last quarter. We continue to incrementally adjust our business model to mitigate the unfavorable revenue impact of new regulation. In fact, we've already begun mitigation efforts, having eliminated free accounts for all customers, except students and seniors, and appraised balance and transaction hurdles, earned a [ph] (00:17:25) waiver of monthly service charges. 
We are closely monitoring performance on a new structure, and we will make further adjustments as necessary, taking into account both customer value provided and related cost of delivery. In all instances, we continue to focus on superior customer service, which we believe sets us apart and which customers highly value. We continue to provide many free account services for customers, but we'll incrementally adjust our pricing models over time to better rationalize the value proposition.
Please keep in mind that the actual impact of Regulation E changes is proving less negative than anticipated. Originally, we expected implementation to reduce service charge on revenues, $72 million during the second half of this year. Based on third quarter results, the second half impact is now expected to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million. This performance and the continued adoption of overdraft services indicate customers find value in these services. In terms of interchange revenue, like the rest of the industry, we are awaiting proposals from our regulators, so it's difficult to project final financial impact. We do have annual interchange fees of approximately $330 million, so any change in fee structure could be significant. But we are seeing a 14% increase in transactions activity year-over-year.
On Basel III, while still being finalized, we are not estimating it to have a significant impact on Regions. Our Tier 1 common ratio is currently in the solid 7.6%, and based on our understanding of these rules, is above Basel III's minimum of 7% guideline. Regions is also expected to meet Basel III's liquidity requirements in this current form. In any case, we will ensure that Regions' capital levels remain strong and fully compliant as the formal implementation of Basel III requirements are better known.
In summary, we are successfully executing our plan to return Regions to sustainable profitability. We are aggressively reducing credit risk, rolling our customer base, implementing productivity and efficiency initiatives and taking appropriate steps to ensure that we are positioned to fully capitalize on profitable revenue growth opportunities. At the same time, we recognize that environmental, economic and regulatory challenges persist, creating headwinds and caution on our part. But I am convinced that Regions has the right strategy and the right people in place to deliver on our commitment. 
David will now discuss third quarter financial results. David?"
271409,113915625,81906,"Regions Financial Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a summary of our third quarter results on Slide 1. As Grayson mentioned, our third quarter loss amounted to $0.17 per diluted share. Pretax pre-provision net revenue, or PPNR, amounted to $4",2158,"Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a summary of our third quarter results on Slide 1. As Grayson mentioned, our third quarter loss amounted to $0.17 per diluted share. Pretax pre-provision net revenue, or PPNR, amounted to $454 million, down about 7% linked quarter, due primarily to the impact of higher credit-related costs and Regulation E. Compared to the same period a year ago, adjusted PPNR was up 11%.
Within PPNR, net interest income continued to grow, increasing $12 million, which drove a nine-basis-point improvement in the net interest margin. Non-interest revenues dipped 1% linked quarter, primarily driven by the impact of service charges from Regulation E, which I'll cover in just a minute.
Absent this impact, non-interest revenues were higher, primarily due to strong mortgage and fixed income brokerage revenue. Non-interest expenses increased $37 million or 3% second to third quarter, excluding second quarter's $200 million regulatory charge. Total non-interest expenses were negatively impacted by the rise in credit-related costs, primarily due to higher OREO and held-for-sale expenses related to the bulk sale of distressed assets.
Regarding credit quality, the level of nonperforming assets, excluding loans held for sale, was down $186 million this quarter to $3.8 billion. The provision for loan losses rose to $760 million from $651 million in the previous quarter and essentially equaled net charge-offs. The increase in charge-offs reflects about $233 million of charges associated with distressed asset sales and the transfer of loans to held for sale.
Let's now take a deeper look into the quarterly results, beginning with credit. As shown on Slide 2, nonperforming assets, excluding loans held for sale, were down 5% this quarter but remained elevated. And I'll reiterate what was said earlier. An increasing and substantial portion of the migration into nonperforming loans was attributable to loans that are paying as agreed. The sluggish and persistent nature of the economy necessitates that we remain cautious when internally risk-rating our portfolio. 
Despite that cautious stance, internally risk-rated problem loans did decline this quarter. However, factors like Florida unemployment, which has been greater than 10% since May 2009, and it's now over 12%, and pressured housing prices in parts of the state require that we not get ahead of ourselves and that we maintain a clear and objective view of the economic environment. To that end, we remain focused on derisking our portfolio.
Our proactive disposition effort remained a key element of our risk management strategy. This quarter, we sold or transferred to held for sale a total of $1 billion of troubled assets. This total reflects a broadened effort, as it included approximately $350 million of distressed asset sales on a bulk basis. These assets, which were predominantly land, included both nonperforming loans and OREO, and resulted in $108 million of associated charge-offs and $30 million in losses that are recorded in non-interest expense. 
While the markdowns were greater than we have previously experienced, we believe the long-term economics justify getting these assets off our books and behind us. Land is one of the most difficult assets to sell, and we were pleased to be able to dispose of these assets as opportunities arose during the quarter. We don't want to be in the property management business, and we'll make every reasonable effort to remove properties and risk from our books when it makes long-term economic sense.
As you can see on Slide 4, net charge-offs increased to $759 million for an annualized 3.52% of average loans and reflect our efforts this quarter to derisk our balance sheet and dispose of problem assets, which contributed $233 million in charge-offs.  Drilling down, the main source of charge-offs continues to be our investor real estate portfolio. Our loan loss provision essentially matched net charge-offs this quarter and was up $109 million linked quarter. Our loan loss allowance to loans ratio increased six basis points linked quarter to 3.77%. As we've said at our Investor Day, we remain cautious about the economy when evaluating the loan portfolio, and our allowance methodology reflects this stance.
Turning to the balance sheet, Slide 5 breaks down this quarter's change in loans. Although investor real estate still accounts for a relatively high percentage of our loan portfolio, we have reduced this exposure substantially through the credit crisis. In fact, total investor real estate loans have declined by $6.5 billion over the last two years, and we continue to make solid progress in reducing this segment of our portfolio as shown by the current quarter reduction of $1.5 billion.
At the same time, targeted efforts to grow segments of our portfolio are getting traction. Most notably, Commercial & Industrial loan balances were 2% in the quarter, primarily through our energy and healthcare lending groups. Energy lending in Texas has been particularly strong. New client acquisition is driving this growth, as line utilization have remained about 40% over the last several months.
Furthermore, we continue to invest in specialized lending groups, including business capital, healthcare, transportation and franchise restaurant. 
Lastly, we are excited about the opportunity to leverage our small-business expertise through our extensive branch network. Our plan to grow consumer loans is multifaceted and includes increased emphasis on direct lending through leveraging the strength of our branch network. Also, on the consumer side, we are evaluating products targeted at the underserved customer segment, a large group with short-term funding needs.
This next slide shows changes in our deposit base this quarter. Ending time deposits declined $2.1 billion, reflecting expected run-off of balances as we reduced maturing high-cost CD rates to market levels. Low-cost deposit growth was somewhat offsetting, with ending balances increasing $854 million or 1% in the quarter. Total deposit levels were also affected by our more disciplined approach to deposit pricing, with some customers choosing to pay down debt rather than hold deposits at current rates. Although customers are deleveraging and paying down their loans, our new checking account growth has helped offset this downward pressure on deposit balances.
Net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, rose $13 million linked quarter, while the margins strengthened nine basis points, increasing to 2.96%. Improvements stemmed primarily from continued optimization of deposit costs and mix. For the quarter, deposit costs declined another nine basis points to 0.7% in the third quarter, and loan yields remained stable at 4.29%.
We expect to see continued improvement in deposit costs and expect to reach a 3% margin in the fourth quarter, as originally projected. In fact, we expected to reach our target of 3% this quarter, but the recent decline in long-term interest rates accelerated mortgage refinance activity and premium amortization within the investment portfolio, which had an adverse impact on net interest margin of around four basis points.
Driving further margin improvement, we have approximately $11.4 billion of CDs maturing over the next nine months, which will be repriced to market rates as they mature. These CDs currently carry an average 2.1% interest rate and should enable us to reduce our overall deposit costs. In addition, the drag to net interest margin associated with interest reversals in carrying excess cash at Fed [ph] (00:29:06) will fade with time. These items were margin headwinds of 16 and eight basis points, respectively, on an annualized basis in the third quarter.
As an update, we have recently adjusted the hedges in place to support the margin in a prolonged low-rate environment. These now reduce our interest rate sensitivity through December 2012. Our emphasis on improving deposit mix and cost, combined with the projected impact of these hedges, is expected to result in modest margin improvement going forward in our most likely rate forecast scenario.
Let's now shift gears and look at non-interest revenue and expenses this quarter. Non-interest revenues were down by about 1% linked quarter, driven by an approximate $16 million impact of Regulation E. Absent this impact, non-interest revenues were higher, reflecting strong mortgage revenue, driven by heavy refinancing activity. In fact, we originated $2.4 billion of loans this quarter versus $1.8 billion last quarter. And refinance activity was much higher, representing 67% of current quarter originations, up from second quarter's 41%. Also contributing to non-interest revenues, Morgan Keegan's brokerage revenues were up 6% versus the prior quarter, reflecting continued private client and fixed income strength. Fixed income revenue was especially strong, increasing 13% linked quarter, driven higher by customer purchasing short-term securities.
In terms of non-interest expense, while credit-related costs continue to remain high, we continue to focus on containing other overall costs. Excluding prior quarters' regulatory charge, total non-interest expense was up $37 million or 3% linked quarter due to a $31 million linked quarter rise in OREO and held-for-sale costs. As I mentioned earlier, the rise in these costs reflects approximately $30 million resulting from a bulk sale of OREO during the quarter. In all, PPNR continues to be impacted by credit-related costs, which on a normalized basis, are impacting us by $75 million to $100 million per quarter.
We recognize in this economy to be successful, we have to be diligent in our efforts to manage expenses. It's going to be a low growth, low rate environment for an extended period of time. And we have to continue to target all areas of staffing, occupancy, discretionary spending and credit-related expenses. Rest assured that any changes we implement, we'll, at the same time, maintain focus on service quality and making sure that we are serving the needs of our customers.
Let me now discuss our capital liquidity. We continue to execute our disciplined capital planning process that we developed over the past year or so, which accounts as various scenario analyses, including stress testing under a range of adverse conditions. It begins with the development of macro economic forecast scenarios, which serve as a basis for our credit modeling. Our capital ratios remained strong, with a Tier 1 capital ratio that now stands at 12.1% and a Tier 1 common ratio at a very solid 7.6%. 
As we stated last quarter, the Collins Amendment will have little impact to our risk-based ratios since trust-preferred securities at about $846 million are a fairly small part of our overall capital base.
Let me briefly touch on Basel III, which will be phased in over the next several years beginning in 2013. We continue to assess the impact and are awaiting the details, but we feel very good about our capital base as our Tier 1 common and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios are above the respective 7% and 8 1/2% minimums required under Basel III. The proposed adjustments are expected to have a minimal impact on us. Similarly, Regions is well-positioned with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio described under Basel III. In fact, we have been internally managing to a similar measure for some time.
Moving to the broader impact of recent regulatory reform, there is no doubt that recent sweeping legislative actions will ripple through banks' operations and financial statements from this point forward. But we are well-positioned to effectively manage any potential impact. In terms of Regulation E, with the August 12 full implementation date behind us, we now have good visibility into foreseeable financial ramifications. As Grayson noted earlier, the negative impact is proving less than our original forecast.
To date, roughly half of all of our customers who have overdrawn their account in the past year have chosen to opt in or link their account for overdraft protection. And 97% of customers who have made an election after experiencing a declined transaction are choosing to opt in or participate in overdraft protection. Clearly, customers are seeing the value in services that ensure their ability to make purchases.
The Durbin Amendment, which affects debit card interchange fees, will likely result in a revenue reduction as well. But keep in mind that final rules have not been established. They will be determined by the Federal Reserve as we head into next year, and we will make adjustments to our products and services as appropriate.
Lastly, unlike many of the larger money center banks or brokerage houses, regulatory reform will only minimally impact our brokerage revenues since Morgan Keegan does not engage in proprietary trading, has little to no private equity exposure and faces very minor impact to its derivatives business. Bottom line, while regulatory changes are certainly challenging from a revenue perspective, I'm confident that we will be able to make adjustments to minimize any long-term financial effect on Regions.
In summary, although we are not pleased with the loss this quarter, our associates remain focused on executing both our short-term and long-term goals. We continue to remain focused on returning the company to sustainable profitability as promptly as possible. And with this quarter's further derisking efforts, we are building a stronger company with an emphasis on improving our risk profile, which will ultimately benefit our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Grayson for closing comments."

Regions had a solid and tested foreclosure process in place to ensure the fairness for customers and compliance with the state and federal regulations. In cases where all options to avoid foreclosure have been exhausted, a committee of key managers approves the decision to proceed with foreclosure after a thorough review of loan documentation. Once a decision has been made to proceed, the process is the same where the loan is owned by Regions or by an investor that we service the mortgage for. In each case, department managers review and verify the accuracy of the loan documents. In states where a mortgage foreclosure affidavit or similar legal documentation is required, the document is completed and signed by the department manager in the presence of a notary employed by Regions.
Due to our foreclosure prevention efforts and a relatively small-sized Regions servicing portfolio, our foreclosure volumes have remained relatively low. Regions forecloses on approximately 100 loans that we own each month and 160 investor-owned loans each month. Staffing levels are sufficient to internally verify loan information and appropriately execute required documentation. Regions has a residential mortgage servicing portfolio of $41.2 billion. Of that, $16.3 billion are loans that we own while $24.9 billion are loans owned by government agencies or investors, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Our foreclosure rate for the entire portfolio, both owned and investor, is less than half the national average. Our ability to maintain low foreclosure rates is the result of proactive efforts to provide solutions to distressed customers. In late 2007, Regions began reaching out to customers at risk of falling behind on payments through our Customer Assistance Program. The program is available to customers whose loans we own and service. To date, we have helped more than 30,000 customers stay in their home. We pursue all available options to help homeowners avoid foreclosure, including loan modifications, rate reductions, short sales and Deed-in-Lieu of foreclosure.
Foreclosure is the option of last resort. When foreclosure does take place, evictions are rare, as many homes are second homes, investment properties or are no longer occupied. Our focus on the customer has resulted in Regions' second consecutive year of ranking in the top five of J.D. Power and Associates customer satisfaction survey for primary mortgage servicers. That being said, we have directed our leadership in the business, in internal audit and in risk management to review and validate each process step to ensure full compliance with all laws and regulations and customer needs.
Operator, that concludes our remarks, and now we will open it up for questions."

Number one is that we do see some of our credit trends clearly moderating. Our early-stage and late-stage delinquencies appear to have stabilized and declining slightly. We do see internal risk-rated loans improving, as you saw in our numbers. However, the migration to nonperforming status clearly stands out this quarter. It was significantly up from last quarter. As we mentioned, last quarter, we were very cautious. One quarter does not make a trend. And as we look, loan portfolio, the pause in economic recovery, it really focused around Commercial Real Estate, and in particular, the guarantor. If you look at -- as the economy continues to have a slow recovery, the capacity and willingness of these guarantors comes into question. And as we look at what's migrated into a nonperforming status this quarter, as you saw the amount, we disposed of a significant amount of that migration, but we also retained quite a bit. And of what we retained, 64%, they're still paying as agreed. But there are already questions. Even though they're paying, there were question raised regarding the capacity or the willingness of those guarantors to continue. With that, I'll ask Bill to make a few comments."

The first thing, we talked about last quarter about being very cautious about where we were with the economy, the slow growth economy. And what we saw in our migration really is a reflection of what we've seen in the economy. Also, as we looked at our valuations, that has caused us to be very conservative in how we've looked at our non-accrual call [ph] (00:42:42), and that's what was the uptick in looking at our gross inflows. As Grayson mentioned, the one thing to talk about, while we're disappointed in the inflow, increase in inflow in migration, what we did notice is that a high percentage of ours, over 60% of the nonperforming loans that we had remaining at the end of the quarter were currently paying. But what the difference is, as Grayson mentioned, there were some question about the guarantors' willingness or capacity to pay, so we thought it was very prudent to put it on non-accrual. Having said that, we do think the loan severity is less than what we have seen before in earlier migrations and also gives us the ability to do more restructures, which in the past, we have not done a lot of restructuring. The other thing that Grayson mentioned is that as we see the gross migration coming in, we are continuing our efforts to aggressively derisk the balance sheet. We've seen that not only in the reduction in our investor real estate of $1.5 billion over the quarter but also our ability to dispose of problem assets in our sales program, which continues to work very well for us."

And so in our pricing that we saw, we saw a little bit more discount than what we have been seeing in the past. That bulk sale discount was about 40% of the book balance that we had. The other thing that I would say is that on our additional sales, we were probably averaging in the low 20s. So an average for us, when you take the bulk sale and what we did on the note sales, was a discount rate on our dispositions of about 31% as opposed to what we did last quarter of 24%."

Although we saw continued improvements in our core business performance this quarter, we have announced a third quarter loss of $0.17 per share due to still elevated credit expense, with an economy that is demonstrating a slow-paced recovery and actions that we've taken to accelerate the disposal of problem assets and reduce our balance sheet risk going forward. 
In addition to absorbing higher costs related to problem asset sales and loans transferred to held for sale, we also recorded a loan loss provision essentially equal to the elevated level of loan charge-offs. Loan loss provision, OREO and held-for-sale costs, in total, were an estimated $0.41 per share after tax this quarter. We executed disposition of $1 billion in problem loans, including $709 million in distressed asset sales. We remain confident in our business plans and our determination to execute these plans and returning Regions to sustainable profitably as properly and prudently as possible. 
Our actions are moving Regions closer to the improvement needed to achieve a breakeven point. We are encouraged by this quarter's business progress that resulted in steps towards achieving that goal. While our credit teams are diligently working to resolve credit-related issues, majority of our associates have demonstrated a focus on profitably growing revenue and constraining operating expenses in our core businesses.
In the third quarter, net interest income rose 1% from second quarter, driven as expected by continued reduction in overall costs of deposits and a favorable shift in mix. And while fee-based revenues declined 1% versus last quarter, the drop was primarily driven by the impact from Regulation E on service charges. Notably, while the implementation of Reg E did negatively impact the quarter, that impact was less than we forecasted, and we continue to be encouraged by the efforts of our associates and our branches and our call centers to further mitigate the impact of this regulatory requirement as we assist customers in making the best decisions to accommodate their needs.
At the same time, operating expenses, while being closely managed, did unfortunately increase due to the impact of higher credit-related expenses. We remain confident in the progress we're making. In spite of the slow pace of economic recovery, our strategies are working. We're disciplined in our focus on customers, and we have developed strong accountability for execution and results. The operating environment does continue to be a challenge. The economy is gradually recovering, but growth is forecasted to be unfavorably slow for the next few quarters, with stubbornly high unemployment, a weak housing market and unusually low interest rates.
Today, economic recovery within our markets has been uneven. Residential home values have not stabilized in many of our markets, especially the markets within the State of Florida, where we can potentially experience another 10% or so decline relative to mid-2010 prices, depending on the ability of the banks and the courts to process foreclosures effectively and the amount of shadow inventory remaining in the system. With that in mind, we are careful when we're making general statements. It may prove to be inaccurate due to the inconsistent valuation from market to market. But we are starting to see what appears to be stabilization in some of our market.
Fortunately, the Gulf oil spill impact on individuals and business customers has been far less economically negative than initially forecasted. It's still a difficult situation for these markets but far less impactful than earlier feared. Regions' maximum loss potential is projected now to be $20 million or less, sharply less than our initial $100 million estimate. That being said, the long-term economic environmental impacts remain a concern, as the markets and businesses along the Gulf Coast recover very slowly.
Across all of our markets, I am convinced the economic conditions are improving, but the slow pace of recovery is weighing on borrowers' capacity and borrowers' willingness to continue to fulfill credit obligations, and thus has decreased the implied potential benefit of guarantor support on many of our credits. As such, we have become incrementally more cautious on our economic outlook, which was a driving factor in the increased gross migration of loans moving to nonperforming status.
I think it's important, however, to consider the composition of that migration. Of the $1.4 billion of third quarter gross nonperforming additions, approximately $390 million were disposed of during the quarter. But of the commercial loans remaining, $933 million, 62% or $575 million were current home payments. Overall, the percentage of nonperforming commercial loans that are current home payments has risen from 24% at the end of the second quarter to 36% at the end of third quarter, giving us more confidence in the ability to manage the potential loss content and the potential to restructure in some cases.
It's also important to point out that our internally risk-rated problem loans declined on a linked-quarter basis. Our early-stage and late-stage delinquencies have stabilized and are moderating. The lingering effects of the slow pace of economic recovery has not helped many of our borrowers, and we have acted cautiously and prudently, reassessing and modifying risk ratings as appropriate. We are focused on being very careful and accurate in assessing the financial condition of our borrowers and taking prompt action as required and as appropriate.
Protracted economic challenges have also reaffirmed our stance with regard to disposing of problem assets, as well as our strategies to reduce exposure to higher-risk loan portfolios, especially investor real estate. Investor real estate declined $1.5 billion, point to point, ending balance in this quarter, achieving $17.5 billion in Investor Commercial Real Estate. 
In terms of strategic growth, our customer focus remains a top priority as we strive to deepen existing relationships and acquire new customers. Our efforts continue to pay off in the third quarter as evidenced by further strengthening in new checking account sales. We remain on track, over more than one million new business and customer checking accounts this year, exceeding 2009's record level. The addition of new relationships is fueling revenue across multiple lines of business for Regions. For example, in the third quarter, we processed 182 million debit card transactions, representing a 14% increase over the third quarter of last year. 
With respect to deposit balances in line with our overall balance sheet strategy, overall deposit levels have declined. As many of you are aware, we had a sizable amount of higher-interest rate CDs maturing in the third quarter and forecasted some runoff as rates were reduced to market levels. Given the reduction of higher-cost deposits, Regions' funding mix and cost continued to improve, declining another nine basis points, driving third quarter's net interest income and net interest margin higher. We remain on track to reach our targeted 3% year-end margin.
Our liquidity remains solid, with a loan-deposit ratio of 89%. While maintaining a clear focus in reducing the overall cost of deposits, we are successful in proving our market position. According to the recently re-released data by the FDIC, the Summary of Deposits analysis, Regions deposit growth ranked first in our peer group and seventh among 25 largest U.S. banks. Furthermore, we grew market share in six of 16 states in which we operate and in 15 of our top 25 MSAs. 
Unfortunately, total average loans did decline in the third quarter, but importantly, at a slower pace than previous quarters and despite the continuing derisking efforts in the investor real estate portfolio. Generating good quality, profitable loans remains a challenge, but we're starting to see some encouraging signs, including a 2% linked-quarter, end-period Commercial & Industrial outstandings.  Within C&I, the growth story really is about our middle market segment, which represents about half of the outstandings. These balances grew 5% in the quarter despite low but stable line utilization.  Most of this production was related to capital expenditures and refinancing of existing debt. 
Small business lending is starting to get traction as well, but this is yet to materialize into growth in net outstandings, given generally light demand. Nevertheless, small business lending is a significant opportunity for Regions as we are the number three small business lender in the country, as ranked by the Small Business Administration.
On whole, we remain cautious but optimistic. Net production volumes will further strengthen in the fourth quarter, due to increasingly solid new business pipelines.
On the consumer side, we continue to emphasize residential first mortgage lending. Production was $2.3 billion for the quarter, a 31% increase over last quarter. We continue to incrementally adjust our business model to mitigate the unfavorable revenue impact of new regulation. In fact, we've already begun mitigation efforts, having eliminated free accounts for all customers, except students and seniors, and appraised balance and transaction hurdles, earned a [ph] (00:17:25) waiver of monthly service charges. 
We are closely monitoring performance on a new structure, and we will make further adjustments as necessary, taking into account both customer value provided and related cost of delivery. In all instances, we continue to focus on superior customer service, which we believe sets us apart and which customers highly value. We continue to provide many free account services for customers, but we'll incrementally adjust our pricing models over time to better rationalize the value proposition.
Please keep in mind that the actual impact of Regulation E changes is proving less negative than anticipated. Originally, we expected implementation to reduce service charge on revenues, $72 million during the second half of this year. Based on third quarter results, the second half impact is now expected to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million. This performance and the continued adoption of overdraft services indicate customers find value in these services. In terms of interchange revenue, like the rest of the industry, we are awaiting proposals from our regulators, so it's difficult to project final financial impact. We do have annual interchange fees of approximately $330 million, so any change in fee structure could be significant. But we are seeing a 14% increase in transactions activity year-over-year.
On Basel III, while still being finalized, we are not estimating it to have a significant impact on Regions. Our Tier 1 common ratio is currently in the solid 7.6%, and based on our understanding of these rules, is above Basel III's minimum of 7% guideline. Regions is also expected to meet Basel III's liquidity requirements in this current form. In any case, we will ensure that Regions' capital levels remain strong and fully compliant as the formal implementation of Basel III requirements are better known.
In summary, we are successfully executing our plan to return Regions to sustainable profitability. We are aggressively reducing credit risk, rolling our customer base, implementing productivity and efficiency initiatives and taking appropriate steps to ensure that we are positioned to fully capitalize on profitable revenue growth opportunities. At the same time, we recognize that environmental, economic and regulatory challenges persist, creating headwinds and caution on our part. But I am convinced that Regions has the right strategy and the right people in place to deliver on our commitment. 
David will now discuss third quarter financial results. David?"
271409,113915625,81908,"Regions Financial Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a summary of our third quarter results on Slide 1. As Grayson mentioned, our third quarter loss amounted to $0.17 per diluted share. Pretax pre-provision net revenue, or PPNR, amounted to $4",2158,"Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a summary of our third quarter results on Slide 1. As Grayson mentioned, our third quarter loss amounted to $0.17 per diluted share. Pretax pre-provision net revenue, or PPNR, amounted to $454 million, down about 7% linked quarter, due primarily to the impact of higher credit-related costs and Regulation E. Compared to the same period a year ago, adjusted PPNR was up 11%.
Within PPNR, net interest income continued to grow, increasing $12 million, which drove a nine-basis-point improvement in the net interest margin. Non-interest revenues dipped 1% linked quarter, primarily driven by the impact of service charges from Regulation E, which I'll cover in just a minute.
Absent this impact, non-interest revenues were higher, primarily due to strong mortgage and fixed income brokerage revenue. Non-interest expenses increased $37 million or 3% second to third quarter, excluding second quarter's $200 million regulatory charge. Total non-interest expenses were negatively impacted by the rise in credit-related costs, primarily due to higher OREO and held-for-sale expenses related to the bulk sale of distressed assets.
Regarding credit quality, the level of nonperforming assets, excluding loans held for sale, was down $186 million this quarter to $3.8 billion. The provision for loan losses rose to $760 million from $651 million in the previous quarter and essentially equaled net charge-offs. The increase in charge-offs reflects about $233 million of charges associated with distressed asset sales and the transfer of loans to held for sale.
Let's now take a deeper look into the quarterly results, beginning with credit. As shown on Slide 2, nonperforming assets, excluding loans held for sale, were down 5% this quarter but remained elevated. And I'll reiterate what was said earlier. An increasing and substantial portion of the migration into nonperforming loans was attributable to loans that are paying as agreed. The sluggish and persistent nature of the economy necessitates that we remain cautious when internally risk-rating our portfolio. 
Despite that cautious stance, internally risk-rated problem loans did decline this quarter. However, factors like Florida unemployment, which has been greater than 10% since May 2009, and it's now over 12%, and pressured housing prices in parts of the state require that we not get ahead of ourselves and that we maintain a clear and objective view of the economic environment. To that end, we remain focused on derisking our portfolio.
Our proactive disposition effort remained a key element of our risk management strategy. This quarter, we sold or transferred to held for sale a total of $1 billion of troubled assets. This total reflects a broadened effort, as it included approximately $350 million of distressed asset sales on a bulk basis. These assets, which were predominantly land, included both nonperforming loans and OREO, and resulted in $108 million of associated charge-offs and $30 million in losses that are recorded in non-interest expense. 
While the markdowns were greater than we have previously experienced, we believe the long-term economics justify getting these assets off our books and behind us. Land is one of the most difficult assets to sell, and we were pleased to be able to dispose of these assets as opportunities arose during the quarter. We don't want to be in the property management business, and we'll make every reasonable effort to remove properties and risk from our books when it makes long-term economic sense.
As you can see on Slide 4, net charge-offs increased to $759 million for an annualized 3.52% of average loans and reflect our efforts this quarter to derisk our balance sheet and dispose of problem assets, which contributed $233 million in charge-offs.  Drilling down, the main source of charge-offs continues to be our investor real estate portfolio. Our loan loss provision essentially matched net charge-offs this quarter and was up $109 million linked quarter. Our loan loss allowance to loans ratio increased six basis points linked quarter to 3.77%. As we've said at our Investor Day, we remain cautious about the economy when evaluating the loan portfolio, and our allowance methodology reflects this stance.
Turning to the balance sheet, Slide 5 breaks down this quarter's change in loans. Although investor real estate still accounts for a relatively high percentage of our loan portfolio, we have reduced this exposure substantially through the credit crisis. In fact, total investor real estate loans have declined by $6.5 billion over the last two years, and we continue to make solid progress in reducing this segment of our portfolio as shown by the current quarter reduction of $1.5 billion.
At the same time, targeted efforts to grow segments of our portfolio are getting traction. Most notably, Commercial & Industrial loan balances were 2% in the quarter, primarily through our energy and healthcare lending groups. Energy lending in Texas has been particularly strong. New client acquisition is driving this growth, as line utilization have remained about 40% over the last several months.
Furthermore, we continue to invest in specialized lending groups, including business capital, healthcare, transportation and franchise restaurant. 
Lastly, we are excited about the opportunity to leverage our small-business expertise through our extensive branch network. Our plan to grow consumer loans is multifaceted and includes increased emphasis on direct lending through leveraging the strength of our branch network. Also, on the consumer side, we are evaluating products targeted at the underserved customer segment, a large group with short-term funding needs.
This next slide shows changes in our deposit base this quarter. Ending time deposits declined $2.1 billion, reflecting expected run-off of balances as we reduced maturing high-cost CD rates to market levels. Low-cost deposit growth was somewhat offsetting, with ending balances increasing $854 million or 1% in the quarter. Total deposit levels were also affected by our more disciplined approach to deposit pricing, with some customers choosing to pay down debt rather than hold deposits at current rates. Although customers are deleveraging and paying down their loans, our new checking account growth has helped offset this downward pressure on deposit balances.
Net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, rose $13 million linked quarter, while the margins strengthened nine basis points, increasing to 2.96%. Improvements stemmed primarily from continued optimization of deposit costs and mix. For the quarter, deposit costs declined another nine basis points to 0.7% in the third quarter, and loan yields remained stable at 4.29%.
We expect to see continued improvement in deposit costs and expect to reach a 3% margin in the fourth quarter, as originally projected. In fact, we expected to reach our target of 3% this quarter, but the recent decline in long-term interest rates accelerated mortgage refinance activity and premium amortization within the investment portfolio, which had an adverse impact on net interest margin of around four basis points.
Driving further margin improvement, we have approximately $11.4 billion of CDs maturing over the next nine months, which will be repriced to market rates as they mature. These CDs currently carry an average 2.1% interest rate and should enable us to reduce our overall deposit costs. In addition, the drag to net interest margin associated with interest reversals in carrying excess cash at Fed [ph] (00:29:06) will fade with time. These items were margin headwinds of 16 and eight basis points, respectively, on an annualized basis in the third quarter.
As an update, we have recently adjusted the hedges in place to support the margin in a prolonged low-rate environment. These now reduce our interest rate sensitivity through December 2012. Our emphasis on improving deposit mix and cost, combined with the projected impact of these hedges, is expected to result in modest margin improvement going forward in our most likely rate forecast scenario.
Let's now shift gears and look at non-interest revenue and expenses this quarter. Non-interest revenues were down by about 1% linked quarter, driven by an approximate $16 million impact of Regulation E. Absent this impact, non-interest revenues were higher, reflecting strong mortgage revenue, driven by heavy refinancing activity. In fact, we originated $2.4 billion of loans this quarter versus $1.8 billion last quarter. And refinance activity was much higher, representing 67% of current quarter originations, up from second quarter's 41%. Also contributing to non-interest revenues, Morgan Keegan's brokerage revenues were up 6% versus the prior quarter, reflecting continued private client and fixed income strength. Fixed income revenue was especially strong, increasing 13% linked quarter, driven higher by customer purchasing short-term securities.
In terms of non-interest expense, while credit-related costs continue to remain high, we continue to focus on containing other overall costs. Excluding prior quarters' regulatory charge, total non-interest expense was up $37 million or 3% linked quarter due to a $31 million linked quarter rise in OREO and held-for-sale costs. As I mentioned earlier, the rise in these costs reflects approximately $30 million resulting from a bulk sale of OREO during the quarter. In all, PPNR continues to be impacted by credit-related costs, which on a normalized basis, are impacting us by $75 million to $100 million per quarter.
We recognize in this economy to be successful, we have to be diligent in our efforts to manage expenses. It's going to be a low growth, low rate environment for an extended period of time. And we have to continue to target all areas of staffing, occupancy, discretionary spending and credit-related expenses. Rest assured that any changes we implement, we'll, at the same time, maintain focus on service quality and making sure that we are serving the needs of our customers.
Let me now discuss our capital liquidity. We continue to execute our disciplined capital planning process that we developed over the past year or so, which accounts as various scenario analyses, including stress testing under a range of adverse conditions. It begins with the development of macro economic forecast scenarios, which serve as a basis for our credit modeling. Our capital ratios remained strong, with a Tier 1 capital ratio that now stands at 12.1% and a Tier 1 common ratio at a very solid 7.6%. 
As we stated last quarter, the Collins Amendment will have little impact to our risk-based ratios since trust-preferred securities at about $846 million are a fairly small part of our overall capital base.
Let me briefly touch on Basel III, which will be phased in over the next several years beginning in 2013. We continue to assess the impact and are awaiting the details, but we feel very good about our capital base as our Tier 1 common and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios are above the respective 7% and 8 1/2% minimums required under Basel III. The proposed adjustments are expected to have a minimal impact on us. Similarly, Regions is well-positioned with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio described under Basel III. In fact, we have been internally managing to a similar measure for some time.
Moving to the broader impact of recent regulatory reform, there is no doubt that recent sweeping legislative actions will ripple through banks' operations and financial statements from this point forward. But we are well-positioned to effectively manage any potential impact. In terms of Regulation E, with the August 12 full implementation date behind us, we now have good visibility into foreseeable financial ramifications. As Grayson noted earlier, the negative impact is proving less than our original forecast.
To date, roughly half of all of our customers who have overdrawn their account in the past year have chosen to opt in or link their account for overdraft protection. And 97% of customers who have made an election after experiencing a declined transaction are choosing to opt in or participate in overdraft protection. Clearly, customers are seeing the value in services that ensure their ability to make purchases.
The Durbin Amendment, which affects debit card interchange fees, will likely result in a revenue reduction as well. But keep in mind that final rules have not been established. They will be determined by the Federal Reserve as we head into next year, and we will make adjustments to our products and services as appropriate.
Lastly, unlike many of the larger money center banks or brokerage houses, regulatory reform will only minimally impact our brokerage revenues since Morgan Keegan does not engage in proprietary trading, has little to no private equity exposure and faces very minor impact to its derivatives business. Bottom line, while regulatory changes are certainly challenging from a revenue perspective, I'm confident that we will be able to make adjustments to minimize any long-term financial effect on Regions.
In summary, although we are not pleased with the loss this quarter, our associates remain focused on executing both our short-term and long-term goals. We continue to remain focused on returning the company to sustainable profitability as promptly as possible. And with this quarter's further derisking efforts, we are building a stronger company with an emphasis on improving our risk profile, which will ultimately benefit our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Grayson for closing comments."

Regions had a solid and tested foreclosure process in place to ensure the fairness for customers and compliance with the state and federal regulations. In cases where all options to avoid foreclosure have been exhausted, a committee of key managers approves the decision to proceed with foreclosure after a thorough review of loan documentation. Once a decision has been made to proceed, the process is the same where the loan is owned by Regions or by an investor that we service the mortgage for. In each case, department managers review and verify the accuracy of the loan documents. In states where a mortgage foreclosure affidavit or similar legal documentation is required, the document is completed and signed by the department manager in the presence of a notary employed by Regions.
Due to our foreclosure prevention efforts and a relatively small-sized Regions servicing portfolio, our foreclosure volumes have remained relatively low. Regions forecloses on approximately 100 loans that we own each month and 160 investor-owned loans each month. Staffing levels are sufficient to internally verify loan information and appropriately execute required documentation. Regions has a residential mortgage servicing portfolio of $41.2 billion. Of that, $16.3 billion are loans that we own while $24.9 billion are loans owned by government agencies or investors, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Our foreclosure rate for the entire portfolio, both owned and investor, is less than half the national average. Our ability to maintain low foreclosure rates is the result of proactive efforts to provide solutions to distressed customers. In late 2007, Regions began reaching out to customers at risk of falling behind on payments through our Customer Assistance Program. The program is available to customers whose loans we own and service. To date, we have helped more than 30,000 customers stay in their home. We pursue all available options to help homeowners avoid foreclosure, including loan modifications, rate reductions, short sales and Deed-in-Lieu of foreclosure.
Foreclosure is the option of last resort. When foreclosure does take place, evictions are rare, as many homes are second homes, investment properties or are no longer occupied. Our focus on the customer has resulted in Regions' second consecutive year of ranking in the top five of J.D. Power and Associates customer satisfaction survey for primary mortgage servicers. That being said, we have directed our leadership in the business, in internal audit and in risk management to review and validate each process step to ensure full compliance with all laws and regulations and customer needs.
Operator, that concludes our remarks, and now we will open it up for questions."

Number one is that we do see some of our credit trends clearly moderating. Our early-stage and late-stage delinquencies appear to have stabilized and declining slightly. We do see internal risk-rated loans improving, as you saw in our numbers. However, the migration to nonperforming status clearly stands out this quarter. It was significantly up from last quarter. As we mentioned, last quarter, we were very cautious. One quarter does not make a trend. And as we look, loan portfolio, the pause in economic recovery, it really focused around Commercial Real Estate, and in particular, the guarantor. If you look at -- as the economy continues to have a slow recovery, the capacity and willingness of these guarantors comes into question. And as we look at what's migrated into a nonperforming status this quarter, as you saw the amount, we disposed of a significant amount of that migration, but we also retained quite a bit. And of what we retained, 64%, they're still paying as agreed. But there are already questions. Even though they're paying, there were question raised regarding the capacity or the willingness of those guarantors to continue. With that, I'll ask Bill to make a few comments."

The first thing, we talked about last quarter about being very cautious about where we were with the economy, the slow growth economy. And what we saw in our migration really is a reflection of what we've seen in the economy. Also, as we looked at our valuations, that has caused us to be very conservative in how we've looked at our non-accrual call [ph] (00:42:42), and that's what was the uptick in looking at our gross inflows. As Grayson mentioned, the one thing to talk about, while we're disappointed in the inflow, increase in inflow in migration, what we did notice is that a high percentage of ours, over 60% of the nonperforming loans that we had remaining at the end of the quarter were currently paying. But what the difference is, as Grayson mentioned, there were some question about the guarantors' willingness or capacity to pay, so we thought it was very prudent to put it on non-accrual. Having said that, we do think the loan severity is less than what we have seen before in earlier migrations and also gives us the ability to do more restructures, which in the past, we have not done a lot of restructuring. The other thing that Grayson mentioned is that as we see the gross migration coming in, we are continuing our efforts to aggressively derisk the balance sheet. We've seen that not only in the reduction in our investor real estate of $1.5 billion over the quarter but also our ability to dispose of problem assets in our sales program, which continues to work very well for us."

And so in our pricing that we saw, we saw a little bit more discount than what we have been seeing in the past. That bulk sale discount was about 40% of the book balance that we had. The other thing that I would say is that on our additional sales, we were probably averaging in the low 20s. So an average for us, when you take the bulk sale and what we did on the note sales, was a discount rate on our dispositions of about 31% as opposed to what we did last quarter of 24%."

Although we saw continued improvements in our core business performance this quarter, we have announced the third quarter loss of $0.17 per share due to still elevated credit expense with an economy that is demonstrating a slow paced recovery and actions that we have taken to accelerate the disposal of problem assets, and reduce our balance sheet risk going forward.
In addition to absorbing higher costs related to problem asset sales and loans transferred to held for sale, we also reported a loan loss provision essentially equal to the elevated level of loan charge-offs. Loan loss provision, OREO and held for sale cost in total were an estimated $0.41 per share after tax this quarter. 
We executed disposition of $1 billion in problem loans, including 709 in distressed asset sales. We remain confident our business plans and our determination to execute these plans and returning Regions to sustainable profitability as powerfully and prudently as possible. Our actions are moving Region to Regions closer to the improvement needed to achieve a breakeven point. We are encouraged by this course of business progress that result in steps towards achieving that goal. Our credit teams are diligently working to resolve credit related issues. Majority of our associates have demonstrated a focus on profitably grow our revenue and constraining operating expenses in our core businesses. 
In the third quarter net interest income rose 1% from second quarter driven as expected by continued reduction in overall cost of deposits and a favorable shift and mix. And while our fee based revenues declined 1% versus last quarter, the drop was primarily driven by the impact from regulation E on service charges. Notably, while the implication of Reg E did negatively impact the quarter that impact was less than we forecasted, and we continue to be encouraged by the efforts of our associates and our branches and our call centers to further mitigate the impact in this regulatory requirement as we assist customers in making the best decisions to accommodate their needs. 
At the same time, operating expenses on being closely managed did unfortunately increase due to the impact of higher credit related expenses. We remain confident in the current progress we're making in spite of the slow paced economic recovery. Our strategies are working with discipline and are focused on customers, and we have developed strong accountability for execution and results. 
The operating environment does continue to be a challenge. The economy is gradually recovering. But growth is forecasted to be unfavorably slow for the next few quarters with stubbornly high unemployment, a weak housing market and unusually low interest rates. 
Today economic recovery within our markets has been uneven. Residential home values have now stabilized in many of our markets, especially the markets within the state of Florida where we could potentially experience another 10% or so decline relative to mid 2010 prices depending on the ability of the banks and the courts to process foreclosures effectively, and the amount of shadow inventory remaining in the system. 
With that in mind, we are careful when making general statements. It may prove to be inaccurate due to the inconsistent valuation from market to market. But we are starting to see what appears to be stabilization in some of our market.
Fortunately, the Gulf oil spills impact on individuals and business customers has been far less economically negative than initially forecasted. It's still a difficult situation for these markets, but far less impacted than earlier feared. 
Regions maximum loss potential is projected now to be $20 million or less, sharply less than our initial $100 million estimate. That being said, the long term economic environmental impacts remain a concern as the markets and businesses along the Gulf Coast recover very slowly. 
Across all of our markets, I am convinced the economic conditions are improving. But the slow pace of recovery is weighing on borrowers capacity, and borrowers willingness to continue to fill credit obligations. And thus has decreased the implied potential benefit of guarantor support on many of our credits. As such we have become incrementally more cautious on our economic outlook, which was a driving factor in the increased gross migration loans moving to a non-performing status.
I think it's important, however to consider the composition of that migration. Of the $1.4 billion of third quarter gross non-performing additions approximately $390 million were disposed off during the quarter. Of the commercial loans remaining $933 million 62% or $575 million were current home payments. 
Overall the percentage of non-performing commercial loans their internal payments has risen from 24% at the end of second quarter to 36% at the end of third quarter giving us more confidence in the ability to manage the potential loss content and the potential to restructure in some cases. It's also important to point out that our internally risk-rated problem loans declined on a linked quarter basis. Our early stage and late stage delinquencies have stabilized and our moderating. 
The lingering effects of the slow pace of the economic recovery has not helped many of our borrowers, and we have acted cautiously and prudently reassessing and modifying risks ratings as appropriate. We are focused on being very careful and accurate in assessing the financial condition of our borrowers in taking prompt action as required and as appropriate. 
Protracted economic challenges have also reaffirmed our stance for your card to disposing a problem asset, as well as our strategy to reduce exposure at a higher risk loan portfolios, especially investor real estate. Investor real estate declined $1.5 billion point to point ending balance in this quarter achieving $17.5 billion in investor commercial real state. 
In terms of strategic growth, our customer focus remains a top priority as we strive to deepen existing relationships and acquire new customers. Our efforts continue to payoff in the third quarter as evidenced by further strengthening in new checking account sales. We remain on track open more than $1 million new business consumer checking accounts this year exceeding 2009's record level. 
The addition of new relationships is fuelling revenue across multiple lines of business for Regions. For example, in third quarter we processed a $182 million debit card transactions, representing a 14% increase over the third quarter of last year. 
With respect to deposit balances, in line with our overall balance sheet strategy overall deposit levels have declined. As many of you are aware we had a sizable amount higher-interest rate CDs mature in the third quarter, and forecasted some run-off as rates were reduced to market levels. 
Given the reduction in higher cost deposits, Regions funding mix and costs continue to improve, declining another 9 basis points driving third quarters net interest income and net interest margin higher. We made it on track to reach our targeted 3% year end margin. Our liquidity remains solid, with a loan deposit ratio of 89%. While maintaining clear focus on reducing the overall cost deposits, we are successful in improving our market position. 
According to the recently released data by the FDIC summary deposit analysis Regions deposit growth ranked first in our peer group and seventh among 25 largest US banks. Furthermore, we grew market share in 6 to 16 states in which we operate, and in 15 of our top 25 MSA's. Unfortunately, total average loans did decline in the third quarter, but importantly at a slower pace than previous quarters. And despite the continuing de-risking efforts in investor real estate portfolio generating good quality profitable loans remains a challenge, but we are starting to see some encouraging signs, including a 2% linked quarter in the period commercial industrial outstandings. 
Within CNI the growth story really is about our middle market segment, which represents about half the outstandings. These balances grew 5% in the quarter, despite loan with stable land utilization. Most of this production was related to capital expenditures and re-financing of existing debt. 
Small business lending is starting to get tractions well, but this is yet to materialize and to grow to net outstanding given the generally locked demand. Nevertheless small business lending is a significant opportunity for Regions as we are the number three small business lender in the country of the small business administration. On the whole we remain cautious but optimistic. Net production volumes will further strengthen in the first quarter due to increasingly solid new business pipelines.
On the consumer side, we continue to emphasize residential first mortgage lending, production was $2.3 billion for the quarter, a 31% increase over the last quarter. We continue to incrementally adjust our business model to mitigate the unfavorable revenue impact of new regulation. In fact we've already begun mitigation efforts and even eliminated free accounts for all customers except students and seniors and have arranged balance and transaction hurdles for a waiver of monthly service charges.
We are closely monitoring performance on a new structure and we will make further adjustments as necessary taking into account both customer value provided and related cost of delivery. In all instances we continue to focus on superior customer service which we believe sets us apart and which customer probably value. We continue to provide many free account services for customers but will incrementally adjust our pricing models over time to better rationalize the value proposition.
Please keep in mind that the actual impact of Regulation E changes are proving less negative than anticipated. Originally we'd expected implementation to reduce service charge revenues of $72 million here in the second half of this year. Based on third quarter results the second half impact is now expected to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million. This performance and the continued adoption of overdraft services indicate customers find value in these services.
In terms of interchange revenue, like the rest of the industry we're awaiting OREO rules for our regulators. So it's difficult to project final financial impact. We do have annual interchange fees of approximately $330 million. So any change in fee structure could be significant. But we are seeing a 14% increase in transaction activity year-over-year.
Although our offerings are still being finalized, we are not estimating it to have a significant impact on all regions. Our Tier 1 common ratio is currently at a solid 7.6% and based on our understanding of OREO rules it's above (inaudible) minimum 7% guidelines. Regions is also expected to meet [Bozell] 3 liquidity requirements in this current form. In any case we will ensure that Regions capital levels remain strong and OREO compliant as the formal implementation of Bozell 3 requirements are better known. 
In summary, we are successful executing our plan to return Regions to sustainable profitability. We are aggressively reducing credit risk, growing our customer base, implementing productivity and efficiency initiatives and taking appropriate steps to ensure that we are positioned to fully capitalize on the profitable revenue growth opportunities. At the same time we've recognized that environmental economic and regulatory challenges persists creating head wins and caution on our part but I am convinced, that Regions has the right strategy and the right people and place to deliver on our commitment.
David will now discuss third quarter financial results.

Let's begin with a summary of our third quarter results on Slide 1.As Grayson mentioned, our third quarter loss amounted to $0.17 per diluted share. Pretax, pre-provision net revenue or PPNR amounted to $454",2188,"Thank you Grayson and good morning everyone. Let's begin with a summary of our third quarter results on Slide 1.
As Grayson mentioned, our third quarter loss amounted to $0.17 per diluted share. Pretax, pre-provision net revenue or PPNR amounted to $454 million down about 7% linked quarter due primarily to the impact of higher credit related cost and Regulation E. Compared to the same period a year ago, adjusted PPNR was up 11%.
Within PPNR, net interest income continued to grow increasing $12 million which grew which drove a 9 basis points improvement in the net interest margin. Non interest revenues dipped 1% linked quarter primarily driven by the impact of service charges from Regulation E which I will cover in just a minute. After this impact, non-interest revenues were higher primarily due to strong mortgage and fixed income brokerage revenues. Non-interest expenses increased $37 million or 3% second to third excluding second quarter's $200 million regulatory charge.
Total non-interest expenses were negatively impacted by the rise in credit related cost primarily due to the higher OREO and HealthSouth expenses related to the bulk sale of distressed assets. Regarding credit quality the level of non-performing assets excluding loan sale for sale was down $186 million this quarter to $3.8 billion. The provision for loan losses rose to $760 million from $651 million in the previous quarter and essentially equaled net charge offs. The increase in charge offs reflects about $233 million of charges associated with distressed asset sales and the transfer of loans held for sale.
Let's now take a deeper look at the quarterly results beginning with credit. Shown in slide 2 non-performing assets excluding loans held for sale were down 5% this quarter, but remain elevated. I will now reiterate what was said earlier, an increasing and substantial portion of the migration into non-performing loans was attributable to loans that are paying as agreed. The sluggish and persistent nature of the economy necessities that we remain cautious which internally risk rating our portfolio. Despite that cautious stands internally risk related problem loans did decline this quarter.
However factors like Florida Unemployment which has been greater than 10% since May 2009 and its now over 12% and pressured housing prices in parts of the state require that we not get ahead of ourselves and that we maintain a clear and objective view of the economic environment. To that end, we remain focused on de-risking our portfolio.
Our proactive disposition efforts remain a key element of our risk management strategy. This quarter we sold or transferred the held for sale, a total of $1 billion of troubled assets. This total reflects a broadened effort as it included approximately $350 million of distressed asset sales on a bulk basis. These assets which will predominantly land included both non-performing loans and OREO and resulted in $108 million of associated charge offs and $30 million in losses that are recorded in non-interest expense.
While the markdowns are greater than we have previously experienced, we believe that long term economics justify getting these assets off our books and behind us. Land is one of the most difficult assets to sell and we were pleased to be able to dispose off these assets as opportunities arose during the quarter. We don't want to be in the property management business and we'll make every reasonable effort to remove properties and risk from our books when it makes long-term economic since.
As you can see on Slide 4, net charge offs increased to $759 million or an annualized 3.52% of average loans and reflect our efforts this quarter to de-risk our balance sheet and dispose off problem assets which contributed $233 million in charge offs. Drilling down the main source of charge-offs continues to be our investor real estate portfolio. Our loan-loss provision essentially matched net charge-offs this quarter and was up $109 million linked quarter. 
Our loan loss allowance to loans ratio increased six basis points, linked quarter to 3.77%. As we said at our Investor Day, we were mainly cautious about the economy when evaluating the loan portfolio and our allowance methodology reflects this stance.
Turning to the balance sheet, slide 5 breaks down this quarter's change in loans. Although investor real estates still accounts for a relatively high percentage of our loan portfolio we have reduced this exposure substantially through the credit crisis. In fact, total investor real estate loans have declined by $6.5 billion over the last two years and we continue to make solid progress in reducing this segment of our portfolio as shown by the current quarter reduction of $1.5 billion.
At the same time targeted efforts to grow segments of our portfolio are getting traction. Most notably commercial and industrial loan balances were 2% in the quarter, primarily through our energy and health care lending groups. Energy lending in Texas has been particularly strong. New client acquisition is driving this growth as line utilization have remained about 40% over the last several months. 
Furthermore, we continue to invest in specialized lending groups including business capital, health care, transportation and franchise restaurant. Lastly, we are excited about the opportunity to leverage our small business expertise through our extensive branch network. Our plan to grow consumer loans is most multifaceted and includes increased emphasis on direct lending for leveraging the strength of our branch network. Also on the consumer side we are evaluating products targeted at the underserved customer segment, a large group with short term funding needs. 
This next slide shows changes in our deposit basis quarter, ending time deposits declined $2.1 billion, reflecting expected run-off of balances as we reduced the maturing high cost CD rate to market levels. Low cost deposit growth was somewhat offsetting with ending balances increasing $854 million or 1% in the quarter. 
Total deposit levels were also affected by our more disciplined approach to deposit pricing with some customers choosing to pay down the debt rather than hold deposits at current rates. Although customers are deleveraging and paying down their loans our new checking account growth has helped offset this down refresher on deposit balances.
Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis rose $13 million linked quarter, while the margin strengthened 9 basis points increasing to 2.96%. Improvements stemmed primarily from continued optimization of deposit cost and mix. For the quarter, deposit cost declined another 9 basis points to 0.7% in the third quarter, and loan yields remained stable at 4.29%.
We expect to see continued improvement in deposit cost and expect to reach a 3% margin in the fourth quarter, as originally projected. In fact, we expected to reach our target of 3% this quarter. But the recent decline in long term interest rates accelerated mortgage refinance activity, and premium amortization within the investment portfolio which had an adverse impact on net interest margin of around 4 basis points. 
Driving further margin improvement, we have approximately $11.4 billion subsidies maturing over the next nine months which will be repriced to market rates as they mature. These CDs currently carry an average 2.1% interest rate, and should enable us to reduce our overall deposit costs. In addition, the drag to net interest margin associated with interest reversals in carrying excess cash deferred will fade with time. These items were margin headwinds of 16 and 8 basis points, respectively on an annualized basis in the third quarter.
As an update, we have recently adjusted the hedges in places to support the margin in a prolonged low rate environment. These now reduce our interest rate sensitivity through December 2012. Our emphasis on improving deposit mix and cost combined with the projected impact of these hedges is expected to result in modest margin improvement going forward in our most likely rate forecast scenario.
Let's now shift gears and look at non-interest revenue and expenses this quarter. Non-interest revenues were down by about 1% linked-quarter, driven by approximate $16 million impact of Regulation E. Except this impact, non-interest revenues were higher reflecting strong mortgage revenue driven by heavy refinancing activity. In fact, we originated $2.4 billion of loans this quarter versus $1.8 billion last quarter, and refinance activity was much higher representing 67% of current quarter originations up from second quarter's 41%. Also contributing to non-interest revenues, Morgan Keegan's brokerage revenues were up 6% versus the prior quarter, reflecting continued private client and fixed income strength. Fixed income revenue was especially strong, increasing 13% linked quarter driven by higher by customer purchasing short term securities.
In terms of non-interest expense, while credit related costs continue to remain high, we continue to focus on containing other overall cost. Excluding prior quarter's regulatory charge, total non-interest expense was up $37 million or 3% linked quarter, due to a $31 million linked quarter rise in OREO and held for sale cost. As I mentioned earlier, the rise in these costs reflects approximately $30 million resulting from a bulk sale of OREO during the quarter.
In all of PPNR continues to be impact by credit related cost, which on a normalized basis are impacting us by $75 million to $100 million per quarter. We recognize in this economy to be successful we have to be diligent in our efforts to manage expenses. It's going to be a low growth, low rate environment for an extended period of time, and we have to continue to target all areas of staffing, occupancy, discretionary expending and credit related expenses. Rest assured that any changes we implement, will at the same time maintain focus on the service quality and making sure that we are serving the needs of our customers. 
Let me now discuss our capital and liquidity. We continue to execute our disciplined capital planning process that we developed over the past year so, which encompasses various scenario analysis, including stress testing under a range of adverse conditions. It begins with the development of macro economic forecast scenarios, which serve as a basis for our credit modeling. Our capital ratios remain strong with a Tier 1 capital ratio that now stands at 12.1%, and a Tier 1 common ratio at a very solid 7.6%. As we stated last quarter, cards amendment will have little impact to our risk based ratios, since trust preferred securities at about $846 million are a fairly small part of our overall capital base.
Let me briefly touch on Basel III, which will be phased in over the next several years beginning in 2013. We continue to assess the impact and are awaiting the details, but we feel very good about our capital base as our Tier 1 common and Tier 1 risk based capital ratios are above the respective 7% and 8.5% minimums required under Basel III. The proposed adjustments are expected to have a minimal impact on us. Similarly, Regions is well positioned with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio described under Basel III. In fact, we have been internally managing to similar measure for some time. 
Moving to the broader impact of recent regulatory reform, there is no doubt that recent sweeping legislative actions will ripple through bank's operations and financial statements from this quarter forward. But we are well positioned to effectively manage any potential impact in terms of Regulation E with the August 12 full implementation date behind us, we now have good visibility and foreseeable financial ramifications. 
As Grayson noted earlier, the negative impact is proving less than our original forecast. To-date, roughly half of all of our customers who have overdrawn their account in the past year have chosen to opt in or link their account for overdraft protection. And 97% of customers who have made an election after experiencing a declined transaction are choosing to opt in or participate in overdraft protection. Clearly, customers are seeing value and services that ensure their ability to make purchases. 
The Durbin amendment which effects debit card interchange fees will likely result in a revenue reduction as well. But keep in mind, that final rules have not been established. They will be determined by the federal reserve as we head into next year, and we will make adjustments to our products and services as appropriate. 
Lastly, unlike many of the larger money center banks or brokerage houses, regulatory reform will only minimally impact our brokerage revenues since Morgan Keegan is not engaged in proprietary trading as little to no private equity exposure and faces very minor impact to its derivatives business. Bottom-line, while regulatory changes are certainly challenging from a revenue perspective, I'm confident that we will be able to make adjustments to minimize any long term financial effect on Regions.
In summary, although we are not pleased with the loss this quarter, our associates remain focused on executing both our short term and long term goals. We continue to remain focused on returning the company to sustainable profitability as promptly as possible and with this quarter's further de-risking efforts we are building a stronger company with an emphasis on improving our risk profile we will have ultimately tested our shareholders. With that I'll turn it back over to Grayson for closing comments.

It has received a tremendous amount of publicity of late, residential foreclosures. Regions have a solid and tested foreclosure process in place to ensure the fairness for customers and compliance with state and federal regulations.
In cases where all options to avoid foreclosures had been exhausted the committee of key managers approves the decision to perceive before closure after a thorough dealing of loan documentation. Once the decision has been made to proceed the process is the same where the loan is owned by Regions or by an investor that we service the mortgage for.
In each case, department managers review and verify the accuracies of loan documents and states where mortgage foreclosure affidavit or some other legal documentation is required. The document is completed and signed by the department manager in the presence of a notary employed by Regions. Due to our foreclosure prevention efforts and a relatively small sized Regions' servicing portfolio, our foreclosure volumes have remained relatively low.
Regions foreclosures on approximately 100 loans that we own each month and 160 investor loans each month. Staffing levels are sufficient to internally verify loan information and appropriately execute required documentation. Regions has a residential mortgage servicing portfolio of $41.2 billion. Of that $16.3 billion are loans that we own while $24.9 billion are loans owned by government agencies or investors such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Our foreclosure rate for the entire portfolio both owned and investor is less than half the national average. 
Our ability to maintain lower foreclosure rates is the result of proactive efforts to provide solutions to distressed customers. In late 2007 Regions began reaching out to customers at the risk of falling behind in payments through our customer systems program. This program is available to customers whose loans we own and service. To date, we have helped more then 30,000 customer stay in their home. We have received all available options to help homeowners avoid the foreclosure including loan modifications, rate reductions, short sales and Deed-in-Lieu of Foreclosure.
Foreclosure is the option of the last resort when forward foreclosure does take place, evictions are rare as many homes are second homes investment properties are no longer occupied. Our focus on the customer has resulted in the Regions second consecutive year ranking in the top five of J.D. Power and Associates customer satisfaction survey from a (inaudible) of mortgage services. That being said we have directed our leadership and the business in internal audit and in risks management to review and validate each process step to ensure full compliance with all laws and regulations and customer needs. 
Operator that concludes our remarks and now we will open it up for questions.

Number one is that we do see some of our credit trends clearly moderating. Our early stage and late stage delinquencies appear to have stabilized and declining slightly. We do see internal risk created loans improving as you saw in our numbers.
However the migration to non-performing status clearly stands out this quarter. It was significantly up from last quarter and as we mentioned last quarter we were very cautious. One quarter does not make a trend and as we look to loan portfolio the cause and economic recovery, it really focused around commercial real estate and in particular the guarantor.
If you look at it, as the economy continues to have a slow recovery, the capacity and willingness of these guarantors comes into question. And as we look at what's migrated into the non-performing status this quarter as you saw the amount we disposed off a significant amount of that migration but we also retained quite a bit and of what we retained 64% is still paying as agreed. But there are good question even though they are paying they are questions raised regarding the capacity or the willingness of those guarantors to continue.

Also, as we looked at our valuations, that has caused us to be very conservative in how we've looked at our non-accrual calls and that's what with the up tick in looking at our growth inflows.
As Grayson mentioned, the one thing to talk about while we are disappointed in the inflow, increase in inflow and migration, what we did note is that a high percentage of ours, over 60% of the non-performing loans that we had remaining at the end of the quarter were currently paying. But what the difference is as Grayson mentioned there were some questions about the guarantors' willingness or capacity to pay. So we thought it was very (inaudible) on a non-accrual.
Having said that, we do think the loan severity is less than what we have seen before in earlier migrations and also gives us the ability to do more restructures which in the past we have not done a lot of restructuring. The other thing that Grayson mentioned is that as we see the gross migration coming in, we are continuing our efforts to aggressively de-risk the balance sheet. We've seen that not only in the reduction and investor real estate of 1.5 billion over the quarter but also our ability to dispose off problem assets in our sales program which continues to work very well for us.

But also as you continue to see valuations of these properties decline, how much decline and willingness of these guarantors did we see? 
And so we have taken a very rigorous and disciplined approach to look at guarantor support, and that's why you are seeing many of these, they are paying as agreed moving to a non-performing status.

As I've said earlier, we see encouragement in some of the trends in terms of early stage and late stage delinquencies. We didn't see any surprises on the consumer side. Consumer side while still elevated continues to modestly improve a little, but really tracks very closely to our forecast. The disappointment this quarter was all around investor commercial real estate that continues to be the problem segment in our portfolio. We do believe that the aggressive stands that we took on guarantor support is reflected in these numbers, but in terms of trying to give guidance on where this goes in the fourth quarter I'm reluctant to do that.

The ultimate net interest margin is going to be driven by the rate environment, which is driven by the economy. 
We have positioned the balance sheet in the hedging strategy to protect us on the low side from a protracted low rate environment for 2012. If on the other hand rates continue to go up the economy rebounds, then we will still participate in that rebound just not as much as we otherwise without the hedges. And we think that, that means everything is getting that much better.
So we are willing to take that risk to protect ourselves on the low side. And I would expect that you would see like I said modest improvement in the net interest margin. But it's all driven by what rates there.

Although we saw continued improvements in our core business performance this quarter, we have announced a third quarter loss of $0.17 per share due to still elevated credi",1862,"Good morning, and thank you for your time and participation in our conference call. Although we saw continued improvements in our core business performance this quarter, we have announced a third quarter loss of $0.17 per share due to still elevated credit expense, with an economy that is demonstrating a slow-paced recovery and actions that we've taken to accelerate the disposal of problem assets and reduce our balance sheet risk going forward. 
In addition to absorbing higher costs related to problem asset sales and loans transferred to held for sale, we also recorded a loan loss provision essentially equal to the elevated level of loan charge-offs. Loan loss provision, OREO and held-for-sale costs, in total, were an estimated $0.41 per share after tax this quarter. We executed disposition of $1 billion in problem loans, including $709 million in distressed asset sales. We remain confident in our business plans and our determination to execute these plans and returning Regions to sustainable profitably as properly and prudently as possible. 
Our actions are moving Regions closer to the improvement needed to achieve a breakeven point. We are encouraged by this quarter's business progress that resulted in steps towards achieving that goal. While our credit teams are diligently working to resolve credit-related issues, majority of our associates have demonstrated a focus on profitably growing revenue and constraining operating expenses in our core businesses.
In the third quarter, net interest income rose 1% from second quarter, driven as expected by continued reduction in overall costs of deposits and a favorable shift in mix. And while fee-based revenues declined 1% versus last quarter, the drop was primarily driven by the impact from Regulation E on service charges. Notably, while the implementation of Reg E did negatively impact the quarter, that impact was less than we forecasted, and we continue to be encouraged by the efforts of our associates and our branches and our call centers to further mitigate the impact of this regulatory requirement as we assist customers in making the best decisions to accommodate their needs.
At the same time, operating expenses, while being closely managed, did unfortunately increase due to the impact of higher credit-related expenses. We remain confident in the progress we're making. In spite of the slow pace of economic recovery, our strategies are working. We're disciplined in our focus on customers, and we have developed strong accountability for execution and results. The operating environment does continue to be a challenge. The economy is gradually recovering, but growth is forecasted to be unfavorably slow for the next few quarters, with stubbornly high unemployment, a weak housing market and unusually low interest rates.
Today, economic recovery within our markets has been uneven. Residential home values have not stabilized in many of our markets, especially the markets within the State of Florida, where we can potentially experience another 10% or so decline relative to mid-2010 prices, depending on the ability of the banks and the courts to process foreclosures effectively and the amount of shadow inventory remaining in the system. With that in mind, we are careful when we're making general statements. It may prove to be inaccurate due to the inconsistent valuation from market to market. But we are starting to see what appears to be stabilization in some of our market.
Fortunately, the Gulf oil spill impact on individuals and business customers has been far less economically negative than initially forecasted. It's still a difficult situation for these markets but far less impactful than earlier feared. Regions' maximum loss potential is projected now to be $20 million or less, sharply less than our initial $100 million estimate. That being said, the long-term economic environmental impacts remain a concern, as the markets and businesses along the Gulf Coast recover very slowly.
Across all of our markets, I am convinced the economic conditions are improving, but the slow pace of recovery is weighing on borrowers' capacity and borrowers' willingness to continue to fulfill credit obligations, and thus has decreased the implied potential benefit of guarantor support on many of our credits. As such, we have become incrementally more cautious on our economic outlook, which was a driving factor in the increased gross migration of loans moving to nonperforming status.
I think it's important, however, to consider the composition of that migration. Of the $1.4 billion of third quarter gross nonperforming additions, approximately $390 million were disposed of during the quarter. But of the commercial loans remaining, $933 million, 62% or $575 million were current home payments. Overall, the percentage of nonperforming commercial loans that are current home payments has risen from 24% at the end of the second quarter to 36% at the end of third quarter, giving us more confidence in the ability to manage the potential loss content and the potential to restructure in some cases.
It's also important to point out that our internally risk-rated problem loans declined on a linked-quarter basis. Our early-stage and late-stage delinquencies have stabilized and are moderating. The lingering effects of the slow pace of economic recovery has not helped many of our borrowers, and we have acted cautiously and prudently, reassessing and modifying risk ratings as appropriate. We are focused on being very careful and accurate in assessing the financial condition of our borrowers and taking prompt action as required and as appropriate.
Protracted economic challenges have also reaffirmed our stance with regard to disposing of problem assets, as well as our strategies to reduce exposure to higher-risk loan portfolios, especially investor real estate. Investor real estate declined $1.5 billion, point to point, ending balance in this quarter, achieving $17.5 billion in Investor Commercial Real Estate. 
In terms of strategic growth, our customer focus remains a top priority as we strive to deepen existing relationships and acquire new customers. Our efforts continue to pay off in the third quarter as evidenced by further strengthening in new checking account sales. We remain on track, over more than one million new business and customer checking accounts this year, exceeding 2009's record level. The addition of new relationships is fueling revenue across multiple lines of business for Regions. For example, in the third quarter, we processed 182 million debit card transactions, representing a 14% increase over the third quarter of last year. 
With respect to deposit balances in line with our overall balance sheet strategy, overall deposit levels have declined. As many of you are aware, we had a sizable amount of higher-interest rate CDs maturing in the third quarter and forecasted some runoff as rates were reduced to market levels. Given the reduction of higher-cost deposits, Regions' funding mix and cost continued to improve, declining another nine basis points, driving third quarter's net interest income and net interest margin higher. We remain on track to reach our targeted 3% year-end margin.
Our liquidity remains solid, with a loan-deposit ratio of 89%. While maintaining a clear focus in reducing the overall cost of deposits, we are successful in proving our market position. According to the recently re-released data by the FDIC, the Summary of Deposits analysis, Regions deposit growth ranked first in our peer group and seventh among 25 largest U.S. banks. Furthermore, we grew market share in six of 16 states in which we operate and in 15 of our top 25 MSAs. 
Unfortunately, total average loans did decline in the third quarter, but importantly, at a slower pace than previous quarters and despite the continuing derisking efforts in the investor real estate portfolio. Generating good quality, profitable loans remains a challenge, but we're starting to see some encouraging signs, including a 2% linked-quarter, end-period Commercial & Industrial outstandings.  Within C&I, the growth story really is about our middle market segment, which represents about half of the outstandings. These balances grew 5% in the quarter despite low but stable line utilization.  Most of this production was related to capital expenditures and refinancing of existing debt. 
Small business lending is starting to get traction as well, but this is yet to materialize into growth in net outstandings, given generally light demand. Nevertheless, small business lending is a significant opportunity for Regions as we are the number three small business lender in the country, as ranked by the Small Business Administration.
On whole, we remain cautious but optimistic. Net production volumes will further strengthen in the fourth quarter, due to increasingly solid new business pipelines.
On the consumer side, we continue to emphasize residential first mortgage lending. Production was $2.3 billion for the quarter, a 31% increase over last quarter. We continue to incrementally adjust our business model to mitigate the unfavorable revenue impact of new regulation. In fact, we've already begun mitigation efforts, having eliminated free accounts for all customers, except students and seniors, and appraised balance and transaction hurdles, earned a [ph] (00:17:25) waiver of monthly service charges. 
We are closely monitoring performance on a new structure, and we will make further adjustments as necessary, taking into account both customer value provided and related cost of delivery. In all instances, we continue to focus on superior customer service, which we believe sets us apart and which customers highly value. We continue to provide many free account services for customers, but we'll incrementally adjust our pricing models over time to better rationalize the value proposition.
Please keep in mind that the actual impact of Regulation E changes is proving less negative than anticipated. Originally, we expected implementation to reduce service charge on revenues, $72 million during the second half of this year. Based on third quarter results, the second half impact is now expected to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million. This performance and the continued adoption of overdraft services indicate customers find value in these services. In terms of interchange revenue, like the rest of the industry, we are awaiting proposals from our regulators, so it's difficult to project final financial impact. We do have annual interchange fees of approximately $330 million, so any change in fee structure could be significant. But we are seeing a 14% increase in transactions activity year-over-year.
On Basel III, while still being finalized, we are not estimating it to have a significant impact on Regions. Our Tier 1 common ratio is currently in the solid 7.6%, and based on our understanding of these rules, is above Basel III's minimum of 7% guideline. Regions is also expected to meet Basel III's liquidity requirements in this current form. In any case, we will ensure that Regions' capital levels remain strong and fully compliant as the formal implementation of Basel III requirements are better known.
In summary, we are successfully executing our plan to return Regions to sustainable profitability. We are aggressively reducing credit risk, rolling our customer base, implementing productivity and efficiency initiatives and taking appropriate steps to ensure that we are positioned to fully capitalize on profitable revenue growth opportunities. At the same time, we recognize that environmental, economic and regulatory challenges persist, creating headwinds and caution on our part. But I am convinced that Regions has the right strategy and the right people in place to deliver on our commitment. 
David will now discuss third quarter financial results. David?"
271409,113915625,82029,"Regions Financial Corp., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Regions Financial Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a summary of our third quarter results on Slide 1. As Grayson mentioned, our third quarter loss amounted to $0.17 per diluted share. Pretax pre-provision net revenue, or PPNR, amounted to $4",2157,"Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a summary of our third quarter results on Slide 1. As Grayson mentioned, our third quarter loss amounted to $0.17 per diluted share. Pretax pre-provision net revenue, or PPNR, amounted to $454 million, down about 7% linked quarter, due primarily to the impact of higher credit-related costs and Regulation E. Compared to the same period a year ago, adjusted PPNR was up 11%.
Within PPNR, net interest income continued to grow, increasing $12 million, which drove a nine-basis-point improvement in the net interest margin. Non-interest revenues dipped 1% linked quarter, primarily driven by the impact of service charges from Regulation E, which I'll cover in just a minute.
Absent this impact, non-interest revenues were higher, primarily due to strong mortgage and fixed income brokerage revenue. Non-interest expenses increased $37 million or 3% second to third quarter, excluding second quarter's $200 million regulatory charge. Total non-interest expenses were negatively impacted by the rise in credit-related costs, primarily due to higher OREO and held-for-sale expenses related to the bulk sale of distressed assets.
Regarding credit quality, the level of nonperforming assets, excluding loans held for sale, was down $186 million this quarter to $3.8 billion. The provision for loan losses rose to $760 million from $651 million in the previous quarter and essentially equaled net charge-offs. The increase in charge-offs reflects about $233 million of charges associated with distressed asset sales and the transfer of loans to held for sale.
Let's now take a deeper look into the quarterly results, beginning with credit. As shown on Slide 2, nonperforming assets, excluding loans held for sale, were down 5% this quarter but remained elevated. And I'll reiterate what was said earlier. An increasing and substantial portion of the migration into nonperforming loans was attributable to loans that are paying as agreed. The sluggish and persistent nature of the economy necessitates that we remain cautious when internally risk-rating our portfolio. 
Despite that cautious stance, internally risk-rated problem loans did decline this quarter. However, factors like Florida unemployment, which has been greater than 10% since May 2009, and it's now over 12%, and pressured housing prices in parts of the state require that we not get ahead of ourselves and that we maintain a clear and objective view of the economic environment. To that end, we remain focused on derisking our portfolio.
Our proactive disposition effort remained a key element of our risk management strategy. This quarter, we sold or transferred to held for sale a total of $1 billion of troubled assets. This total reflects a broadened effort, as it included approximately $350 million of distressed asset sales on a bulk basis. These assets, which were predominantly land, included both nonperforming loans and OREO, and resulted in $108 million of associated charge-offs and $30 million in losses that are recorded in non-interest expense. 
While the markdowns were greater than we have previously experienced, we believe the long-term economics justify getting these assets off our books and behind us. Land is one of the most difficult assets to sell, and we were pleased to be able to dispose of these assets as opportunities arose during the quarter. We don't want to be in the property management business, and we'll make every reasonable effort to remove properties and risk from our books when it makes long-term economic sense.
As you can see on Slide 4, net charge-offs increased to $759 million for an annualized 3.52% of average loans and reflect our efforts this quarter to derisk our balance sheet and dispose of problem assets, which contributed $233 million in charge-offs.  Drilling down, the main source of charge-offs continues to be our investor real estate portfolio. Our loan loss provision essentially matched net charge-offs this quarter and was up $109 million linked quarter. Our loan loss allowance to loans ratio increased six basis points linked quarter to 3.77%. As we've said at our Investor Day, we remain cautious about the economy when evaluating the loan portfolio, and our allowance methodology reflects this stance.
Turning to the balance sheet, Slide 5 breaks down this quarter's change in loans. Although investor real estate still accounts for a relatively high percentage of our loan portfolio, we have reduced this exposure substantially through the credit crisis. In fact, total investor real estate loans have declined by $6.5 billion over the last two years, and we continue to make solid progress in reducing this segment of our portfolio as shown by the current quarter reduction of $1.5 billion.
At the same time, targeted efforts to grow segments of our portfolio are getting traction. Most notably, Commercial & Industrial loan balances were 2% in the quarter, primarily through our energy and healthcare lending groups. Energy lending in Texas has been particularly strong. New client acquisition is driving this growth, as line utilization have remained about 40% over the last several months.
Furthermore, we continue to invest in specialized lending groups, including business capital, healthcare, transportation and franchise restaurant. 
Lastly, we are excited about the opportunity to leverage our small-business expertise through our extensive branch network. Our plan to grow consumer loans is multifaceted and includes increased emphasis on direct lending through leveraging the strength of our branch network. Also, on the consumer side, we are evaluating products targeted at the underserved customer segment, a large group with short-term funding needs.
This next slide shows changes in our deposit base this quarter. Ending time deposits declined $2.1 billion, reflecting expected run-off of balances as we reduced maturing high-cost CD rates to market levels. Low-cost deposit growth was somewhat offsetting, with ending balances increasing $854 million or 1% in the quarter. Total deposit levels were also affected by our more disciplined approach to deposit pricing, with some customers choosing to pay down debt rather than hold deposits at current rates. Although customers are deleveraging and paying down their loans, our new checking account growth has helped offset this downward pressure on deposit balances.
Net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, rose $13 million linked quarter, while the margins strengthened nine basis points, increasing to 2.96%. Improvements stemmed primarily from continued optimization of deposit costs and mix. For the quarter, deposit costs declined another nine basis points to 0.7% in the third quarter, and loan yields remained stable at 4.29%.
We expect to see continued improvement in deposit costs and expect to reach a 3% margin in the fourth quarter, as originally projected. In fact, we expected to reach our target of 3% this quarter, but the recent decline in long-term interest rates accelerated mortgage refinance activity and premium amortization within the investment portfolio, which had an adverse impact on net interest margin of around four basis points.
Driving further margin improvement, we have approximately $11.4 billion of CDs maturing over the next nine months, which will be repriced to market rates as they mature. These CDs currently carry an average 2.1% interest rate and should enable us to reduce our overall deposit costs. In addition, the drag to net interest margin associated with interest reversals in carrying excess cash at Fed [ph] (00:29:06) will fade with time. These items were margin headwinds of 16 and eight basis points, respectively, on an annualized basis in the third quarter.
As an update, we have recently adjusted the hedges in place to support the margin in a prolonged low-rate environment. These now reduce our interest rate sensitivity through December 2012. Our emphasis on improving deposit mix and cost, combined with the projected impact of these hedges, is expected to result in modest margin improvement going forward in our most likely rate forecast scenario.
Let's now shift gears and look at non-interest revenue and expenses this quarter. Non-interest revenues were down by about 1% linked quarter, driven by an approximate $16 million impact of Regulation E. Absent this impact, non-interest revenues were higher, reflecting strong mortgage revenue, driven by heavy refinancing activity. In fact, we originated $2.4 billion of loans this quarter versus $1.8 billion last quarter. And refinance activity was much higher, representing 67% of current quarter originations, up from second quarter's 41%. Also contributing to non-interest revenues, Morgan Keegan's brokerage revenues were up 6% versus the prior quarter, reflecting continued private client and fixed income strength. Fixed income revenue was especially strong, increasing 13% linked quarter, driven higher by customer purchasing short-term securities.
In terms of non-interest expense, while credit-related costs continue to remain high, we continue to focus on containing other overall costs. Excluding prior quarters' regulatory charge, total non-interest expense was up $37 million or 3% linked quarter due to a $31 million linked quarter rise in OREO and held-for-sale costs. As I mentioned earlier, the rise in these costs reflects approximately $30 million resulting from a bulk sale of OREO during the quarter. In all, PPNR continues to be impacted by credit-related costs, which on a normalized basis, are impacting us by $75 million to $100 million per quarter.
We recognize in this economy to be successful, we have to be diligent in our efforts to manage expenses. It's going to be a low growth, low rate environment for an extended period of time. And we have to continue to target all areas of staffing, occupancy, discretionary spending and credit-related expenses. Rest assured that any changes we implement, we'll, at the same time, maintain focus on service quality and making sure that we are serving the needs of our customers.
Let me now discuss our capital liquidity. We continue to execute our disciplined capital planning process that we developed over the past year or so, which accounts as various scenario analyses, including stress testing under a range of adverse conditions. It begins with the development of macroeconomic forecast scenarios, which serve as a basis for our credit modeling. Our capital ratios remained strong, with a Tier 1 capital ratio that now stands at 12.1% and a Tier 1 common ratio at a very solid 7.6%. 
As we stated last quarter, the Collins Amendment will have little impact to our risk-based ratios since trust-preferred securities at about $846 million are a fairly small part of our overall capital base.
Let me briefly touch on Basel III, which will be phased in over the next several years beginning in 2013. We continue to assess the impact and are awaiting the details, but we feel very good about our capital base as our Tier 1 common and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios are above the respective 7% and 8 1/2% minimums required under Basel III. The proposed adjustments are expected to have a minimal impact on us. Similarly, Regions is well-positioned with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio described under Basel III. In fact, we have been internally managing to a similar measure for some time.
Moving to the broader impact of recent regulatory reform, there is no doubt that recent sweeping legislative actions will ripple through banks' operations and financial statements from this point forward. But we are well-positioned to effectively manage any potential impact. In terms of Regulation E, with the August 12 full implementation date behind us, we now have good visibility into foreseeable financial ramifications. As Grayson noted earlier, the negative impact is proving less than our original forecast.
To date, roughly half of all of our customers who have overdrawn their account in the past year have chosen to opt in or link their account for overdraft protection. And 97% of customers who have made an election after experiencing a declined transaction are choosing to opt in or participate in overdraft protection. Clearly, customers are seeing the value in services that ensure their ability to make purchases.
The Durbin Amendment, which affects debit card interchange fees, will likely result in a revenue reduction as well. But keep in mind that final rules have not been established. They will be determined by the Federal Reserve as we head into next year, and we will make adjustments to our products and services as appropriate.
Lastly, unlike many of the larger money center banks or brokerage houses, regulatory reform will only minimally impact our brokerage revenues since Morgan Keegan does not engage in proprietary trading, has little to no private equity exposure and faces very minor impact to its derivatives business. Bottom line, while regulatory changes are certainly challenging from a revenue perspective, I'm confident that we will be able to make adjustments to minimize any long-term financial effect on Regions.
In summary, although we are not pleased with the loss this quarter, our associates remain focused on executing both our short-term and long-term goals. We continue to remain focused on returning the company to sustainable profitability as promptly as possible. And with this quarter's further derisking efforts, we are building a stronger company with an emphasis on improving our risk profile, which will ultimately benefit our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Grayson for closing comments."

Regions had a solid and tested foreclosure process in place to ensure the fairness for customers and compliance with the state and federal regulations. In cases where all options to avoid foreclosure have been exhausted, a committee of key managers approves the decision to proceed with foreclosure after a thorough review of loan documentation. Once a decision has been made to proceed, the process is the same where the loan is owned by Regions or by an investor that we service the mortgage for. In each case, department managers review and verify the accuracy of the loan documents. In states where a mortgage foreclosure affidavit or similar legal documentation is required, the document is completed and signed by the department manager in the presence of a notary employed by Regions.
Due to our foreclosure prevention efforts and a relatively small-sized Regions servicing portfolio, our foreclosure volumes have remained relatively low. Regions forecloses on approximately 100 loans that we own each month and 160 investor-owned loans each month. Staffing levels are sufficient to internally verify loan information and appropriately execute required documentation. Regions has a residential mortgage servicing portfolio of $41.2 billion. Of that, $16.3 billion are loans that we own while $24.9 billion are loans owned by government agencies or investors, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Our foreclosure rate for the entire portfolio, both owned and investor, is less than half the national average. Our ability to maintain low foreclosure rates is the result of proactive efforts to provide solutions to distressed customers. In late 2007, Regions began reaching out to customers at risk of falling behind on payments through our Customer Assistance Program. The program is available to customers whose loans we own and service. To date, we have helped more than 30,000 customers stay in their home. We pursue all available options to help homeowners avoid foreclosure, including loan modifications, rate reductions, short sales and Deed-in-Lieu of foreclosure.
Foreclosure is the option of last resort. When foreclosure does take place, evictions are rare, as many homes are second homes, investment properties or are no longer occupied. Our focus on the customer has resulted in Regions' second consecutive year of ranking in the top five of J.D. Power and Associates customer satisfaction survey for primary mortgage servicers. That being said, we have directed our leadership in the business, in internal audit and in risk management to review and validate each process step to ensure full compliance with all laws and regulations and customer needs.
Operator, that concludes our remarks, and now we will open it up for questions."

Number one is that we do see some of our credit trends clearly moderating. Our early-stage and late-stage delinquencies appear to have stabilized and declining slightly. We do see internal risk-rated loans improving, as you saw in our numbers. However, the migration to nonperforming status clearly stands out this quarter. It was significantly up from last quarter. As we mentioned, last quarter, we were very cautious. One quarter does not make a trend. And as we look, loan portfolio, the pause in economic recovery, it really focused around Commercial Real Estate, and in particular, the guarantor. If you look at -- as the economy continues to have a slow recovery, the capacity and willingness of these guarantors comes into question. And as we look at what's migrated into a nonperforming status this quarter, as you saw the amount, we disposed of a significant amount of that migration, but we also retained quite a bit. And of what we retained, 64%, they're still paying as agreed. But there are already questions. Even though they're paying, there were question raised regarding the capacity or the willingness of those guarantors to continue. With that, I'll ask Bill to make a few comments."

The first thing, we talked about last quarter about being very cautious about where we were with the economy, the slow growth economy. And what we saw in our migration really is a reflection of what we've seen in the economy. Also, as we looked at our valuations, that has caused us to be very conservative in how we've looked at our non-accrual call [ph] (00:42:42), and that's what was the uptick in looking at our gross inflows. As Grayson mentioned, the one thing to talk about, while we're disappointed in the inflow, increase in inflow in migration, what we did notice is that a high percentage of ours, over 60% of the nonperforming loans that we had remaining at the end of the quarter were currently paying. But what the difference is, as Grayson mentioned, there were some question about the guarantors' willingness or capacity to pay, so we thought it was very prudent to put it on non-accrual. Having said that, we do think the loan severity is less than what we have seen before in earlier migrations and also gives us the ability to do more restructures, which in the past, we have not done a lot of restructuring. The other thing that Grayson mentioned is that as we see the gross migration coming in, we are continuing our efforts to aggressively derisk the balance sheet. We've seen that not only in the reduction in our investor real estate of $1.5 billion over the quarter but also our ability to dispose of problem assets in our sales program, which continues to work very well for us."

And so in our pricing that we saw, we saw a little bit more discount than what we have been seeing in the past. That bulk sale discount was about 40% of the book balance that we had. The other thing that I would say is that on our additional sales, we were probably averaging in the low 20s. So an average for us, when you take the bulk sale and what we did on the note sales, was a discount rate on our dispositions of about 31% as opposed to what we did last quarter of 24%."

We measure today, which poses risk to us to the extent prepayments occur. We are going to evaluate what that risk is and whether it makes sense to continue along with our strategy, which has been a fairly clean investment portfolio. Virtually, all of it in agency guarantee. And we did that as we derisked our balance sheet. We've had CMBS, taking credit risk in our investment portfolio. We had it on the loan side. And we did think that was prudent for us to do. We are looking at ways to reinvest proceeds coming off the investment portfolio, as well as whether it makes sense to take any gains and reposition in the other asset classes, whether it be back into some of newer tranche CMBS or corporates or whatever the case may be. And we will evaluate that during the quarter. What we have been seeing from a cash flow perspective often, investment portfolios have been about $500 million per month to reinvest. As a result of prepayments, that number has been up about $300 million on top of that. So we have about $800 million right now to deal with from a reinvestment standpoint.

It's about at the national average for all of the U.S. But Florida, as you know, is probably 3x or 4x the national average in Florida. And so we're disappointed that we've got foreclosures period, but encouraged that our foreclosure rate compares so favorably. But we would anticipate that there's going to be a lot of attention on this issue. It's too early to call. There is a certain amount of media attention, and there will be certain amount of regulatory intensity around this foreclosure issue. But I think in today's call, it's way too early for us to predict what some of the implications the foreclosures will be going forward. I can tell you, we feel good about our process, but we're going back and revalidating and retesting to make sure that everything is working as it should be. But I think it's going to take a few weeks for this issue to fold out across the industry. And as it does, we will react appropriately. But I think we're in a good position today."

And even during this entire time frame, with the foreclosure issue front and center in the media, we have not stopped our foreclosure process. Again, we work very diligently with our customers up to the point of foreclosure and even up to the point of being sold and the court had set what need be. For that, we get every opportunity to avoid foreclosure where it's possible. But again, to the second part of your question, yes, we do test for impairment."
