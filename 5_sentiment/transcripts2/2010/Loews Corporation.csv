Good morning and thank you for joining us on our call today. Loews wrapped up the year with a solid first quarter that benefited from good operating results of CNA, ongoing earning strength of Diamond Offshore and improved investment in",949,"Thank you, Darren. Good morning and thank you for joining us on our call today. Loews wrapped up the year with a solid first quarter that benefited from good operating results of CNA, ongoing earning strength of Diamond Offshore and improved investment income from the holding company investment portfolio. CNA reported solid net operating income for both the quarter and full year, primarily due to improvement in net investment income.In '09, Tom Motamed, the CEO of CNA launched the strategy to drive top and bottom line growth. And in support of this strategy, CNA has strengthened its leadership team, opened new field offices and added underwriting staff. Within its core Property and Casualty operations, CNA's Specialty segment continue to deliver very strong performance and within its Commercial segment, the improvement initiatives are beginning to take hold.CNA has seen continued recovery of its investment portfolio, which the government earnings has boosted CNA book value per common share by 72% from year end '08, representing a $5.4 billion pretax improvement in its unrealized gain position. Last quarter, during our earnings conference call, I elaborated on how mark-to-market accounting rules could potentially be misleading with respect to unrealized losses at property and casualty insurance company. While it was unpleasant last year to see unrealized losses on the asset side of the balance sheet, we believe that the bulk of the securities held by CNA would ultimately recover in value as they have.CNA finished '09 with its balance sheet and investment portfolio in very good shape. The reason on revisiting this issue, however, is that at some point in the future, interest rates could again rise in the United States. Should this occur or more realistically, when this occurs, most P&C insurance companies, including CNA would likely suffer a negative impact on the market value of their fixed income investment portfolios, which would in turn have a negative impact on GAAP book value. But because CNA's portfolio is generally comprised of securities that attempt to match the duration and liquidity requirements of this insurance liability, a decline in market values caused by an interest rate rise would not meaningfully impact the company's ability to pay claims. With the effort tends to focus on book value per share before unrealized gains and losses. And notwithstanding the decline in stated GAAP book value as a result of increasing interest rates, there is an offsetting benefit to a higher interest rate environment. CNA would be able to invest its significant cash flow into higher yielding security.During the fourth quarter, CNA completed a $350 million bond offering at a competitive yield, which underscores the market confidence in CNA's financial strength. All of the proceeds, $250 million will use to regain preferred stock owned by Loews, which continues to hold $1 billion of the prepared shares in CNA. For '09, Diamond Offshore posted record earnings stemming from strong day rates and utilization rates for a semi-submersible drilling rates. Energy prices have recovered from one year ago, but the uncertain economic outlook has somewhat dampened demand for offshore drilling services and the day rates, the Diamond has been able to come in [ph] for new contracts. Despite these market challenges, Diamond entered 2010 with a contract backlog of about $8.5 billion and with approximately 75% of its floater fleet fully committed. As you may know, Diamond has a policy of considering the payment of special cash dividends reflecting the earnings, financial position and the earnings outlook for the company. In that regard, Diamond Board of Directors last week declared a special and regular quarterly dividend, together totaling $2 per share, representing a $140 million payment to Loews. Boardwalk closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter, both in terms of progress made on its expansion projects and the positive impact these expansion projects are having on cash flow. Boardwalk has declared a cash distribution for the fourth quarter of $0.50 per unit, continuing its track record of increasing cash distribution to unit holders each quarter since its initial public offering in '05. Loews' cash receipts from Boardwalk dividend last quarter was $69 million. As previously disclosed, all of Boardwalk's 42-inch pipeline expansion project have received approval from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration or PHMSA to operate at a full-design capacity. On a 36-inch project, the Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals, Boardwalk is able to meet all customer requirements until mid-2011 by operating the pipeline at normal operating pressures. The company is seeking approval from PHMSA to operate the Fayetteville Lateral at higher operating pressures, which would allow Boardwalk to further increase capacity.Given the strong demand for pipeline capacity from the Haynesville Shale production area, Boardwalk has announced two compression projects to boost capacity on its East Texas Pipeline System. The Crown's [ph] compression project and the Haynesville project will leverage Boardwalk's flexible and integrated pipeline system and should generate favorable project economic. Once in service, these projects will be supported by long-life contracts averaging more than 11 years.Importantly, Boardwalk has completed all the necessary financing and has enough liquidity in place to complete all of its announced projects, including the newest compression project. With strong cash flow from our subsidiary, Loews Corporation finished 2009 with $3 billion of cash and investments and only $866 million of debt at the holding company level. During the year, we repurchased 10.5 million shares of our common stock to $348 million. This represents 2.4% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. From January 1 through February 5 of this year, we brought an additional 1.6 million shares for $57 million. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Peter Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer.

For the fourth quarter, Loews reported net income of $403 million versus a loss of $958 million in the prior year quarter.

For the fourth quarter, Loews reported net income of $403 million versus a loss of $958 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, income from continuing operations was $566 million versus a loss of $182 million in 2008.Loews' interest in CNA's fourth quarter net realized investment gains after tax and non-controlling interest was $44 million versus a loss of $283 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. This improvement reflects the realized investment gain of $217 million after tax in non-controlling interest from the sale of CNA's common stock holdings of Verisk Analytics in October 2009, offset by other-than-temporary impairment losses. For the full year, Loews' interest in CNA's net realized investment losses after tax in non-controlling interest was $505 million. These primarily consisted of other-than-temporary impairment losses related to asset-backed and corporate securities. In 2008, Loews' interest in CNA's net investment losses was $756 million after tax in non-controlling interest.CNA contributed $182 million to Loews' net operating income for the quarter versus a loss of $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase was primarily driven by improved results from limited partnership investments. For the full year, CNA contribution to net operating income was $904 million, up from $488 million in 2008. Results benefited primarily from higher investment income as well as from unusually light catastrophe losses.Diamond Offshore contribution to net income for the fourth quarter declined to $128 million versus $137 million in the prior year fourth quarter, primarily due to a higher effective tax rate. Average day rates at semi-submersible rigs were essentially flat as with average utilization for intermediate semi-submersibles. Utilization for high-spec floaters was down by eight percentage points, primarily because of timing of acquired rig surveys. For the full year, Diamond's contribution to net income increased to a record $642 million from $612 million in 2008. HighMount reported net income of $35 million in the fourth quarter versus $37 million in the prior year fourth quarter, excluding $754 million of non-cash impairment charges.Excluding non-cash impairment charges of $754 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2008, and a $660 million after tax in the first quarter of 2009, HighMount's net income for the full year declined to $123 million from $179 million in 2008, primarily because of decreased production volumes and lower natural gas prices. Some production numbers are as follows: For 2009, HighMount reported natural gas sales of 70.8 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $6.94 per thousand cubic feet. Natural gas liquids production of 3.3 million barrels at an average realized price of $30.98 per barrel and oil production of 363,000 barrels at an average price of $55.37 per barrel.As of December 31, HighMount had hedges in place covered approximately 64% of its estimated 2010 natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.43 per Mcfe and 35% of estimated 2011 production at an equivalent price of $6.49 per Mcfe. At year end, total proved reserves were approximately 2 trillion cubic feet equivalent, down from 2.2 Tcfe in the previous year. Revision is primarily related to lower average energy prices in 2009 compared to December 31, 2008, and the reclassification of some proved undeveloped reserves to a non-proven category.Boardwalk's contribution to Loews' fourth quarter net income increased to $28 million from $27 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting increased revenues from pipeline expansion projects and higher parking and lending revenues, which benefited from favorable pricing spreads between spot in futures market prices. For the full year, Boardwalk's contribution to net income decreased to $67 million as compared to $125 million in 2008. The decline is because in 2009, revenues from the expansion projects were approximately $122 million lower than expected due to remediation of pipeline anomalies, while operating expenses associated with the expansion projects increased.Loews Hotels recorded net losses of $4 million and $34 million for the quarter and full year versus net income of $4 million and $40 million for the fourth quarter and full year in 2008. Average room rates for the quarter decreased to $217 from $252 in the prior year quarter, while occupancy decreased to 61.6% from 65.8%, resulting in a 19.3% decrease in revenue per available room. Hotel bookings across the entire upper upscale lodging industry was significantly lower in 2009 than in prior years.Net investment income from Loews' trading portfolio was $16 million for the quarter versus a net loss of $78 million in prior year fourth quarter. For the full year, investment income was $113 million versus a net loss of $33 million in 2008. Improvements were primarily from better performance in the trading portfolio and a larger cash balance. Much of the losses in 2008 related to mark-to-market losses in the equity portfolio which has since recovered.Holding company cash and investments as of December 31 totaled $3 billion. As Jim mentioned, during 2009, we purchased $348 million of our common stock at an average price of $33.05. Additionally, we made investments in Boardwalk Pipeline of $150 million for common units and $200 million for subordinated debt and repaid $108 million of dividends to our shareholders. We received $954 million in dividends from our subsidiaries and $175 million of investment income from our trading portfolio. $250 million of  senior preferred stocks was redeemed by CNA and $100 million of subordinated debt was repaid by Boardwalk Pipeline. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Darren."

We look at just about everything that any analyst would look at in determining whether the shares are cheap or not [ph]. And then we act accordingly. I can't say how much money we would spend in the course of the year on repurchases, but the thing I can say is we will do absolutely nothing in any way to jeopardize the financial strength of Loews. I said in my remarks that we have $3 billion of cash, we have $866 million of debt. I think that even though we spent last year a $350 million repurchasing shares, our cash balance at the end of the year was higher than at the beginning of the year. So we are very conservative in the management of those share repurchases. With respect to monetizing assets, it's funny, I don't know how to answer you because if we were thinking about an IPO and I would say something, then we would be jumping the gun, and I can't do that. So if I say we're not doing something, then maybe that gives a different answer, and you could gain your way to figuring out what we're doing. So let me just say, instead, we constantly look at markets.

I would say that with respect to a lot of businesses, sellers are looking to sell based on the economics of '07 and early '08. And buyers oftentimes are looking to buy based on the economics of late '08 and '09. And it's too early to tell yet exactly how that's going to all weigh out. And we're going to have to see as well what happens to the economy. And with that, in general corporate profits and for each particular instance, the profitability of both individual companies. My general sense is that we are not going to have a robust recovery the way we've had from prior recessions. And now reason for that is that I believe that this what we now call great recession is different from prior recessions. And it's different because it didn't come about because the Fed raised interest rates to choke off an expanding economy. Rather, it came about, I believe, because we as a nation had a mountain of debt that basically fell down on itself. We have debt-to-GDP in the 50s of 120%, and that has expanded over the past 50 years to 360% of total debt-to-GDP in our economy. And in '07 and '08, that mountain cracked and then crashed the economy. And when you come out of a normal recession, what happens is that the Fed loosens up on interest rates after they choked off the inflationary expectations. And then the banks lend money, extend credit. And with that extension of credit, you have that expansion phase coming off of the bottom of the economy. This time around, there is not that extension of credit. And the reason is because there's already too much credit in the economy either on the part of the homeowner and consumers primarily, but also the overall economy in general. And so I don't believe we're going to get that boost or lift-off phase that you get ordinarily out the bottom of a recession simply because we're not going to have the accelerant, which is the credit extension in order to finance it. Just to bring that back to the price of buying businesses, we operate under the assumption that things are not going to get significantly better in the near term. And we'll have to see what the market is thinking with respect to the economy by looking at the prices that others are willing to pay for businesses that are up for sale."

So for all those reasons, we tend to maintain our focus here in the United States. We're not afraid to have businesses that deal internationally.

I do know we've bought HighMount for $1.65 per Mcf, which was at the time an attractive valuation, and I still consider it an attractive valuation. The write-downs that took place last year occurred because of the spot price of natural gas on one particular day. And last year, the price of natural gas got down to -- Henry Hub's gas got down to a price with handle of one on it. So it's like $1.80 or $1.90. But at the end of the quarter, when we had to actually determine whether there would be a write-down, the price got down to I think $3 in change, some very low priced. In the meantime, the SEC has changed the rules for the SEC 10 (sic) [10% discount rate] ceiling test impairment charges. And so, I think if these new rules had been used in the prior quarters, the write-downs would not have been as significant. I'd say also that the -- as you can imagine, I think the business is getting better overall. Certainly, gas prices are up or at least spot gas prices are up. The 12-month strip is now trading just at under $6 an Mcf. That's up significantly from where it was during '09. And importantly, the cost of drilling wells has come down rather significantly for us. Going back a year and a half, to drill a well in Sonora costs us in excess of $1 million or about $1 million. It has since declined to about $450,000. And now it's picking up a bit because of what's going on with fuel prices and the like. But nonetheless, the cost of drilling is still rather low. And we find, especially in our major market which is Sonora, we can drill wells at what looks to us to be very attractive returns for HighMount."

I think that as I said before that the people at CNA are doing a great job. But anything can happen there. We could have more hurricanes. And even outside of hurricane season, earthquakes have been known to strike from time to time. So catastrophes are a significant risk, as well as investment portfolio. And at the Hotel business, there's the overall economic environment. There's the risk. Hopefully, they've learned their lesson.

Good morning and thank you for joining us on our call today. Loews wrapped up the year with a solid first quarter that benefited from good operating results of CNA, ongoing earning strength of Diamond Offshore and improved investment income from the holding company investment portfolio. CNA reported solid net operating income for both the quarter and full year, primarily due to improvement in net investment income.In '09, Tom Motamed, the CEO of CNA launched the strategy to drive top and bottom line growth. And in support of this strategy, CNA has strengthened its leadership team, opened new field offices and added underwriting staff. Within its core Property and Casualty operations, CNA's Specialty segment continue to deliver very strong performance and within its Commercial segment, the improvement initiatives are beginning to take hold.CNA has seen continued recovery of its investment portfolio, which the government earnings has boosted CNA book value per common share by 72% from year end '08, representing a $5.4 billion pretax improvement in its unrealized gain position. Last quarter, during our earnings conference call, I elaborated on how mark-to-market accounting rules could potentially be misleading with respect to unrealized losses at property and casualty insurance company. While it was unpleasant last year to see unrealized losses on the asset side of the balance sheet, we believe that the bulk of the securities held by CNA would ultimately recover in value as they have.CNA finished '09 with its balance sheet and investment portfolio in very good shape. The reason on revisiting this issue, however, is that at some point in the future, interest rates could again rise in the United States. Should this occur or more realistically, when this occurs, most P&C insurance companies, including CNA would likely suffer a negative impact on the market value of their fixed income investment portfolios, which would in turn have a negative impact on GAAP book value. But because CNA's portfolio is generally comprised of securities that attempt to match the duration and liquidity requirements of this insurance liability, a decline in market values caused by an interest rate rise would not meaningfully impact the company's ability to pay claims. With the effort tends to focus on book value per share before unrealized gains and losses. And notwithstanding the decline in stated GAAP book value as a result of increasing interest rates, there is an offsetting benefit to a higher interest rate environment. CNA would be able to invest its significant cash flow into higher yielding security.During the fourth quarter, CNA completed a $350 million bond offering at a competitive yield, which underscores the market confidence in CNA's financial strength. All of the proceeds, $250 million will use to regain preferred stock owned by Loews, which continues to hold $1 billion of the preferred shares in CNA. For '09, Diamond Offshore posted record earnings stemming from strong day rates and utilization rates for its semi-submersible drilling rigs. Energy prices have recovered from one year ago, but the uncertain economic outlook has somewhat dampened demand for offshore drilling services and the day rates that Diamond has been able to command for new contracts. Despite these market challenges, Diamond entered 2010 with a contract backlog of about $8.5 billion and with approximately 75% of its floater fleet fully committed. As you may know, Diamond has a policy of considering the payment of special cash dividends reflecting the earnings, financial position and the earnings outlook for the company. In that regard, Diamond's Board of Directors last week declared a special and regular quarterly dividends, together totaling $2 per share, representing a $140 million payment to Loews. Boardwalk closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter, both in terms of progress made on its expansion projects and the positive impact these expansion projects are having on cash flow. Boardwalk has declared a cash distribution for the fourth quarter of $0.50 per unit, continuing its track record of increasing cash distribution to unit holders each quarter since its initial public offering in '05. Loews' cash receipts from Boardwalk dividends last quarter was $69 million. As previously disclosed, all of Boardwalk's 42-inch pipeline expansion project have received approval from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration or PHMSA to operate at their full design capacity. On a 36-inch project, the Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals, Boardwalk is able to meet all customer requirements until mid-2011 by operating the pipelines at normal operating pressures. The company is seeking approval from PHMSA to operate the Fayetteville Lateral at higher operating pressures, which would allow Boardwalk to further increase capacity.Given the strong demand for pipeline capacity from the Haynesville Shale production area, Boardwalk has announced two compression projects to boost capacity on its East Texas pipeline system. The Clarence Compression Project and the Haynesville Project will leverage Boardwalk's flexible and integrated pipeline system and should generate favorable project economics. Once in service, these projects will be supported by long-life contracts averaging more than 11 years.Importantly, Boardwalk has completed all the necessary financing and has enough liquidity in place to complete all of its announced projects, including the newest compression project. With strong cash flow from our subsidiary, Loews Corporation finished 2009 with $3 billion of cash and investments and only $866 million of debt at the holding company level. During the year, we repurchased 10.5 million shares of our common stock to $348 million. This represents 2.4% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.

For the fourth quarter, Loews reported net income of $403 million versus a loss of $958 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, income from continuing operations was $566 million versus a loss of $182",908,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, Loews reported net income of $403 million versus a loss of $958 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, income from continuing operations was $566 million versus a loss of $182 million in 2008.Loews' interest in CNA's fourth quarter net realized investment gains after tax and non-controlling interest was $44 million versus a loss of $283 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. This improvement reflects the realized investment gain of $217 million after tax in non-controlling interest from the sale of CNA's common stock holdings of Verisk Analytics in October 2009, offset by other-than-temporary impairment losses. For the full year, Loews' interest in CNA's net realized investment losses after tax in non-controlling interest was $505 million. These primarily consisted of other-than-temporary impairment losses related to asset-backed and corporate securities. In 2008, Loews' interest in CNA's net investment losses was $756 million after tax in non-controlling interest.CNA contributed $182 million to Loews' net operating income for the quarter versus a loss of $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase was primarily driven by improved results from limited partnership investments. For the full year, CNA contribution to net operating income was $904 million, up from $488 million in 2008. Results benefited primarily from higher investment income as well as from unusually light catastrophe losses.Diamond Offshore contribution to net income for the fourth quarter declined to $128 million versus $137 million in the prior year fourth quarter, primarily due to a higher effective tax rate. Average day rates at semi-submersible rigs were essentially flat as with average utilization for intermediate semi-submersibles. Utilization for high-spec floaters was down by eight percentage points, primarily because of timing of acquired rig surveys. For the full year, Diamond's contribution to net income increased to a record $642 million from $612 million in 2008. HighMount reported net income of $35 million in the fourth quarter versus $37 million in the prior year fourth quarter, excluding $754 million of non-cash impairment charges.Excluding non-cash impairment charges of $754 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2008, and a $660 million after tax in the first quarter of 2009, HighMount's net income for the full year declined to $123 million from $179 million in 2008, primarily because of decreased production volumes and lower natural gas prices. Some production numbers are as follows: For 2009, HighMount reported natural gas sales of 70.8 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $6.94 per thousand cubic feet. Natural gas liquids production of 3.3 million barrels at an average realized price of $30.98 per barrel and oil production of 363,000 barrels at an average price of $55.37 per barrel.As of December 31, HighMount had hedges in place covered approximately 64% of its estimated 2010 natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.43 per Mcfe and 35% of estimated 2011 production at an equivalent price of $6.49 per Mcfe. At year end, total proved reserves were approximately 2 trillion cubic feet equivalent, down from 2.2 Tcfe in the previous year. Revision is primarily related to lower average energy prices in 2009 compared to December 31, 2008, and the reclassification of some proved undeveloped reserves to a non-proven category.Boardwalk's contribution to Loews' fourth quarter net income increased to $28 million from $27 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting increased revenues from pipeline expansion projects and higher parking and lending revenues, which benefited from favorable pricing spreads between spot in futures market prices. For the full year, Boardwalk's contribution to net income decreased to $67 million as compared to $125 million in 2008. The decline is because in 2009, revenues from the expansion projects were approximately $122 million lower than expected due to remediation of pipeline anomalies, while operating expenses associated with the expansion projects increased.Loews Hotels recorded net losses of $4 million and $34 million for the quarter and full year versus net income of $4 million and $40 million for the fourth quarter and full year in 2008. Average room rates for the quarter decreased to $217 from $252 in the prior year quarter, while occupancy decreased to 61.6% from 65.8%, resulting in a 19.3% decrease in revenue per available room. Hotel bookings across the entire upper upscale lodging industry was significantly lower in 2009 than in prior years.Net investment income from Loews' trading portfolio was $16 million for the quarter versus a net loss of $78 million in prior year fourth quarter. For the full year, investment income was $113 million versus a net loss of $33 million in 2008. Improvements were primarily from better performance in the trading portfolio and a larger cash balance. Much of the losses in 2008 related to mark-to-market losses in the equity portfolio which has since recovered.Holding company cash and investments as of December 31 totaled $3 billion. As Jim mentioned, during 2009, we purchased $348 million of our common stock at an average price of $33.05. Additionally, we made investments in Boardwalk Pipeline of $150 million for common units and $200 million for subordinated debt and repaid $108 million of dividends to our shareholders. We received $954 million in dividends from our subsidiaries and $175 million of investment income from our trading portfolio. $250 million of  senior preferred stocks was redeemed by CNA and $100 million of subordinated debt was repaid by Boardwalk Pipeline. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Darren."

And that is we buy the shares in what we think they are attractively priced. We used a whole host of measures to do that. We look at some of the parts valuation. We look at earnings. We at cash flow. We look at just about everything that any analyst would look at in determining whether the shares are cheap or not [ph]. And then we act accordingly. I can't say how much money we would spend in the course of the year on repurchases, but the thing I can say is we will do absolutely nothing in any way to jeopardize the financial strength of Loews. I said in my remarks that we have $3 billion of cash, we have $866 million of debt. I think that even though we spent last year a $350 million repurchasing shares, our cash balance at the end of the year was higher than at the beginning of the year. So we are very conservative in the management of those share repurchases. With respect to monetizing assets, it's funny, I don't know how to answer you because if we were thinking about an IPO and I would say something, then we would be jumping the gun, and I can't do that. So if I say we're not doing something, then maybe that gives a different answer, and you could gain your way to figuring out what we're doing. So let me just say, instead, we constantly look at markets. When we taken businesses public, they've been for a very, very specific reasons and because we thought it would be not only it's good for Loews, but also good for the shareholders of Loews and the potential shareholders of those subsidiaries. But beyond that, I don't want to talk about what specific plans we have for the IPOs of any of our businesses. I'm sorry to say, but it's the way it has to be.

I would say that with respect to a lot of businesses, sellers are looking to sell based on the economics of '07 and early '08. And buyers oftentimes are looking to buy based on the economics of late '08 and '09. And it's too early to tell yet exactly how that's going to all weigh out. And we're going to have to see as well what happens to the economy. And with that, in general corporate profits and for each particular instance, the profitability of both individual companies. My general sense is that we are not going to have a robust recovery the way we've had from prior recessions. And now reason for that is that I believe that this what we now call great recession is different from prior recessions. And it's different because it didn't come about because the Fed raised interest rates to choke off an expanding economy. Rather, it came about, I believe, because we as a nation had a mountain of debt that basically fell down on itself. We have debt-to-GDP in the 50s of 120%, and that has expanded over the past 50 years to 360% of total debt-to-GDP in our economy. And in '07 and '08, that mountain cracked and then crashed the economy. And when you come out of a normal recession, what happens is that the Fed loosens up on interest rates after they choked off the inflationary expectations. And then the banks lend money, extend credit. And with that extension of credit, you have that expansion phase coming off of the bottom of the economy. This time around, there is not that extension of credit. And the reason is because there's already too much credit in the economy either on the part of the homeowner and consumers primarily, but also the overall economy in general. And so I don't believe we're going to get that boost or lift-off phase that you get ordinarily out the bottom of a recession simply because we're not going to have the accelerant, which is the credit extension in order to finance it. Just to bring that back to the price of buying businesses, we operate under the assumption that things are not going to get significantly better in the near term. And we'll have to see what the market is thinking with respect to the economy by looking at the prices that others are willing to pay for businesses that are up for sale."

Number one, they don't make airplanes fast enough. Number two, they haven't eliminated time zones. Number three, we have a tough enough time understanding how to do business in the culture here in the United States. And to think that we could, from a few thousand miles away, master it in a foreign country just doesn't really make sense to me. Additionally, the question always has to arise, if the opportunity is so good, why aren't the locals in that foreign country taking advantage of it? So for all those reasons, we tend to maintain our focus here in the United States. We're not afraid to have businesses that deal internationally. For example, Diamond Offshore has very substantial operations that occur outside the United States. But we are, in general, looking for businesses that are located here in the States."

I do know we've bought HighMount for $1.65 per Mcf, which was at the time an attractive valuation, and I still consider it an attractive valuation. The write-downs that took place last year occurred because of the spot price of natural gas on one particular day. And last year, the price of natural gas got down to -- Henry Hub's gas got down to a price with handle of one on it. So it's like $1.80 or $1.90. But at the end of the quarter, when we had to actually determine whether there would be a write-down, the price got down to I think $3 in change, some very low priced. In the meantime, the SEC has changed the rules for the SEC 10 (sic) [10% discount rate] ceiling test impairment charges. And so, I think if these new rules had been used in the prior quarters, the write-downs would not have been as significant. I'd say also that the -- as you can imagine, I think the business is getting better overall. Certainly, gas prices are up or at least spot gas prices are up. The 12-month strip is now trading just at under $6 an Mcf. That's up significantly from where it was during '09. And importantly, the cost of drilling wells has come down rather significantly for us. Going back a year and a half, to drill a well in Sonora costs us in excess of $1 million or about $1 million. It has since declined to about $450,000. And now it's picking up a bit because of what's going on with fuel prices and the like. But nonetheless, the cost of drilling is still rather low. And we find, especially in our major market which is Sonora, we can drill wells at what looks to us to be very attractive returns for HighMount."

But just to mention a few, I'd say oil prices could go down significantly. Gas prices could go down, both of which would hurt Diamond Offshore and also HighMount. Generally that wouldn't hurt Boardwalk too much. And likewise, Boardwalk has pretty much finished its major capital project. So it would be difficult to see what could hurt Boardwalk significantly other than a dramatic change in gas demand or some things going on intra-market, in the different markets that Boardwalk serves. And likewise, I'm assuming no gas leaks or explosions, which are something that could happen to anybody in the pipeline business. But when you talk about CNA, that's a work in progress. I think that as I said before, that the people at CNA are doing a great job. But anything can happen there. We could have more hurricanes. And even outside of hurricane season, earthquakes have been known to strike from time to time. So catastrophes are a significant risk, as well as investment portfolio. And at the Hotel business, there's the overall economic environment. There's the risk. Hopefully, they've learned their lesson. But there's a risk that Washington can do yet more to try to kill the business. But notwithstanding all these risks, they're risks that we live with; they're risks that I'm accustomed to. I feel generally comfortable taking those risks. And I feel especially comfortable that we at the holding company have the cash and financial resources in place such that if, heaven forbid, some of these risks actually do come to pass that we have the ability to come through them in pretty good shape."

Loews started the year with very solid first quarter reporting earnings of $0.99 per share compared to a loss of $1.49 per share in the first quarter of '09. CNA saw substantial improvement in its net operating income, primarily from higher investment income from limited partnership investments. The Specialty segment for CNA is performing well in a very competitive environment. CNA continues to exercise underlining discipline in both its Specialty and Commercial segments. In the Commercial segment, CNA maintains its focus on improving profitability with more selective underwriting and improved pricing. The competitive P&C insurance market and weak economy have put pressure on the top line but CNA's progress towards an adequately priced, more profitable commercial book of business is evidenced in its improving rate trend. Results in CNA's core property and casualty operation included higher catastrophe losses and decreased favorable net prior year development versus the first quarter of '09. 
Diamond Offshore posted strong results for the first quarter. While day rates have decreased from their all-time high, current rates remain attractive and profitable. During the quarter, Diamond signed a number of contacts, bringing a revenue backlog to approximately $9.1 billion or 78.5 rig years of work. Diamond's recently declared special quarterly dividend along with its regular quarterly dividend was reduced from the previous level of $2 per share to $1.50 per share. This new level of dividend represents over $100 million of cash to be received by Loews this quarter.
The tragic events on the Deepwater Horizon and the ensuing oil spills are of great concern to all of us. Larry Dickerson, the CEO of Diamond Offshore, is on the call this morning. And after Pete Keegan and I have finished our prepared remarks, Larry will give us an update on the situation. 
So turning back to our results, Boardwalk had a strong first quarter, benefiting from increased pipeline capacity and throughput on its major pipeline expansion projects. The growth of natural gas supply continues to create new opportunities, such as the previously announced Haynesville and Clarence Compression Projects which will boost capacity on Boardwalk's East Texas pipeline system to accommodate demand from the Haynesville Shale production area. During the quarter, Boardwalk placed into service three new compressor stations on the Gulf Crossing pipeline and the Fayetteville and Greenville laterals, increasing the delivery capacities of these pipelines. These compression projects demonstrate the attractiveness and flexibility of Boardwalk's footprint. Boardwalk has increased the cash distribution pay to unit holders each quarter since its IPO in '05. The most recently declared distribution was $15.05 per unit, which when combined with distributions to the Boardwalk general partner represents $65 million of cash flow to Loews during the second quarter.
In the E&P sector, natural gas pricing weakness has resulted in a challenging operating environment. To better position itself to succeed in this environment, HighMount is disposing of its non-core assets in Alabama and Michigan. On April 28, HighMount entered into an agreement to sell its assets in the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama to Walter Energy for $210 million. This sale is expected to close during the second quarter of 2010. Additionally, on April 30, HighMount completed the sale of its Exploration & Production assets in the Antrim Shale in Michigan for $330 million, subject to adjustments. Net proceeds from both transactions total approximately $500 million and will go towards repayment of HighMount’s outstanding $1.6 billion term loan.
As of year-end '09, approximately 83% of HighMount’s proved reserves were located in the Permian Basin in Texas. In comparison, the Antrim Shale and the Black Warrior Basin assets were geographically distant and relatively small, together representing only about 17% of HighMount's proved reserves. As a result of these transactions, HighMount will be able to concentrate on its prolific Permian Basin assets which have more favorable production economics. 
In management news, HighMount's Chief Executive Officer, Tim Parker, has elected to pursue other opportunities in the E&P sector, and therefore the changes at HighMount will also include the appointment of a new CEO. Given the depth of experience of HighMount's management team led by Jason Gardner, a longtime HighMount employee and current Chief Operating Officer, we anticipate that this time of transition will proceed smoothly.
We have a long-standing policy of not commenting on the potential sale or divestiture of subsidiary companies. But in this case, I'd like to make an exception. In light of the many M&A transactions that have taken place in the E&P sector, as well as the actions taken at HighMount, I want to say very clearly that we do not have any plans to divest of our HighMount's E&P subsidiary. We continue to light the economics of these long-life natural gas assets over the long term. We are making changes at HighMount to make the company more competitive in this difficult operating environment and we will continue to look for the right opportunity to grow in the E&P industry.
On the lodging front, I am pleased to report some upbeat news from our Loews Hotels subsidiary. Last month, Loews Hotels celebrated the opening of its 19th property, the Loews Atlanta Hotel, located in the heart of Midtown Atlanta. It is a beautiful 414-room property, and we hope that you will visit us when traveling to Atlanta. 
And finally, Loews Corp. finished the quarter with $3.4 billion of cash and investments, up from $3 billion at the beginning of 2010. During the quarter plus the month of April, we repurchased over 6.8 million shares of our common stock for slightly more than $250 million. This brings the total shares repurchased since the beginning of the quarter -- beginning of the second quarter of '09, to just under 17.4 million shares and represents a whisker less than 4% of our shares outstanding at that time. As many of you know, share repurchasing at opportune times and prices have been an integral part of our efforts over the years to build long-term value for all Loews common stockholders. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?"

Loews reported first quarter net income of $420 million versus a net loss of $647 million in the prior year first quarter. Last year's first quarter results include the non-cash after-tax impairment charge of $660 million at HighMount E&P. In the first quarter of 2010, realized investment gains of CNA totaled $19 million after-tax and non-controlling interest versus realized net investment losses in the prior year quarter of $310 million after-tax in non-controlling interest. CNA's contribution to Loews' net income before investment gains and losses was $206 million for the quarter versus $140 million in the prior year quarter. CNA's core property and casualty operations and its non-core segments both saw improvement primarily from higher investment income in limited partnership investments.
During the quarter, CNA's unrealized position improved by $348 million net of tax. Loews' book value per share increased $41.80 as of March 31, 2010, compared to $39.76 at the beginning of the year, mainly as a result of increased book value at CNA.
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the quarter declined to $136 million from a $163 million in the first quarter of 2009. Diamond’s first quarter net income reflects a 2.7% decrease in revenue stemming from an overall decline rig utilization, although average day rates for Diamond Offshore’s floater fleet increased. Revenues from jack-up rigs decreased $47 million versus the prior year quarter primarily due to decreased day rates and utilization.
HighMount reported first quarter net income of $24 million. Its revenues decreased to $235 million in the first quarter 2010 from $175 million in the first quarter of 2009, mainly due to reduced average realized prices and sales volume. The decline in production reflects some curtailment of HighMount's drilling program as well as delayed well completions in response to lower natural gas prices. HighMount's expenses for the first quarter decreased to $91 million from $145 million in the first quarter of 2009, excluding the impairment of natural gas and oil properties. Expenses in the first quarter of 2009 included the $23 million fee, determinate contracts on five drilling rigs at HighMount's Permian Basin properties. DD&A expenses for the quarter decreased $14 million versus the prior year's first quarter primarily as a result of the impairment of the carrying value of HighMount's natural gas and oil properties. HighMount's first quarter results included $8 million loss after-tax from discontinuing hedge accounting and derivative positions primarily related to the sale of Michigan assets.
HighMount's production volumes are as follows: Natural gas production of 17.6 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $7.16 per thousand cubic feet; natural gas liquids production of 734,000 barrels at an average realized price of $34.43 per barrel; and oil production of 61,000 barrels at an average price of $74.19 per barrel. As of March 31, HighMount had hedges in place for approximately 75% of its estimated 2010 natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.07 per Mcfe, and 49% of estimated 2011 production at an equivalent price of $6.41 per Mcfe.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the quarter was $38 million versus $22 million in the prior year's first quarter. Revenues increased to $301 million from $224 million in the first quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of increased gas transportation capacities and throughput from pipeline expansion projects. Expenses rose to $213 million from $173 million in the prior year first quarter. Expenses during the quarter included a $14 million increase in fuel consumed due to higher throughput from the pipeline expansion projects and a $10 million increase in interest expense due to higher debt levels.
In the first quarter, Loews Hotels reported a net loss of $1 million versus a net loss of $18 million in the prior year first quarter, which included a non-cash impairment charge related to Loews Hotels minority interest in a joint venture. In the first quarter of 2010, revenue per available room increased to $144.65 from $137.56 in the prior year first quarter. Occupancy for the quarter also increased to 65.3% from 62.4%. 
As of March 31, holding company cash and investments totaled $3.4 billion. During the quarter, we received net proceeds of approximately $333 million from the sale of 11.5 million Boardwalk Pipeline common units, representing a portion of the common units we purchased from Boardwalk in late 2008 and mid-2009. Also during the quarter, we received $237 million of dividends and interest from our subsidiaries. We have purchased 5.4 million shares of our common stock for $197 million and we paid $26 million of dividend to our shareholders. From April 1 through April 28, 2010, we repurchased an additional 1.25 million shares of common stock for $47 million. And now, I'll turn the call back to Jim."

I would point out that the industry has a 41-year track record of operating safely in the U.S. Gulf, or in all U.S. waters without any significant oil spills. So therefore, the scope and size of this particular tragedy of the sinking of the Horizon and the uncontrolled flow of oil into the sea surprised us very much that this would happen and be of this magnitude. We don't have our full set of facts to be able to comment as to what particularly happened, but the first thing we did was we did understand from reports that they were in the final processes of testing their well and securing that well. So the first thing that Diamond Offshore did was begin a review of its own procedures governing these particular types of operations with emphasis and questions of what could go wrong, so that we could make sure that there wasn’t any changes that we need to make to our procedures. 
The Ocean Endeavor was the closest offshore rig to the Horizon and, even before the Horizon sank, we began taking on transferring from boats some of the survivors that were evacuated from the rig and they  were initially staged there. We requested for a couple of tools to be utilized in efforts to close the BOP stacks and we quickly provided those to the companies undergoing those particular efforts. Again, we are ready as needed to provide any further assistance but I think most of those efforts are in hand by BP and the other subcontractors that are working there.
We are confident that our procedures and our personnel are adequate in scope and sufficiently trained so that if those procedures are followed, that we will prevent this type of occurrence in the future on our rigs. The only thing I can provide as an update is that the MMS, the regulatory authorities which is a part of the Department of Interior, announced that they would make and have made for Diamond Offshore, visits to our deepwater operations to review what we're doing with emphasis on our stacks and our procedures there. And we did not receive as a result of those visits any incidence of non-compliance, which would be the regulatory method of recognizing deficiency or something that needed to be corrected. 
So again, we stand by with the rest of the industry. I do know that the men and women of this industry are working very, very hard, are trying all sorts of things, have a number of plans in the works to begin to get control of the oil flow, and that's obviously everybody's highest priority before we move on to determining what may have happened, and should there be additional safeguards or changes in our procedures in the future. So with that, I think Jim, I'll let you continue on with your Q&A portion."

We bought HighMount in '07. Gas prices proceeded to go up for a year. When we bought HighMount, gas prices were about $7.50 in Mcf. They almost doubled in the next year, going to $14.50 in Mcf in July",294,"Yes. The shale boom, I think, has surprised everybody. We bought HighMount in '07. Gas prices proceeded to go up for a year. When we bought HighMount, gas prices were about $7.50 in Mcf. They almost doubled in the next year, going to $14.50 in Mcf in July of '08, and then they went down steadily. At one point, it hit a $1 handle about a year ago. And that's all due to the shale I believe. The shale boom really became recognized as a permanent phenomenon beginning in the summer of '08, and people now have a pretty good understanding of just how significant it is, and it is rather significant. Having said that, I would say that natural gas prices at $4 in Mcf are below the cost of production, even for many of the shale players. So I think that two things will happen in the world of natural gas. Number one, I think that slowly but surely production will come down because the industry is operating -- many people in the industry are operating at negative cash flow. And the other thing that will happen is that natural gas consumption, I believe, over the next several years will increase significantly. Right now, natural gas trades for about 30% of the per Btu that oil trades for. And I think that spread is just too big to last for a long time. And I think what we're going to see is increased consumption of natural gas to the detriment of oil consumption. But as I said, that's not going to happen in a month or two. That will take a few years for that to happen. But it could add a few percentage points of consumption every year to natural gas."

The rest of that money, so close to $3 billion, is invested primarily in fixed income instruments. Our corporate philosophy is to have cash at the holding company level because only by having cash at the holding company level can we take advantage of opportunities when they appear. So the cash that we have by the standards of the past few years is high, by the standards of a few years before that I think the cash that we have is low. I would say to you that it's a level that we're very comfortable with. It gives us the opportunity to buy back stock, if we want to do that. It gives us the opportunity to make an acquisition if we see an attractive one come along. And it’s not so great that it's, as I like to say, it's not burning a hole in our pocket."

And certainly not as serious an impact as it will have for banks. I think the thing that's concerning me that I may talk about next quarter are the changes that the FASB has up its sleeve, that it will start to lay out over the next several months, which will relate to market value accounting. I know the banks are apoplectic about it. It will be, as they say in the world of economists, procyclical, so that when things are good banks will be giddy to actually loan more, and when things are bad in the economy banks will be retrenching even more. My guess is -- and for Loews and CNA, because we would have to mark all of our investment assets to market, it will cause our earnings to swing wildly. Such that in '08 if we had reported under this regime, our earnings would have been at CNA a loss of $5 billion, and in '09 our earnings would have been income of $5 billion. And so the first thing I think that analysts will do with respect to insurance companies which don't have one on the bank lists the way that other financial institutions have it, the first thing analysts will do when we report our net income number is deduct out that change of in-market value of our assets. I would encourage one and all, when these proposals come out, to make your feelings known to the FASB about what's going on. Because it seems to me to be accounting that will serve no good purpose, will be difficult to account for at the corporate level, and will economically be dangerous for the country. For banks, they will have -- instead of taking Loan Loss Reserves, they will have to mark their loans to market, whatever that means. And as I said, it just doesn't make sense. So pay close, close attention to it and we'll see how it develops."

Loews started the year with very solid first quarter reporting earnings of $0.99 per share compared to a loss of $1.49 per share in the first quarter of '09. CNA saw substantial improvement in its net operating income, primarily from higher investment income from limited partnership investments. The Specialty segment for CNA is performing well in a very competitive environment. CNA continues to exercise underlining discipline in both its Specialty and Commercial segments. In the Commercial segment, CNA maintains its focus on improving profitability with more selective underwriting and improved pricing. The competitive P&C insurance market and weak economy have put pressure on the top line but CNA's progress towards an adequately priced, more profitable commercial book of business is evidenced in its improving rate trend. Results in CNA's core property and casualty operation included higher catastrophe losses and decreased favorable net prior year development versus the first quarter of '09. 
Diamond Offshore posted strong results for the first quarter. While day rates have decreased from their all-time high, current rates remain attractive and profitable. During the quarter, Diamond signed a number of contacts, bringing a revenue backlog to approximately $9.1 billion or 78.5 rig years of work. Diamond's recently declared special quarterly dividend along with its regular quarterly dividend was reduced from the previous level of $2 per share to $1.50 per share. This new level of dividend represents over $100 million of cash to be received by Loews this quarter.
The tragic events on the Deepwater Horizon and the ensuing oil spills are of great concern to all of us. Larry Dickerson, the CEO of Diamond Offshore, is on the call this morning. And after Pete Keegan and I have finished our prepared remarks, Larry will give us an update on the situation. 
So turning back to our results, Boardwalk had a strong first quarter, benefiting from increased pipeline capacity and throughput on its major pipeline expansion projects. The growth of natural gas supply continues to create new opportunities, such as the previously announced Haynesville and Clarence Compression Projects which will boost capacity on Boardwalk's East Texas pipeline system to accommodate demand from the Haynesville Shale production area. During the quarter, Boardwalk placed into service three new compressor stations on the Gulf Crossing pipeline and the Fayetteville and Greenville laterals, increasing the delivery capacities of these pipelines. These compression projects demonstrate the attractiveness and flexibility of Boardwalk's footprint. Boardwalk has increased the cash distribution pay to unit holders each quarter since its IPO in '05. The most recently declared distribution was $15.05 per unit, which when combined with distributions to the Boardwalk general partner represents $65 million of cash flow to Loews during the second quarter.
In the E&P sector, natural gas pricing weakness has resulted in a challenging operating environment. To better position itself to succeed in this environment, HighMount is disposing of its non-core assets in Alabama and Michigan. On April 28, HighMount entered into an agreement to sell its assets in the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama to Walter Energy for $210 million. This sale is expected to close during the second quarter of 2010. Additionally, on April 30, HighMount completed the sale of its Exploration & Production assets in the Antrim Shale in Michigan for $330 million, subject to adjustments. Net proceeds from both transactions total approximately $500 million and will go towards repayment of HighMount’s outstanding $1.6 billion term loan.
As of year-end '09, approximately 83% of HighMount’s proved reserves were located in the Permian Basin in Texas. In comparison, the Antrim Shale and the Black Warrior Basin assets were geographically distant and relatively small, together representing only about 17% of HighMount's proved reserves. As a result of these transactions, HighMount will be able to concentrate on its prolific Permian Basin assets which have more favorable production economics. 
In management news, HighMount's Chief Executive Officer, Tim Parker, has elected to pursue other opportunities in the E&P sector, and therefore the changes at HighMount will also include the appointment of a new CEO. Given the depth of experience of HighMount's management team led by Jason Garner, a long-time HighMount employee and current Chief Operating Officer, we anticipate that this time of transition will proceed smoothly.
We have a long-standing policy of not commenting on the potential sale or divestiture of subsidiary companies. But in this case, I'd like to make an exception. In light of the many M&A transactions that have taken place in the E&P sector, as well as the actions taken at HighMount, I want to say very clearly that we do not have any plans to divest of our HighMount's E&P subsidiary. We continue to like the economics of these long-life natural gas assets over the long term. We are making changes at HighMount to make the company more competitive in this difficult operating environment and we will continue to look for the right opportunity to grow in the E&P industry.
On the lodging front, I am pleased to report some upbeat news from our Loews Hotels subsidiary. Last month, Loews Hotels celebrated the opening of its 19th property, the Loews Atlanta Hotel, located in the heart of Midtown Atlanta. It is a beautiful 414-room property, and we hope that you will visit us when traveling to Atlanta. 
And finally, Loews Corp. finished the quarter with $3.4 billion of cash and investments, up from $3 billion at the beginning of 2010. During the quarter plus the month of April, we repurchased over 6.8 million shares of our common stock for slightly more than $250 million. This brings the total shares repurchased since the beginning of the quarter -- beginning of the second quarter of '09, to just under 17.4 million shares and represents a whisker less than 4% of our shares outstanding at that time. As many of you know, share repurchases at opportune times and prices have been an integral part of our efforts over the years to build long-term value for all Loews common stockholders. 
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?"

Loews reported first quarter net income of $420 million versus a net loss of $647 million in the prior year first quarter. Last year's first quarter results include the non-cash after-tax impairment charge of $660 million at HighMount E&P. In the first quarter of 2010, realized investment gains at CNA totaled $19 million after-tax and non-controlling interest versus realized net investment losses in the prior year quarter of $310 million after-tax in non-controlling interest. CNA's contribution to Loews' net income before investment gains and losses was $206 million for the quarter versus $140 million in the prior year quarter. CNA's core property and casualty operations and its non-core segments both saw improvement primarily from higher investment income in limited partnership investments.
During the quarter, CNA's unrealized position improved by $348 million net of tax. Loews' book value per share increased to $41.80 as of March 31, 2010, compared to $39.76 at the beginning of the year, mainly as a result of increased book value at CNA.
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the quarter declined to $136 million from a $163 million in the first quarter of 2009. Diamond’s first quarter net income reflects a 2.7% decrease in revenue stemming from an overall decline rig utilization, although average day rates for Diamond Offshore’s floater fleet increased. Revenues from jack-up rigs decreased $47 million versus the prior year quarter primarily due to decreased day rates and utilization.
HighMount reported first quarter net income of $24 million. Its revenues decreased to $235 million in the first quarter 2010 from $175 million in the first quarter of 2009, mainly due to reduced average realized prices and sales volume. The decline in production reflects some curtailment of HighMount's drilling program as well as delayed well completions in response to lower natural gas prices. HighMount's expenses for the first quarter decreased to $91 million from $145 million in the first quarter of 2009, excluding the impairment of natural gas and oil properties. Expenses in the first quarter of 2009 included the $23 million fee, determinate contracts on five drilling rigs at HighMount's Permian Basin properties. DD&A expenses for the quarter decreased $14 million versus the prior year's first quarter primarily as a result of the impairment of the carrying value of HighMount's natural gas and oil properties. HighMount's first quarter results included $8 million loss after-tax from discontinuing hedge accounting and derivative positions primarily related to the sale of Michigan assets.
HighMount's production volumes are as follows: Natural gas production of 17.6 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $7.16 per thousand cubic feet; natural gas liquids production of 734,000 barrels at an average realized price of $34.43 per barrel; and oil production of 61,000 barrels at an average price of $74.19 per barrel. As of March 31, HighMount had hedges in place for approximately 75% of its estimated 2010 natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.07 per Mcfe, and 49% of estimated 2011 production at an equivalent price of $6.41 per Mcfe.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the quarter was $38 million versus $22 million in the prior year's first quarter. Revenues increased to $301 million from $224 million in the first quarter of 2009, primarily as a result of increased gas transportation capacities and throughput from pipeline expansion projects. Expenses rose to $213 million from $173 million in the prior year first quarter. Expenses during the quarter included a $14 million increase in fuel consumed due to higher throughput from the pipeline expansion projects and a $10 million increase in interest expense due to higher debt levels.
In the first quarter, Loews Hotels reported a net loss of $1 million versus a net loss of $18 million in the prior year first quarter, which included a non-cash impairment charge related to Loews Hotels minority interest in a joint venture. In the first quarter of 2010, revenue per available room increased to $144.65 from $137.56 in the prior year first quarter. Occupancy for the quarter also increased to 65.3% from 62.4%. 
As of March 31, holding company cash and investments totaled $3.4 billion. During the quarter, we received net proceeds of approximately $333 million from the sale of 11.5 million Boardwalk Pipeline common units, representing a portion of the common units we purchased from Boardwalk in late 2008 and mid-2009. Also during the quarter, we received $237 million of dividends and interest from our subsidiaries. We have purchased 5.4 million shares of our common stock for $197 million and we paid $26 million of dividend to our shareholders. From April 1 through April 28, 2010, we repurchased an additional 1.25 million shares of common stock for $47 million. And now, I'll turn the call back to Jim."

I'm going to talk about the Deepwater Horizon event, which is an unfolding tragedy, but first we need to focus on it was a tragedy for 11 of our fellow offshore workers who lost their lives apparently in this event, and certainly the company extends its condolences to those families and to those companies.
I would point out that the industry has a 41-year track record of operating safely in the U.S. Gulf, or in all U.S. waters without any significant oil spills. So therefore, the scope and size of this particular tragedy of the sinking of the Horizon and the uncontrolled flow of oil into the sea surprised us very much that this would happen and be of this magnitude. We don't have our full set of facts to be able to comment as to what particularly happened, but the first thing we did was we did understand from reports that they were in the final processes of testing their well and securing that well. So the first thing that Diamond Offshore did was begin a review of its own procedures governing these particular types of operations with emphasis and questions of what could go wrong, so that we could make sure that there wasn’t any changes that we need to make to our procedures. 
The Ocean Endeavor was the closest offshore rig to the Horizon and, even before the Horizon sank, we began taking on transferring from boats some of the survivors that were evacuated from the rig and they  were initially staged there. We requested for a couple of tools to be utilized in efforts to close the BOP stacks and we quickly provided those to the companies undergoing those particular efforts. Again, we are ready as needed to provide any further assistance but I think most of those efforts are in hand by BP and the other subcontractors that are working there.
We are confident that our procedures and our personnel are adequate in scope and sufficiently trained so that if those procedures are followed, that we will prevent this type of occurrence in the future on our rigs. The only thing I can provide as an update is that the MMS, the regulatory authorities which is a part of the Department of Interior, announced that they would make and have made for Diamond Offshore, visits to our deepwater operations to review what we're doing with emphasis on our stacks and our procedures there. And we did not receive as a result of those visits any incidence of non-compliance, which would be the regulatory method of recognizing deficiency or something that needed to be corrected. 
So again, we stand by with the rest of the industry. I do know that the men and women of this industry are working very, very hard, are trying all sorts of things, have a number of plans in the works to begin to get control of the oil flow, and that's obviously everybody's highest priority before we move on to determining what may have happened, and should there be additional safeguards or changes in our procedures in the future. So with that, I think Jim, I'll let you continue on with your Q&A portion."

We bought HighMount in '07. Gas prices proceeded to go up for a year. When we bought HighMount, gas prices were about $7.50 in Mcf. They almost doubled in the next year, going to $14.50 in Mcf in July",294,"Yes. The shale boom, I think, has surprised everybody. We bought HighMount in '07. Gas prices proceeded to go up for a year. When we bought HighMount, gas prices were about $7.50 in Mcf. They almost doubled in the next year, going to $14.50 in Mcf in July of '08, and then they went down steadily. At one point, it hit a $1 handle about a year ago. And that's all due to the shale I believe. The shale boom really became recognized as a permanent phenomenon beginning in the summer of '08, and people now have a pretty good understanding of just how significant it is, and it is rather significant. Having said that, I would say that natural gas prices at $4 in Mcf are below the cost of production, even for many of the shale players. So I think that two things will happen in the world of natural gas. Number one, I think that slowly but surely production will come down because the industry is operating -- many people in the industry are operating at negative cash flow. And the other thing that will happen is that natural gas consumption, I believe, over the next several years will increase significantly. Right now, natural gas trades for about 30% of the per Btu that oil trades for. And I think that spread is just too big to last for a long time. And I think what we're going to see is increased consumption of natural gas to the detriment of oil consumption. But as I said, that's not going to happen in a month or two. That will take a few years for that to happen. But it could add a few percentage points of consumption every year to natural gas."

And certainly not as serious an impact as it will have for banks. I think the thing that's concerning me that I may talk about next quarter are the changes that the FASB has up its sleeve, that it will start to lay out over the next several months, which will relate to market value accounting. I know the banks are apoplectic about it. It will be, as they say in the world of economists, procyclical, so that when things are good banks will be giddy to actually loan more, and when things are bad in the economy banks will be retrenching even more. My guess is -- and for Loews and CNA, because we would have to mark all of our investment assets to market, it will cause our earnings to swing wildly. Such that in '08 if we had reported under this regime, our earnings would have been at CNA a loss of $5 billion, and in '09 our earnings would have been income of $5 billion. And so the first thing I think that analysts will do with respect to insurance companies which don't have one on the bank lists the way that other financial institutions have it, the first thing analysts will do when we report our net income number is deduct out that change of in-market value of our assets. I would encourage one and all, when these proposals come out, to make your feelings known to the FASB about what's going on. Because it seems to me to be accounting that will serve no good purpose, will be difficult to account for at the corporate level, and will economically be dangerous for the country.

For the second quarter, Loews' net income increased to $366 million from $340 million in the second quarter of 2009. This increase reflects an investment gain",985,"Thank you, Darren, and good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call today. For the second quarter, Loews' net income increased to $366 million from $340 million in the second quarter of 2009. This increase reflects an investment gain of $1 million this year versus a net investment loss of $178 million in the second quarter of '09. 
Loews' reported income before investment gains and losses of $365 million versus $518 million in the second quarter of '09. This decline is primarily the result of decreased earnings from Diamond Offshore, CNA and HighMount and lower investment income from Loews' trading portfolio.
CNA reported overall solid operating and financial performance for the second quarter, although its net operating income declined versus the prior year quarter. The primary drivers of this decline were decreased limited partnership results and decreased current accident year underwriting results, which were partially offset by favorable net prior year development. Subsequent to the close of the quarter, CNA announced an agreement to transfer its legacy asbestos and pollution liability from National Indemnity, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. We believe that this transaction will effectively eliminate CNA's asbestos and pollution reserve risk as well as any reinsurance dispute and credit risk.
In the past, our earnings conference calls has given me an opportunity to do a quarterly lecture series on current topics in insurance accounting, and I continue to propose changes to the accounting rules proposed by the FASB to be a worthy topic for today. On May 26, the FASB published an exposure draft of an accounting standards update that will significantly change mark-to-market accounting rules for insurance companies and other financial institutions. The proposed rule changes will require insurance companies to mark substantially all of their investments to market each quarter through the income statement. Fluctuations in the market price of these securities will therefore flow through both the quarterly income statement and balance sheet, and so adjust the balance sheet that now occurs under the current rules. Importantly, this new methodology will apply to securities currently classified as available-for-sale.
So let's examine the impact of the proposed rules on CNA's reported earnings during the tumultuous market conditions of '08 and '09. If the proposed rules have been in effect in '08, Loews and CNA would have recognized through the income statement additional investment losses of approximately $5 billion. On CNA's portfolio recovered in value in '09, the proposed rules would have resulted in investment gains of almost $5 billion being reported on the income statement. From '08 to '09, Loews' and CNA's reported results would have swung $10 billion when, in our view, not much have really changed with respect to the underlying Insurance business. 
The problem with the expanded use of mark-to-market accounting is that this methodology does not reflect the way an insurance business is run the way that we and other insurance management think about or manage our businesses. The wild and unpredictable swings in unrealized investment gains and losses will oftentimes dwarf the businesses' underwriting results and net investment income, notwithstanding the insurance companies' ability and intent to hold the investment securities to a recovery. While the stated goals of these rules is to enhance transparency, mark-to-market will do the opposite via sealing and camouflaging the underlying operating results. If seasonal accounting rules are imposed, I predict that the first thing that security analysts will do when an insurance company announces its results is adjust their reported earnings for the unrealized investment gains or losses to get to the underlying operating income number, as it is currently reported under existing accounting rules.
The comment period for the FASB's proposed accounting standards update extends due September 30. I encourage you to send your cards and letters, and if we want to get to the 21st century, your e-mails as well, to let them know that the proposed rules do nothing to improve transparency, and they do a lot to obscure operating results. 
And now, back to our regularly scheduled program. For the second quarter, Diamond Offshore reported a reduction in revenue that was largely the result of a decline in renewal contract day rates from peak levels and a decrease in overall average fleet utilization. Given these factors, along with the continuing uncertainty caused by the drawing moratorium in U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Diamond has announced a reduction in its quarterly special dividend. Its regular and special dividends payable in the third quarter will reduce to a total of $0.875 from a total of $1.50 in the prior quarter. Diamond stated that it thought that it was prudent to retain cash to maintain financial strength and strategic flexibility, as well as to position itself for potential rig acquisition opportunity. 
In July, Diamond announced the sale of its high specification jack-up rig, the Ocean Shield, to Ensco for over $186 million. This rig is currently working for Apache Corporation in Australia under a term contract which Ensco will assume. This was a one-off opportunistic transaction that Diamond made in order to increase its funds for potential investment in deepwater assets such as last year's purchase of the Ocean Valor and the Ocean Courage.
Loews finished the quarter with holding company cash and investments of $3.4 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of our common stock, which is considerably less than our share repurchases in the prior three quarters. While we typically do not comment on the factors that guide our decisions to buy back our stock in any given quarter, I will point out that CNA's discussions with National Indemnity regarding the loss portfolio transfer transaction prevented us from repurchasing our stock during much of the quarter. Absent that factor, the total would probably have been higher than the 1.5 million share repurchase. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Peter Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer."
285930,109024510,71326,"Loews Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-02-2010",2010-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Loews Corporation","Analysts","Thanks, Jim and good morning, everyone. For the quarter, our earnings per share improved $0.87 from $0.78 in the prior year quarter, primarily as the result of realized investment gains at CNA compared to investment losses in the prior period. Offsetting",951,"Thanks, Jim and good morning, everyone. For the quarter, our earnings per share improved $0.87 from $0.78 in the prior year quarter, primarily as the result of realized investment gains at CNA compared to investment losses in the prior period. Offsetting this were declining results of three of our subsidiary companies and a decline in holding company investment income. 
Book value for Loews common share increased to $43.53 as of June 30 from $39.76 at the beginning of the year. For the quarter, realized investment gains at CNA totaled $12 million after-tax in noncontrolling interest versus realized investment losses of $178 million in the prior year quarter. The driver of improvement was a reduction in other-than-temporary impairment losses. CNA's contribution to Loews' net income before investment gains and losses decreased to $247 million for the quarter from $277 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease resulted mainly from lower investment income, which included a significant decrease in limited partnership results versus the prior year period in which CNA recorded exceptional limited partnership investment results.
CNA's results for the quarter benefited from a favorable net prior year development in its core property and casualty operations. The second quarter combined ratio for P&C operations was 89.4 compared with 98.1 in the second quarter of 2009, with the difference primarily attributable to 18.4 points of favorable prior year development. 
CNA has reported favorable prior year development for 14 consecutive quarters, reflecting disciplined underwriting and reserving practices. In his comments, Jim mentioned that CNA has entered into an agreement with National Indemnity under which CNA's legacy asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities will be reinsured. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2010, at which time Loews expects to recognize a loss of approximately $340 million after-tax in noncontrolling interest.
Diamond Offshore's contribution to net income for the quarter declined to $104 million from $181 million in the second quarter of 2009. Compared to the prior year's second quarter, operating revenues decreased by $111 million to $812 million while contract drilling expense increased by $43 million to $349 million. The decline in revenue primarily relates to a decrease in day rates and an overall decrease in average utilization from 80% during the second quarter of 2009 to 76% for the second quarter of 2010.
This increase in operating expense is primarily due to the addition of the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor to Diamond's fleet, as well as higher amortized mobilization expenses and higher operating costs from rigs exiting the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to operate internationally where the operating cost structure is generally higher.
HighMount reported second quarter net operating income of $5 million versus $29 million in the prior year quarter. During the quarter, HighMount completed the sale of Exploration & Production assets located in the Antrim Shale in Michigan and the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama. HighMount's remaining natural gas exploration & production operations are primarily located in the Permian Basin in Texas. Compared to the second quarter 2009, HighMount's operating revenues decreased by $42 million to $105 million. The sale of assets in Michigan and Alabama decreased revenues by $24 million, and the reduction in drilling activity in the Permian Basin as well as lower average prices decreased revenues by $19 million. 
Aside from this discontinuing hedge accounting on derivative positions, no significant investment gains or losses were recognized in the sale of HighMount's Antrim Shale or Black Warrior Basin assets. Because HighMount utilizes the full cost method of accounting, no gain or loss is recognized on the sale of reserve and sales proceeds reduced the capitalized cost pool.
During the quarter, HighMount's aggregate production volumes for Permian, Antrim and Black Warrior assets are as follows: Natural gas production of 15 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $5.19 per thousand cubic feet; natural gas liquids production of 738,000 barrels at an average realized price of $33.20 per barrel; and oil production of 68,000 barrels at an average price of $71.08 per barrel. HighMount's production volume for the Permian Basin are as follows: Natural gas production of 12.4 billion cubic feet; natural gas liquids production of just under 738,000 barrels; and oil production of 60,000 barrels. As of June 30, HighMount had hedges in place for approximately 79% of its estimated 2010 natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.26 per Mcfe and 60% of estimated 2011 production at an equivalent price of $6.32 per Mcfe.
Boardwalk Pipeline's contribution to net income for the quarter increased to $21 million from $8 million in the prior year second quarter. Versus the prior year's second quarter, revenues increased by $55 million to $256 million, primarily due to pipeline expansion projects. These increases were partially offset by a $10 million decrease in interruptible and short-term firm transportation services caused by lower basis spreads between delivery points and Boardwalk Pipeline's pipeline system.
Operating expenses in the quarter increased by $15 million to $165 million, primarily from an increase in natural gas prices and consumed fuel related to the pipeline expansion. 
In the second quarter, Loews Hotels' net income increased to $4 million from $3 million in the prior year quarter. Revenue per available room increased to $152.82 from $139.21 in the second quarter of 2009. Occupancy for the quarter also increased to 73.6% from 69.8%.
As of June 30, holding company cash and investments totaled $3.4 billion. During the quarter, we received $200 million of dividends and interest from our subsidiaries. We repurchased 1.5 million shares of our common stock for $56 million, and we paid $27 million of dividends to our shareholders. And now I'll turn the call back over to Darren. Darren?"

And as a result of the economy being over-levered, it is very difficult to get that bounce off the bottom that you would ordinarily expect from a recession. So we're now growing probably over the last quarter. The second quarter I think came in at 2.4%, and many analysts are now forecasting that going forward in the second half of the year, we could have growth of less than that amount because of the fiscal drag coming about from state governments as well as the way the stimulus money starts to add as well. So I'm generally in agreement. I think that the second half of the year, growth should probably be in the 0% to 2%. And I think going forward, it's going to be very difficult to get this economy cranking at a faster rate of growth because of the continued high levels of debt. So when we factor that into our forecasts for individual companies, I just don't understand how the bottoms-up analysis of earnings that gets you to these enormous growth in S&P earnings is actually going to come to fruition. And so when we think about acquisitions, we think about it in the context of a slow growth economy as opposed to an economy that's going to take off."

For the second quarter, Loews net income increased to $356 million from $340 in the second quarter of 2009.

For the second quarter, Loews net income increased to $356 million from $340 in the second quarter of 2009. This increase reflects an investment gain of $1 million this year, versus a net investment loss of $178 million in the second quarter of 2009. Those reported income before the investment gains and losses of $365 million versus $518 million in the second quarter of 2009. This decline is primarily the result of decreased earnings from Diamond Offshore, CNA and HighMount and a lower investment incomes from Loews trading portfolio. 
CNA reported overall solid operating and financial performance for the second quarter, although it’s net operating income declined versus the prior year quarter. The primary drivers of this decline was decreased limited partnership results and decreased current accident year underwriting results, which were partially offset by favorable net prior year development. 
Subsequent to the close of the quarter, CNA announced an agreement to transform its legacy asbestos and pollution liability for National Indemnity, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. We believe that this transaction will effectively eliminate CNA’s asbestos and pollution reserve risks, as well as any reinsurance dispute and credit risks. 
In the past, our earnings conference call has given me an opportunity to do a quarterly lectures theory on current topics in insurance accounting, and I consider the proposed changes to the accounting rules proposed by the FASB to be a worthy topic for today. On May 26 the FASB published an exposure draft of an accounting standards updates that would significantly change mark-to-market accounting rules for insurance companies and other financial institutions. 
The proposed rule changes would require insurance companies to mark substantiate all of their investments to markets each quarter through the income states. Fluctuations in the market place of new securities would therefore flow through both the quarterly income statement and balance sheet, instead just the balance sheet has now occurred under the current rules. Importantly this new methodology would apply to securities currently classified as available for sale. 
So let’s examine the impact of the proposed rules on CNA’s reported earnings during the promotion of market conditions of 2008 and 2009. If the proposed rules had been in effect in ’08, Loews and CNA would have recognized through the income statement, additional investment losses of approximately $5 billion. When CNA’s portfolio recovered in value in 2009, the proposed rules would have resulted in investment gains along those $5 billion being reported on the income statement. 
From ‘08 to ’09, Loews’s and CNA’s reported results would have swung by $10 billion, when in our view not much had really changed with respect to the underlying insurance business. The problem with the expanded use of mark-to-market accounting, is that this methodology does not reflect the way an insurance business is run; the way that we and other insurance managements think about or manage our businesses. 
The wild and unpredictable swings in unrealized investment gains and losses, will often times draw out the business’s under writing results and net investment income, notwithstanding the insurance company’s ability and intent to hold the investment security through recovery. While the stated goals for these rules is to enhance transparency, mark-to-market will prove the opposite, by obscuring and camouflaging the under lying operating results. 
If these new accounting rules are imposed, I predict that the first thing a security analyst will do when an insurance company announces its results, is adjust the reported earnings for the unrealized investment gains or losses to get to the underlying operating income number, as it is currently reported under existing accounting rules. 
The commentary for the FDSBs proposed accounting standards update extends through September 30. I encourage you to send your cards and letters and if you want to get with the 21st century, your emails as well, to let them know that the proposed rules do nothing to improve transparency and they do a lot to obscure operating results. 
Now back to our regularly scheduled program. For the second quarter, Diamond Offshore reported a reduction in revenue that was largely the results of a decline in renewal contract tailwinds [ph] from peak levels and a decrease in overall average fleet utilizations. Given these factors, along with the continuing uncertainty caused by the drilling moratorium in the US Gulf of Mexico, Diamond has announced a reduction in its quarterly special dividend. 
Its regular and special dividends payable in the third quarter were reduced to a total of $0.875 from the total of $1.50 in the prior quarter. Diamond stated that it felt that it was prudent to retain cash to maintain financial strength and strategic flexibility, as well as to position itself for potential rig acquisition opportunity. 
In July, Diamond announced the sale of its high specification jack-up rig, the Ocean Shield to ENSCO for $186 million. This rig is currently working for Apache Corporation in Australia under a term contract, which ENSCO will assume. This was a one-off, opportunistic transaction that Diamond made in order to increase its funds for potential investment in deep water assets such as after yield purchase of the Ocean Endeavor and the Ocean Courage. 
Loews finished the quarter with holding company cash and investment of $3.4 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased one and a half million shares of our common stock, which is considerably less than our share repurchases in the prior three quarters. While we typically do not comment on the factors that guide our decision to buy back our stocks in any given quarter, I will point out that CNA's discussion with national indemnity, regarding the loss portfolio transfer transaction for rented [Inaudible] purchasing our stock during much of the quarter. After that factor, the total would probably have been higher than the 1.5 million shares purchase.
And with that, I will now turn the call over to Peter Keegan our Chief Financial Officer. Pete.

For the quarter, earnings per share improved $0.87 from $0.78 in the prior year quarter, primarily as the result of realized investment gains at CNA, compared to investment losses in the prior period. Offsetting this",950,"Thanks Jim and good morning everyone. For the quarter, earnings per share improved $0.87 from $0.78 in the prior year quarter, primarily as the result of realized investment gains at CNA, compared to investment losses in the prior period. Offsetting this we are a decline in results with three of our subsidiary companies, and a declined holding company investment income.
Book value for Loews common share increased to $43.53 as of June 30, from $39.76 at the beginning of the year. For the quarter, realized investment gains at CNA totaled $12 million after tax and non-controlling interest, versus realized investment losses of $178 million in the prior year quarter. The driver of improvement was a reduction in other than temporary impairment losses.
CNA’s contribution to Loews net income before investment gains and losses decreased to $247 million for the quarter from $277 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease resulted mainly from lower investment income, which included a significant decrease and limited partnership results, versus the prior year period, in which CNA recorded exceptional limited partnership investment results.
CNA’S results for the quarter benefited from a favorable net prior year development and its core property and casualty operations. For second quarter combined ratio for PNC operations was 89.4 compared with 98.1 in the second quarter 2009, with the difference primarily attributable to 18.4 points of favorable prior year development. CNA has reported favorable prior year development for 14 consecutive quarters, reflecting disciplined underwriting and reserving practices. 
In his comments, Jim mentioned that CNA has entered into an agreement with National Indemnity, under which CNA’s legacy as best as an environmental pollution liability will reinsured. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the third quarter 2010, at which time Loews expects to recognize a loss of approximately $340 million after tax in non-controlling interest.
Diamond Offshore’s contribution to net income for the quarter declined to $104 million from $181 million in the second quarter 2009. Compared to the prior year’s second quarter, operating revenues decreased by $111 million to $812 million, while contract drilling expense increased by $43 million to $349 million. 
The decline in revenue primarily relates to a decrease in day rates and an overall decrease in average utilization from 80% during the second quarter of 2009 to 76% for the second quarter of 2010. This increased in operating expense is primarily due to the addition of Ocean Courage and Ocean Endeavor to Diamond’s fleet, as well as higher amortized mobilization expenses and higher operating costs from rigs exiting the US Gulf of Mexico to operate internationally, where the operating cost structure is generally higher.
HighMount reported second quarter net operating income of $5 million versus $29 in the prior year quarter. During the quarter, HighMount completed the sale of exploration and production assets located in the Antrim Shale of Michigan and the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama. HighMount’s remaining natural gas exploration and production operations are primarily located in the Permian Basin in Texas.
Compared to the second quarter of 2009, HighMount’s operating revenues decreased by $42 million to $105 million. The sale assets in Michigan and Alabama decreased revenues by $24 million, and the reduction in drilling activity in the Permian Basin, as well as lower average prices decreased revenues by $19.
Aside from discontinuing hedge accounting on derivative positions, no significant investment gains or losses were recognized from the sale of HighMount’s Antrim Shale or Black Warrior Basin assets. Because HighMount utilizes the full cost method of accounting, no gain or loss is recognized on the sale of reserved and sales proceeds reduce the capitalized cost pool.
During the quarter, HighMount’s aggregate production volumes for Permian Antrim and from the Black Warrior assets are as follows: Natural gas production of 15 billion cubic feet, at an average realize price of $5.19 per 1000 cubic feet. Natural gas liquids production of 738,000 barrels at an average realized price of $33.20 per barrel, and oil production of 68,000 barrels, at an average price of $71.08 per barrel.
HighMount’s production volumes for the Permian Basin are as follows: Natural gas production of 12.4 billion cubic feet, natural gas liquids production of just under 738,000 barrels, and oil production of 60,000 barrels. As of June 30, HighMount had hedges in place for approximately 79% of its estimated 2010 natural gas revealing production, at an equivalent price of $6.26 per mcfe and 60% of estimated 2011 production at an equivalent price of $6.32 per mcfe.
Regular pipelines contribution to net income for the quarter increased to $21 million from $8 million in the prior year second quarter. Versus the prior year second quarter, revenues increased by $55 million to $256 million, primarily due to pipeline expansion projects. These increases were partially offset by a $10 million decrease in interoperable and short-term firm transportation services, caused by the lower basis points between delivery points on Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline system.
Operating expenses in the quarter increased by $15 million to $165 million, primarily from an increase in natural gas prices and consumed fuel related to the pipeline expansion. In the second quarter, Loews Hotel’s net income increased to $4 million from $3 million in the prior year quarter. Revenue per available room increased to $152.82 from $139.21 in the second quarter of 2009. Occupancy for the quarter also increased to 73.6% from 69.8%.
As of June 30, holding company cash and investments totaled $3.4 billion. During the quarter, we received $200 million in dividends and interest from our subsidiaries who purchased 1.5 million shares or common stock for $56 and we paid $27 million of dividends to our shareholders.
Now, I’ll turn the call back over to Darren. Darren.

The decline that we had in ’08 and going into ‘09 came about, because of an over levered U.S. economy and as a result of the economy being over levered it is very difficult to get that bounce of the bottom that you would ordinarily expect from a recession. 
So, we are now growing probably over the last quarter, the second quarter I think came in at 2.4% and many analyst are now forecasting that going forward in the second half of the year, we could have growth of once in that amount because of the fiscal drag coming about from state, government as well as the way the stimulus money starts to add as well.
So, I am generally in am agreement. I think that the second half of the year, growth should probably be in a zero to 2% and I think going forward its going to be very difficult to get this economy cranking at a faster rate growth because of the continued high levels of debts. 
So, when we factor that into our forecast for individual companies, I just don’t understand how it bottoms up analysis of earnings that gets you to this enormous growth in [F&P] earnings is actually going to come to provision, and so when we think about acquisition, we think about it in the context of affordable economy as opposed to an economy that’s going to take off.

Its nice to receive the 10% dividend on that preferred, and it will be missed when the preferred is pied down, but remember once that preferred is paid down then depending upon a lot of factor, but CNA could be capable of paying a dividend to all its shareholders, and so Loews could receive cash flow from a CNA dividend on its commonly stock as opposed to dividend on its preferred stock. 
So, I heard the CNA call, I heard people worrying that the repayment of Loews preferred had to be mutually agreed by Loews and CNA and I’ll just remind everyone that CNA has already paid off $250 million of that preferred by mutual agreement of the two companies.

For the third quarter, Loews reported net income of $36 million versus $468 million in the prior year’s third quarter. The decline primarily reflects the $328 million after-tax charge related to CNA’s previously reported agreement to seed its legacy asbestos and pollution liabilities to a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway.
Additionally, all results reflect lowering net income from Diamond Offshore, which saw lower rig utilization rates due primarily to the Deepwater Horizon accident and its aftermath. Upon to a charge associated with the legacy asbestos and pollution liability loss portfolio transfer net operating income at CNA declined in large part as a result of decreased limited partnership income.
This was partially offset by favorable prior year reserve development of $93 million in CNAs property and casualty operations, which lowered the calendar year loss ratio by over six points. This was CNAs 15th consecutive quarter of favorable prior year reserve development, reflecting disciplined underwriting and reserving practices.
CNA’s investment portfolio continued to perform well, with its unrealized gain position improving by $1.2 billion from the end of the second quarter. Over the same period, CNA’s book value increased 6% to $42.76. But before you celebrate too much, I would caution that increases in interest rates and credit spread can negatively impact CNA’s unrealized gain position and book value per share.
During the third quarter, CNA completed a $500 million debt offering with proceeds going towards paying down the $1 billion of outstanding senior preferred stock held by Loews.
Additionally, CNA today announced that it intend to redeem out internally generated funds through remaining $500 million of preferred stock during the fourth quarter. The full redemption of $1.25 billion of preferred securities issued just two years ago reflects the strong financial position of CNA.
This morning, CNA also announced that it is proposed to acquire for $22 per share all of the outstanding shares of common stock of its 62% owned subsidiary CNA Surety Corporation that are currently not owned by CNA. This offer representing a 14% premium to the closing price on Friday provides CNA Surety’s minority shareholders the opportunity to monetize their investment at a substantial premium to the current and historical stock price.
For CNA, the transaction represents an investment in a business that it knows well, and at the proposed price is expected to be modestly accretive to earnings and have only a slight impact on its capital position. The transaction offers compelling benefit for the shareholders of both companies, and is consistent with CNA’s strategic objective to grow its specialty franchise.
Diamond Offshore’s third quarter results were negatively impacted by the U.S. Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium which has caused the contractual force majeure dispute with a customer related to the Ocean Monarch.
Aside from rigs being idle in Gulf, Diamond’s results for the quarter also reflect higher than normal rig downtime related to special surveys, shipyard maintenance, and acceptance testing as well as the mobilization of rigs out the U.S. Gulf.
Although, the moratorium has been lifted, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has issued drilling permits at remarkably slower pace than the before the moratorium. Drilling cannot commence unless companies obtain these permits and Diamond believes the permitting process will be slow for the foreseeable future, especially for new deepwater oil wells.
Fortunately for Diamond, it only has three marketed floating rigs remaining the U.S. Gulf and all of these rigs have had their blowout preventers independently certified in accordance with regulations and have had the certifications accepted by the BOEM. While the degree of uncertainty persist in the U.S. Gulf, international markets remain relatively stable supported by healthy oil prices.
Diamond’s Board of Directors recently declared regular and special dividends amounting to $0.875 per share payable in the fourth quarter which is the same amount that was paid in the prior quarter. These dividends represent over $60 million of cash to be received by Loews in the fourth quarter.
Boardwalk Pipeline’s third quarter results reflect higher revenues, mainly attributable to gas transportation and its major pipeline expansion projects. An important market dynamic is the base of spread between gallons received and delivery locations on Boardwalk’s pipeline systems. These spreads have narrowed adversely affecting the transportation rates that Boardwalk is able to charge on the spot market.
However, strong long-term demand for new pipeline capacity has created opportunities for expansion projects that yield high utilization rates from these new assets. One such expansion project, the Haynesville project was placed into service last month. Customers have contracted substantially all of the firm capacity on this project at a weighted average contract life of more than 12 years.
Another project, The Clarence Compression project has received FERC approval to proceed and is expected to be in service late next year. Customer contracts for this project have a weighted average life of approximately 11 years.
Last month Boardwalk received approval from The Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration to operate its Fayetteville Lateral at the higher operating pressure for which it is designed.
With this final approval from PHMSA in place, all of Boardwalk’s major pipeline expansion projects have now been approved to operate at their full design capacity. Boardwalk declared a quarterly distribution of $51.5 per unit continuing its track record of increasing cash distributions to unit holders each quarters since its initial public offering in ‘05. Limited and general partnered distributions represent approximately $66 million of cash to be received by Loews in the fourth quarter.
At HighMount Exploration & Production we’re pleased that the company has named Steve Hinchman as President and Chief Executive Officer. Steve possesses 30-years of experience in the E&P industry most recently as Chief Operating Officer of Callon Petroleum & Company and prior to that as Senior Vice President of worldwide productions for Marathon Oil Company. His leadership and experience will be of great value to HighMount’s ongoing success.
Finally, during the quarter we repurchased 2.3 million shares of Loews common stock at a total cost of $84 million or an average of about $36.50 per share. This brings the number of outstanding shares to $416.2 million as of September 30.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Pete Keegan, our Chief Financial Officer. Pete?

For the third quarter, Loews reported earnings of $0.09 per share versus $1.08 per share in the prior year quarter.
During the quarter book value for Loews common share increased 4% to $45.31, primarily as a result of the performance of CNAs investment portfolio.
In the quarter, investment gains at CNA were $37 million after-tax and non-controlling interest versus investment losses of $61 million in the prior year quarter. Improvement was driven by net transaction activity and lower other than temporary impairment losses as compared to the 2009 period.
CNA contributed a net loss of $140 million to Loews’s operating income for the quarter versus income of $304 million in the prior year quarter.
Results in CNAs core P&C operations improved, but offset primarily by the following items; a $309 million charge net of tax and non-controlling interest for the previously discussed loss portfolio transaction. Reduced limited partnership investment income, which was $68 million pre-tax versus $145 million in the prior year quarter.
In the third quarter of 2009 included a $55 million gain net of tax and non-controlling interest from a settlement that resolved litigation related to the placement of personal accident reinsurance. These items were partially offset by favorable prior year reserve development at $93 million pre-tax.
Diamond Offshore’s contribution to Loews’s net income for the quarter declined to $93 million from $170 million in the third quarter of 2009. Diamond’s total revenue decreased to $833 million from $919 million in the prior year quarter, while total expense increased to $535 million from $445 million.
The decrease in revenue was primarily related to lower day rates combined with an overall decrease in average utilization which was particularly affected by a decline in drilling activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Diamond’s revenue for the quarter includes a pre-tax gain of approximately $31 million related to the sale of a jack-up rig, Ocean Shield, on July 7, 2010. The rig was sold for a gross purchase price of $186 million.
HighMount reported third quarter net income of $19 million versus $40 million in the prior year quarter. The decline reflects the sale on the second quarter of 2010 of exploration and production assets located in Michigan and Alabama which represented approximately 17% of HighMount’s assets at year-end 2009.
HighMount’s operating revenues for the quarter decreased to $98 million from $144 million in the prior year period. Of the decline in revenues, $35 million is attributable to the sale of assets, and $11 million is due to lower realized sales prices and a reduction in drilling activity. HighMount’s third quarter production volumes are as follows.
Natural gas production was 12.4 billion cubic feet at an average realized price of $5.56 per thousand cubic feet. Natural gas liquids production was 759.3 thousand barrels at an average realized price of $35.81 per barrel, and oil production was 59.5 thousand barrels at an average price of $69.61 per barrel.
As of September 30, HighMount had hedges in place for approximately 82% of its estimated fourth quarter natural gas equivalent production at an equivalent price of $6.43 per Mcfe, and 68% of estimated 2011 production at an equivalent price of $6.31 per Mcfe.
Boardwalk Pipeline’s contribution to Loews’s net income for the quarter increased to $21 million from $9 million in the prior year third quarter. Revenues increased to $264 million from $206 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to additional gas transportation throughput on pipeline expansion projects.
Operating expenses in the quarter increased to $172 million from $155 million, primarily from an increase in natural gas prices and consumed fuel related to the pipeline expansion.
Loews Hotels reported a net loss of $2 million versus a loss of $15 million in the third quarter of 2009 which included impairment charges of $12 million after-tax related to two hotel properties. Revenue per available room increased to $143.90 from $128.27 in the third quarter of 2009. Occupancy also increased to 74.6% from 71.5% in the prior year third quarter.
As of September 30, holding company cash and investments totaled $4 billion. During the quarter, we received $500 million from the repayment senior preferred stock by CNA. We received $147 million in dividends and interest from its subsidiaries. We repurchased $84 million of common stock and we paid $26 million of dividends to our shareholders.
During the fourth quarter, we expect to receive $500 million from CNA upon redemption of the preferred stock that remains outstanding.
Now, I’ll turn the call back over to Darren.

So, we said it’s a time that we wanted to make sure that all of our subsidiaries were entirely covered in terms of their financial needs before we reduce our cash for anything else.

Number one, we still want to make sure that we have a more than enough liquidity at Loews to handle all of our needs, but also obviously with $4.5 billion potentially on our balance sheet by the end of the year that’s more than I could see us needing for any internal issues. So, we continue to look for opportunities to deploy that cash. But as I like to say all the time, we won’t let cash putting the hole in our pockets. So, we will be very patient, and we’ll not let the accumulation of the cash on the balance sheet put us in a position where we do a transaction that isn’t in the shareholders best interest.

That somewhat better is in between marginally better and a lot better. We’ve seen average room rates increase somewhat. We’ve seen pretty good occupancy and that has come about generally from the trendy traveler as opposed to the group traveler. We’re starting to see some signs of life again from the group travelers. If you remember, the group travel business was pretty much killed off in ‘08 as people in Washington were criticizing AIG and Citibank and others for having group meetings.
As I said, that’s now coming back, but it’s nowhere near where it was. And when we look at RevPAR which is the revenue per available room, we see that that it has improved versus it’s low but it is still about 20% below the levels that it achieved in ‘07. So there’s still plenty of room for improvement.

Many things that we see have traded at very significant prices, I think that’s because many of the private equity firms are hungry to invest what funds they have and so we see prices at relatively high level. That combined with the fact that the financing markets both the bank market as well as the high yield market have also improved rather significantly means that private equity firms can pay pretty higher prices combined with the fact that there really aren’t a lot of transactions that are taking place.

That is gas that has a significant amount of natural gas liquids in the mix. A number of the constituents of natural gas liquids trade off of oil prices as opposed to gas prices. So, by drilling for wet gas now, we’re able to achieve better economics than if you go simply for dry gas. But let me talk more on strategy of HighMount in the next quarter.

The other question I had actually was on the dividend. On the long-term investment because I have total confidence in your management, I would truly like to be getting a little bit more of a sort of income from your stock, so if it I could indeed hold it forever and never have to sell it.

We have equity securities representing between 10% and 15% of the $4 billion that Loews has on its balance sheet. And then we also have an investment in limited partnerships which are fairly liquid, but also represent another 10% to 15% of the portfolio.
And then be on that we have the standard of one of securities, many of which close to zero, repos and other short-term investments, and then just some modest fixed term investments. This quarter the increase that you saw in investment income at the Loews level was due primarily to the change in market value of that portfolio of equity securities as well as the limited partnership investments.
In terms of dividends, that’s an issue that obviously is entirely up to the Board of Directors. As you know historically Loews has not been a company that pays out a high percentage of net income in the form of dividend. Instead, we’ve used the cash in order to; number one, we purchase our shares and number two, make acquisitions.
And just to remind you of our long and glorious history of share repurchases, today we have outstanding about one-third of the number of shares that were outstanding in 1970. And it is my belief that the significant outperformance of Loews versus the S&P 500 over those years was due significantly to the share repurchases that took place over that time period. So that’s all a long way of saying it’s in our DNA to use the Loews cash very selectively in order to increase asset value.
And in my mind whether the company pays a higher dividend or a lower dividend, the value will be reflected in the shares of a stock. So to the extent that you want the company to pay a higher dividend and it’s not paying it, then by selling off 1% or 2% of your shares every year, you should be able to achieve the same economics as if the company had paid a higher dividend.
