Now let's review our fourth quarter results.  Fourth quarter revenues were $737 million.  This is a decline of 26% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and a sequential increase of 2% from the third quarter of 2009.  Income per share was $0.09 compared with $0.25 for the fourth quarter of 2008 and $0.06 for the third quarter of 2009.
Cash flow from operations was $48 million during the fourth quarter.  We invested $10 million in capital expenditures during the quarter and paid a quarterly cash dividend to stockholders of $0.12 per share for a total of $18 million.  We also repurchased 2 million RHI shares during the fourth quarter at a cost of $48 million.  There are approximately 5.1 million shares still available for repurchase under our board approved stock repurchase plan.  
We were encouraged to see broad based improving demand for our professional staffing services during the fourth quarter.  Each of our staffing divisions reported sequential revenue growth as did productivity on a same day basis.  
Keith will now provide you with a more detailed look at our fourth quarter financial results.  We'll leave time for your questions after our prepared remarks.

Fourth quarter revenues were $737 million down 26% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 2% sequentially.  On a constant currency basis these rates were down 28% year over year and up 1% sequentially.  There were 62 billing days in the fourth quarter, the same number of billing days as the fourth quarter of 2008.  In the third quarter of 2009 there were 64 billing days.
Accountemps fourth quarter revenues were $288 million.  This is a 23% decline from one year ago and a 4% increase sequentially on a same-day basis.  Accountemps is our largest staffing division and accounts for 39% of company revenues.  There are 366 Accountemps locations worldwide.
Fourth quarter revenues for OfficeTeam were $142 million down 21% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 9% sequentially on a same-day basis.  OfficeTeam is our high-end administrative staffing division and it represents 19% of company revenues and has 324 locations worldwide.
Fourth quarter revenues for Robert Half management resources were $91 million.  This is a 33% decline from the fourth quarter of 2008 and a 4% increase sequentially on a same-day basis.  This division places senior level accounting and finance professionals on a project basis.  It has 148 locations worldwide and makes up 12% of company revenues.
Fourth quarter revenues for Robert Half Technology were $76 million, down 25% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 6% sequentially on a same-day basis.  Robert Half Technology places information technology professionals on a consulting and full-time basis.  It operates in 110 locations worldwide and accounts for 10% of company revenues.  Our permanent placement division Robert Half Finance and Accounting had revenues of $45 million in the fourth quarter.  This is a decline of 40% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and an increase of 10% on a same-day sequential basis.  This business was established in 1948 and operates in 366 locations worldwide.  It accounts for 6% of company-wide revenues.
Fourth quarter revenues for our international staffing operations were $190 million, down 21% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 8% sequentially on a same-day basis.  On a constant currency basis revenues for international staffing operations were down 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 and up1% sequentially.  We have staffing operations at 108 locations in 20 counties outside the United States.  International staffing operations represent 30% of total staffing revenues.  
Fourth quarter revenues for Protiviti were $96 million down 23% from one year ago and up 5% sequentially on a same-day basis.  Formed in 2002, Protiviti is a global business consulting and internal audit firm providing risk, advisory, and transaction services.  It has 62 locations in 17 countries and accounts for 13% of total RHI revenues.  Protiviti's international operations represent 30% of Protiviti revenues.
Turning to gross margin, fourth quarter gross margin and our temporary and consulting staffing operations was $206 million or 34.5% of applicable revenues.  This compares with 37% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008 and 33.5% of revenues for the third quarter of 2009.  The fourth quarter sequential increase is primarily the result of lower workers compensation accruals which were adjusted pursuant to an independent actuarial review.  Overall staffing gross margin was $251 million for the fourth quarter or 39.1% of staffing revenues.  This compares to 42.5% of revenues in Q4 2008 and 38.1% of revenues in Q3 2009. Overall staffing gross margin increased on a sequential basis due to a slightly higher mix of permanent placement revenues and the higher temporary and consulting margins just noted.
Fourth quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $27 million or 28.7% of Protiviti revenues.  This compares to 27.6% of Protiviti revenues in the fourth quarter of last year and 27.8% of revenues in the third quarter of 2009.  Gross margins improved as staffing utilization rates continued to increase.
Protiviti's direct costs for the quarter were down $22 million versus one year ago and were down $2 million sequentially, 24 and 2% respectively.  Staffing SG&A costs for the quarter were $229 or 35.7% of staffing revenues.  This compares to $302 million or 34.9% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008 and $223 million or 35.4% of revenues for the third quarter of 2009.
Staffing SG&A costs for the quarter were down $73 million versus one year ago and up $6 million sequentially or down 24% and up 3% respectively. This sequential increase is due primarily to higher field compensation cost including additional incentive pay related to higher sequential revenues as well as discretionary field employee retention payments.
We ended the year with 7,500 full-time employees in our staffing divisions down 27% from last year.  Fourth quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were $27 million or 28.4% of revenues.  This compares to $33 million or 26.4% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008 and $26 million or 26.8% of revenues for the third quarter of 2009. Protiviti SG&A costs for the quarter were $6 million lower than one year ago and $1 million higher than last quarter.  We ended the year with 2,500 full-time Protiviti employees and contractors, down 19% from last year.
Operating income from our staffing divisions was $22 million during the fourth quarter or 3.5% of staffing revenues.  Temporary and consulting divisions contributed $22 million of this amount of 3.7% of applicable revenues.  Fourth quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was break even.  Operating income for Protiviti was $300,000 in the fourth quarter of 0.3% of Protiviti revenues.  Protiviti's engagement demand was particularly strong in IT security, e-discovery, and credit-risk assessments.
At the end of the fourth quarter our accounts receivable were $362 million with implied days outstanding or DSO or 44.7 days.  This compares to 44.6 days at the end of the fourth quarter a year ago.
Now let's turn to guidance.  Following a few of the trends we observed in our business during the fourth quarter and the first weeks of January 2010, on a same day sequential basis revenues from our temporary and consulting divisions increased every month during the fourth quarter.  Within our permanent placement operations on a same-day basis, revenues increased in October, increased in November, and were flat in December.
During the first two weeks of January revenues from our temporary and consulting businesses were down 15% compared to the same period last year.  For the first three weeks of January revenues from our permanent placement division were down 21% compared to the same period last year.
As we've discussed before it's very difficult to evaluate particularly important placement trends over such short periods of time. Taking into account these trends and the uncertain economy we offer the following first-quarter guidance; revenues $725-$775 million. Note that this range is $50 million higher than the guidance we gave last quarter.  Income per share, $0.03-$0.08. As you know we limit our guidance to one quarter.  The estimates we provided on the call are subject to the risk mentioned in today's press release.  Now I'll turn the call back over to Max.

As we noted earlier we were pleased to see the improving demand for our professional staffing services during the quarter.  Globally it appears that many of the G20 countries may be emerging from the recession. While the US unemployment rate remains high, initial jobless claims for the most part have been declining since the end of August.  We hope this is a precursor to a turnaround in the labor markets overall.
  As most of you know much of our client base is made up of small and midsized businesses.  We've seen a lot written about limited access to credit for this business segment so we were encouraged to read in the most recent survey from the National Federation of Independent Business that only 8% of small business owners reported that their borrowing needs were not being satisfied.  This is down two points from the November report.  We also were encouraged to see that only 4% reported that financing is their chief business challenge.
  As the economy recovers we want to continue to be a resource for our clients as they rebuild their teams.  Many companies made deep cutbacks in personnel during this recession, so deep that we believe many are going to need staffing services at the first sign of a pickup in their business.  We believe Protiviti also will continue to be a valuable resource for clients.  Protiviti has been building a loyal client base and our teams are extremely well regarded for their expertise.
We've talked before about the global business trends we feel will benefit both Protiviti and our staffing operation.  This includes regulatory efforts in the wake of the financial crisis.  We also continue to believe the impending retirement of baby boomers from the workforce over the next several years may result in staffing shortages that could increase the need for staffing and recruitment services, but perhaps most important we feel this recession has changed the way many companies now look at their businesses and how they staff those businesses.
Many of our clients discovered that employing temporary professionals offers them the flexibility to staff up or down as business needs dictate, which for some firms has been a way to avoid the cycle of over hiring followed by layoffs.  It's certainly not a new concept, but the value of this approach was borne out during this very difficult and lengthy recession.
  The end of a year is obviously a time to reflect on where we've been in the past 12-18 months.  This has been the worst general economic environment in our company's 60 year history yet even in this environment we find ourselves well positioned.  We had positive operating cash flow of $240 million in 2009 which funded approximately $110 million in RHI stock repurchases, $41 million in capital expenditures, and the payment of $72 million in dividends to stockholders.  We have raised our cash dividend every year since we initiated one in 2004.
Our accounts receivable collection period remained virtually unchanged during the year which contributed to our cash flow. We ended the year with $366 million in cash and cash equivalents and virtually no debt.  Our longstanding conservative financial policies proved particularly beneficial during the past year's difficult economic environment.
This has left us with the financial resources to expand as the economy improves.  We aggressively managed our operating costs in 2009 by reducing SG&A expenses by $460 million or 31%.  This was accomplished while keeping more than 98% of our office network intact which we believe positions us well for the future.  We also retained all key executives and field personnel even in a difficult economy which we believe is important to our future success.  
At this time Keith and I will be happy to answer questions.  We would ask that you please limit yourself as usual to one question and a single followup as needed.  If you have additional questions we'll certainly try to return to you later in the call.  Thank you.

On the staffing side the low-end of our guidance we hope is conservative and assumes some slight sequential declines.  At the high end of our guidance it assumes the continuation of the growth rates in the fourth quarter we just reported.  The first quarter and staffing traditionally is a little bit weak for OfficeTeam, management resources, and technology — the latter two where it's a little tougher to get projects started after the new year.  On the other hand, the first quarter traditionally is a little better quarter seasonally for Accountemps so all of those things were considered in setting that range.
For Protiviti in the first quarter it's always seasonally their weakest quarter.  We've been down anywhere from 10%-20% sequentially in the first quarter in Protiviti as clients focus on getting their Ks and Qs out rather than internal audit. So our Protiviti first quarter forecast does assume a sequential decline.  At the low end it's low double digits, at the high end it's down low single digits.
At the gross margin line we noted that the fourth quarter benefited from a workers' comp adjustment.  That adjustment was about $5 million so that will not continue into the first quarter.  In addition there will be new higher state unemployment rates for 2010 which we expect to be between 1-1.25 percentage points based on the estimates we've gotten from our advisors.  So the absence of the workers comp credit plus the arriving to the scene the higher state unemployment rates, probably says you're going to see somewhere between 125-150 basis points lower gross margins sequentially relative to the fourth quarter just reported.
At the SG&A line we did add a little bit of headcount during the fourth quarter.  We had some of our smaller offices that we felt had gotten too small as to their staff count so we added to that a little bit and we expect in the first quarter to add small numbers of staff as well, nothing significant, but a little bit.
When you look at the operating income line from a staffing standpoint at the low forecast number it's obviously down based on less revenues.  At the high level, on the one hand it reflects pretty high incremental margins for the revenue growth there, and remember we had 25% incremental margins in temp and 35% incremental margins in perm as we came out of the last downturn.  On the other hand, offsetting that would be the absence of the workers comp credit and the new state unemployment cost which will be higher. 
For Protiviti in the first quarter because you're going to have some seasonally lower revenues, Protiviti will lose a little money, but we are expected to snap back to profitability in the second quarter and traditionally the second quarter does increase nicely from the first quarter.
From a tax rate standpoint I would also note in the quarter just reported we had about a $1 million credit from a favorable settlement of an audit with Canada.  We would not expect to see that continue to so the tax rate, whereas it was only around 40 or so in the fourth quarter, we would expect it to be between 42 and 45 in the first quarter.
I guess when you step back and look at the fourth quarter there's about three pennies of noise I'll call it, from the workers comp credit and the tax adjustment, the income tax adjustment.  So adjusted for that three pennies of positive noise your real base for going into the first quarter is six pennies on the bottom line, not nine pennies and that might be more than you wanted to hear, but that's kind of a tour of the P&L.

And then traditionally coming out of a downturn OfficeTeam leads followed by accounting and tech and lagged by perm.  Well, clearly this quarter it was much different than that and essentially everything improved in the same quarter and if you talk to our people what's probably the most different is whereas traditionally the admin side gets cut more by clients and therefore gets cut first by clients and is also the first back, in this downturn clients seem to cut indiscriminately across the board and because they had cut deeply across the board we see strength across the board in the early parts of this cycle.

It in fact was more profitable than temp staffing or perm staffing for the quarter.  It did extremely well.  Protiviti non-US, while light years better than it was earlier in the year, it's still underwater and offset the profitability of the US. We will continue to focus on and work on the profitability of Protiviti non-US in 2010.  As I said, 2010 seasonally the first quarter is always Protiviti's weakest quarter.  Clients focus on Ks and Qs, they don't focus on internal audit. Therefore there will be a revenue dip, Protiviti will lose money in the first quarter. We fully expect that to turnaround in the second quarter and in the background we also fully expect to continue to make progress outside the United States. 
From a nature of services standpoint their internal audit co sourcing and outsourcing renewals are very strong.  They've diversified their revenue sources significantly away from stocks relative to two or three years ago. We called out IT security, we called out e-discovery, we called out credit-risk assessment.  They've done a wonderful job of diversifying their revenue sources over the last 24 months.

Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to make customary comments on the call to the effect that this call contains predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. These statements represent our current judgment of what the future holds, they include words such as forecast, estimate, project, expect, believe, guidance, and similar expressions. While we believe these remarks to be reasonable, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We've described some of these risks and uncertainties in the press release issued today and in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update the statements made in this conference call.
Now let's review the first quarter results. Revenues for the first quarter were $737 million, down 10% from the first quarter of last year. Income per share for the quarter was $0.05, down 7% from the first quarter of 2009. Cash flow from operations was $15 million during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $8 million. 
In January, we raised our quarterly cash dividend to $0.13. Our total dividend paid to stockholders was $20 million during the first quarter. We are beginning to see improvement in the demand for our professional staffing services as a result of better economic conditions in North America and abroad.
First quarter revenues for our staffing operations were up 2% on a constant currency basis from the results we reported for the fourth quarter. Our permanent placement operations performed particularly well during the quarter, growing 9% on a constant currency basis versus the fourth quarter of 2009. We believe this relates directly to the depth and the severity of personal cuts made during the recession. Many businesses have had to hire the first sign of a pickup in demand as well as immediately replace workers lost due to turnover. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Keith for more detailed review of our first quarter financial results."

There were 62 billing days in the first quarter, the same as the first quarter of 2009 and the same as last quarter. 
Revenues for Accountemps were $289 million in the first quarter. This is down 12% from a year ago and flat sequentially. Accountemps as our largest Staffing division accounts for 39% of company revenues. There are 360 Accountemps locations worldwide. 
OfficeTeam had revenues of $141 million in the first quarter. This is down 3% from the first quarter of 2009 and also flat sequentially. OfficeTeam is our Administrative Staffing division. It represents 19% of company revenues and [Audio Gap] locations worldwide. 
First quarter revenues for Robert Half Management Resources were $93 million. This is an 18% decline from one year ago and a 3% increase sequentially. This division places senior-level accounting and finance professionals on a project basis. It has 149 locations worldwide and makes up 13% of company revenues.
Robert Half Technology had first quarter revenues of $75 million, down 10% from the first quarter of 2009, and down 1% sequentially. Robert Half Technology places information technology professionals on a consulting and full-time basis. It operates 112 locations worldwide and accounts for 10% of company revenues.

On a constant currency basis, revenues for our international staffing operations were down 16% compared to the first quarter of last year, but up 4% sequentially. We have staffing operations in 103 locations in 20 countries outside the U.S. International staffing operations represent 29% of total staffing revenues.
First quarter revenues for Protiviti were $90 million, 11% lower than one year ago and 6% lower than last quarter. Formed in 2002, Protiviti is a global business consulting and internal audit firm, providing risk advisory and transaction services. It has 61 locations in 17 countries and accounts for 12% of total RHI revenues. Protiviti's international operations represent 29% of total Protiviti revenues.
Turning to gross margin. First quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was $201 million or 33.6% of applicable revenues. This compares with 34.7% of revenues for the first quarter of 2009 and 34.5% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009. The first quarter sequential decline is the result of higher state unemployment insurance cost and the absence of prior-quarter workers' compensation credits. This was partially offset by higher temp-to-hire conversion fees. 
Overall, staffing gross margin was $250 million for the first quarter or 38.6% of staffing revenues. This includes the gross margin from our temporary and consulting operations, as well as our Permanent Placement divisions, which grew from 7.1% to 7.5% of staffing revenues during the quarter.
First quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $18 million or 20.6% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to 10.4% of revenues in Q1 2009 and 28.7% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2009. Gross margins declined from the fourth quarter largely due to seasonal factors. These included lower revenues and lower payroll credits for less time charged the vacation and holiday accruals. Protiviti's direct costs for the quarter were down $19 million versus a year ago and up $3 million sequentially or 21% and 5%, respectively.
Turning to selling, general and administrative costs. Staffing SG&A costs for the quarter were $230 million or 35.5% of staffing revenues. This compares to $247 million, a 34.3% of revenues for the first quarter of 2009, and $229 million or 35.7% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009. Staffing SG&A costs for the quarter were down $17 million versus one year ago, and up $1 million sequentially or 7% and 0%, respectively. First quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were $26 million or 29% of revenues. This compares to $30 million or 29.2% of revenues for the first quarter of 2009 and compares to $27 million or 28.4% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009. Protiviti SG&A costs for the quarter were $4 million lower than one year ago and $1 million lower than last quarter.
Operating income in the first quarter from our Staffing divisions was $20 million or 3.1% of staffing revenues. The Temporary and Consulting divisions contributed 17 of this amount or 2.8% of applicable revenues. First quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement division was $3 million or 6.4% of applicable revenues. The operating loss for Protiviti was $7.6 million in the first quarter or 8.5% of revenues. 
Protiviti is engaged with demand during the quarter, was strong in IT security, IT application controls, merger, integrations and restructurings. Accounts receivables were $373 million at the end of the fourth quarter, with implied days outstanding or DSO of 46.1 days compared to 45.5 days at the end of the first quarter one year ago.
Now let's turn to guidance. Here are the trends we observed in our business during the first quarter and the first weeks of April. On a same-day sequential basis, revenue from our Temporary and Consulting divisions decreased in January, decreased in February and increased in March. Revenues for our Permanent Placement operations decreased in January, increased in February and increased again in March. 
During the first three weeks of April, revenues from our Temporary and Consulting businesses were down 3% compared to the same period last year. For the first three weeks of April, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 28% compared to the same period last year. 
As we've said before, it's difficult to gauge perm trends over such short periods of time. Taking into account these trends and the improving but still uncertain economy, we offer the following second quarter guidance: Revenues, $730 million to $780 million; income per share, $0.03 to $0.08. As you know, we limit our guidance to one quarter. The estimates we provided on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. 
I'll turn it back to Max."

While the quarter started slowly, we picked up momentum as the quarter progressed. Unemployment levels remained fairly high in the United States and to some of our other geographies, but we have started to see renewed staffing demand. 
As we noted earlier on the call, we were particularly pleased with the performance of our Robert Half Finance & Accounting, Permanent Placement division. Many companies that made deep personnel cuts during the recession are having to quickly hire as business demand grows or when they lose workers through turnover. 
We are optimistic about our business prospects as the economy continues to gain momentum. As we have discussed on prior calls, we've kept our domestic and international office networks largely intact. We've retained our best people. We are supporting our strong brand names through marketing activities. And we've invested in technology to further increase productivity in our field operations. 
Protiviti has diversified its revenue base by strengthening its client relationships and expanding its service offerings in areas such as IT, security, IT applications controls, business continuity and infrastructure management. We are also encouraged by the joint opportunities we are seeing as a result of collaboration between Protiviti and our Staffing divisions. We do believe that one effect of this recession has been the wider adoption by companies of flexible staffing models. In a difficult economy, the benefit of having variable labor costs becomes very clear. For the small and mid-sized businesses that make up the largest percentage of our client base, this type of staffing flexibility can be inviable. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to respond to questions. We ask that you please limit yourself as usual to one question and a single follow-up as needed. If you have additional questions, we'll certainly try to return to you later in the call."

You note that our sequential change in temp gross margins was down 75 basis points. That effectively is a combination of 100 basis point decline due to unemployment plus the absence of the workers comp credit we got during the fourth quarter. And we got a 25 basis point pickup in conversions. Now going forward, the conservative thing to do was to model flattish gross margins for the next quarter or so. On the one hand, we do expect to continue to make more progress passing through unemployment. That said, the conversions can be volatile. And therefore, to be conservative, I wouldn't necessarily assume we'll see that kind of bump in conversions, although it's quite possible."

That, sometime in the future, we believe much could change before then. There is a staffing industry, a lobbying group, that is very active and planning to get more active as we speak because the bill that was drafted doesn't fit very well into the type of employees we have, i.e., temporary employees. Further, given how it's currently drafted, it's very hard to estimate what the cost is going to be because all of the following have to be met before we have to pay the excise tax. First, our temporaries have to average 30 hours per week for a given month. Second, they actually have to enroll in state insurance exchanges. And finally, they have to have their income below certain thresholds. All of which have to be present before we're obligated to pay the excise tax. I think the biggest uncertainty is what portion of our temporaries will opt into the state exchanges versus what portion will opt to pay the personal penalty. Understand that at least initially, that personal penalty is only 1% of your income, and further understand that because you can't be excluded due to preexisting conditions, you effectively can wait until you get sick to sign up. Many pundits believe that for those reasons, many will in fact opt for the personal penalty, which would totally alleviate our costs on their behalf. The point being, it's really or there's absolutely no way to guesstimate how many will opt for the exchanges versus opt to pay the penalty. And furthermore, because there's another three years until it becomes effective, trust me, there's going to be plenty of attempts to change and make this bill more appropriate for firms such as ourselves."

But clearly, an improvement over what was just reported. As we said in our remarks, the first quarter is Protiviti's seasonally slowest quarter. And that played out again, and it not only impacts revenues, but because you charge less of your payroll to vacation and holiday accruals, your payroll cost that you report in your P&L actually increased as well."

And that's been on the downside, so I'm not so sure on the upside, it should act that differently either."

Now let's review the first quarter results. Revenues for the first quarter were $737 million, down 10% from the first quarter of last year. Income per share for the quarter was $0.05, down 7% from the first quarter of 2009. Cash flow from operations was $15 million during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $8 million. 
In January, we raised our quarterly cash dividend to $0.13. Our total dividend paid to stockholders was $20 million during the first quarter. We are beginning to see improvement in the demand for our professional staffing services as a result of better economic conditions in North America and abroad.
First quarter revenues for our staffing operations were up 2% on a constant currency basis from the results we reported for the fourth quarter. Our permanent placement operations performed particularly well during the quarter, growing 9% on a constant currency basis versus the fourth quarter of 2009. We believe this relates directly to the depth and the severity of personal cuts made during the recession. Many businesses have had to hire the first sign of a pickup in demand as well as immediately replace workers lost due to turnover. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Keith for more detailed review of our first quarter financial results."

Turning to gross margin. First quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was $201 million or 33.6% of applicable revenues. This compares with 34.7% of revenues for the first quarter of 2009 and 34.5% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2009. The first quarter sequential decline is the result of higher state unemployment insurance cost and the absence of prior-quarter workers' compensation credits. This was partially offset by higher temp-to-hire conversion fees. 
Overall, staffing gross margin was $250 million for the first quarter or 38.6% of staffing revenues. This includes the gross margin from our temporary and consulting operations, as well as our Permanent Placement divisions, which grew from 7.1% to 7.5% of staffing revenues during the quarter.

Gross margins declined from the fourth quarter largely due to seasonal factors. These included lower revenues and lower payroll credits for less time charged the vacation and holiday accruals. Protiviti's direct costs for the quarter were down $19 million versus a year ago and up $3 million sequentially or 21% and 5%, respectively.
Turning to selling, general and administrative costs. Staffing SG&A costs for the quarter were $230 million or 35.5% of staffing revenues.

First quarter operating income for our Permanent Placement division was $3 million or 6.4% of applicable revenues. The operating loss for Protiviti was $7.6 million in the first quarter or 8.5% of revenues. 
Protiviti is engaged with demand during the quarter, was strong in IT security, IT application controls, merger, integrations and restructurings. Accounts receivables were $373 million at the end of the fourth quarter, with implied days outstanding or DSO of 46.1 days compared to 45.5 days at the end of the first quarter one year ago.
Now let's turn to guidance. Here are the trends we observed in our business during the first quarter and the first weeks of April. On a same-day sequential basis, revenue from our Temporary and Consulting divisions decreased in January, decreased in February and increased in March. Revenues for our Permanent Placement operations decreased in January, increased in February and increased again in March. 
During the first three weeks of April, revenues from our Temporary and Consulting businesses were down 3% compared to the same period last year. For the first three weeks of April, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 28% compared to the same period last year. 
As we've said before, it's difficult to gauge perm trends over such short periods of time. Taking into account these trends and the improving but still uncertain economy, we offer the following second quarter guidance: Revenues, $730 million to $780 million; income per share, $0.03 to $0.08. As you know, we limit our guidance to one quarter. The estimates we provided on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release. 
I'll turn it back to Max."

While the quarter started slowly, we picked up momentum as the quarter progressed. Unemployment levels remained fairly high in the United States and to some of our other geographies, but we have started to see renewed staffing demand. 
As we noted earlier on the call, we were particularly pleased with the performance of our Robert Half Finance & Accounting, Permanent Placement division. Many companies that made deep personnel cuts during the recession are having to quickly hire as business demand grows or when they lose workers through turnover. 
We are optimistic about our business prospects as the economy continues to gain momentum. As we have discussed on prior calls, we've kept our domestic and international office networks largely intact. We've retained our best people. We are supporting our strong brand names through marketing activities. And we've invested in technology to further increase productivity in our field operations. 
Protiviti has diversified its revenue base by strengthening its client relationships and expanding its service offerings in areas such as IT, security, IT applications controls, business continuity and infrastructure management. We are also encouraged by the joint opportunities we are seeing as a result of collaboration between Protiviti and our Staffing divisions. We do believe that one effect of this recession has been the wider adoption by companies of flexible staffing models. In a difficult economy, the benefit of having variable labor costs becomes very clear. For the small and mid-sized businesses that make up the largest percentage of our client base, this type of staffing flexibility can be inviable. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to respond to questions. We ask that you please limit yourself as usual to one question and a single follow-up as needed. If you have additional questions, we'll certainly try to return to you later in the call."

You note that our sequential change in temp gross margins was down 75 basis points. That effectively is a combination of 100 basis point decline due to unemployment plus the absence of the workers comp credit we got during the fourth quarter. And we got a 25 basis point pickup in conversions. Now going forward, the conservative thing to do was to model flattish gross margins for the next quarter or so. On the one hand, we do expect to continue to make more progress passing through unemployment. That said, the conversions can be volatile. And therefore, to be conservative, I wouldn't necessarily assume we'll see that kind of bump in conversions, although it's quite possible."

That, sometime in the future, we believe much could change before then. There is a staffing industry, a lobbying group, that is very active and planning to get more active as we speak because the bill that was drafted doesn't fit very well into the type of employees we have, i.e., temporary employees. Further, given how it's currently drafted, it's very hard to estimate what the cost is going to be because all of the following have to be met before we have to pay the excise tax. First, our temporaries have to average 30 hours per week for a given month. Second, they actually have to enroll in state insurance exchanges. And finally, they have to have their income below certain thresholds. All of which have to be present before we're obligated to pay the excise tax. I think the biggest uncertainty is what portion of our temporaries will opt into the state exchanges versus what portion will opt to pay the personal penalty. Understand that at least initially, that personal penalty is only 1% of your income, and further understand that because you can't be excluded due to preexisting conditions, you effectively can wait until you get sick to sign up. Many pundits believe that for those reasons, many will in fact opt for the personal penalty, which would totally alleviate our costs on their behalf. The point being, it's really or there's absolutely no way to guesstimate how many will opt for the exchanges versus opt to pay the penalty. And furthermore, because there's another three years until it becomes effective, trust me, there's going to be plenty of attempts to change and make this bill more appropriate for firms such as ourselves."

Even Internal Audit budgets have been under pressure because in companies' quest to save cost, they've also reduced their internal audit budgets. I think those begin to come back. We're getting more and more traction with joint staffing and Protiviti engagements, many times staffing introduces Protiviti. The Protiviti provides the project management skills, staffing provides the arms and legs. We've had some very nice wins of nice seven-figure projects, where we've gone to market together. So there are a lot of small incremental wins that collectively add up. We've done well in eDiscovery. We've done well in our restructuring operations. We're bullish about the Protiviti future. We've tried very hard to keep the resource base intact as best we can. Clearly, we could take it lower now and get better short-term results from that.

While we believe these remarks to be reasonable, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.

Our comments today should be considered in light of this press release and the SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update the statements made on this conference call.
Now let's review our second quarter financial results. Second quarter revenues were $769 million, up 3% from the second quarter of last year. On a sequential basis, revenues were up 4% from the first quarter. Income per share for the second quarter was $0.08, up 147% from the $0.03 reported this time last year and up 54% from the $0.05 reported in the first quarter of this year.
Cash flow from operations was $35 million during the second quarter. Capital expenditures were $6 million. During the second quarter, we paid a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.13 per share for a total of $19 million. We also repurchased 2.5 million shares of RHI common stock during the second quarter at a total cost of $66 million. There remain approximately 2.6 million shares available for repurchase under our Board approved stock repurchase plan.
Keith will provide a more detailed review of our second quarter financial results, but I did want to note that we were pleased to see year-over-year and sequential revenue growth during the quarter. We believe this is indicative of improving labor markets in our various geographies. Our OfficeTeam and Robert Half Technology staffing divisions performed particularly well, as did our permanent placement operations. Second quarter revenues for our Robert Half Finance & Accounting permanent placement division were up 29% from one year ago and up 15% sequentially.
Now I will turn the call over to Keith for a closer look at our results.

To recap, second quarter revenues were $769 million, up 3% from the second quarter of last year and up 4% sequentially from the first quarter of this year. On a constant currency basis, the year-over-year and sequential growth rates were 2% and 6% respectively. There were 63 billing days in the second quarter, the same as the second quarter of 2009 and up one day from last quarter. There are 64 billing days in the current third quarter.
Second quarter revenues for Accountemps were $295 million. This is down 5% from a year ago and is flat sequentially on a same day basis. Accountemps is our largest staffing division and accounts for 38% of company revenues. There are 357 Accountemps locations worldwide.
OfficeTeam had second quarter revenues of $150 million, which is up 11% from the second quarter of last year and up 5% sequentially on a same day basis. OfficeTeam is our high end administrative staffing division and represents 20% of company revenues. There are 322 OfficeTeam locations worldwide.
Robert Half Management Resources revenues were $93 billion in the second quarter. This is down 1% from a year ago and down 1% sequentially on a same day basis. Robert Half Management Resources places senior level accounting and finance professionals on a project basis. It has 151 locations worldwide and makes up 12% of company revenues.
Robert Half Technology had second quarter revenues of $82 million, up 9% from the second quarter of last year and up 7% sequentially on a same day basis. Robert Half Technology places information technology professionals on a consulting and full-time basis. It operates in 117 locations worldwide and accounts for 11% of company revenues.
Our permanent placement division, Robert Half Finance & Accounting, had revenues of $56 million in the second quarter. This is up 29% from the second quarter of 2009 and is up 15% sequentially. This business was established in 1948 and it operates in 357 locations worldwide. It accounts for 7% of companywide revenues.
International staffing operations had revenues of $189 million during the second quarter, up 3% from the second quarter of 2009 and down 1% sequentially. On a constant currency basis, revenues for international operations were up 3% compared to the second quarter of last year and up 3% sequentially. We have staffing operations in 101 locations in 20 countries outside of the US. International staffing operations represent 28% of total staffing revenues.
Protiviti revenues were $93 million during the second quarter, up 3% from one year ago and up 6% from last quarter on a same day basis. Formed in 2002, Protiviti is a global business consulting and internal audit firm providing risk, advisory and transaction services. It has 61 locations in 17 countries and accounts for 12% of total RHI revenues. Protiviti’s international operations also represent 28% of total Protiviti revenues.
Now let’s turn to gross margins. Second quarter gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was $111 million or 34.1% of applicable revenues. This compares with 33.6% of revenues for the first quarter of this year. Second quarter improvement is the result of higher pay bill spreads, higher conversion fees, and workers’ comp accrual adjustment credits of $1.3 million.
Overall staffing gross margin during the second quarter was $268 million or 39.6% of staffing revenues. This compares to 38.6% of revenues for the first quarter of this year. This increase is a result of higher gross margins from our temporary and consulting operations as well as higher permanent placement revenues, which grew from 7.5% to 8.3% of staffing revenues during the quarter.
Second quarter gross margin for Protiviti was $22 million or 24% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to 20.6% of its revenues in the first quarter of this year. The improvement is due primarily to higher chargeability. Protiviti’s direct costs for the quarter were down $4 million versus a year ago and down another $1 million sequentially.
Second quarter staffing SG&A costs were $238 million or 35.3% of staffing revenues. This compares to $227 million or 34.4% of revenues for the second quarter of last year and $230 million or 35.5% of revenues for the first quarter of this year. Second quarter staffing SG&A costs include special charges of $2.6 million related to the settlement of several outstanding litigation claims primarily related to wage and hour labor loss. These cases have been outstanding for many years.
While the company believes - continues to believe it has meritorious defenses, these cases were settled primarily to avoid potentially significant additional cost that would result from protracted litigation. Second quarter SG&A costs for Protiviti were $29 million or 31.2% of revenues. This compares to $28 million or 31.2% of revenues for the second quarter of last year and $26 million or 29% of revenues for the first quarter of this year.
Protiviti SG&A costs also include special charges of $2.4 million to settle outstanding litigation claims, primarily related to wage and hour labor loss. This case covered an eight-plus year period dating back to 2002. While the company continues to believe it has meritorious defenses, these cases were also settled primarily to avoid future litigation costs.
Now turning to operating income. Operating income from our staffing divisions during the second quarter was $29 million or 4.3% of staffing revenues. Temporary and consulting divisions contributed $24 million of this amount or 3.8% of revenues. Quarter operating for our permanent placement division was $5 million or 9.9% of applicable revenues.
The operating loss for Protiviti was $6.8 million in the second quarter or 7.3% of revenues. Excluding the special charges just referenced, Protiviti’s second quarter loss was $4.4 million, an improvement of $3.2 million from the first quarter of this year. Much of this improvement occurred in Protiviti’s international operations. Accounts receivable were $385 million at the end of the second quarter, with implied days outstanding of 45.5 days, which compares to 45.4 days at the end of last year’s second quarter.
Now let's turn to guidance. Following were few of the trends we observed in our business during the second quarter and the first weeks of July. On a same day sequential basis, revenues from our temporary and consulting divisions were down in April, decreased again in May, but increased in June. Revenues from our permanent placement operations decreased in April, increased in May, and increased again in June.
During the first two weeks of July, revenues from our temporary and consulting businesses were up 7% compared to the same period last year. For the first three weeks of July, revenues from our permanent placement division were up 8% compared to the same period last year. As we've said before, however, it is difficult to read too much into perm trends over such short periods of time.
Taking into account these business trends and the improving but still uncertain economy, we offer the following third quarter guidance. Revenues, $770 million to $820 million. Income per share, $0.09 to $0.14. This guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. As you know, we limit our guidance to one quarter. The estimates we’ve provided on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today’s press release.
Now I’ll turn it back to Max.

As previously noted, we were pleased to see our second quarter revenues improve on both the year-over-year and sequential basis. We believe the US economy, while still uncertain, is on a stronger footing today than it was one year ago. But the unemployment rate remains high and many companies are managing increased business demand by using temporary workers. This is allowing them to keep their labor costs variable until they are confident their business improvement is sustainable.
We believe there is greater acceptance by companies of flexible staffing models that include a mix of both full-time and temporary workers. Business trends within our staffing operations are in some respects consistent with past economic cycles. For example, we saw strength in OfficeTeam during the second quarter, and it is not unusual for administrative staffing to improve before the Finance & Accounting segments.
The relative strength in technology staffing, we believe, is likely the result of renewed investment by companies in new systems and software following years of postponing information technology investments. What is perhaps inconsistent with past cycles is the continued strong demand for our permanent placement services.
Historically, full-time staffing has been the last to recover from a downturn because companies typically rely first on temporary employees to meet rising workload demands. We have said many times that we felt companies would need to add full-time personnel to make up for the deep personnel cuts made during the downturn. This apparently has been the case at least in our experience.
Our Federal Reserve Chairman stated this morning that the US economy faces “unusually uncertain prospects.” However, if the economy is in fact on the path to recovery, we feel we are in a good position to benefit from increased demand for staffing and consulting services. Historically, we have emerged from economic downturns stronger and growing more rapidly than before.
We feel we have an experienced management team in our staffing operations and in Protiviti, and I am confident in their leadership abilities. Protiviti continues to diversify its business and develop a loyal client base. SOX-related services now account for less than 20% of total revenues of Protiviti. This quarter we saw particular demand in various IT related areas, including IT security and privacy, IT applications controls, and infrastructure management. Protiviti and our staffing brands also are collaborating more frequently and bringing a full suite of staffing and consulting services to our clients.
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to answer questions. We ask that you please limit yourself as usual to one question and a single follow-up as needed. If you have additional questions, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call. Thank you.

Our direct answer is, if you look at our gross margin in temp, it was up 50-odd basis points for the quarter. About 20 of that was the workers’ comp credit, about 20 of that was better pay bill spreads, and the balance or a little over 10 of that w",692,"Yes. Our direct answer is, if you look at our gross margin in temp, it was up 50-odd basis points for the quarter. About 20 of that was the workers’ comp credit, about 20 of that was better pay bill spreads, and the balance or a little over 10 of that were higher conversions. So it was better on all three scores. As far as trends we are seeing, let me talk a little bit overall and by division. I guess we were pleased that this quarter was the quarter whether it was an inflection point to positive year-over-year growth in our temp businesses, which is the first time that’s happened in a while, obviously led by OfficeTeam and Robert Half Technology. We actually went back and compared this cycle to last. And relative to the trough months in the last cycle, it took us 15 months thereafter to return to positive year-over-year growth. At this time, we returned to positive year-over-year growth in ten months. So obviously, faster than we did last time.
Let’s talk a little bit divisionally. Accountemps, we’re happy to report the accounting operations or transactional part of Accountemps, which is about half its revenues, in fact had year-over-year growth during the quarter and they had a little sequential growth as well. The staff accountant level and above, what we call internally the financial positions, were still down year-over-year, but sequentially they flattened out. And this was a marked improvement from what we saw in the prior quarter. And it’s in fact if we stay on a flat sequential pace with Accountemps, we will return to positive year-over-year growth in Accountemps in the third quarter that we are in. And if you compare that to prior cycles, Accountemps would return to positive year-over-year growth three to four months faster than what’s been the case in prior cycles. If you look at OfficeTeam, it was obviously strong. It’s earlier cycle. There is no secret there. We are adding to staff where we cut too much in some of our smaller offices and as productivity dictates, but there is no question that the tone is positive in OfficeTeam.
In Technology, we went year-over-year positive in April. There we are seeing strength in Windows 7 upgrades and installs, electronic medical records conversions. We are also selectively adding the staff in Technology because of that strength. And the strength is both the development and the tech support side. If you turn to MR, Management Resources, we went year-over-year positive in June. We are happy to report the tone of project demand is getting a little better. We are on pay for a small amount of sequential growth there, which would also result in positive year-over-year in the third quarter for Management Resources.
Couple comments about perm, while perm remained strong, remember that in the third quarter you’ve got the August holidays in Europe. Our international operations are 50% of our consolidated perm results. And to the extent that seasonally they are a bit soft in August, that impacts overall perm results. So we have less sequential growth in perm built into our forecast than we have in the last couple of quarters. Protiviti went positive year-over-year in April. Strength in IT controls, as Max talked about, e-discovery, public company readiness, financial services, industry services, they did continue to improve incrementally during the quarter although a little slower than we have forecasted in the US.
The non-US losses did decline, as the cost-cutting measures of past have kicked in. We believe we should benefit from the Frank Dodd Act, where we have clients deal with increased regulatory oversights. We do expect further incremental improvement in the third quarter, although we won’t get the SOX lift we have in years past because frankly SOX just isn’t near as bigger part of the total as it once was. We should, at a minimum, reduce the losses further in the third quarter Protiviti and potentially report small positive earnings. But in Protiviti, the tone there does continue to improve modestly. So that’s clearly a mouthful, but that kind of gives you a tour of our divisions.

In the US, we were a little light at the revenue lines based or versus what we expected, but not a lot light. I think the overarching point is things continue to improve at Protiviti. The tone is clearly positive. I’d say the improvements are modest improvements rather than screaming improvements. But things are getting better incrementally. Second quarter was better than first quarter. We believe third quarter will be better than the second quarter.

So we didn’t contract our footprint like many other firms did. And therefore our expectation would be on the upside. We’re not going to expand our footprint significantly as far as numbers of locations. As demand justifies, we will begin adding the headcount. We’ve talked about with OfficeTeam and Robert Half Technology, which are particularly strong; we are beginning to add the headcount. Perm, we had a lot of excess capacity. And so far, we’ve relied totally on that to support the growth we’ve had in perm. But we are probably getting close to where we started adding headcount there as well. That said, notice that our incremental margins in temp and perm this quarter were north of 30%. And as we’ve said in the past, we should get incremental margins at this point in the cycle that are 30% or better in perm and 20% or better in temp. And we actually did better than that this quarter, notwithstanding our conservative guidance last quarter.

The odd ball is that they are even using more again of full-time hires to replace a tranche of people they probably overcut in the downturn. But again, I think our numbers would support there is a secular shift taking place. Companies are using more temporaries. We are on pace, grown a faster recovery pace relative to the prior downturn, and that includes accounting and finance. There has always been a lag between administrative and accounting. That lag exists as we speak. But given current trends, we are going to go to revenue positive in Accounting & Finance more quickly this time than last.

We paid cash dividend to shareholders of $0.13 per share during the quarter for a total of $19 million. We also spent $11 million to repurchase 500,000 shares of RHI common stock during the quarter. Approximately 2.1 million shares remain available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan. 
We were pleased to see broad-based increases in demand throughout our operations. Each of our staffing divisions and Protiviti reported both year-over-year and sequential revenue gains during the third quarter.

There were 64 billing days in the third quarter, the same as the third quarter last year. There were 63 billing days last quarter and the current fourth quarter have 62 billing days. 
Accountemps revenues were $313 million in the third quarter, up 9% from this time last year and up 4% sequentially on a same day basis. Accountemps is our largest staffing division and accounts for 38% of company revenues. There are 355 Accountemps locations worldwide. 
OfficeTeam had third quarter revenues of $163 million, an increase of 22% from the third quarter of 2009 and an increase of 7% sequentially on a same day basis. OfficeTeam is our high-end administrative staffing division and represents 20% of company revenues. There are 321 OfficeTeam locations worldwide. 
Third quarter revenues for our Robert Half Management Resources division were $98 million. This is an increase of 9% from a year ago and an increase of 4% sequentially on a same day basis. Robert Half Management Resources places senior-level accounting and finance professionals on a project basis, and has 153 locations worldwide and makes up 12% of company revenues.
Robert Half Technology had third quarter revenues of $87 million, up 17% from the third quarter of 2009 and up 5% from the second quarter of this year on a same day basis. Robert Half Technology places IT professionals on a consulting and full-time basis. It operates in 117 locations worldwide and accounts for 11% of company revenues.

This is a 33% increase from the third quarter of last year and a 2% increase sequentially. This business was established in 1948 and it operates in 355 locations worldwide. Our perm placement division accounts for 7% of company wide revenues. 
International staffing operations had revenues of $204 million during the third quarter, up 11% from the third quarter of 2009 and up 8% sequentially. On a constant-currency basis, revenues for international staffing operations were up 15% compared to the third quarter of last year and up 7% sequentially. We have staffing operations in 100 locations in 18 countries outside the U.S. International staffing operations represent 28% of total staffing revenues. 
Protiviti revenues were $99 million during the third quarter, up 2% from a year ago and up 8% from the second quarter of this year on a same day basis. Formed in 2002, Protiviti is a global business consulting and internal audit firm providing risk advisory and transaction services. It has 60 locations in 16 countries and accounts for 12% of total RHI revenues. Protiviti's international operations represent 25% of total Protiviti revenues.
Turning to gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was $225 million in the third quarter or 34.1% of applicable revenues. This is up from 33.5% one year ago and unchanged from the 34.1% reported last quarter. Overall staffing gross margin during the third quarter was $282 million or 39.3% of staffing revenues. This compares to 38.1% of revenues one year ago and 39.6% of revenues in the second quarter of this year. The mix of permanent placement revenues directly impacts overall gross margin and represents 8%, 8.3% and 6.8% of revenues for the third quarter of 2010, the second quarter of 2010 and the third quarter of 2009, respectively. 
Protiviti gross margin was $27 million in the third quarter or 27% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to 24% of its revenues in the second quarter of this year. The increase is due primarily to higher chargeability. 
Staffing SG&A costs during the quarter were $245 million or 34.2% of staffing revenues. This compares to $223 million or 35.4% of revenues for the third quarter of last year and $238 million or 35.3% of revenues for the second quarter of this year. The decline as a percent of revenues relates to the absence of litigation costs, which were expensed last quarter. 
SG&A costs for Protiviti during the quarter were $27 million or 26.9% of revenues. This compares to $26 million or 26.8% of revenues for the third quarter of last year and $29 million or 31.2% of revenues for the second quarter of this year. This decline as a percentage of revenue also relates to the absence of prior-quarter litigation cost.
Turning to operating income. Third quarter operating income for our staffing divisions was $37 million or 5.2% of staffing revenues. The temporary and consulting divisions contributed $32 million of this amount or 4.8% of applicable revenues. Third quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $5 million or 8.9% of applicable revenues. 
Operating income was $113,000 for Protiviti in the third quarter compared to an operating loss of $6.8 million in the second quarter of this year. The improvement relates primarily to the $5.7 million increase in Protiviti revenues during the quarter.
Turning to accounts receivable. At the end of the third quarter, accounts receivable were $428 million, with implied days sales outstanding of 47.6 days compared to 45.7 days at the end of last year's third quarter. 
And now, guidance. We observed the following business trends during the third quarter and the first weeks of October. On a same day sequential basis, revenues from our temporary and consulting divisions increased in July, increased in August and increased again in September. Revenues for our permanent placement operations decreased in July, increased in August and increased again in September. During the first two weeks of October, revenues from our temporary and consulting businesses were up 13% compared to the same period last year. For the first three weeks of October, revenues from our permanent placement division were up 10% compared to the same period last year. As we've said before, we would caution reading too much in the perm trends over these short time periods. 
Taking into account these trends, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: Revenues, $800 million to $850 million; income per share, $0.12 to $0.17. As we've noted in the past, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. 
As you know, we limit our guidance to one quarter. The estimates we provided in this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release.

As I noted earlier on the call, we were pleased to see broad-based improvement throughout our operations. We saw higher demand for our services and higher revenues in all of our staffing divisions and Protiviti, both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially. Unemployment rates in United States remained high, but it has been our experience that companies do appear to be more open to hiring on a both temporary and full-time basis. As business demand grows, the first course of action for many companies is often to bring in temporary workers, which keeps their labor costs variable. We have seen this pattern for several quarters now. 
For companies that made deeper personnel cuts, and we believe many companies made severe cuts last year, their teams are now to lean in some cases. This makes them more likely to hire full-time personnel at the first sign of improving business conditions, and we have witnessed this in our permanent placement division. 
Hiring demand has improved here and outside the United States. As Keith indicated, revenues for our non-U.S. staffing operations were up 11% from the third quarter of 2009 and up 8% sequentially from the second quarter. We have emerged strongly from past recessions, and we believe we are well positioned today. Our field teams are eager to take advantage of more favorable business conditions. 
We also were pleased to see higher revenues in Protiviti. Protiviti has continued to diversify its service offerings and clients are responding favorably. We see business opportunities in helping companies navigate the various financial reform measures that have either been introduced or are in process around the world in response to the global financial crisis. We also see potential in Protiviti's information technology practice, which is working with companies in areas such as IT security and privacy, IT applications controls and infrastructure management. Protiviti and our staffing brands also are working together more frequently on joint projects for clients in bringing a full suite of staffing and consulting services to those clients. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to respond to your questions. We ask that you please limit yourself, as is usual, to one question and a single follow-up as needed. If you have additional questions, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call. Thank you."

Nice progress here in terms of the sequential revenue growth. Can you give us a little bit of a sense of if things continue, and I guess, what's embedded, first of all, in your overall guidance for Protiviti for the fourth quarter?

Protiviti is more impacted by the holidays as their clients, many of them, shut down between Christmas and New Years, and because that they're not open, our staff can't work. So for that reason, our guidance would be that the revenues would be a little lighter, not a lot lighter, but a little lighter in the fourth quarter than in the third. But you also get some payroll relief for those same reasons. And our guidance would say that the operating income from Protiviti would be about the same, maybe a little bit higher. Clearly, there's been a lot of improvement from the first half of the year, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. As to profitability, Protiviti's had solid double-digit margins in their past. Clearly, the objective is to get back to double-digit operating margins. Given where we've come, it's nice to be in the block again. It's nice to be forecasting that we'll stay in the block. The challenge will be the seasonal slowness that typically happens in the first quarter, and we're already working hard with our cost structure, which is more variable as we speak to try to deal with that. But the improvement we've seen for several quarters now in Protiviti continued into this quarter and is expected to continue into the quarter we're in."

And again, there's more volatility to that than there traditionally would be because of the relative importance of foreign operations, earnings, or lack thereof. As to perm and guidance, the fourth quarter seasonally is always a little bit softer in perm than the other quarters. Companies run out of hiring budget, companies begin to work on their following year hiring budget and throttle back a bit on their full-time hiring. There's the December effect, and we've lived through over 20 Decembers, and Decembers are particularly hard to predict in perm. We've have some great ones. We've had some not so great ones.

I'd say we added mid-single digit to our headcount during the quarter that was tech-related first, and our smaller Accountemps operations where growth began to kick in, where we felt like we were understaffed. So we did add to our staff during the quarter, given the results that we had. Along those lines, I would make a couple of points. This is the fastest recovery we've ever experienced post downturn. Our temp business is 20% above its lows versus at the same time in the last upcycle, it was still flat relative to the lows. Our Perm business is 40% above the lows versus same time last cycle. It was also flat versus the lows. Those things said, our Temp business is still only 70% of its prior peak. Our Perm business is only 50% of its prior peak, and many make the case that prior peaks will well be exceeded in this cycle because of the secular shifts. I would also point out, there's a lot of discussion about the late cycle leaders, cycle participation of accounting and finance, and we're happy to report that the lag between accounting and office administrative, as an example, is the shortest lag we've ever experienced. This time around, there was a four- to five-month lag between when OfficeTeam went year-over-year positive in revenues and when Accountemps went year-over-year positive. In the last cycle, that lag was nine to 10 months. So for all of those positive reasons, we begun to add the headcount, starting with technology; and secondly, backfilling the locations that we felt got a little too small in Accountemps."

We also spent $11 million to repurchase 500,000 shares of RHI common stock during the quarter. Approximately 2.1 million shares remain available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.

The year-over-year and sequential growth rates were 14% and 6%, respectively, on a constant-currency basis. 
There were 64 billing days in the third quarter, the same as the third quarter last year. There were 63 billing days last quarter and the current fourth quarter has 62 billing days. 
Accountemps revenues were $313 million in the third quarter, up 9% from this time last year and up 4% sequentially on a same day basis. Accountemps is our largest staffing division and accounts for 38% of company revenues. There are 355 Accountemps locations worldwide. 
OfficeTeam had third quarter revenues of $163 million, an increase of 22% from the third quarter of 2009 and an increase of 7% sequentially on a same day basis. OfficeTeam is our high-end administrative staffing division and represents 20% of company revenues. There are 321 OfficeTeam locations worldwide. 
Third quarter revenues for our Robert Half Management Resources division were $98 million. This is an increase of 9% from a year ago and an increase of 4% sequentially on a same day basis. Robert Half Management Resources places senior-level accounting and finance professionals on a project basis, and has 153 locations worldwide and makes up 12% of company revenues.
Robert Half Technology had third quarter revenues of $87 million, up 17% from the third quarter of 2009 and up 5% from the second quarter of this year on a same day basis. Robert Half Technology places IT professionals on a consulting and full-time basis. It operates in 117 locations worldwide and accounts for 11% of company revenues.
Robert Half Finance & Accounting, our Perm [Permanent] Placement division, had third quarter revenues of $57 million. This is a 33% increase from the third quarter of last year and a 2% increase sequentially. This business was established in 1948, and it operates in 355 locations worldwide. Our Perm Placement division accounts for 7% of companywide revenues. 
International staffing operations had revenues of $204 million during the third quarter, up 11% from the third quarter of 2009 and up 8% sequentially. On a constant-currency basis, revenues for international staffing operations were up 15% compared to the third quarter of last year and up 7% sequentially. We have staffing operations in 100 locations in 18 countries outside the U.S. International staffing operations represent 28% of total staffing revenues. 
Protiviti revenues were $99 million during the third quarter, up 2% from a year ago and up 8% from the second quarter of this year on a same day basis. Formed in 2002, Protiviti is a global business consulting and internal audit firm providing risk, advisory and transaction services. It has 60 locations in 16 countries and accounts for 12% of total RHI revenues. Protiviti's international operations represent 25% of total Protiviti revenues.
Turning to gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was $225 million in the third quarter or 34.1% of applicable revenues. This is up from 33.5% one year ago and unchanged from the 34.1% reported last quarter. Overall staffing gross margin during the third quarter was $282 million or 39.3% of staffing revenues. This compares to 38.1% of revenues one year ago and 39.6% of revenues in the second quarter of this year. The mix of permanent placement revenues directly impacts overall gross margin and represents 8%, 8.3% and 6.8% of revenues for the third quarter of 2010, the second quarter of 2010 and the third quarter of 2009, respectively. 
Protiviti gross margin was $27 million in the third quarter or 27% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to 24% of its revenues in the second quarter of this year. The increase is due primarily to higher chargeability. 
Staffing SG&A costs during the quarter were $245 million or 34.2% of staffing revenues. This compares to $223 million or 35.4% of revenues for the third quarter of last year and $238 million or 35.3% of revenues for the second quarter of this year. The decline as a percent of revenues relates to the absence of litigation costs, which were expensed last quarter. 
SG&A costs for Protiviti during the quarter were $27 million or 26.9% of revenues. This compares to $26 million or 26.8% of revenues for the third quarter of last year and $29 million or 31.2% of revenues for the second quarter of this year. This decline as a percentage of revenue also relates to the absence of prior-quarter litigation cost.
Turning to operating income. Third quarter operating income for our staffing divisions was $37 million or 5.2% of staffing revenues. The temporary and consulting divisions contributed $32 million of this amount or 4.8% of applicable revenues. Third quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $5 million or 8.9% of applicable revenues. 
Operating income was $113,000 for Protiviti in the third quarter compared to an operating loss of $6.8 million in the second quarter of this year. The improvement relates primarily to the $5.7 million increase in Protiviti revenues during the quarter.
Turning to accounts receivable. At the end of the third quarter, accounts receivable were $428 million, with implied days sales outstanding of 47.6 days compared to 45.7 days at the end of last year's third quarter. 
And now, guidance. We observed the following business trends during the third quarter and the first weeks of October. On a same day sequential basis, revenues from our temporary and consulting divisions increased in July, increased in August and increased again in September. Revenues for our Permanent Placement operations decreased in July, increased in August and increased again in September. During the first two weeks of October, revenues from our temporary and consulting businesses were up 13% compared to the same period last year. For the first three weeks of October, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 10% compared to the same period last year. As we've said before, we would caution against reading too much into Perm trends over these short time periods. 
Taking into account these trends, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: Revenues, $800 million to $850 million; income per share, $0.12 to $0.17. As we've noted in the past, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. 
As you know, we limit our guidance to one quarter. The estimates we provided on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release.

As I noted earlier on the call, we were pleased to see broad-based improvement throughout our operations. We saw higher demand for our services and higher revenues in all of our staffing divisions and Protiviti, both on a year-over-year",390,"Thank you, Keith. As I noted earlier on the call, we were pleased to see broad-based improvement throughout our operations. We saw higher demand for our services and higher revenues in all of our staffing divisions and Protiviti, both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially. Unemployment rates in United States remained high, but it has been our experience that companies do appear to be more open to hiring on a both temporary and full-time basis. As business demand grows, the first course of action for many companies is often to bring in temporary workers, which keeps their labor costs variable. We have seen this pattern for several quarters now. 
For companies that made deeper personnel cuts, and we believe many companies made severe cuts last year, their teams are now too lean in some cases. This makes them more likely to hire full-time personnel at the first sign of improving business conditions, and we have witnessed this in our permanent placement division. 
Hiring demand has improved here and outside the United States. As Keith indicated, revenues for our non-U.S. staffing operations were up 11% from the third quarter of 2009 and up 8% sequentially from the second quarter. We have emerged strongly from past recessions, and we believe we are well positioned today. Our field teams are eager to take advantage of more favorable business conditions. 
We also were pleased to see higher revenues in Protiviti. Protiviti has continued to diversify its service offerings and clients are responding favorably. We see business opportunities in helping companies navigate the various financial reform measures that have either been introduced or are in process around the world in response to the global financial crisis. We also see potential in Protiviti's information technology practice, which is working with companies in areas such as IT security and privacy, IT applications controls and infrastructure management. Protiviti and our staffing brands also are working together more frequently on joint projects for clients in bringing a full suite of staffing and consulting services to those clients. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to respond to your questions. We ask that you please limit yourself, as is usual, to one question and a single follow-up as needed. If you have additional questions, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call. Thank you."

Protiviti is more impacted by the holidays as their clients, many of them, shut down between Christmas and New Years, and because they're not open, our staff can't work. So for that reason, our guidance would be that the revenues would be a little lighter, not a lot lighter, but a little lighter in the fourth quarter than in the third. But you also get some payroll relief for those same reasons. And our guidance would say that the operating income from Protiviti would be about the same, maybe a little higher. Clearly, there's been a lot of improvement from the first half of the year, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. As to profitability, Protiviti's had solid double-digit margins in their past. Clearly, the objective is to get back to double-digit operating margins. Given where we've come, it's nice to be in the block again. It's nice to be forecasting that we'll stay in the block. The challenge will be the seasonal slowness that typically happens in the first quarter, and we're already working hard with our cost structure, which is more variable as we speak to try to deal with that. But the improvement we've seen for several quarters now in Protiviti continued into this quarter and is expected to continue into the quarter we're in."

As to Perm and guidance, the fourth quarter seasonally is always a little bit softer in Perm than the other quarters. Companies run out of hiring budget, companies begin to work on their following year hiring budget and throttle back a bit on their full-time hiring. There's the December effect, and we've lived through over 20 Decembers, and Decembers are particularly hard to predict in Perm. We've have some great ones. We've had some not so great ones.

I'd say we added mid-single digit to our headcount during the quarter that was tech-related first and our smaller Accountemps operations where growth began to kick in, where we felt like we were understaffed. So we did add to our staff during the quarter, given the results that we had. Along those lines, I would make a couple of points. This is the fastest recovery we've ever experienced post downturn. Our temp business is 20% above its lows versus at the same time in the last upcycle, it was still flat relative to the lows. Our Perm business is 40% above the lows versus same time last cycle. It was also flat versus the lows. Those things said, our Temp business is still only 70% of its prior peak. Our Perm business is only 50% of its prior peak, and many make the case that prior peaks will well be exceeded in this cycle because of the secular shifts. I would also point out, there's a lot of discussion about the late cycle leaders, cycle participation of accounting and finance, and we're happy to report that the lag between accounting and office administrative, as an example, is the shortest lag we've ever experienced. This time around, there was a four- to five-month lag between when OfficeTeam went year-over-year positive in revenues and when Accountemps went year-over-year positive. In the last cycle, that lag was nine to 10 months. So for all of those positive reasons, we’ve begun to add the headcount, starting with technology; and secondly, backfilling the locations that we felt got a little too small in Accountemps."

We also spent $11 million to repurchase 500,000 shares of RHI common stock during the quarter. Approximately 2.1 million shares remain available for repurchase under our board-approved stock repurchase plan.

There were 64 billing days in the third quarter, the same as the third quarter last year. There were 63 billing days last quarter and the current fourth quarter has 62 billing days. 
Accountemps revenues were $313 million in the third quarter, up 9% from this time last year and up 4% sequentially on a same day basis. Accountemps is our largest staffing division and accounts for 38% of company revenues. There are 355 Accountemps locations worldwide. 
OfficeTeam had third quarter revenues of $163 million, an increase of 22% from the third quarter of 2009 and an increase of 7% sequentially on a same day basis. OfficeTeam is our high-end administrative staffing division and represents 20% of company revenues. There are 321 OfficeTeam locations worldwide. 
Third quarter revenues for our Robert Half Management Resources division were $98 million. This is an increase of 9% from a year ago and an increase of 4% sequentially on a same day basis. Robert Half Management Resources places senior-level accounting and finance professionals on a project basis, and has 153 locations worldwide and makes up 12% of company revenues.
Robert Half Technology had third quarter revenues of $87 million, up 17% from the third quarter of 2009 and up 5% from the second quarter of this year on a same day basis. Robert Half Technology places IT professionals on a consulting and full-time basis. It operates in 117 locations worldwide and accounts for 11% of company revenues.
Robert Half Finance & Accounting, our Perm [Permanent] Placement division, had third quarter revenues of $57 million. This is a 33% increase from the third quarter of last year and a 2% increase sequentially. This business was established in 1948, and it operates in 355 locations worldwide. Our Perm Placement division accounts for 7% of companywide revenues. 
International staffing operations had revenues of $204 million during the third quarter, up 11% from the third quarter of 2009 and up 8% sequentially. On a constant-currency basis, revenues for international staffing operations were up 15% compared to the third quarter of last year and up 7% sequentially. We have staffing operations in 100 locations in 18 countries outside the U.S. International staffing operations represent 28% of total staffing revenues. 
Protiviti revenues were $99 million during the third quarter, up 2% from a year ago and up 8% from the second quarter of this year on a same day basis. Formed in 2002, Protiviti is a global business consulting and internal audit firm providing risk, advisory and transaction services. It has 60 locations in 16 countries and accounts for 12% of total RHI revenues. Protiviti's international operations represent 25% of total Protiviti revenues.
Turning to gross margin. Gross margin in our temporary and consulting staffing operations was $225 million in the third quarter or 34.1% of applicable revenues. This is up from 33.5% one year ago and unchanged from the 34.1% reported last quarter. Overall staffing gross margin during the third quarter was $282 million or 39.3% of staffing revenues. This compares to 38.1% of revenues one year ago and 39.6% of revenues in the second quarter of this year. The mix of permanent placement revenues directly impacts overall gross margin and represents 8%, 8.3% and 6.8% of revenues for the third quarter of 2010, the second quarter of 2010 and the third quarter of 2009, respectively. 
Protiviti gross margin was $27 million in the third quarter or 27% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to 24% of its revenues in the second quarter of this year. The increase is due primarily to higher chargeability. 
Staffing SG&A costs during the quarter were $245 million or 34.2% of staffing revenues. This compares to $223 million or 35.4% of revenues for the third quarter of last year and $238 million or 35.3% of revenues for the second quarter of this year. The decline as a percent of revenues relates to the absence of litigation costs, which were expensed last quarter. 
SG&A costs for Protiviti during the quarter were $27 million or 26.9% of revenues. This compares to $26 million or 26.8% of revenues for the third quarter of last year and $29 million or 31.2% of revenues for the second quarter of this year. This decline as a percentage of revenue also relates to the absence of prior-quarter litigation cost.
Turning to operating income. Third quarter operating income for our staffing divisions was $37 million or 5.2% of staffing revenues. The temporary and consulting divisions contributed $32 million of this amount or 4.8% of applicable revenues. Third quarter operating income for our permanent placement division was $5 million or 8.9% of applicable revenues. 
Operating income was $113,000 for Protiviti in the third quarter compared to an operating loss of $6.8 million in the second quarter of this year. The improvement relates primarily to the $5.7 million increase in Protiviti revenues during the quarter.
Turning to accounts receivable. At the end of the third quarter, accounts receivable were $428 million, with implied days sales outstanding of 47.6 days compared to 45.7 days at the end of last year's third quarter. 
And now, guidance. We observed the following business trends during the third quarter and the first weeks of October. On a same day sequential basis, revenues from our temporary and consulting divisions increased in July, increased in August and increased again in September. Revenues for our Permanent Placement operations decreased in July, increased in August and increased again in September. During the first two weeks of October, revenues from our temporary and consulting businesses were up 13% compared to the same period last year. For the first three weeks of October, revenues from our Permanent Placement division were up 10% compared to the same period last year. As we've said before, we would caution against reading too much into Perm trends over these short time periods. 
Taking into account these trends, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance: Revenues, $800 million to $850 million; income per share, $0.12 to $0.17. As we've noted in the past, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims. 
As you know, we limit our guidance to one quarter. The estimates we provided on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today's press release.

As I noted earlier on the call, we were pleased to see broad-based improvement throughout our operations. We saw higher demand for our services and higher revenues in all of our staffing divisions and Protiviti, both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially. Unemployment rates in United States remained high, but it has been our experience that companies do appear to be more open to hiring on a both temporary and full-time basis. As business demand grows, the first course of action for many companies is often to bring in temporary workers, which keeps their labor costs variable. We have seen this pattern for several quarters now. 
For companies that made deeper personnel cuts, and we believe many companies made severe cuts last year, their teams are now too lean in some cases. This makes them more likely to hire full-time personnel at the first sign of improving business conditions, and we have witnessed this in our permanent placement division. 
Hiring demand has improved here and outside the United States. As Keith indicated, revenues for our non-U.S. staffing operations were up 11% from the third quarter of 2009 and up 8% sequentially from the second quarter. We have emerged strongly from past recessions, and we believe we are well positioned today. Our field teams are eager to take advantage of more favorable business conditions. 
We also were pleased to see higher revenues in Protiviti. Protiviti has continued to diversify its service offerings and clients are responding favorably. We see business opportunities in helping companies navigate the various financial reform measures that have either been introduced or are in process around the world in response to the global financial crisis. We also see potential in Protiviti's information technology practice, which is working with companies in areas such as IT security and privacy, IT applications controls and infrastructure management. Protiviti and our staffing brands also are working together more frequently on joint projects for clients in bringing a full suite of staffing and consulting services to those clients. 
At this time, Keith and I will be happy to respond to your questions. We ask that you please limit yourself, as is usual, to one question and a single follow-up as needed. If you have additional questions, we will certainly try to return to you later in the call. Thank you."

Protiviti is more impacted by the holidays as their clients, many of them, shut down between Christmas and New Years, and because they're not open, our staff can't work. So for that reason, our guidance would be that the revenues would be a little lighter, not a lot lighter, but a little lighter in the fourth quarter than in the third. But you also get some payroll relief for those same reasons. And our guidance would say that the operating income from Protiviti would be about the same, maybe a little higher. Clearly, there's been a lot of improvement from the first half of the year, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. As to profitability, Protiviti's had solid double-digit margins in their past. Clearly, the objective is to get back to double-digit operating margins. Given where we've come, it's nice to be in the block again. It's nice to be forecasting that we'll stay in the block. The challenge will be the seasonal slowness that typically happens in the first quarter, and we're already working hard with our cost structure, which is more variable as we speak to try to deal with that. But the improvement we've seen for several quarters now in Protiviti continued into this quarter and is expected to continue into the quarter we're in."

As to Perm and guidance, the fourth quarter seasonally is always a little bit softer in Perm than the other quarters. Companies run out of hiring budget, companies begin to work on their following year hiring budget and throttle back a bit on their full-time hiring. There's the December effect, and we've lived through over 20 Decembers, and Decembers are particularly hard to predict in Perm. We've have some great ones. We've had some not so great ones.

I'd say we added mid-single digit to our headcount during the quarter that was tech-related first and our smaller Accountemps operations where growth began to kick in, where we felt like we were understaffed. So we did add to our staff during the quarter, given the results that we had. Along those lines, I would make a couple of points. This is the fastest recovery we've ever experienced post downturn. Our temp business is 20% above its lows versus at the same time in the last upcycle, it was still flat relative to the lows. Our Perm business is 40% above the lows versus same time last cycle. It was also flat versus the lows. Those things said, our Temp business is still only 70% of its prior peak. Our Perm business is only 50% of its prior peak, and many make the case that prior peaks will well be exceeded in this cycle because of the secular shifts. I would also point out, there's a lot of discussion about the late cycle leaders, cycle participation of accounting and finance, and we're happy to report that the lag between accounting and office administrative, as an example, is the shortest lag we've ever experienced. This time around, there was a four- to five-month lag between when OfficeTeam went year-over-year positive in revenues and when Accountemps went year-over-year positive. In the last cycle, that lag was nine to 10 months. So for all of those positive reasons, we’ve begun to add the headcount, starting with technology; and secondly, backfilling the locations that we felt got a little too small in Accountemps."

Protiviti gross margin was $27 million in the third quarter or 27% of Protiviti revenues. This compares to 24% of its revenues in the second quarter of this year.

As I noted earlier on the call, we were pleased to see broad based improvement throughout our operations. We saw higher demand for our services and higher revenues in all of our staffing divisions and Protiviti both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially. Unemployment rates in United States remain high, but it has been our experience that companies do appear to be more open to hiring on both the temporary and full time basis. As business demand grows, the first course of action for many companies is often to bring in temporary workers, which keeps their labor cost variable. We have seen this pattern for several quarters now. For companies that made deeper personnel cuts and we believe many companies made severe cuts last year, their teams are now too lean in some cases. This makes them more likely to hire full time personnel at the first sign of improving business conditions and we have witnessed this in our permanent placement division.
Hiring demand has improved here and outside the United States, as Keith indicated, revenues for our non-US staffing operations were up 11% from the third quarter of 2009, and up 8% sequentially from the second quarter. We have emerged strongly from past recessions and we believe we are well positioned today. Our field teams are eager to take advantage of more favorable business conditions. We also were pleased to see higher revenues in Protiviti. Protiviti has continued to diversify its service offerings and clients are responding favorably. We see business opportunities in helping companies navigate the various financial reform measures that have either been introduced or are in process around the world in response to the global financial crisis.
We also see potential in Protiviti’s information technology practice, which is working with companies in areas such as IT security and privacy, IT applications controls, and infrastructure management. Protiviti and our staffing brands also are working together more frequently on joint projects for clients and bringing a full suite of staffing and consulting services to those clients. 
At this time Keith and I will be happy to respond to your questions. We ask that you please limit yourself as is usual to one question and a single follow-up as needed. If you have additional question we will certainly try to return to you later in the call. Thank you.

Nice progress here in terms of the sequential revenue growth. Can you give us a little bit of a sense of if things continue and I guess what's embedded first of all in your overall guidance for Protiviti for the fourth quarter, and then if things continue, how should we think about the profitability levels of Protiviti as we go out one or two years?

Remember that there'll be three fewer billing days in the fourth quarter than in the third. Protiviti is more impacted by the holidays as their clients, many of them, are shutdown between Christmas and New Years, and because if they're not open, our staff can't work. So for that reason our guidance would be that the revenues would be a little lighter, not a lot lighter, but a little lighter in the fourth quarter than in the third, but you also get some payroll relief for those same reasons. Our guidance would say that the operating income from Protiviti would be about the same, maybe a little higher. Clearly, there has been a lot of improvement from the first half of the year both in the US and outside the US 
As to profitability, Protiviti had solid double digit margins in their past. Clearly the objective is to get back to double digit operating margins. Given where we've come, it's nice to be in the black again. It's nice to be forecasting that we'll stay in the black. The challenge will be the seasonal slowness that typically happens in the first quarter, and we're already working hard with our cost structure which is more variable as we speak to try to deal with that, but the improvement we've seen for several quarters now in Protiviti continued into this quarter and is expected to continue into the quarter we're in.

So 42% to 45% for the near term probably isn't a bad estimate, and again there is more volatility to that than there traditionally would be because of the relative importance of foreign operations earnings or lack thereof. 
As to perm and guidance, the fourth quarter seasonally is always a little bit softer in perm than the other quarters. Companies run out of hiring budget. Companies begin to work on their following year hiring budget and throttle back a bit on their full time hiring. There is the December effect and we've lived through over 20 Decembers and Decembers are particularly hard to predict in perm. We've had great ones; we've had some not so great ones. So there is probably more uncertainty with our perm component of our guidance than any other one line of business. But that said, our people remain bullish on perm. It's just the typical fourth quarter jitters.

Along those lines, I would make a couple of points. This is the fastest recovery, we've ever experienced, post downturn. 
Our temp business is 20% above its lows versus at the same time in the last up cycle it was still flat relative to the lows. Our perm business is 40% above the lows versus same time last cycle it was also flat versus the lows. Those things said, our temp business is still only 70% of its prior peak. Our perm business is only 50% of its prior peak and many make the case that prior peaks will well be exceeded in this cycle because of the secular shifts. I would also point out there is a lot of discussion about the late cycle or later cycle participation of accounting and finance, and we're happy to report that the lag between accounting and office administrative as an example is the shortest lag we've ever experienced. 
This time around there was a four to five month lag between when OfficeTeam went year-over-year positive in revenues and when Accountemps went year-over-year positive. In the last cycle that lag was 9 to 10 months. So for all of those positive reasons, we've begun to add to headcount starting with technology and secondly backfilling the locations that we felt got a little too small in Accountemps.

We'd certainly there is room for more than we have now and outside the US we certainly have countries that have virtually no presence in technology as we speak, so that’s Greenfield opportunity. So I am sure it’s less and it doesn’t need to be as much less as it currently is. But that said, I am not sure it will ever be the same number.

Hiring demand has improved here and outside the United States, as Keith indicated, revenues for our non-US staffing operations were up 11% from the third quarter of 2009, and up 8% sequentially from the second quarter. We have emerged strongly from past recessions and we believe we are well positioned today. Our field teams are eager to take advantage of more favorable business conditions.
We also were pleased to see higher revenues in Protiviti. Protiviti has continued to diversify its service offerings and clients are responding favorably. We see business opportunities in helping companies navigate the various financial reform measures that have either been introduced or are in process around the world in response to the global financial crisis. We also see potential in Protiviti’s information technology practice, which is working with companies in areas such as IT security and privacy, IT applications controls, and infrastructure management. Protiviti and our staffing brands also are working together more frequently on joint projects for clients and bringing a full suite of staffing and consulting services to those clients.

Turning to accounts receivable, at the end of the third quarter, accounts receivable were $428 million with implied days sales outstanding of 47.6 days compared to 45.7 days at the end of last year's third quarter.
Now guidance, we observed the following business trends during the third quarter and the first weeks of October. On a same day sequential basis, revenues from our temporary and consulting divisions increased in July, increased in August, and increased again in September. Revenues for our permanent placement operations decreased in July, increased in August, and increased again in September. During the first two weeks of October, revenues from our temporary and consulting businesses were up 13% compared to the same period last year. 
For the first three weeks of October, revenues from our permanent placement division were up 10% compared to the same period last year. As we said before, we would caution against reading too much into perm trends over these short time periods. 
Taking into account these trends, we offer the following fourth quarter guidance, revenues, $800 million to $850 million; income per share, $0.12 to $0.18. As we've noted in the past, our guidance does not include any amounts for the possible settlement of outstanding legal claims.
As you know, we limit our guidance to one quarter. The estimates we provided on this call are subject to the risks mentioned in today’s press release. Max?

As I noted earlier on the call, we were pleased to see broad based improvement throughout our operations. We saw higher demand for our services and higher revenues in all of our staffing divisions and Protiviti both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially. Unemployment rates in United States remain high, but it has been our experience that companies do appear to be more open to hiring on both the temporary and full time basis. As business demand grows, the first course of action for many companies is often to bring in temporary workers, which keeps their labor cost variable. We have seen this pattern for several quarters now. For companies that made deeper personnel cuts and we believe many companies made severe cuts last year, their teams are now too lean in some cases. This makes them more likely to hire full time personnel at the first sign of improving business conditions and we have witnessed this in our permanent placement division.
Hiring demand has improved here and outside the United States, as Keith indicated, revenues for our non-US staffing operations were up 11% from the third quarter of 2009, and up 8% sequentially from the second quarter. We have emerged strongly from past recessions and we believe we are well positioned today. Our field teams are eager to take advantage of more favorable business conditions. We also were pleased to see higher revenues in Protiviti. Protiviti has continued to diversify its service offerings and clients are responding favorably. We see business opportunities in helping companies navigate the various financial reform measures that have either been introduced or are in process around the world in response to the global financial crisis.
We also see potential in Protiviti’s information technology practice, which is working with companies in areas such as IT security and privacy, IT applications controls, and infrastructure management. Protiviti and our staffing brands also are working together more frequently on joint projects for clients and bringing a full suite of staffing and consulting services to those clients. 
At this time Keith and I will be happy to respond to your questions. We ask that you please limit yourself as is usual to one question and a single follow-up as needed. If you have additional question we will certainly try to return to you later in the call. Thank you.

Remember that there'll be three fewer billing days in the fourth quarter than in the third. Protiviti is more impacted by the holidays as their clients, many of them, are shutdown between Christmas and New Years, and because if they're not open, our staff can't work. So for that reason our guidance would be that the revenues would be a little lighter, not a lot lighter, but a little lighter in the fourth quarter than in the third, but you also get some payroll relief for those same reasons. Our guidance would say that the operating income from Protiviti would be about the same, maybe a little higher. Clearly, there has been a lot of improvement from the first half of the year both in the US and outside the US 
As to profitability, Protiviti had solid double digit margins in their past. Clearly the objective is to get back to double digit operating margins. Given where we've come, it's nice to be in the black again. It's nice to be forecasting that we'll stay in the black. The challenge will be the seasonal slowness that typically happens in the first quarter, and we're already working hard with our cost structure which is more variable as we speak to try to deal with that, but the improvement we've seen for several quarters now in Protiviti continued into this quarter and is expected to continue into the quarter we're in.

So 42% to 45% for the near term probably isn't a bad estimate, and again there is more volatility to that than there traditionally would be because of the relative importance of foreign operations earnings or lack thereof. 
As to perm and guidance, the fourth quarter seasonally is always a little bit softer in perm than the other quarters. Companies run out of hiring budget. Companies begin to work on their following year hiring budget and throttle back a bit on their full time hiring. There is the December effect and we've lived through over 20 Decembers and Decembers are particularly hard to predict in perm. We've had great ones; we've had some not so great ones. So there is probably more uncertainty with our perm component of our guidance than any other one line of business. But that said, our people remain bullish on perm. It's just the typical fourth quarter jitters.

Along those lines, I would make a couple of points. This is the fastest recovery, we've ever experienced, post downturn. 
Our temp business is 20% above its lows versus at the same time in the last up cycle it was still flat relative to the lows. Our perm business is 40% above the lows versus same time last cycle it was also flat versus the lows. Those things said, our temp business is still only 70% of its prior peak. Our perm business is only 50% of its prior peak and many make the case that prior peaks will well be exceeded in this cycle because of the secular shifts. I would also point out there is a lot of discussion about the late cycle or later cycle participation of accounting and finance, and we're happy to report that the lag between accounting and office administrative as an example is the shortest lag we've ever experienced. 
This time around there was a four to five month lag between when OfficeTeam went year-over-year positive in revenues and when Accountemps went year-over-year positive. In the last cycle that lag was 9 to 10 months. So for all of those positive reasons, we've begun to add to headcount starting with technology and secondly backfilling the locations that we felt got a little too small in Accountemps.

We'd certainly there is room for more than we have now and outside the US we certainly have countries that have virtually no presence in technology as we speak, so that’s Greenfield opportunity. So I am sure it’s less and it doesn’t need to be as much less as it currently is. But that said, I am not sure it will ever be the same number. You don’t need as many offices in technology, you can cover a wider area with a given office in technology than you can and as an example in OfficeTeam.

They effectively outsource that to us which makes sense from them given their size. So I don't think that demand driver changes and if anything, gets stronger rather than not.
Hiring demand has improved here and outside the United States, as Keith indicated, revenues for our non-US staffing operations were up 11% from the third quarter of 2009, and up 8% sequentially from the second quarter. We have emerged strongly from past recessions and we believe we are well positioned today. Our field teams are eager to take advantage of more favorable business conditions.
We also were pleased to see higher revenues in Protiviti. Protiviti has continued to diversify its service offerings and clients are responding favorably. We see business opportunities in helping companies navigate the various financial reform measures that have either been introduced or are in process around the world in response to the global financial crisis. We also see potential in Protiviti’s information technology practice, which is working with companies in areas such as IT security and privacy, IT applications controls, and infrastructure management. Protiviti and our staffing brands also are working together more frequently on joint projects for clients and bringing a full suite of staffing and consulting services to those clients.
