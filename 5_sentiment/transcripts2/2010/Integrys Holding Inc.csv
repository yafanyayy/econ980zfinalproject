On February 17, we hosted an Investor and Analyst Day in New York. A webcast of each presentation and question-and-answer session is archived on our website, and the associated slides are available there as well.We had approximately 40 people joining us in person for that event, and many more listened to the webcast. And we appreciate your interest in the company, and we thank you for your participation. For those who are unable to participate, I encourage you to review the materials from the event, as they cover in detail our regulated utility operations, the results of our Integrys Energy Services strategy change, our restructured non-regulated business and detailed financial information. We also discussed our decision to maintain our quarterly dividend at its current level, and management's confidence that successful execution of our business plan will lead to a reasonable payout ratio over time. Today, as listed on the agenda on Slide 6, I will provide an overview of 2009, as well as the key takeaways from the Investor and Analyst Day. Joe O'Leary will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results, and our diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011. Finally, we will be happy to take your questions, either on our fourth quarter and full-year results for 2009, or on any information that we discussed at our event last week.Turning to Slide 7, we are pleased to report 2009 diluted earnings per share – adjusted results of $2.41, which exceeds our previously communicated 2009 diluted earnings per share - adjusted guidance range of $2.26 to $2.38. We are continuing on a deliberate path that will bring our utilities closer to earning their authorized returns on equity over time. We are advancing along this path with the operational progress that we made through our two-pronged approach to achieving this goal. First, we completed a number of rate cases during 2009 and early 2010. Second, we are continually making progress on our operational excellence initiatives to further streamline and improve the efficiency of our operations.Another major accomplishment is that we met our key strategic objectives for Integrys Energy Services. We substantially reduced the invested capital and collateral support requirements of this business. Upon completion of our announced transactions, we would have exited wholesale operations, and we have refocused the remaining non-regulated retail natural gas marketing and retail electric marketing operations to achieve a platform for controlled growth within acceptable parameters.These accomplishments in our regulated and non-regulated operations position us well for 2010 and beyond. I would now like to briefly review the key takeaways for our regulated and non-regulated operations from our Investor and Analyst Day last week. In our regulated business, covered on Slide 8, our objective is to bring each utility closer to earning as authorized return on equity. As I said earlier, one major way that we are doing this is through cost control efforts focused on operational excellence, and timely and regular filings of rate cases when appropriate. We've also been able to incorporate mechanisms that help us achieve more predictable earnings over time. The decoupling and bad debt riders that we have in place from several of our jurisdictions are examples of these mechanisms. Our rate base will grow through investment in capital projects needed for environmental compliance, renewable portfolio standard mandates, and maintaining and improving our infrastructure.American Transmission Company will continue to positively impact our earnings. Although this is an equity investment for us, we treat this investment as a separate reportable segment. We have included American Transmission Company on this slide, under the category of Regulated Operations, because the ATC is subject to regulation via the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. And finally, but no less than importantly, our commitment to continuous improvements in operational excellence and cost controls will allow us to deliver on our financial expectations while delivering safe, reliable and outstanding customer service.Slide 9, shows our potential earnings growth for 2008 and 2009's financial results, associated with our efforts to have our regulated utilities earn closer to their authorized returns on equity. You can find the 2008 and 2009 data for each utility in the Appendix of the presentation. We have also displayed estimates of our earnings potential for our regulated Natural Gas and Regulated Electric segments for 2010 and 2011, which we calculated using the midpoint of the 2010 and 2011 diluted earnings per share guidance range that we presented at the Investor and Analyst Day last week.Although we are confident with the diluted earnings per share guidance ranges that we have provided to you, I do want to stress that the figures you see for 2010 and 2011 are estimates to give you an idea of the improving trends in earnings that we expect to deliver in the next two years. The actual results could vary by as much as $5 million to $10 million either way, and still remain within our guidance range.Consistent with what we said during our presentation last week, the earnings shortfall between what was authorized and what was actually earned for all of our regulated utilities, increased in 2009, going from about $45 million in 2008 to about $57 million in 2009. Given the economy and the timing of rate cases, this was not unexpected. And while we experience a decline in utility earnings from 2008 to 2009, the longer-term trends shows improvement. A closer look at the individual utility results also shows the progress we are making. For example, Minnesota Energy Resources' financial results for 2009 showed that it has slightly exceeded its allowed return on equity, and Michigan Gas Utilities' financial results showed an improvement in earnings. Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas were involved in rate cases in 2009, with new rates going into effect in late January of 2010, which will lead to an improvement in earnings for these companies as well. Wisconsin Public Service's 2009 financial results were impacted by a shortfall in sales and limitations of the decoupling cap at the electric utility.  We will be filing a rate case for the Wisconsin Public Service in April, and expect its earnings to improve upon implementation of new rates in 2011. So in total, we are expecting a substantial improvement in the utility earnings for 2010, which is the first full year that the recent rate cases are in effect. We expect the shortfall to be reduced to approximately $37 million in total, roughly $20 million for the Natural Gas Utility business, and $17 million for the Electric business.From 2010 and 2011, there is a bit of lumpiness as the expected increase in the Electric Utility segment, due to anticipated rate case awards will be somewhat offset by a decline at Peoples Gas and North Shore gas, which will be in a rate case filing year. Again, I want to emphasize that these are estimates using the diluted-earnings-per-share guidance midpoint, and the actual numbers will vary. Nevertheless, we believe that the improve in trend will continue in 2011 when we expect the total shortfall to be approximately $34 million, roughly $25 million for the Natural Gas Utility business, and $9 million for the Electric business. One of our major strategic objectives is to bring our utilities closer to earning their authorized returns on equity over time. Due to the inherent nature of the regulatory process in terms of timing and typical disallowances, complete eradication of the shortfalls is probably not likely. However, we will keep trying to improve on that number as much as we can through our operational excellence program and rate case filings when they are appropriate.In our Non-Regulated business covered on Slide 10, we are pleased to have achieved our strategic objectives for Integrys Energy Services. We are completely exiting the wholesale portions of this business. We have restructured the remaining portions of our Non-Regulated business, which now encompasses Retail Electric and Retail Natural Gas marketing, and solar and other renewable energy projects. And we have restructured it, so that is positioned for controlled growth.Our refocused Non-regulated Retail Customer business is lower risk and more predictable than our prior integrated business, and our new renewable energy projects will focus on customer-sited solar and renewable contracted asset development. Our commitment to operational excellence extends to Integrys Energy Services as well, and we will make improvements in that arena as we continue to provide exceptional energy solutions for our customers.With that, I will now turn the call over to Joe O'Leary."

I will cover our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009, as well as our annual diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011.

I will cover our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009, as well as our annual diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011. Beginning with Slide 9, during the fourth quarter of 2009, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP, we recognize total diluted earnings per share of $0.31 for the quarter ended December 31, 2009, compared with $0.33 for the same quarter in 2008. To arrive at diluted earnings per share - adjusted for the quarter, 2009 expenses relating to our reductions in the workforce at the regulated utilities and holding company are added back, as is Integrys Energy Services' net loss from continuing operations in 2009 and 2008.Diluted earnings per share - adjusted was $0.49 for the quarter of 2009, compared with $0.68 for the same period in 2008. For the full year 2009, on a GAAP basis, we experienced a net loss per share of $0.92, compared with net income of $1.64 per diluted share for the full year 2008. To arrive at diluted earnings per share - adjusted, the non-cash goodwill impairment losses for our Natural Gas Utility segment, expenses related to our reductions in the workforce at the regulated utilities and holding company, and the Integrys Energy Services' net loss from continuing operations in 2008 and 2009 are removed. Resulting in diluted earnings per share - adjusted of $2.41 for 2009 compared with $2.51 for 2008.Last year, 2009, was a difficult year for many companies and a lot of our customers, and we did not escape the impact of a tough economy nor did we expect to. We are pleased that our performance allows us to report 2009 results that exceed our previously communicated guidance for the full year.This was due primarily to lower fuel and purchased power costs for our Electric Utility segment than we have forecasted earlier in 2009. Considering the difficult economic environment in 2009, it is no surprise that our sales volumes were negatively affected. We were able to partially mitigate the impacts through the decoupling mechanisms that we have in place in our jurisdictions for our regulated utility operations. However, we reached our decoupling cap relating to our electric utility in Wisconsin in the first half of 2009, which is why the lower sales volumes have had a relatively larger earnings impact in the second half of this year for 2009.on Slide 12, you will see that there are seven key items driving the $2.1 million quarter-over-quarter decrease in the fourth-quarter GAAP net income. Slide 13, is a similar chart that compares factors that drove the $197.3 million decrease in GAAP net income for the full year 2009 versus the same period a year ago. Additional detail related to the key drivers by segment for the fourth quarter and full year can be found on Slides 23 through 32, contained in the Appendix of the slide deck for today's presentation, in the news release we issued last evening and in the Form 10-K we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission last evening, which are also available on our website.Moving to Slide 14, I would like to refer you to the Appendix for the slides replicated from our February 17th Investor and Analyst Day presentation for detail on our financing, recent favorable credit rating agency action, capital expenditure plans, utility depreciation, utility rate base growth and a simplified cash flow model.Slides 15 and 16 cover our diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011, which is the same information we presented last week in New York. We are now providing diluted earnings per share guidance for all of Integrys Energy Group instead of on a diluted earnings per share - adjusted basis, which we have provided in November during our third quarter conference call. As indicated on Slide 15, we expect our 2010 diluted earnings per share to be between the $3.09 and $3.37. Our guidance related to the Integrys Energy Services' other line includes gains and losses and certain other impacts related to divestiture transactions, restructuring costs related to Integrys Energy Services, net non-cash gains or losses related to derivative accounting, and a non-cash impact on margin resulting from inventory adjustments made in prior periods. Our guidance does not include any Integrys Energy Group restructuring costs related to the reduction in workforce that is currently in progress, other than those related to Integrys Energy Services.Slide 16, shows our guidance for 2011. We expect 2011 diluted earnings per share to be between $3.28 and $3.61. Our guidance for the Integrys Energy Services' other line includes net non-cash gains and losses related to derivative accounting, the non-cash impact on margin resulting from inventory adjustments made in prior periods, and certain impacts related to divestiture transactions. Now I will turn the call back over to Charlie Schrock."

Turning to Slide 17, I will summarize the key points from today's call before we take your questions. We completed five rate cases in 2009 and early 2010, made progress on our operational excellence initiatives and put certain mechanisms in place to improve the predictability of our regulated utilities. In 2010, we will be filing general rate cases for Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power. These efforts will move our utilities closer to earning their authorized returns on equity over time. At Integrys Energy Services, we achieved our key strategic objectives by reducing the amount of invested capital and collateral support requirements. We are exiting the wholesale portions of the business, and over all, have significantly reduced the scale of operations and risk profile of this business. We have refocused in remaining Non-regulated Retail Natural Gas and Retail Electric Marketing operations, while allowing room for controlled growth in the future. From a corporate perspective, we have taken steps to improve our productivity and processes throughout the company, resulting in more streamlined and efficient operations.Moving onto Slide 18, future earnings will be driven by our utilities and complemented by our non-regulated operations. This will be achieved by investing approximately $1.2 billion in regulated utility capital projects between 2010 and 2012. These investments in our utilities will be for environmental controls, renewable portfolio standards and infrastructure improvements. The infrastructure investment in Chicago will be done in accordance with the Rider ICR, which the Illinois Commerce Commission approved in our last rate case at Peoples Gas. Additionally for our regulated utilities, we will file rate cases when appropriate. This will be complemented by controlled growth at our Non-regulated Energy Services business. All of these efforts will be accompanied by continually focusing on operational excellence and cost controls that we'll deliver on our financial commitments. We also expect to continue achieving earnings growth for our investment in American Transmission Company. On February 16, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.68 per share, payable on March 20, to shareholders of record on February 26, 2010.The dividend was maintained at the same amount as the previous quarterly dividend declaration. While this remains subject to quarterly review by our Board of Directors, management is confident that with a dividend at this level, the successful execution of our business plan will lead to a reasonable payout ratio over time.We are reaffirming the diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011 that we provided on February 17, 2010, as well as an expected 4% to 6% growth rate on an average annualized basis using 2011 as the base year through 2015.

One caution, however, is that's what's completely on the books for the Retail business, and we continue to go through some restructuring, most notable in the Texas market. And at year end, we had about 5.5 million megawatt hours in that forward book related to primarily Texas where we won't be going forward. The way to think about our sales goals that we've outlined in 2011, as well as visibility that I provided for 2010 in this table, is to look both at what we currently have contracted up. And for the Retail Electric business, when I strip out those markets again, notable to taxes that we will not be remaining and we don't really include that in that forward projection that we have provided at the analyst meeting, we've got, for 2010, about 10.8 million-megawatt hours currently contracted up. And as you saw on the slides, we've got a sales goal and expectation for ourselves of about 16.5 million megawatt hours. So we have 65% of the 2010 business, contracted up coming into the year. Now that's a little lower than historically has been the case. 2008 which was a more normal year, we had 83% of our 2009 volumes on the books at the end of 2008. So you could look at that and say, ""these guys have a little bit more headwind than they have in the past."" But keep in mind, that we have really had this business throttled back over the course of 2009. And with the restructuring in place and our financings getting configured, the sales force is now back in the market, signing customers up consistent with the new targets that we have in the markets that we have identified. So there's certainly some kind of pent-up demand, if you will, among our customer base in the markets that we're in. And we really expect that growth to come through organic growth, we don't project acquisitions to facilitate this but through organic growth in the markets that we operate. And we have some confidence around that because while the Illinois market, we've got significant share, we continue to see growth there. The entering of some of our Eastern markets, particularly like Mid-Atlantic and New England, we have entered those a few years ago and really as a growth play. And so we're at the early stages of the growth curve in those markets, and that's what gives us confidence associated with being able to reach those goals in 2010. And 2010 is really that stepping stone to 2011. The other thing to keep in mind is that it's not just a volume gain. It's really about the overall margins that you take away from the business, and our margins are running a little bit ahead of plan at this point. So while our volumes are 65% of plan, margins, when we look at it, we're a little better than that, probably closer to 75% or 80% of plan. On the GAAP side, the exiting the Canadian business, significant impacts to be sure, that was a very high-volume business. And you can see actual volumes in that same supplemental data pack. You can see our actual volumes on a  prior page. Retail Natural Gas sales in 2008 were like 336 Bcf, 236 Bcf in 2009, as we lost the tail end of the year for the Canadian business. And that's why we're projecting about 118 Bcf in 2010 for that business that remains. Now we have, today, in the forward book about 76 Bcf of volume associated with markets that will stay and you'll note that's very, very similar to the total portfolio that we have described in that supplemental data pack because the markets -- we're essentially, the markets that we have on the books today are essentially the markets that we're going to be in. And of that 118 Bcf plan for the year, we have 76 Bcf under contract, so about 65% , that's very, very consistent with historical practice. Kind of coming into the year with about 60% to 65% of our gas sales volumes under contract. So we're very, very comfortable with achieving our gas objectives."

We do some cost allocation internally, but it's not really disclosure-agreed data. So I think the thing to look at, the thing to focus on more so than just that $0.50 to $0.55, is the margin level of the Retail business versus the margins that we are projecting. And with each release, we've provided both our realized margins and our non-cash margins, split by retail and wholesale. You can look back to those and focus just on the retail-realized margins to get a sense for the levels that we're at. But to really cut to the chase, I mean, it's a true statement that the Retail business on a standalone basis, historically, would not have earned at these levels. We have structured this business to focus on current period results, taking the emphasis away from growth. We have a lot of expense and investment that we were making in growing into new markets. We've backed away from that, now growing just within the control parameters that should earlier that Charlie referred to. And that results in a business that performs much better on how we measured as a return on invested capital, and we have a much higher expectation for this business going forward than it had performed in the past, because it's a different business, operating in a different environment."

What we do tend to see is the change in contracting behavior on the part of customers.

On February 17, we hosted an Investor and Analyst Day in New York. A webcast of each presentation and question-and-answer session is archived on our website, and the associated slides are available there as well.We had approximately 40 people joining us in person for that event, and many more listened to the webcast. And we appreciate your interest in the company, and we thank you for your participation. For those who are unable to participate, I encourage you to review the materials from the event, as they cover in detail our regulated utility operations, the results of our Integrys Energy Services strategy change, our restructured non-regulated business and detailed financial information. We also discussed our decision to maintain our quarterly dividend at its current level, and management's confidence that successful execution of our business plan will lead to a reasonable payout ratio over time. Today, as listed on the agenda on Slide 6, I will provide an overview of 2009, as well as the key takeaways from the Investor and Analyst Day. Joe O'Leary will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results, and our diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011. Finally, we will be happy to take your questions, either on our fourth quarter and full-year results for 2009, or on any information that we discussed at our event last week.Turning to Slide 7, we are pleased to report 2009 diluted earnings per share – adjusted results of $2.41, which exceeds our previously communicated 2009 diluted earnings per share - adjusted guidance range of $2.26 to $2.38. We are continuing on a deliberate path that will bring our utilities closer to earning their authorized returns on equity over time. We are advancing along this path with the operational progress that we made through our two-pronged approach to achieving this goal. First, we completed a number of rate cases during 2009 and early 2010. Second, we are continually making progress on our operational excellence initiatives to further streamline and improve the efficiency of our operations.Another major accomplishment is that we met our key strategic objectives for Integrys Energy Services. We substantially reduced the invested capital and collateral support requirements of this business. Upon completion of our announced transactions, we would have exited wholesale operations, and we have refocused the remaining non-regulated retail natural gas marketing and retail electric marketing operations to achieve a platform for controlled growth within acceptable parameters.These accomplishments in our regulated and non-regulated operations position us well for 2010 and beyond. I would now like to briefly review the key takeaways for our regulated and non-regulated operations from our Investor and Analyst Day last week. In our regulated business, covered on Slide 8, our objective is to bring each utility closer to earning as authorized return on equity. As I said earlier, one major way that we are doing this is through cost control efforts focused on operational excellence, and timely and regular filings of rate cases when appropriate. We've also been able to incorporate mechanisms that help us achieve more predictable earnings over time. The decoupling and bad debt riders that we have in place from several of our jurisdictions are examples of these mechanisms. Our rate base will grow through investment in capital projects needed for environmental compliance, renewable portfolio standard mandates, and maintaining and improving our infrastructure.American Transmission Company will continue to positively impact our earnings. Although this is an equity investment for us, we treat this investment as a separate reportable segment. We have included American Transmission Company on this slide, under the category of Regulated Operations, because the ATC is subject to regulation via the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. And finally, but no less than importantly, our commitment to continuous improvements in operational excellence and cost controls will allow us to deliver on our financial expectations while delivering safe, reliable and outstanding customer service.Slide 9, shows our potential earnings growth for 2008 and 2009's financial results, associated with our efforts to have our regulated utilities earn closer to their authorized returns on equity. You can find the 2008 and 2009 data for each utility in the Appendix of the presentation. We have also displayed estimates of our earnings potential for our regulated Natural Gas and Regulated Electric segments for 2010 and 2011, which we calculated using the midpoint of the 2010 and 2011 diluted earnings per share guidance range that we presented at the Investor and Analyst Day last week.Although we are confident with the diluted earnings per share guidance ranges that we have provided to you, I do want to stress that the figures you see for 2010 and 2011 are estimates to give you an idea of the improving trends in earnings that we expect to deliver in the next two years. The actual results could vary by as much as $5 million to $10 million either way, and still remain within our guidance range.Consistent with what we said during our presentation last week, the earnings shortfall between what was authorized and what was actually earned for all of our regulated utilities, increased in 2009, going from about $45 million in 2008 to about $57 million in 2009. Given the economy and the timing of rate cases, this was not unexpected. And while we experience a decline in utility earnings from 2008 to 2009, the longer-term trends shows improvement. A closer look at the individual utility results also shows the progress we are making. For example, Minnesota Energy Resources' financial results for 2009 showed that it has slightly exceeded its allowed return on equity, and Michigan Gas Utilities' financial results showed an improvement in earnings. Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas were involved in rate cases in 2009, with new rates going into effect in late January of 2010, which will lead to an improvement in earnings for these companies as well. Wisconsin Public Service's 2009 financial results were impacted by a shortfall in sales and limitations of the decoupling cap at the electric utility.  We will be filing a rate case for the Wisconsin Public Service in April, and expect its earnings to improve upon implementation of new rates in 2011. So in total, we are expecting a substantial improvement in the utility earnings for 2010, which is the first full year that the recent rate cases are in effect. We expect the shortfall to be reduced to approximately $37 million in total, roughly $20 million for the Natural Gas Utility business, and $17 million for the Electric business.From 2010 and 2011, there is a bit of lumpiness as the expected increase in the Electric Utility segment, due to anticipated rate case awards will be somewhat offset by a decline at Peoples Gas and North Shore gas, which will be in a rate case filing year. Again, I want to emphasize that these are estimates using the diluted-earnings-per-share guidance midpoint, and the actual numbers will vary. Nevertheless, we believe that the improve in trend will continue in 2011 when we expect the total shortfall to be approximately $34 million, roughly $25 million for the Natural Gas Utility business, and $9 million for the Electric business. One of our major strategic objectives is to bring our utilities closer to earning their authorized returns on equity over time. Due to the inherent nature of the regulatory process in terms of timing and typical disallowances, complete eradication of the shortfalls is probably not likely. However, we will keep trying to improve on that number as much as we can through our operational excellence program and rate case filings when they are appropriate.In our Non-Regulated business covered on Slide 10, we are pleased to have achieved our strategic objectives for Integrys Energy Services. We are completely exiting the wholesale portions of this business. We have restructured the remaining portions of our Non-Regulated business, which now encompasses Retail Electric and Retail Natural Gas marketing, and solar and other renewable energy projects. And we have restructured it, so that is positioned for controlled growth.Our refocused Non-regulated Retail Customer business is lower risk and more predictable than our prior integrated business, and our new renewable energy projects will focus on customer-sited solar and renewable contracted asset development. Our commitment to operational excellence extends to Integrys Energy Services as well, and we will make improvements in that arena as we continue to provide exceptional energy solutions for our customers.With that, I will now turn the call over to Joe O'Leary."

I will cover our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009, as well as our annual diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011. Beginning with Slide 9, during the fourth quarter of 2009, in accordance with generally accep",804,"Thanks, Charlie. I will cover our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009, as well as our annual diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011. Beginning with Slide 9, during the fourth quarter of 2009, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP, we recognize total diluted earnings per share of $0.31 for the quarter ended December 31, 2009, compared with $0.33 for the same quarter in 2008. To arrive at diluted earnings per share - adjusted for the quarter, 2009 expenses relating to our reductions in the workforce at the regulated utilities and holding company are added back, as is Integrys Energy Services' net loss from continuing operations in 2009 and 2008.Diluted earnings per share - adjusted was $0.49 for the quarter of 2009, compared with $0.68 for the same period in 2008. For the full year 2009, on a GAAP basis, we experienced a net loss per share of $0.92, compared with net income of $1.64 per diluted share for the full year 2008. To arrive at diluted earnings per share - adjusted, the non-cash goodwill impairment losses for our Natural Gas Utility segment, expenses related to our reductions in the workforce at the regulated utilities and holding company, and the Integrys Energy Services' net loss from continuing operations in 2008 and 2009 are removed. Resulting in diluted earnings per share - adjusted of $2.41 for 2009 compared with $2.51 for 2008.Last year, 2009, was a difficult year for many companies and a lot of our customers, and we did not escape the impact of a tough economy nor did we expect to. We are pleased that our performance allows us to report 2009 results that exceed our previously communicated guidance for the full year.This was due primarily to lower fuel and purchased power costs for our Electric Utility segment than we have forecasted earlier in 2009. Considering the difficult economic environment in 2009, it is no surprise that our sales volumes were negatively affected. We were able to partially mitigate the impacts through the decoupling mechanisms that we have in place in our jurisdictions for our regulated utility operations. However, we reached our decoupling cap relating to our electric utility in Wisconsin in the first half of 2009, which is why the lower sales volumes have had a relatively larger earnings impact in the second half of this year for 2009.on Slide 12, you will see that there are seven key items driving the $2.1 million quarter-over-quarter decrease in the fourth-quarter GAAP net income. Slide 13, is a similar chart that compares factors that drove the $197.3 million decrease in GAAP net income for the full year 2009 versus the same period a year ago. Additional detail related to the key drivers by segment for the fourth quarter and full year can be found on Slides 23 through 32, contained in the Appendix of the slide deck for today's presentation, in the news release we issued last evening and in the Form 10-K we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission last evening, which are also available on our website.Moving to Slide 14, I would like to refer you to the Appendix for the slides replicated from our February 17th Investor and Analyst Day presentation for detail on our financing, recent favorable credit rating agency action, capital expenditure plans, utility depreciation, utility rate base growth and a simplified cash flow model.Slides 15 and 16 cover our diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011, which is the same information we presented last week in New York. We are now providing diluted earnings per share guidance for all of Integrys Energy Group instead of on a diluted earnings per share - adjusted basis, which we have provided in November during our third quarter conference call. As indicated on Slide 15, we expect our 2010 diluted earnings per share to be between the $3.09 and $3.37. Our guidance related to the Integrys Energy Services' other line includes gains and losses and certain other impacts related to divestiture transactions, restructuring costs related to Integrys Energy Services, net non-cash gains or losses related to derivative accounting, and a non-cash impact on margin resulting from inventory adjustments made in prior periods. Our guidance does not include any Integrys Energy Group restructuring costs related to the reduction in workforce that is currently in progress, other than those related to Integrys Energy Services.Slide 16, shows our guidance for 2011. We expect 2011 diluted earnings per share to be between $3.28 and $3.61. Our guidance for the Integrys Energy Services' other line includes net non-cash gains and losses related to derivative accounting, the non-cash impact on margin resulting from inventory adjustments made in prior periods, and certain impacts related to divestiture transactions. Now I will turn the call back over to Charlie Schrock."

Turning to Slide 17, I will summarize the key points from today's call before we take your questions. We completed five rate cases in 2009 and early 2010, made progress on our operational excellence initiatives and put certain mechanisms in place to improve the predictability of our regulated utilities. In 2010, we will be filing general rate cases for Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power. These efforts will move our utilities closer to earning their authorized returns on equity over time. At Integrys Energy Services, we achieved our key strategic objectives by reducing the amount of invested capital and collateral support requirements. We are exiting the wholesale portions of the business, and over all, have significantly reduced the scale of operations and risk profile of this business. We have refocused in remaining Non-regulated Retail Natural Gas and Retail Electric Marketing operations, while allowing room for controlled growth in the future. From a corporate perspective, we have taken steps to improve our productivity and processes throughout the company, resulting in more streamlined and efficient operations.Moving onto Slide 18, future earnings will be driven by our utilities and complemented by our non-regulated operations. This will be achieved by investing approximately $1.2 billion in regulated utility capital projects between 2010 and 2012. These investments in our utilities will be for environmental controls, renewable portfolio standards and infrastructure improvements. The infrastructure investment in Chicago will be done in accordance with the Rider ICR, which the Illinois Commerce Commission approved in our last rate case at Peoples Gas. Additionally for our regulated utilities, we will file rate cases when appropriate. This will be complemented by controlled growth at our Non-regulated Energy Services business. All of these efforts will be accompanied by continually focusing on operational excellence and cost controls that we'll deliver on our financial commitments. We also expect to continue achieving earnings growth for our investment in American Transmission Company. On February 16, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.68 per share, payable on March 20, to shareholders of record on February 26, 2010.The dividend was maintained at the same amount as the previous quarterly dividend declaration. While this remains subject to quarterly review by our Board of Directors, management is confident that with a dividend at this level, the successful execution of our business plan will lead to a reasonable payout ratio over time.We are reaffirming the diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011 that we provided on February 17, 2010, as well as an expected 4% to 6% growth rate on an average annualized basis using 2011 as the base year through 2015.

One caution, however, is that's what's completely on the books for the Retail business, and we continue to go through some restructuring, most notable in the Texas market. And at year end, we had about 5.5 million megawatt hours in that forward book related to primarily Texas where we won't be going forward. The way to think about our sales goals that we've outlined in 2011, as well as visibility that I provided for 2010 in this table, is to look both at what we currently have contracted up. And for the Retail Electric business, when I strip out those markets again, notable to taxes that we will not be remaining and we don't really include that in that forward projection that we have provided at the analyst meeting, we've got, for 2010, about 10.8 million-megawatt hours currently contracted up. And as you saw on the slides, we've got a sales goal and expectation for ourselves of about 16.5 million megawatt hours. So we have 65% of the 2010 business, contracted up coming into the year. Now that's a little lower than historically has been the case. 2008 which was a more normal year, we had 83% of our 2009 volumes on the books at the end of 2008. So you could look at that and say, ""these guys have a little bit more headwind than they have in the past."" But keep in mind, that we have really had this business throttled back over the course of 2009. And with the restructuring in place and our financings getting configured, the sales force is now back in the market, signing customers up consistent with the new targets that we have in the markets that we have identified. So there's certainly some kind of pent-up demand, if you will, among our customer base in the markets that we're in. And we really expect that growth to come through organic growth, we don't project acquisitions to facilitate this but through organic growth in the markets that we operate. And we have some confidence around that because while the Illinois market, we've got significant share, we continue to see growth there. The entering of some of our Eastern markets, particularly like Mid-Atlantic and New England, we have entered those a few years ago and really as a growth play. And so we're at the early stages of the growth curve in those markets, and that's what gives us confidence associated with being able to reach those goals in 2010. And 2010 is really that stepping stone to 2011. The other thing to keep in mind is that it's not just a volume gain. It's really about the overall margins that you take away from the business, and our margins are running a little bit ahead of plan at this point. So while our volumes are 65% of plan, margins, when we look at it, we're a little better than that, probably closer to 75% or 80% of plan. On the GAAP side, the exiting the Canadian business, significant impacts to be sure, that was a very high-volume business. And you can see actual volumes in that same supplemental data pack. You can see our actual volumes on a  prior page. Retail Natural Gas sales in 2008 were like 336 Bcf, 236 Bcf in 2009, as we lost the tail end of the year for the Canadian business. And that's why we're projecting about 118 Bcf in 2010 for that business that remains. Now we have, today, in the forward book about 76 Bcf of volume associated with markets that will stay and you'll note that's very, very similar to the total portfolio that we have described in that supplemental data pack because the markets -- we're essentially, the markets that we have on the books today are essentially the markets that we're going to be in. And of that 118 Bcf plan for the year, we have 76 Bcf under contract, so about 65% , that's very, very consistent with historical practice. Kind of coming into the year with about 60% to 65% of our gas sales volumes under contract. So we're very, very comfortable with achieving our gas objectives."

And with each release, we've provided both our realized margins and our non-cash margins, split by retail and wholesale. You can look back to those and focus just on the retail-realized margins to get a sense for the levels that we're at. But to really cut to the chase, I mean, it's a true statement that the Retail business on a standalone basis, historically, would not have earned at these levels. We have structured this business to focus on current period results, taking the emphasis away from growth. We have a lot of expense and investment that we were making in growing into new markets. We've backed away from that, now growing just within the control parameters that should earlier that Charlie referred to. And that results in a business that performs much better on how we measured as a return on invested capital, and we have a much higher expectation for this business going forward than it had performed in the past, because it's a different business, operating in a different environment."

And that's the majority of our Electric business. On the gas side, it's fully competitive. So there's no regulated offer that distorts market prices.

On February 17, we hosted an Investor and Analyst Day in New York. A webcast of each presentation and question-and-answer session is archived on our website, and the associated slides are available there as well.We had approximately 40 people joining us in person for that event, and many more listened to the webcast. And we appreciate your interest in the company, and we thank you for your participation. For those who are unable to participate, I encourage you to review the materials from the event, as they cover in detail our regulated utility operations, the results of our Integrys Energy Services strategy change, our restructured non-regulated business and detailed financial information. We also discussed our decision to maintain our quarterly dividend at its current level, and management's confidence that successful execution of our business plan will lead to a reasonable payout ratio over time. Today, as listed on the agenda on Slide 6, I will provide an overview of 2009, as well as the key takeaways from the Investor and Analyst Day. Joe O'Leary will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results, and our diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011. Finally, we will be happy to take your questions, either on our fourth quarter and full-year results for 2009, or on any information that we discussed at our event last week.Turning to Slide 7, we are pleased to report 2009 diluted earnings per share – adjusted results of $2.41, which exceeds our previously communicated 2009 diluted earnings per share - adjusted guidance range of $2.26 to $2.38. We are continuing on a deliberate path that will bring our utilities closer to earning their authorized returns on equity over time. We are advancing along this path with the operational progress that we made through our two-pronged approach to achieving this goal. First, we completed a number of rate cases during 2009 and early 2010. Second, we are continually making progress on our operational excellence initiatives to further streamline and improve the efficiency of our operations.Another major accomplishment is that we met our key strategic objectives for Integrys Energy Services. We substantially reduced the invested capital and collateral support requirements of this business. Upon completion of our announced transactions, we would have exited wholesale operations, and we have refocused the remaining non-regulated retail natural gas marketing and retail electric marketing operations to achieve a platform for controlled growth within acceptable parameters.These accomplishments in our regulated and non-regulated operations position us well for 2010 and beyond. I would now like to briefly review the key takeaways for our regulated and non-regulated operations from our Investor and Analyst Day last week. In our regulated business, covered on Slide 8, our objective is to bring each utility closer to earning as authorized return on equity. As I said earlier, one major way that we are doing this is through cost control efforts focused on operational excellence, and timely and regular filings of rate cases when appropriate. We've also been able to incorporate mechanisms that help us achieve more predictable earnings over time. The decoupling and bad debt riders that we have in place from several of our jurisdictions are examples of these mechanisms. Our rate base will grow through investment in capital projects needed for environmental compliance, renewable portfolio standard mandates, and maintaining and improving our infrastructure.American Transmission Company will continue to positively impact our earnings. Although this is an equity investment for us, we treat this investment as a separate reportable segment. We have included American Transmission Company on this slide, under the category of Regulated Operations, because the ATC is subject to regulation via the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. And finally, but no less than importantly, our commitment to continuous improvements in operational excellence and cost controls will allow us to deliver on our financial expectations while delivering safe, reliable and outstanding customer service.Slide 9, shows our potential earnings growth for 2008 and 2009's financial results, associated with our efforts to have our regulated utilities earn closer to their authorized returns on equity. You can find the 2008 and 2009 data for each utility in the Appendix of the presentation. We have also displayed estimates of our earnings potential for our regulated Natural Gas and Regulated Electric segments for 2010 and 2011, which we calculated using the midpoint of the 2010 and 2011 diluted earnings per share guidance range that we presented at the Investor and Analyst Day last week.Although we are confident with the diluted earnings per share guidance ranges that we have provided to you, I do want to stress that the figures you see for 2010 and 2011 are estimates to give you an idea of the improving trends in earnings that we expect to deliver in the next two years. The actual results could vary by as much as $5 million to $10 million either way, and still remain within our guidance range.Consistent with what we said during our presentation last week, the earnings shortfall between what was authorized and what was actually earned for all of our regulated utilities, increased in 2009, going from about $45 million in 2008 to about $57 million in 2009. Given the economy and the timing of rate cases, this was not unexpected. And while we experience a decline in utility earnings from 2008 to 2009, the longer-term trends shows improvement. A closer look at the individual utility results also shows the progress we are making. For example, Minnesota Energy Resources' financial results for 2009 showed that it has slightly exceeded its allowed return on equity, and Michigan Gas Utilities' financial results showed an improvement in earnings. Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas were involved in rate cases in 2009, with new rates going into effect in late January of 2010, which will lead to an improvement in earnings for these companies as well. Wisconsin Public Service's 2009 financial results were impacted by a shortfall in sales and limitations of the decoupling cap at the electric utility.  We will be filing a rate case for the Wisconsin Public Service in April, and expect its earnings to improve upon implementation of new rates in 2011. So in total, we are expecting a substantial improvement in the utility earnings for 2010, which is the first full year that the recent rate cases are in effect. We expect the shortfall to be reduced to approximately $37 million in total, roughly $20 million for the Natural Gas Utility business, and $17 million for the Electric business.From 2010 and 2011, there is a bit of lumpiness as the expected increase in the Electric Utility segment, due to anticipated rate case awards will be somewhat offset by a decline at Peoples Gas and North Shore gas, which will be in a rate case filing year. Again, I want to emphasize that these are estimates using the diluted-earnings-per-share guidance midpoint, and the actual numbers will vary. Nevertheless, we believe that the improve in trend will continue in 2011 when we expect the total shortfall to be approximately $34 million, roughly $25 million for the Natural Gas Utility business, and $9 million for the Electric business. One of our major strategic objectives is to bring our utilities closer to earning their authorized returns on equity over time. Due to the inherent nature of the regulatory process in terms of timing and typical disallowances, complete eradication of the shortfalls is probably not likely. However, we will keep trying to improve on that number as much as we can through our operational excellence program and rate case filings when they are appropriate.In our Non-Regulated business covered on Slide 10, we are pleased to have achieved our strategic objectives for Integrys Energy Services. We are completely exiting the wholesale portions of this business. We have restructured the remaining portions of our Non-Regulated business, which now encompasses Retail Electric and Retail Natural Gas marketing, and solar and other renewable energy projects. And we have restructured it, so that is positioned for controlled growth.Our refocused Non-regulated Retail Customer business is lower risk and more predictable than our prior integrated business, and our new renewable energy projects will focus on customer-sited solar and renewable contracted asset development. Our commitment to operational excellence extends to Integrys Energy Services as well, and we will make improvements in that arena as we continue to provide exceptional energy solutions for our customers.With that, I will now turn the call over to Joe O'Leary."

I will cover our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009, as well as our annual diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011. Beginning with Slide 9, during the fourth quarter of 2009, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP, we recognize total diluted earnings per share of $0.31 for the quarter ended December 31, 2009, compared with $0.33 for the same quarter in 2008. To arrive at diluted earnings per share - adjusted for the quarter, 2009 expenses relating to our reductions in the workforce at the regulated utilities and holding company are added back, as is Integrys Energy Services' net loss from continuing operations in 2009 and 2008.Diluted earnings per share - adjusted was $0.49 for the quarter of 2009, compared with $0.68 for the same period in 2008. For the full year 2009, on a GAAP basis, we experienced a net loss per share of $0.92, compared with net income of $1.64 per diluted share for the full year 2008. To arrive at diluted earnings per share - adjusted, the non-cash goodwill impairment losses for our Natural Gas Utility segment, expenses related to our reductions in the workforce at the regulated utilities and holding company, and the Integrys Energy Services' net loss from continuing operations in 2008 and 2009 are removed. Resulting in diluted earnings per share - adjusted of $2.41 for 2009 compared with $2.51 for 2008.Last year, 2009, was a difficult year for many companies and a lot of our customers, and we did not escape the impact of a tough economy nor did we expect to. We are pleased that our performance allows us to report 2009 results that exceed our previously communicated guidance for the full year.This was due primarily to lower fuel and purchased power costs for our Electric Utility segment than we have forecasted earlier in 2009. Considering the difficult economic environment in 2009, it is no surprise that our sales volumes were negatively affected. We were able to partially mitigate the impacts through the decoupling mechanisms that we have in place in our jurisdictions for our regulated utility operations. However, we reached our decoupling cap relating to our electric utility in Wisconsin in the first half of 2009, which is why the lower sales volumes have had a relatively larger earnings impact in the second half of this year for 2009.on Slide 12, you will see that there are seven key items driving the $2.1 million quarter-over-quarter decrease in the fourth-quarter GAAP net income. Slide 13, is a similar chart that compares factors that drove the $197.3 million decrease in GAAP net income for the full year 2009 versus the same period a year ago. Additional detail related to the key drivers by segment for the fourth quarter and full year can be found on Slides 23 through 32, contained in the Appendix of the slide deck for today's presentation, in the news release we issued last evening and in the Form 10-K we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission last evening, which are also available on our website.Moving to Slide 14, I would like to refer you to the Appendix for the slides replicated from our February 17th Investor and Analyst Day presentation for detail on our financing, recent favorable credit rating agency action, capital expenditure plans, utility depreciation, utility rate base growth and a simplified cash flow model.Slides 15 and 16 cover our diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011, which is the same information we presented last week in New York. We are now providing diluted earnings per share guidance for all of Integrys Energy Group instead of on a diluted earnings per share - adjusted basis, which we have provided in November during our third quarter conference call. As indicated on Slide 15, we expect our 2010 diluted earnings per share to be between the $3.09 and $3.37. Our guidance related to the Integrys Energy Services' other line includes gains and losses and certain other impacts related to divestiture transactions, restructuring costs related to Integrys Energy Services, net non-cash gains or losses related to derivative accounting, and a non-cash impact on margin resulting from inventory adjustments made in prior periods. Our guidance does not include any Integrys Energy Group restructuring costs related to the reduction in workforce that is currently in progress, other than those related to Integrys Energy Services.Slide 16, shows our guidance for 2011. We expect 2011 diluted earnings per share to be between $3.28 and $3.61. Our guidance for the Integrys Energy Services' other line includes net non-cash gains and losses related to derivative accounting, the non-cash impact on margin resulting from inventory adjustments made in prior periods, and certain impacts related to divestiture transactions. Now I will turn the call back over to Charlie Schrock."

Turning to Slide 17, I will summarize the key points from today's call before we take your questions. We completed five rate cases in 2009 and early 2010, made progress on our operational excellence initiatives and put certain mechanisms in place to improve the predictability of our regulated utilities. In 2010, we will be filing general rate cases for Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power. These efforts will move our utilities closer to earning their authorized returns on equity over time. At Integrys Energy Services, we achieved our key strategic objectives by reducing the amount of invested capital and collateral support requirements. We are exiting the wholesale portions of the business, and over all, have significantly reduced the scale of operations and risk profile of this business. We have refocused in remaining Non-regulated Retail Natural Gas and Retail Electric Marketing operations, while allowing room for controlled growth in the future. From a corporate perspective, we have taken steps to improve our productivity and processes throughout the company, resulting in more streamlined and efficient operations.Moving onto Slide 18, future earnings will be driven by our utilities and complemented by our non-regulated operations. This will be achieved by investing approximately $1.2 billion in regulated utility capital projects between 2010 and 2012. These investments in our utilities will be for environmental controls, renewable portfolio standards and infrastructure improvements. The infrastructure investment in Chicago will be done in accordance with the Rider ICR, which the Illinois Commerce Commission approved in our last rate case at Peoples Gas. Additionally for our regulated utilities, we will file rate cases when appropriate. This will be complemented by controlled growth at our Non-regulated Energy Services business. All of these efforts will be accompanied by continually focusing on operational excellence and cost controls that we'll deliver on our financial commitments. We also expect to continue achieving earnings growth for our investment in American Transmission Company. On February 16, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.68 per share, payable on March 20, to shareholders of record on February 26, 2010.The dividend was maintained at the same amount as the previous quarterly dividend declaration. While this remains subject to quarterly review by our Board of Directors, management is confident that with a dividend at this level, the successful execution of our business plan will lead to a reasonable payout ratio over time.We are reaffirming the diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011 that we provided on February 17, 2010, as well as an expected 4% to 6% growth rate on an average annualized basis using 2011 as the base year through 2015.

One caution, however, is that's what's completely on the books for the Retail business, and we continue to go through some restructuring, most notable in the Texas market. And at year end, we had about 5.5 million megawatt hours in that forward book related to primarily Texas where we won't be going forward. The way to think about our sales goals that we've outlined in 2011, as well as visibility that I provided for 2010 in this table, is to look both at what we currently have contracted up. And for the Retail Electric business, when I strip out those markets again, notable to taxes that we will not be remaining and we don't really include that in that forward projection that we have provided at the analyst meeting, we've got, for 2010, about 10.8 million-megawatt hours currently contracted up. And as you saw on the slides, we've got a sales goal and expectation for ourselves of about 16.5 million megawatt hours. So we have 65% of the 2010 business, contracted up coming into the year. Now that's a little lower than historically has been the case. 2008 which was a more normal year, we had 83% of our 2009 volumes on the books at the end of 2008. So you could look at that and say, ""these guys have a little bit more headwind than they have in the past."" But keep in mind, that we have really had this business throttled back over the course of 2009. And with the restructuring in place and our financings getting configured, the sales force is now back in the market, signing customers up consistent with the new targets that we have in the markets that we have identified. So there's certainly some kind of pent-up demand, if you will, among our customer base in the markets that we're in. And we really expect that growth to come through organic growth, we don't project acquisitions to facilitate this but through organic growth in the markets that we operate. And we have some confidence around that because while the Illinois market, we've got significant share, we continue to see growth there. The entering of some of our Eastern markets, particularly like Mid-Atlantic and New England, we have entered those a few years ago and really as a growth play. And so we're at the early stages of the growth curve in those markets, and that's what gives us confidence associated with being able to reach those goals in 2010. And 2010 is really that stepping stone to 2011. The other thing to keep in mind is that it's not just a volume gain. It's really about the overall margins that you take away from the business, and our margins are running a little bit ahead of plan at this point. So while our volumes are 65% of plan, margins, when we look at it, we're a little better than that, probably closer to 75% or 80% of plan. On the GAAP side, the exiting the Canadian business, significant impacts to be sure, that was a very high-volume business. And you can see actual volumes in that same supplemental data pack. You can see our actual volumes on a  prior page. Retail Natural Gas sales in 2008 were like 336 Bcf, 236 Bcf in 2009, as we lost the tail end of the year for the Canadian business. And that's why we're projecting about 118 Bcf in 2010 for that business that remains. Now we have, today, in the forward book about 76 Bcf of volume associated with markets that will stay and you'll note that's very, very similar to the total portfolio that we have described in that supplemental data pack because the markets -- we're essentially, the markets that we have on the books today are essentially the markets that we're going to be in. And of that 118 Bcf plan for the year, we have 76 Bcf under contract, so about 65% , that's very, very consistent with historical practice. Kind of coming into the year with about 60% to 65% of our gas sales volumes under contract. So we're very, very comfortable with achieving our gas objectives."

We do some cost allocation internally, but it's not really disclosure-agreed data. So I think the thing to look at, the thing to focus on more so than just that $0.50 to $0.55, is the margin level of the Retail business versus the margins that we are projecting. And with each release, we've provided both our realized margins and our non-cash margins, split by retail and wholesale. You can look back to those and focus just on the retail-realized margins to get a sense for the levels that we're at. But to really cut to the chase, I mean, it's a true statement that the Retail business on a standalone basis, historically, would not have earned at these levels. We have structured this business to focus on current period results, taking the emphasis away from growth. We have a lot of expense and investment that we were making in growing into new markets. We've backed away from that, now growing just within the control parameters that should earlier that Charlie referred to. And that results in a business that performs much better on how we measured as a return on invested capital, and we have a much higher expectation for this business going forward than it had performed in the past, because it's a different business, operating in a different environment."

The healthiest markets from our perspective are those that customers can choose a standard offer that's based on prevailing market prices or choose an offer from a competitive supplier. And that's the majority of our Electric business. On the gas side, it's fully competitive. So there's no regulated offer that distorts market prices. What we do tend to see is the change in contracting behavior on the part of customers. As prices rise, they tend to maybe contract a little bit shorter term, get less aggressive in firming up their future commitments.

On February 17, we hosted an Investor and Analyst Day in New York. A webcast of each presentation and question-and-answer session is archived on our website, and the associated slides are available there as well.We had approximately 40 people joining us in person for that event, and many more listened to the webcast. And we appreciate your interest in the company, and we thank you for your participation. For those who are unable to participate, I encourage you to review the materials from the event, as they cover in detail our regulated utility operations, the results of our Integrys Energy Services strategy change, our restructured non-regulated business and detailed financial information. We also discussed our decision to maintain our quarterly dividend at its current level, and management's confidence that successful execution of our business plan will lead to a reasonable payout ratio over time. Today, as listed on the agenda on Slide 6 I will provide an overview of 2009, as well as the key takeaways from the Investor and Analyst Day. Joe O'Leary will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results, and our diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011. Finally, we will be happy to take your questions, either on our fourth quarter and full year results for 2009, or on any information that we discussed at our event last week.Turning to Slide 7, we are pleased to report 2009 diluted earnings per share adjusted results of $2.41, which exceeds our previously communicated 2009 diluted earnings per share adjusted guidance range of $2.26 to $2.38. We are continuing on a deliberate path that will bring our utilities closer to earning their authorized returns on equity over time. We are advancing along this path with the operational progress that we made through our two-pronged approach to achieving this goal. First, we completed a number of rate cases during 2009 and early 2010. Second, we are continually making progress on our operational excellence initiatives to further streamline and improve the efficiency of our operations.Another major accomplishment is that we met our key strategic objectives for Integrys Energy Services. We substantially reduced the invested capital and collateral support requirements of this business. Upon completion of our announced transactions, we will have exited wholesale operations, and we have refocused the remaining non-regulated retail natural gas marketing and retail electric marketing operations to achieve a platform for controlled growth within acceptable parameters. These accomplishments in our regulated and non-regulated operations position us well for 2010 and beyond. I would now like to briefly review the key takeaways for our regulated and non-regulated operations from our Investor and Analyst Day last week. In our regulated business, covered on Slide 8, our objective is to bring each utility closer to earning its authorized return on equity. As I said earlier, one major way that we are doing this is through cost control efforts focused on operational excellence, and timely and regular filings of rate cases when appropriate. We've also been able to incorporate mechanisms that help us achieve more predictable earnings over time. The decoupling and bad debt riders that we have in place in several of our jurisdictions are examples of these mechanisms. Our rate base will grow through investment in capital projects needed for environmental compliance, renewable portfolio standard mandates and maintaining and improving our infrastructure.American Transmission Company will continue to positively impact our earnings. Although this is an equity investment for us, we treat this investment as a separate reportable segment. We have included American Transmission Company on this slide, under the category of Regulated Operations, because the ATC is subject to regulation via the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. And finally, but no less importantly, our commitment to continuous improvements in operational excellence and cost controls will allow us to deliver on our financial expectations while delivering safe, reliable and outstanding customer service.Slide 9 shows our potential earnings growth for 2008 and 2009's financial results, associated with our efforts to have our regulated utilities earn closer to their authorized returns on equity. You can find the 2008 and 2009 data for each utility in the Appendix of the presentation. We have also displayed estimates of our earnings potential for our regulated natural gas and regulated electric segments for 2010 and 2011, which we calculated using the midpoint of the 2010 and 2011 diluted earnings per share guidance range that we presented at the Investor and Analyst Day last week.Although we are confident in the diluted earnings per share guidance ranges that we have provided to you, I do want to stress that the figures you see for 2010 and 2011 are estimates to give you an idea of the improving trends in earnings that we expect to deliver in the next two years. The actual results could vary by as much as $5 million to $10 million either way, and still remain within our guidance range.Consistent with what we said during our presentation last week, the earnings shortfall between what was authorized and what was actually earned for all of our regulated utilities increased in 2009, going from about $45 million in 2008 to about $57 million in 2009. Given the economy and the timing of rate cases, this was not unexpected. And while we experience a decline in utility earnings from 2008 to 2009, the longer-term trends shows improvement. A closer look at the individual utility results also shows the progress we are making. For example, Minnesota Energy Resources' financial results for 2009 showed that it has slightly exceeded its allowed return on equity, and Michigan Gas Utilities' financial results showed an improvement in earnings. Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas were involved in rate cases in 2009, with new rates going into effect in late January of 2010, which will lead to an improvement in earnings for these companies as well. Wisconsin Public Service's 2009 financial results were impacted by a shortfall in sales and limitations of the decoupling cap at the electric utility.  We will be filing a rate case for the Wisconsin Public Service in April, and expect its earnings to improve upon implementation of new rates in 2011. So in total, we are expecting a substantial improvement in the utility earnings for 2010, which is the first full year that the recent rate cases are in effect. We expect the shortfall to be reduced to approximately $37 million in total, roughly $20 million for the Natural Gas Utility business, and $17 million for the Electric business.From 2010 and 2011, there is a bit of lumpiness as the expected increase in the Electric Utility segment, due to anticipated rate case awards will be somewhat offset by a decline at Peoples Gas and North Shore gas, which will be in a rate case filing year. Again, I want to emphasize that these are estimates using the diluted-earnings-per-share guidance midpoint, and the actual numbers will vary. Nevertheless, we believe that the improve in trend will continue in 2011 when we expect the total shortfall to be approximately $34 million, roughly $25 million for the Natural Gas Utility business, and $9 million for the Electric business. One of our major strategic objectives is to bring our utilities closer to earning their authorized returns on equity over time. Due to the inherent nature of the regulatory process in terms of timing and typical disallowances, complete eradication of the shortfalls is probably not likely. However, we will keep trying to improve on that number as much as we can through our operational excellence program and rate case filings when they are appropriate.In our Non-Regulated business covered on Slide 10, we are pleased to have achieved our strategic objectives for Integrys Energy Services. We are completely exiting the wholesale portions of this business. We have restructured the remaining portions of our Non-Regulated business, which now encompasses Retail Electric and Retail Natural Gas marketing, and solar and other renewable energy projects. And we have restructured it, so that is positioned for controlled growth.Our refocused Non-regulated Retail Customer business is lower risk and more predictable than our prior integrated business, and our new renewable energy projects will focus on customer-sited solar and renewable contracted asset development. Our commitment to operational excellence extends to Integrys Energy Services as well, and we will make improvements in that arena as we continue to provide exceptional energy solutions for our customers.With that, I will now turn the call over to Joe O'Leary."

I will cover our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009, as well as our annual diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011.

I will cover our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009, as well as our annual diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011. Beginning with Slide 9, during the fourth quarter of 2009, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP, we recognize total diluted earnings per share of $0.31 for the quarter ended December 31, 2009, compared with $0.33 for the same quarter in 2008. To arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the quarter, 2009 expenses relating to our reductions in the workforce at the regulated utilities and holding company are added back, as is Integrys Energy Services' net loss from continuing operations in 2009 and 2008.Diluted earnings per share adjusted was $0.49 for the quarter of 2009, compared with $0.68 for the same period in 2008. For the full year 2009, on a GAAP basis, we experienced a net loss per share of $0.92, compared with net income of $1.64 per diluted share for the full year 2008. To arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted, the non-cash goodwill impairment losses for our Natural Gas Utility segment, expenses related to our reductions in the workforce at the regulated utilities and holding company, and the Integrys Energy Services' net loss from continuing operations in 2008 and 2009 are removed, resulting in diluted earnings per share adjusted of $2.41 for 2009 compared with $2.51 for 2008.Last year, 2009, was a difficult year for many companies and a lot of our customers, and we did not escape the impact of a tough economy nor did we expect to. We are pleased that our performance allows us to report 2009 results that exceed our previously communicated guidance for the full year.This was due primarily to lower fuel and purchased power costs for our Electric Utility segment than we had forecasted earlier in 2009. Considering the difficult economic environment in 2009, it is no surprise that our sales volumes were negatively affected. We were able to partially mitigate the impact through the decoupling mechanisms that we have in place in our jurisdictions for our regulated utility operations. However, we reached our decoupling cap relating to our electric utility in Wisconsin in the first half of 2009, which is why the lower sales volumes have had a relatively larger earnings impact in the second half of this year -- or 2009.On Slide 12, you will see that there are seven key items driving the $2.1 million quarter-over-quarter decrease in fourth quarter GAAP net income. Slide 13 is a similar chart that compares factors that drove the $197.3 million decrease in GAAP net income for the full year 2009 versus the same period a year ago. Additional detail related to the key drivers by segment for the fourth quarter and full year can be found on Slides 23 through 32, contained in the Appendix of the slide deck for today's presentation, in the news release we issued last evening and in the Form 10-K we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission last evening, which are also available on our website.Moving to Slide 14, I would like to refer you to the Appendix for the slides replicated from our February 17 Investor and Analyst Day presentation for detail on our financings, recent favorable credit rating agency action, capital expenditure plans, utility depreciation, utility rate base growth and a simplified cash flow model.Slides 15 and 16 cover our diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011, which is the same information we presented last week in New York. We are now providing diluted earnings per share guidance for all of Integrys Energy Group instead of on a diluted earnings per share adjusted basis, which we had provided in November during our third quarter conference call. As indicated on Slide 15, we expect our 2010 diluted earnings per share to be between $3.09 and $3.37. Our guidance related to the Integrys Energy Services' other line includes gains and losses and certain other impacts related to divestiture transactions, restructuring costs related to Integrys Energy Services, net non-cash gains or losses related to derivative accounting, and the non-cash impact on margin resulting from inventory adjustments made in prior periods. Our guidance does not include any Integrys Energy Group restructuring costs related to the reduction in workforce that is currently in progress, other than those related to Integrys Energy Services.Slide 16 shows our guidance for 2011. We expect 2011 diluted earnings per share to be between $3.28 and $3.61. Our guidance for the Integrys Energy Services' other line includes net non-cash gains and losses related to derivative accounting, the non-cash impact on margin resulting from inventory adjustments made in prior periods, and certain impacts related to divestiture transactions. Now I will turn the call back over to Charlie Schrock."

Turning to Slide 17, I will summarize the key points from today's call before we take your questions. We completed five rate cases in 2009 and early 2010, made progress on our operational excellence initiatives and put certain mechanisms in place to improve the predictability of our regulated utilities. In 2010, we will be filing general rate cases for Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power. These efforts will move our utilities closer to earning their authorized returns on equity over time. At Integrys Energy Services, we achieved our key strategic objectives by reducing the amount of invested capital and collateral support requirements. We are exiting the wholesale portions of the business, and over all, have significantly reduced the scale of operations and risk profile of this business. We have refocused in remaining Non-regulated Retail Natural Gas and Retail Electric Marketing operations, while allowing room for controlled growth in the future. From a corporate perspective, we have taken steps to improve our productivity and processes throughout the company, resulting in more streamlined and efficient operations.Moving onto Slide 18, future earnings will be driven by our utilities and complemented by our non-regulated operations. This will be achieved by investing approximately $1.2 billion in regulated utility capital projects between 2010 and 2012. These investments in our utilities will be for environmental controls, renewable portfolio standards and infrastructure improvements. The infrastructure investment in Chicago will be done in accordance with the Rider ICR, which the Illinois Commerce Commission approved in our last rate case at Peoples Gas. Additionally for our regulated utilities, we will file rate cases when appropriate. This will be complemented by controlled growth at our Non-regulated Energy Services business. All of these efforts will be accompanied by continually focusing on operational excellence and cost controls that we'll deliver on our financial commitments. We also expect to continue achieving earnings growth for our investment in American Transmission Company. On February 16, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.68 per share, payable on March 20, to shareholders of record on February 26, 2010.The dividend was maintained at the same amount as the previous quarterly dividend declaration. While this remains subject to quarterly review by our Board of Directors, management is confident that with a dividend at this level, the successful execution of our business plan will lead to a reasonable payout ratio over time.We are reaffirming the diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011 that we provided on February 17, 2010, as well as an expected 4% to 6% growth rate on an average annualized basis using 2011 as the base year through 2015.

One caution, however, is that's what's completely on the books for the Retail business, and we continue to go through some restructuring, most notable in the Texas market. And at year end, we had about 5.5 million megawatt hours in that forward book related to primarily Texas where we won't be going forward. The way to think about our sales goals that we've outlined in 2011, as well as visibility that I provided for 2010 in this table, is to look both at what we currently have contracted up. And for the Retail Electric business, when I strip out those markets again, notable to taxes that we will not be remaining and we don't really include that in that forward projection that we have provided at the analyst meeting, we've got, for 2010, about 10.8 million-megawatt hours currently contracted up. And as you saw on the slides, we've got a sales goal and expectation for ourselves of about 16.5 million megawatt hours. So we have 65% of the 2010 business, contracted up coming into the year. Now that's a little lower than historically has been the case. 2008 which was a more normal year, we had 83% of our 2009 volumes on the books at the end of 2008. So you could look at that and say, ""these guys have a little bit more headwind than they have in the past."" But keep in mind, that we have really had this business throttled back over the course of 2009. And with the restructuring in place and our financings getting configured, the sales force is now back in the market, signing customers up consistent with the new targets that we have in the markets that we have identified. So there's certainly some kind of pent-up demand, if you will, among our customer base in the markets that we're in. And we really expect that growth to come through organic growth, we don't project acquisitions to facilitate this but through organic growth in the markets that we operate. And we have some confidence around that because while the Illinois market, we've got significant share, we continue to see growth there. The entering some of our Eastern markets, particularly like Mid-Atlantic and New England, we had entered those a few years ago and really as a growth play. And so we're at the early stages of the growth curve in those markets, and that's what gives us confidence associated with being able to reach those goals in 2010, and 2010 is really that stepping stone to 2011. The other thing to keep in mind is that it's not just a volume gain. It's really about the overall margins that you take away from the business, and our margins are running essentially a little bit ahead of plan at this point. So while our volumes are 65% of plan, margins, when we look at it, we're a little better than that, probably closer to 75% or 80% of plan. On the GAAP side, the exiting the Canadian business, significant -- a significant impact to be sure, that was a very high-volume business. And you can see our actual volumes in that same supplemental data pack. You can see our actual volumes on a prior page. Retail natural gas sales in 2008 were like 336 Bcf, 236 Bcf in 2009, as we lost the tail end of the year for the Canadian business. And that's why we're projecting about 118 Bcf in 2010 for that business that remains. Now we have today, in the forward book about 76 Bcf of volume associated with markets that we'll stay in, and you'll note that's very, very similar to the total portfolio that we have described in that supplemental data pack. Because the markets -- we're essentially, the markets that we have on the books today are essentially the markets that we're going to be in. And of that 118 Bcf plan for the year, we have 76 Bcf under contract, so about 65%. That's very, very consistent with historical practice, kind of coming into the year with about 60% to 65% of our gas sales volumes under contract. So we're very, very comfortable with achieving our gas objectives."

We do some cost allocation internally, but it's not really disclosure-agreed data. So I think the thing to look at, the thing to focus on more so than just that $0.50 to $0.55, is the margin level of the Retail business versus the margins that we are projecting. And with each release, we've provided both our realized margins and our non-cash margins, split by retail and wholesale. You can look back to those and focus just on the retail-realized margins to get a sense for the levels that we're at. But to really cut to the chase, I mean, it's a true statement that the Retail business on a standalone basis, historically, would not have earned at these levels. We have structured this business to focus on current period results, taking the emphasis away from growth. We have a lot of expense and investment that we were making in growing into new markets. We've backed away from that, now growing just within the control parameters that should earlier that Charlie referred to. And that results in a business that performs much better on how we measured as a return on invested capital, and we have a much higher expectation for this business going forward than it had performed in the past, because it's a different business, operating in a different environment."

And that's the majority of our Electric business. On the gas side, it's fully competitive. So there's no regulated offer that distorts market prices. What we do tend to see is the change in contracting behavior on the part of customers.

On February 17, we hosted an Investor and Analyst Day in New York. A webcast of each presentation and question-and-answer session is archived on our website and the associated slides are available there as well.We had approximately 40 people joining us in person for that event, and many more listened to the webcast. And we appreciate your interest in the company and we thank you for your participation. For those who are unable to participate, I encourage you to review the materials from the event, as they cover in detail our regulated utility operations, the results of our Integrys Energy Services strategy change, our restructured Non-Regulated business and detailed financial information. We also discussed our decision to maintain our quarterly dividend at its current level, and management's confidence that successful execution of our business plan will lead to a reasonable payout ratio over time. Today, as listed on the agenda on Slide 6 I will provide an overview of 2009, as well as the key takeaways from the Investor and Analyst Day. Joe O'Leary will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results, and our diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011. Finally, we will be happy to take your questions, either on our fourth quarter and full year results for 2009, or on any information that we discussed at our event last week.Turning to Slide 7, we are pleased to report 2009 diluted earnings per share, adjusted results of $2.41, which exceeds our previously communicated 2009 diluted earnings per share, adjusted guidance range of $2.26 to $2.38. We are continuing on a deliberate path that will bring our utilities closer to earning their authorized returns on equity over time. We are advancing along this path with the operational progress that we made through our two-pronged approach to achieving this goal. First, we completed a number of rate cases during 2009 and early 2010. Second, we are continually making progress on our operational excellence initiatives to further streamline and improve the efficiency of our operations.Another major accomplishment is that we met our key strategic objectives for Integrys Energy Services. We substantially reduced the invested capital and collateral support requirements of this business. Upon completion of our announced transactions, we will have exited wholesale operations, and we have refocused the remaining Non-Regulated Retail Natural Gas Marketing and Retail Electric Marketing operations to achieve a platform for controlled growth within acceptable parameters. These accomplishments in our regulated and non-regulated operations position us well for 2010 and beyond. I would now like to briefly review the key takeaways for our regulated and non-regulated operations from our Investor and Analyst Day last week. In our regulated business, covered on Slide 8, our objective is to bring each utility closer to earning its authorized return on equity. As I said earlier, one major way that we are doing this is through cost control efforts focused on operational excellence, and timely and regular filings of rate cases when appropriate. We've also been able to incorporate mechanisms that help us achieve more predictable earnings over time. The decoupling and bad debt riders that we have in place in several of our jurisdictions are examples of these mechanisms. Our rate base will grow through investment in capital projects needed for environmental compliance, Renewable portfolio standard mandates and maintaining and improving our infrastructure.American Transmission Company will continue to positively impact our earnings. Although this is an equity investment for us, we treat this investment as a separate reportable segment. We have included American Transmission Company on this slide, under the category of Regulated Operations, because the ATC is subject to regulation via the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. And finally, but no less importantly, our commitment to continuous improvements in operational excellence and cost controls will allow us to deliver on our financial expectations while delivering safe, reliable and outstanding customer service.Slide 9 shows our potential earnings growth for 2008 and 2009's financial results, associated with our efforts to have our regulated utilities earn closer to their authorized returns on equity. You can find the 2008 and 2009 data for each utility in the Appendix of the presentation. We have also displayed estimates of our earnings potential for our regulated natural gas and regulated electric segments for 2010 and 2011, which we calculated using the midpoint of the 2010 and 2011 diluted earnings per share guidance range that we presented at the Investor and Analyst Day last week.Although we are confident in the diluted earnings per share guidance ranges that we have provided to you, I do want to stress that the figures you see for 2010 and 2011 are estimates to give you an idea of the improving trends in earnings that we expect to deliver in the next two years. The actual results could vary by as much as $5 million to $10 million either way, and still remain within our guidance range.Consistent with what we said during our presentation last week, the earnings shortfall between what was authorized and what was actually earned for all of our regulated utilities increased in 2009, going from about $45 million in 2008 to about $57 million in 2009. Given the economy and the timing of rate cases, this was not unexpected. And while we experience a decline in utility earnings from 2008 to 2009, the longer-term trends shows improvement. A closer look at the individual utility results also shows the progress we are making. For example, Minnesota Energy Resources' financial results for 2009 showed that it slightly exceeded its allowed return on equity and Michigan Gas Utilities' financial results showed an improvement in earnings. Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas were involved in rate cases in 2009, with new rates going into effect in late January of 2010, which will lead to an improvement in earnings for these companies as well. Wisconsin Public Service's 2009 financial results were impacted by a shortfall in sales and limitations of the decoupling cap at the electric utility. We will be filing a rate case for Wisconsin Public Service in April and expect its earnings to improve upon implementation of new rates in 2011. So in total, we are expecting a substantial improvement in the utility earnings for 2010, which is the first full year that the recent rate cases are in effect. We expect the shortfall to be reduced to approximately $37 million in total, and roughly $20 million for the Natural Gas Utility business and $17 million for the Electric business.From 2010 and 2011, there is a bit of lumpiness as the expected increase in the Electric Utility segment, due to anticipated rate case awards will be somewhat offset by a decline at Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas, which will be in a rate case filing year. Again, I want to emphasize that these are estimates using the diluted earnings per share guidance midpoint and the actual numbers will vary. Nevertheless, we believe that the improving trend will continue in 2011 when we expect the total shortfall to be approximately $34 million, roughly $25 million for the Natural Gas Utility business and $9 million for the Electric business. One of our major strategic objectives is to bring our utilities closer to earning their authorized returns on equity over time. Due to the inherent nature of the regulatory process in terms of timing and typical disallowances, complete eradication of the shortfall is probably not likely. However, we will keep trying to improve on that number as much as we can through our operational excellence program and rate case filings when they are appropriate.In our Non-Regulated business covered on Slide 10, we are pleased to have achieved our strategic objectives for Integrys Energy Services. We are completely exiting the wholesale portions of this business. We have restructured the remaining portions of our Non-Regulated business, which now encompasses Retail Electric and Retail Natural Gas Marketing and solar and other renewable energy projects. And we have restructured it so it is positioned for controlled growth.Our refocused Non-Regulated Retail Customer business is low at risk and more predictable than our prior integrated business, and our renewable energy projects will focus on customer-sited solar and renewable contracted asset development. Our commitment to operational excellence extends to Integrys Energy Services as well. And we will make improvements in that arena as we continue to provide exceptional energy solutions for our customers.With that, I will now turn the call over to Joe O'Leary."

I will cover our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009, as well as our annual diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011.

I will cover our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009, as well as our annual diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011. Beginning with Slide 9, during the fourth quarter of 2009, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP, we recognize total diluted earnings per share of $0.31 for the quarter ended December 31, 2009, compared with $0.33 for the same quarter in 2008. To arrive at diluted earnings per share, adjusted for the quarter, 2009 expenses relating to our reductions in the workforce at the regulated utilities and holding company are added back, as is Integrys Energy Services' net loss from continuing operations in 2009 and 2008.Diluted earnings per share adjusted was $0.49 for the quarter of 2009, compared with $0.68 for the same period in 2008. For the full year 2009, on a GAAP basis, we experienced a net loss per share of $0.92, compared with net income of $1.64 per diluted share for the full year 2008. To arrive at diluted earnings per share, adjusted, the non-cash goodwill impairment losses for our Natural Gas Utility segment, expenses related to our reductions in the workforce at the regulated utilities and holding company, and the Integrys Energy Services' net loss from continuing operations in 2008 and 2009 are removed, resulting in diluted earnings per share, adjusted of $2.41 for 2009 compared with $2.51 for 2008.Last year, 2009, was a difficult year for many companies and a lot of our customers, and we did not escape the impact of a tough economy nor did we expect to. We are pleased that our performance allows us to report 2009 results that exceed our previously communicated guidance for the full year.This was due primarily to lower fuel and purchased power costs for our Electric Utility segment than we had forecasted earlier in 2009. Considering the difficult economic environment in 2009, it is no surprise that our sales volumes were negatively affected. We were able to partially mitigate the impact through the decoupling mechanisms that we have in place in our jurisdictions for our regulated utility operations. However, we reached our decoupling cap relating to our electric utility in Wisconsin in the first half of 2009, which is why the lower sales volumes have had a relatively larger earnings impact in the second half of this year -- or 2009.On Slide 12, you will see that there are seven key items driving the $2.1 million quarter-over-quarter decrease in fourth quarter GAAP net income. Slide 13 is a similar chart that compares factors that drove the $197.3 million decrease in GAAP net income for the full year 2009 versus the same period a year ago. Additional detail related to the key drivers by segment for the fourth quarter and full year can be found on Slides 23 through 32, contained in the Appendix of the slide deck for today's presentation, in the news release we issued last evening and in the Form 10-K we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission last evening, which are also available on our website.Moving to Slide 14, I would like to refer you to the Appendix for the slides replicated from our February 17 Investor and Analyst Day presentation for detail on our financings, recent favorable credit rating agency action, capital expenditure plans, utility depreciation, utility rate base growth and a simplified cash flow model.Slides 15 and 16 cover our diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011, which is the same information we presented last week in New York. We are now providing diluted earnings per share guidance for all of Integrys Energy Group instead of on a diluted earnings per share adjusted basis, which we had provided in November during our third quarter conference call. As indicated on Slide 15, we expect our 2010 diluted earnings per share to be between $3.09 and $3.37. Our guidance related to the Integrys Energy Services' other line includes gains and losses and certain other impacts related to divestiture transactions, restructuring costs related to Integrys Energy Services, net non-cash gains or losses related to derivative accounting, and the non-cash impact on margin resulting from inventory adjustments made in prior periods. Our guidance does not include any Integrys Energy Group restructuring costs related to the reduction in workforce that is currently in progress, other than those related to Integrys Energy Services.Slide 16, shows our guidance for 2011. We expect 2011 diluted earnings per share to be between $3.28 and $3.61. Our guidance for the Integrys Energy Services' other line includes net non-cash gains and losses related to derivative accounting, the non-cash impact on margin resulting from inventory adjustments made in prior periods and certain impacts related to divestiture transactions. Now I will turn the call back over to Charlie Schrock."

Turning to Slide 17, I will summarize the key points from today's call before we take your questions. We completed five rate cases in 2009 and early 2010, made progress on our operational excellence initiatives and put certain mechanisms in place to improve the predictability of our regulated utilities. In 2010, we will be filing general rate cases for Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power. These efforts will move our utilities closer to earning their authorized returns on equity over time. At Integrys Energy Services, we achieved our key strategic objectives by reducing the amount of invested capital and collateral support requirements. We are exiting the wholesale portions of the business, and over all, have significantly reduced the scale of operations and risk profile of this business. We have refocused the remaining Non-Regulated Retail Natural Gas and Retail Electric Marketing operations, while allowing room for controlled growth in the future. From a corporate perspective, we have taken steps to improve our productivity and processes throughout the company, resulting in more streamlined and efficient operations.Moving on to Slide 18, future earnings will be driven by our utilities and complemented by our non-regulated operations. This will be achieved by investing approximately $1.2 billion in regulated utility capital projects between 2010 and 2012. These investments in our utilities will be for environmental controls, Renewable portfolio standards and infrastructure improvements. The infrastructure investment in Chicago will be done in accordance with the Rider ICR, which the Illinois Commerce Commission approved in our last rate case at Peoples Gas. Additionally, for our regulated utilities, we will file rate cases when appropriate. This will be complemented by controlled growth at our Non-Regulated Energy Services business. All of these efforts will be accompanied by continually focusing on operational excellence and cost controls that will deliver on our financial commitments. We also expect to continue achieving earnings growth for our investment in American Transmission Company. On February 16, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.68 per share, payable on March 20, to shareholders of record on February 26, 2010.The dividend was maintained at the same amount as the previous quarterly dividend declaration. While this remains subject to quarterly review by our Board of Directors, management is confident that with the dividend at this level, successful execution of our business plan will lead to a reasonable payout ratio over time.We are reaffirming that diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011 that we provided on February 17, 2010, as well as an expected 4% to 6% growth rate on an average annualized basis using 2011 as the base year through 2015.

One caution, however, is that's what's completely on the books for the Retail business, and we continue to go through some restructuring, most notable in the Texas market. And at year end, we had about 5.5 million-megawatt hours in that forward book related to primarily Texas where we won't be going forward. The way to think about our sales goals that we've outlined in 2011, as well as the visibility that I provided for 2010 in this table, is to look both at what we currently have contracted up. And for the Retail Electric business, when I strip out those markets again, notably Taxes, that we will not be remaining and we don't really include that in that forward projection that we have provided at the analyst meeting, we've got, for 2010, about 10.8 million-megawatt hours currently contracted up. And as you saw on the slides, we've got a sales goal and expectation for ourselves of about 16.5 million-megawatt hours. So we have 65% of the 2010 business contracted up coming into the year. Now that's a little lower than historically has been the case. 2008, which was a more normal year, we had 83% of our 2009 volumes on the books at the end of 2008. So you could look at that and say, ""these guys have a little bit more headwind than they have in the past."" But keep in mind, that we have really had this business throttled back over the course of 2009. And with the restructuring in place and our financings getting configured, the sales force is now back in the market, signing customers up consistent with the new targets that we have in the markets that we have identified. So there's certainly some kind of pent-up demand, if you will, among our customer base in the markets that we're in. And we really expect that growth to come through organic growth, we don't project acquisitions to facilitate this but through organic growth in the markets that we operate. And we have some confidence around that because while the Illinois market, we've got significant share, we continue to see growth there. The entering some of our Eastern markets, particularly like Mid-Atlantic and New England, we had entered those a few years ago and really as a growth play. And so we're at the early stages of the growth curve in those markets, and that's what gives us confidence associated with being able to reach those goals in 2010, and 2010 is really that stepping stone to 2011. The other thing to keep in mind is that it's not just a volume gain. It's really about the overall margins that you take away from the business, and our margins are running essentially a little bit ahead of plan at this point. So while our volumes are 65% of plan, margins, when we look at it, we're a little better than that, probably closer to 75% or 80% of plan. On the GAAP side, the exiting the Canadian business, significant -- a significant impact to be sure, that was a very high-volume business. And you can see our actual volumes in that same supplemental data pack. You can see our actual volumes on a prior page. Retail natural gas sales in 2008 were like 336 Bcf, 236 Bcf in 2009, as we lost the tail end of the year for the Canadian business. And that's why we're projecting about 118 Bcf in 2010 for that business that remains. Now we have today, in the forward book about 76 Bcf of volume associated with markets that we'll stay in, and you'll note that's very, very similar to the total portfolio that we have described in that supplemental data pack. Because the markets -- we're essentially, the markets that we have on the books today are essentially the markets that we're going to be in. And of that 118 Bcf plan for the year, we have 76 Bcf under contract, so about 65%. That's very, very consistent with historical practice kind of coming into the year with about 60% to 65% of our gas sales volumes under contract. So we're very, very comfortable with achieving our gas objectives."

You can look back to those and focus just on the retail-realized margins to get a sense for the levels that we're at. But to really cut to the chase, I mean it's a true statement that the Retail business on a standalone basis, historically, would not have earned at these levels. We have structured this business to focus on current period results, taking the emphasis away from growth. We have a lot of expense and investment that we were making in growing into new markets. We've backed away from that, now growing just within the control parameters that should earlier that Charlie referred to. And that results in a business that performs much better on how we measured as a return on invested capital, and we have a much higher expectation for this business going forward than it had performed in the past, because it's a different business, operating in a different environment."

On February 17, we hosted an Investor and Analyst Day in New York. A webcast of each presentation and question-and-answer session is archived on our website and the associated slides are available there as well.We had approximately 40 people joining us in person for that event, and many more listened to the webcast. And we appreciate your interest in the company and we thank you for your participation. For those who are unable to participate, I encourage you to review the materials from the event, as they cover in detail our regulated utility operations, the results of our Integrys Energy Services strategy change, our restructured Non-Regulated business and detailed financial information. We also discussed our decision to maintain our quarterly dividend at its current level, and management's confidence that successful execution of our business plan will lead to a reasonable payout ratio over time. Today, as listed on the agenda on Slide 6 I will provide an overview of 2009, as well as the key takeaways from the Investor and Analyst Day. Joe O'Leary will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results, and our diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011. Finally, we will be happy to take your questions, either on our fourth quarter and full year results for 2009, or on any information that we discussed at our event last week.Turning to Slide 7, we are pleased to report 2009 diluted earnings per share, adjusted results of $2.41, which exceeds our previously communicated 2009 diluted earnings per share, adjusted guidance range of $2.26 to $2.38. We are continuing on a deliberate path that will bring our utilities closer to earning their authorized returns on equity over time. We are advancing along this path with the operational progress that we made through our two-pronged approach to achieving this goal. First, we completed a number of rate cases during 2009 and early 2010. Second, we are continually making progress on our operational excellence initiatives to further streamline and improve the efficiency of our operations.Another major accomplishment is that we met our key strategic objectives for Integrys Energy Services. We substantially reduced the invested capital and collateral support requirements of this business. Upon completion of our announced transactions, we will have exited wholesale operations, and we have refocused the remaining Non-Regulated Retail Natural Gas Marketing and Retail Electric Marketing operations to achieve a platform for controlled growth within acceptable parameters. These accomplishments in our regulated and non-regulated operations position us well for 2010 and beyond. I would now like to briefly review the key takeaways for our regulated and non-regulated operations from our Investor and Analyst Day last week. In our regulated business, covered on Slide 8, our objective is to bring each utility closer to earning its authorized return on equity. As I said earlier, one major way that we are doing this is through cost control efforts focused on operational excellence, and timely and regular filings of rate cases when appropriate. We've also been able to incorporate mechanisms that help us achieve more predictable earnings over time. The decoupling and bad debt riders that we have in place in several of our jurisdictions are examples of these mechanisms. Our rate base will grow through investment in capital projects needed for environmental compliance, Renewable portfolio standard mandates and maintaining and improving our infrastructure.American Transmission Company will continue to positively impact our earnings. Although this is an equity investment for us, we treat this investment as a separate reportable segment. We have included American Transmission Company on this slide, under the category of Regulated Operations, because the ATC is subject to regulation via the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. And finally, but no less importantly, our commitment to continuous improvements in operational excellence and cost controls will allow us to deliver on our financial expectations while delivering safe, reliable and outstanding customer service.Slide 9 shows our potential earnings growth for 2008 and 2009's financial results, associated with our efforts to have our regulated utilities earn closer to their authorized returns on equity. You can find the 2008 and 2009 data for each utility in the Appendix of the presentation. We have also displayed estimates of our earnings potential for our regulated natural gas and regulated electric segments for 2010 and 2011, which we calculated using the midpoint of the 2010 and 2011 diluted earnings per share guidance range that we presented at the Investor and Analyst Day last week.Although we are confident in the diluted earnings per share guidance ranges that we have provided to you, I do want to stress that the figures you see for 2010 and 2011 are estimates to give you an idea of the improving trends in earnings that we expect to deliver in the next two years. The actual results could vary by as much as $5 million to $10 million either way, and still remain within our guidance range.Consistent with what we said during our presentation last week, the earnings shortfall between what was authorized and what was actually earned for all of our regulated utilities increased in 2009, going from about $45 million in 2008 to about $57 million in 2009. Given the economy and the timing of rate cases, this was not unexpected. And while we experience a decline in utility earnings from 2008 to 2009, the longer-term trends shows improvement. A closer look at the individual utility results also shows the progress we are making. For example, Minnesota Energy Resources' financial results for 2009 showed that it slightly exceeded its allowed return on equity and Michigan Gas Utilities' financial results showed an improvement in earnings. Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas were involved in rate cases in 2009, with new rates going into effect in late January of 2010, which will lead to an improvement in earnings for these companies as well. Wisconsin Public Service's 2009 financial results were impacted by a shortfall in sales and limitations of the decoupling cap at the electric utility. We will be filing a rate case for Wisconsin Public Service in April and expect its earnings to improve upon implementation of new rates in 2011. So in total, we are expecting a substantial improvement in the utility earnings for 2010, which is the first full year that the recent rate cases are in effect. We expect the shortfall to be reduced to approximately $37 million in total, and roughly $20 million for the Natural Gas Utility business and $17 million for the Electric business.From 2010 and 2011, there is a bit of lumpiness as the expected increase in the Electric Utility segment, due to anticipated rate case awards will be somewhat offset by a decline at Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas, which will be in a rate case filing year. Again, I want to emphasize that these are estimates using the diluted earnings per share guidance midpoint and the actual numbers will vary. Nevertheless, we believe that the improving trend will continue in 2011 when we expect the total shortfall to be approximately $34 million, roughly $25 million for the Natural Gas Utility business and $9 million for the Electric business. One of our major strategic objectives is to bring our utilities closer to earning their authorized returns on equity over time. Due to the inherent nature of the regulatory process in terms of timing and typical disallowances, complete eradication of the shortfall is probably not likely. However, we will keep trying to improve on that number as much as we can through our operational excellence program and rate case filings when they are appropriate.In our Non-Regulated business covered on Slide 10, we are pleased to have achieved our strategic objectives for Integrys Energy Services. We are completely exiting the wholesale portions of this business. We have restructured the remaining portions of our Non-Regulated business, which now encompasses Retail Electric and Retail Natural Gas Marketing and solar and other renewable energy projects. And we have restructured it so that it is positioned for controlled growth.Our refocused Non-Regulated Retail Customer business is lower risk and more predictable than our prior integrated business, and our renewable energy projects will focus on customer-sited solar and renewable contracted asset development. Our commitment to operational excellence extends to Integrys Energy Services as well. And we will make improvements in that arena as we continue to provide exceptional energy solutions for our customers.With that, I will now turn the call over to Joe O'Leary."

I will cover our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009, as well as our annual diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011. Beginning with Slide 9, during the fourth quarter of 2009, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP, we recognize total diluted earnings per share of $0.31 for the quarter ended December 31, 2009, compared with $0.33 for the same quarter in 2008. To arrive at diluted earnings per share, adjusted for the quarter, 2009 expenses relating to our reductions in the workforce at the regulated utilities and holding company are added back, as is Integrys Energy Services' net loss from continuing operations in 2009 and 2008.Diluted earnings per share adjusted was $0.49 for the quarter of 2009, compared with $0.68 for the same period in 2008. For the full year 2009, on a GAAP basis, we experienced a net loss per share of $0.92, compared with net income of $1.64 per diluted share for the full year 2008. To arrive at diluted earnings per share, adjusted, the non-cash goodwill impairment losses for our Natural Gas Utility segment, expenses related to our reductions in the workforce at the regulated utilities and holding company, and the Integrys Energy Services' net loss from continuing operations in 2008 and 2009 are removed, resulting in diluted earnings per share, adjusted of $2.41 for 2009 compared with $2.51 for 2008.Last year, 2009, was a difficult year for many companies and a lot of our customers, and we did not escape the impact of a tough economy nor did we expect to. We are pleased that our performance allows us to report 2009 results that exceed our previously communicated guidance for the full year.This was due primarily to lower fuel and purchased power costs for our Electric Utility segment than we had forecasted earlier in 2009. Considering the difficult economic environment in 2009, it is no surprise that our sales volumes were negatively affected. We were able to partially mitigate the impact through the decoupling mechanisms that we have in place in our jurisdictions for our regulated utility operations. However, we reached our decoupling cap relating to our electric utility in Wisconsin in the first half of 2009, which is why the lower sales volumes have had a relatively larger earnings impact in the second half of this year -- or 2009.On Slide 12, you will see that there are seven key items driving the $2.1 million quarter-over-quarter decrease in fourth quarter GAAP net income. Slide 13 is a similar chart that compares factors that drove the $197.3 million decrease in GAAP net income for the full year 2009 versus the same period a year ago. Additional detail related to the key drivers by segment for the fourth quarter and full year can be found on Slides 23 through 32, contained in the Appendix of the slide deck for today's presentation, in the news release we issued last evening and in the Form 10-K we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission last evening, which are also available on our website.Moving to Slide 14, I would like to refer you to the Appendix for the slides replicated from our February 17 Investor and Analyst Day presentation for detail on our financings, recent favorable credit rating agency action, capital expenditure plans, utility depreciation, utility rate base growth and a simplified cash flow model.Slides 15 and 16 cover our diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011, which is the same information we presented last week in New York. We are now providing diluted earnings per share guidance for all of Integrys Energy Group instead of on a diluted earnings per share adjusted basis, which we had provided in November during our third quarter conference call. As indicated on Slide 15, we expect our 2010 diluted earnings per share to be between $3.09 and $3.37. Our guidance related to the Integrys Energy Services' other line includes gains and losses and certain other impacts related to divestiture transactions, restructuring costs related to Integrys Energy Services, net non-cash gains or losses related to derivative accounting, and the non-cash impact on margin resulting from inventory adjustments made in prior periods. Our guidance does not include any Integrys Energy Group restructuring costs related to the reduction in workforce that is currently in progress, other than those related to Integrys Energy Services.Slide 16, shows our guidance for 2011. We expect 2011 diluted earnings per share to be between $3.28 and $3.61. Our guidance for the Integrys Energy Services' other line includes net non-cash gains and losses related to derivative accounting, the non-cash impact on margin resulting from inventory adjustments made in prior periods and certain impacts related to divestiture transactions. Now I will turn the call back over to Charlie Schrock."

Turning to Slide 17, I will summarize the key points from today's call before we take your questions. We completed five rate cases in 2009 and early 2010, made progress on our operational excellence initiatives and put certain mechanisms in place to improve the predictability of our regulated utilities. In 2010, we will be filing general rate cases for Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power. These efforts will move our utilities closer to earning their authorized returns on equity over time. At Integrys Energy Services, we achieved our key strategic objectives by reducing the amount of invested capital and collateral support requirements. We are exiting the wholesale portions of the business, and over all, have significantly reduced the scale of operations and risk profile of this business. We have refocused the remaining Non-Regulated Retail Natural Gas and Retail Electric Marketing operations, while allowing room for controlled growth in the future. From a corporate perspective, we have taken steps to improve our productivity and processes throughout the company, resulting in more streamlined and efficient operations.Moving on to Slide 18, future earnings will be driven by our utilities and complemented by our non-regulated operations. This will be achieved by investing approximately $1.2 billion in regulated utility capital projects between 2010 and 2012. These investments in our utilities will be for environmental controls, Renewable portfolio standards and infrastructure improvements. The infrastructure investment in Chicago will be done in accordance with the Rider ICR, which the Illinois Commerce Commission approved in our last rate case at Peoples Gas. Additionally, for our regulated utilities, we will file rate cases when appropriate. This will be complemented by controlled growth at our Non-Regulated Energy Services business. All of these efforts will be accompanied by continually focusing on operational excellence and cost controls that will deliver on our financial commitments. We also expect to continue achieving earnings growth for our investment in American Transmission Company. On February 16, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.68 per share, payable on March 20, to shareholders of record on February 26, 2010.The dividend was maintained at the same amount as the previous quarterly dividend declaration. While this remains subject to quarterly review by our Board of Directors, management is confident that with the dividend at this level, successful execution of our business plan will lead to a reasonable payout ratio over time.We are reaffirming that diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011 that we provided on February 17, 2010, as well as an expected 4% to 6% growth rate on an average annualized basis using 2011 as the base year through 2015.

One caution, however, is that's what's completely on the books for the Retail business, and we continue to go through some restructuring, most notable in the Texas market. And at year end, we had about 5.5 million-megawatt hours in that forward book related to primarily Texas where we won't be going forward. The way to think about our sales goals that we've outlined in 2011, as well as the visibility that I provided for 2010 in this table, is to look both at what we currently have contracted up. And for the Retail Electric business, when I strip out those markets again, notably Taxes, that we will not be remaining and we don't really include that in that forward projection that we have provided at the analyst meeting, we've got, for 2010, about 10.8 million-megawatt hours currently contracted up. And as you saw on the slides, we've got a sales goal and expectation for ourselves of about 16.5 million-megawatt hours. So we have 65% of the 2010 business contracted up coming into the year. Now that's a little lower than historically has been the case. 2008, which was a more normal year, we had 83% of our 2009 volumes on the books at the end of 2008. So you could look at that and say, ""these guys have a little bit more headwind than they have in the past."" But keep in mind, that we have really had this business throttled back over the course of 2009. And with the restructuring in place and our financings getting configured, the sales force is now back in the market, signing customers up consistent with the new targets that we have in the markets that we have identified. So there's certainly some kind of pent-up demand, if you will, among our customer base in the markets that we're in. And we really expect that growth to come through organic growth, we don't project acquisitions to facilitate this but through organic growth in the markets that we operate. And we have some confidence around that because while the Illinois market, we've got significant share, we continue to see growth there. The entering some of our Eastern markets, particularly like Mid-Atlantic and New England, we had entered those a few years ago and really as a growth play. And so we're at the early stages of the growth curve in those markets, and that's what gives us confidence associated with being able to reach those goals in 2010, and 2010 is really that stepping stone to 2011. The other thing to keep in mind is that it's not just a volume gain. It's really about the overall margins that you take away from the business, and our margins are running essentially a little bit ahead of plan at this point. So while our volumes are 65% of plan, margins, when we look at it, we're a little better than that, probably closer to 75% or 80% of plan. On the GAAP side, the exiting the Canadian business, significant -- a significant impact to be sure, that was a very high-volume business. And you can see our actual volumes in that same supplemental data pack. You can see our actual volumes on a prior page. Retail natural gas sales in 2008 were like 336 Bcf, 236 Bcf in 2009, as we lost the tail end of the year for the Canadian business. And that's why we're projecting about 118 Bcf in 2010 for that business that remains. Now we have today, in the forward book about 76 Bcf of volume associated with markets that we'll stay in, and you'll note that's very, very similar to the total portfolio that we have described in that supplemental data pack. Because the markets -- we're essentially, the markets that we have on the books today are essentially the markets that we're going to be in. And of that 118 Bcf plan for the year, we have 76 Bcf under contract, so about 65%. That's very, very consistent with historical practice kind of coming into the year with about 60% to 65% of our gas sales volumes under contract. So we're very, very comfortable with achieving our gas objectives."

We do some cost allocation internally, but it's not really disclosure-agreed data. So I think the thing to look -- the thing to focus on more so than just that the $0.50 to $0.55, is the margin level of the Retail business versus the margins that we are projecting. And with each release, we've provided both our realized margins and our non-cash margins, split by retail and wholesale. You can look back to those and focus just on the retail-realized margins to get a sense for the levels that we're at. But to really cut to the chase, I mean it's a true statement that the Retail business on a standalone basis, historically, would not have earned at these levels. We have structured this business to focus on current period results, taking the emphasis away from growth. We have a lot of expense and investment that we were making in growing into new markets. We've backed away from that, now growing just within the controlled parameters that Charlie referred to. And that results in a business that performs much better on how we measured as a return on invested capital, and we have a much higher expectation for this business going forward than it had performed in the past, because it's a different business, operating in a different environment."

And that's the majority of our Electric business. On the gas side, it's fully competitive. So there's no kind of regulated offer that distorts market prices. What we do tend to see is a change in contracting behavior on the part of customers.

Welcome to Integrys Energy Group’s first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Delivering formal remarks with me today are Charlie Schrock, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Joe O’Leary, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Other executives, including Larry Borgard, our President and Chief Operating Officer of Utilities; and Mark Radtke, Chief Executive Officer of our non-regulated subsidiary, Integrys Energy Services, are available for the question and answer session at the conclusion of our formal remarks.
The slides supporting today’s presentation and an associated data package are located on our Web site at www.integrysgroup.com. Select Investor, select Presentations, and then today’s presentation.  Before we begin, I will advise everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay through August 3, 2010.
I need to direct you to Slides 3 and 4 of our presentation and to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Safe Harbor rules, including projected results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries. Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond the ability of Integrys Energy Group to control and, in many cases, Integrys Energy Group cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements. 
I also refer you to the forward-looking statements section of yesterday's news release for further information. Except as may be required by federal securities laws, Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement contained in this presentation, whether the result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
Slide 5 indicates that today’s presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to “diluted earnings per share - adjusted” and “net income or loss attributed to common shareholders - adjusted.”  We believe these are useful measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance and the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Please review the text of this slide regarding non-GAAP financial information.
I will now turn the call over to Charlie Schrock.

I’ll begin by mentioning the key takeaways form our discussion this morning.  First, our plan to move our utilities closer to authorize returns on equity and to implement the strategy change at Integrys Energy Services is on course.  
Second, although our plan is on course, we have adjusted our 2010 diluted earnings per share guidance to reflect the impact of the Federal healthcare legislation.  Third, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2011 and fourth, we have achieved our target to recover $700 million of invested capital at Integrys Energy Services.  This achievement is ahead of schedule.
Moving on to Slide 6, let me briefly review the agenda for the balance of today’s call.  I will provide an overview of our 2010 first quarter from an operational standpoint as well as a brief overview of our financial results.  Joe O'Leary will discuss our finances for the first quarter of 2010 in more detail and our diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011.  We will conclude with a question and answer session.
In the first quarter of 2010 we recognized net income attributed to common shareholders on a generally accepted accounting principles basis of $0.64 per diluted share compared with a net loss attributed to common shareholders of $2.35 per share in the same period in 2009.  
Turning to Slide 7, we recorded diluted earnings per share adjusted for the first quarter 2010 which excludes the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next of $1.49 versus $1.56 for the same period a year ago.  While our consolidated financial results quarter-over-quarter are down, we are seeing positive progress in a number of areas of our business.  For example, quarterly financial results for our regulated utilities and electric transmission segments improved during the first quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009.
In addition, quarterly financial results for the holding company segment also showed improvement in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009.  The quarterly financial results for Integrys Energy Services were down in the first quarter this year compared with the same period a year ago, but this was expected since the scope and scale of our non-regulated energy services business have been substantially reduced and there is still transition work underway at Integrys Energy Services.
Even so, the implementation of our revised strategy at Integrys Energy Services is proceeding according to plan which I will touch on in just a moment.  You likely saw our quarterly dividend declaration of $0.68 per share payable in June 2010 which is the same dividend rate paid to shareholders in March 2010.  We continue to remain confident that successful execution of our business plan will lead to a reasonable dividend payout ratio over time.
Moving on to Slide 8, let me give you a little more information regarding our cost management efforts which are a critical component in our strategy to move utility earnings closer to authorized rates of return.  Our reduction in force initiative that we announced last year is about 75% complete.  We targeted the elimination of about 300 positions at Integrys Business Support and the regulated utilities.  When completed, we expect this will reduce our annual labor costs by $20 million after tax which includes salaries and benefits.  
We are also projecting other cost reductions.  One example is the company-wide furloughs instituted for 2010 that are expected to result in additional cost savings of $5 million after tax.  We are implementing operational excellence initiatives in concert with our cost management efforts to ensure that the cost savings we have already achieved or expect to achieve are sustained over the long haul.  All of this is factored into our guidance.     
As we have mentioned in our recent presentations, we plan to file rate cases as needed to bring our regulated utilities closer to their authorized returns on equity.  We took another step down this path on April 1 when we filed an electric and natural gas rate case for Wisconsin Public Service.  The key items of the Wisconsin Public Service rate case which requests new rates to be effective in January of 2011 are presented on Slide 9.
I won’t go through all the details set forth on that slide other than to mention that we are requesting the decoupling cap for both electric and natural gas to be replaced by an earnings cap.  You will recall that the existing decoupling mechanism includes a pre-tax cap of $14 million for electric and $8 million for natural gas.
Moving on to Slide 10, one of the key achievements for Integrys Energy Services this quarter was the closing of the sale of its United States wholesale record and marketing trading business on March 31, 2010.  As a result of this, as well as other operating activities, we achieved our objective to recover $700 million of capital invested by Integrys Energy Services. This milestone was achieved on April 30, 2010 which is 8 months ahead of schedule.
Because of the timing of the related contract assignments to the purchaser in this transaction, and a 20% decline in energy prices during the quarter, our corporate guarantees increased by $300 million versus where we were at year end 2009 but we remain on target to reduce Integrys Energy Group’s corporate guarantees to $500 million by the end of 2010 from a high of $2.6 billion at March 31, 2009.
Moving to Slide 11 with the divestiture transactions largely behind us, we are now focusing on completing the restructuring of Integrys Energy Services.  As I mentioned early, our progress is proceeding as expected.  Our non-regulated energy marketing business now consists primarily of retail natural gas and electric customers in the northeastern quadrant of the United States with an energy supply agreement in place where our retail natural gas business to stabilize the collateral support requirements going forward.  
As we’ve said before, 2010 is a transitioned year.  Our financial results will be impacted by transition and restructuring items such as the gains and losses on transactions as well as the impacts of non-cash gains and losses related to derivative accounting.  Non-cash mark to market gains and losses will continue to be significant this issue but not as large as in historical quarters.
We have previously shared our growth projection for our restructured Integrys Energy Services segment which is based on our past experience in these markets. We recognize that it is early in our implementation of this strategy but based on our current progress and actual results in the first quarter of 2010, we continue to believe that our projections for 2010 and 2011 are reasonable and achievable.  We expect that overall volumes will be lower in 2010 compared to prior years because of divestitures and reduced sales during our restructuring process.
As our lower margin legacy contracts are running off, we are steadily replacing them with higher margin contracts reflecting new market conditions.  So despite the fact that the financial results were down for the Integrys Energy Services segment in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009, we see progress that indicates our implementation of the revised strategy for this segment is going according to plan.
  
I will now turn the call over to Joe O’Leary who will discuss our financial results in more detail.

I’ll cover our results for the first quarter of 2010 and briefly review our annual diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011.

I’ll cover our results for the first quarter of 2010 and briefly review our annual diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011.  Beginning with Slide 12, during the first quarter of 2010, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP, we recognized total diluted earnings per share of $0.64 for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 compared with a loss of $2.35 for the same quarter in 2009.
To arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for each of the quarters, we have removed net non-cash losses related to derivative and inventory accounting activities at Integrys Energy Services.  For the three months ended March 31, 2010, we have also removed the net loss and dispositions related to Integrys Energy Services strategy change that deferred any income tax expense resulting from the enactment of federal healthcare legislation and restructuring charges.  
There were no comparable adjustments for these items for the same period in 2009.  In addition, we have also removed the goodwill impairment loss related to the utility segment that occurred in the first quarter of 2009.  There was no comparable charge for this in the first quarter of 2010.  Eliminating the impact of these special items, our first quarter 2010 diluted earnings per share adjusted of $1.49 was slightly below the $1.56 we reported in the first quarter of 2009.  

As Charlie mentioned, we showed improvement in each of our reporting segments except Integrys Energy Services, and the results were in line with our expectations.  Given the warmer weather this year versus last year and the general economic slowdown that remains we are pleased with these results.  We attribute that to recent rate increases at our regulated utilities, as well as our cost management initiatives that Charlie discussed earlier.  
On Slide 13 we have presented the net income changes by segment for the first quarter of 2010.  The related key drivers by segment can be found on Slides 25 through 30 in the appendix.  I won't go through them here, but I will answer any questions you may have on this during our question and answer session.  Moving on to Slide 14, I will give you an update on our credit facilities.  
As most of you are aware, $1.3 billion of our $2.2 billion total credit line was due to mature during 2010.  We decided to renew $1.1 billion and that was completed during the latter part of April.  This reduction in credit facilities is in accordance with our plan to reduce our total credit line to $1.7 billion by December 31, 2011 as a result of the reduced size and scope of operations following Integrys Energy Services' restructuring.  With these new facilities in place, our total credit facilities now total $2 billion.  
Moving to Slide 15, I will give you an update on our 3 year capital expenditure plan.  Not much has changed at the utility level.  We added $40 million to 2012 for Integrys Energy Services in anticipation of additional non-regulated expenditures for solar projects we see on the horizon.  
Moving to Slide 16, we show our estimated utility depreciation.  The numbers for Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power have declined in the aggregate by $24 million over the 3 year timeframe compared with what we presented during our last quarterly conference call due to updated depreciation studies. 
Our net growth and regulated utility rate base for the 3 year period 2010 through 2012 is $482 million, as presented on Slide 17.  As set forth in Slide 18, our financing summary remains unchanged from what we presented at our Investor and Analyst Day in New York on February 17.  It's repeated here for ease of reference.  
As Charlie mentioned earlier, we are adjusting our diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 downward to reflect the impact of the recently enacted federal healthcare legislation.  And that $0.15 per share impact is set forth on Slide 19.  We are reaffirming our diluted earnings per share guidance for 2011, and this is reflected in Slide 20.  
As a reminder, the number for Integrys Energy Services other for both 2010 and 2011 was our estimate based on the information we had at the end of 2009.  This number will change over time, and it is impacted by energy prices as well as contracts that are terminating throughout the year and new business that is being entered into.  As such, we suggest you focus on the Integrys Energy Services core number for this segment.  Now I'll turn the call back over to Charlie Schrock.

Turning to Slide 21, I will summarize why we believe we are well positioned for the future before we take your questions.  First, the execution of our plan is on target.  Our utilities and our restructured Integrys Energy Services are performing as expected.  Our recovered capital target of $700 million for Integrys Energy Services was achieved ahead of schedule.  
Our quarterly common stock dividend of $0.68 per share was declared payable on June 19 to shareholders of record on May 28, 2010.  The dividend was maintained at the same amount as previously quarterly dividend declaration.  Although our utilities and Integrys Energy Services are performing as expected, we are adjusting our 2010 diluted earnings per share guidance to reflect the impact of the federal healthcare reform legislation.  
We are reaffirming our 2011 diluted earnings per share guidance.  Going forward our earnings will be driven by our regulated utilities and continuing investment in the American Transmission Company, complemented by our focused non-regulated operations and our cost management efforts.  And finally, we expect our earnings per share growth of 4% to 6% on an average annualized basis, with 2011 as the base year, through 2015.  We'd like to now open up the call for your questions.

I think you're referring to Slide 12 in the presentation, where we're taking earnings per share and we're trying to adjust it for certain items so we can do the comparisons to the prior year.  And so the healthcare affects 2010, does not affect 2009.  
So we're kind of pulling it out just for comparison purposes there so we can get down to an adjusted rate that kind of shows what's happening for business operations for that quarter in either year.  You know, separate from those particular items that we've adjusted for.  When we get to providing guidance for 2010 for the entire year, we're just trying to show you where we anticipate the guidance is going to end up for that year.  
And clearly, there is going to be an impact from the federal healthcare legislation.  We've noted how much that is.  And there is not an impact on that for 2011 and going forward.  The healthcare legislation will impact our costs, but we anticipate getting recovery of that in future rate cases.  
So it's really just the 2010 year that we have the $0.15 that we have to deal with.  Now, we had recognized deferred tax assets in prior years, and that's just us reversing that during the year 2010 upon the enactment of the legislation.  Although we did expense it, we do expect to go in and seek recovery of those amounts in our future rate case proceedings.

You look at that on a weighted average basis given the forward contracted volumes table in our supplemental data.  But in general, it's very rare to be less than a year, quite unusual to be longer than 3.

Let me just suggest that the dust has not settled on the Ameren rate case at this point.  You may or may not be aware of this, but I believe there is going to be a special open meeting of the Illinois Commerce Commission later today to discuss the amendatory order.

I wouldn’t take what the initial order was to the bank quite yet.  
Let me remind you that we’ve told you folks pretty consistently that we pride ourselves on having solid, positive regulatory relationships across all four states that our regulated utilities operate in.  We think that we’ve been responsive to regulatory inquiries.  We’ve put together complete and compelling evidentiary records for the commissions to make decisions on and quite honestly our results have been, what we would describe as reasonable across all four jurisdictions. 
We would not expect any of that to change.  I didn’t look specifically into the details of the Ameren order but I’ll tell you that we’ve had good success in Illinois and we would expect reasonable treatment to continue.

Now, like Charlie said, it’s early in the game and we’ve really had our sales engine up and running for half of the quarter, if you will, working on 2010 and beyond.  When I look at those realized margins, in the natural gas side we trailed 2009 by $11.3 million, well that’s a function of exiting the Canadian markets and then in Illinois in 2009 we pulled a lot of gas out of storage as we were working to improve our liquidity position.  That really drives that delta.  
On the electric side we’ve got a smaller delta and that’s really a function of some reduced sales volumes in Illinois and that’s consistent with scaled back marketing operations while we were working through our strategic change.  Our Texas business that we have announced our intent to move forward with the sale on as the opportunities present themselves so that business is not running at the rate that it was in 2009 and then also a miscellaneous in there we divested of our Northern Maine electric marketing business.
When I look at our forecast, I’m comfortable and when I look at compared to 2009 everything holds together.  That’s why we’re saying we’re comfortable with the trajectory that we’re on to hit our objectives.

I think it’s a great question and it does, on the natural gas side we really don’t see any impact of available margin and underlying commodity price because that is across the board a competitive market.
In some electric markets customers have a regulated alternative some kind of a standard offer that they will compare against.  And then what we see is more so than margin impact because we ultimately make the decision about the margin levels that we’re willing to contract up.  But what will happen is if prices rise relative to the standard offer alternative that a customer may have you’ll just see lots of opportunity to save customers money compared to that alternative and then they’ll stay with the standard offers.

Before we begin, I will advise everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay through November 2nd, 2010. I need to direct you to Slides 3 and 4 of our presentation and to point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Safe Harbor rules including projected results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries.
Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond the ability of Integrys Energy Group to control and in many cases; Integrys Energy Group cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements. I also refer you to the forward-looking statement section of yesterday's news release for further information. Except as may be required by federal securities laws, Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement contained in this presentation, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
Slide 5 indicates that today's presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted and adjusted earnings or loss. We believe that these are useful measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance and the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Please review the text of this slide regarding non-GAAP financial information.
I will now turn this call over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie?

Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on the call today. I will begin by providing an overview of our 2010 second quarter from a financial standpoint, as well as a brief overview of our operating results. Joe O'Leary will then discuss our financials for the second quarter of 2010 in more detail and our diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011. We will conclude with a question-and-answer session.
Moving to Slide 6, this quarter, we are emphasizing reported earnings on an adjusted basis and introducing guidance on an earnings per share adjusted basis. We decided to do this to provide better clarity and understanding of the performance of the company. Earnings per share adjusted excludes the effect of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. So with that explanation, we reported diluted earnings per share adjusted of $0.47 for the second quarter of 2010 versus $0.26 in the same period a year ago.
Financial results on an adjusted basis for all segments improved during the second quarter of 2010 compared with the same quarter in 2009. Our earnings were driven by our regulated utilities and continuing investment in American Transmission Company, complemented by our restructured non-regulated operations and cost management throughout the company.
Our guidance for diluted earnings per share adjusted remains unchanged on a consolidated basis for 2010 and 2011. Joe will have more to say on that shortly. We declared a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share payable in September 2010. We remain confident that successful execution of our business plan supports the dividend and will lead to a reasonable payout - reasonable dividend payout ratio over time.
Moving on to Slide 7, I will provide a brief operational overview, beginning with our regulated utilities. As you are aware, our customers are still facing tough economic times, and that is reflected in the demand and usage trends for our electric and natural gas utilities, particularly on the natural gas side. We have provided some additional economic data related to our service territories on Slide 19 in the Appendix.
Our plan to file rate cases as needed to bring our regulated utilities closer to their authorized returns on equity continues. We are in the process of a retail electric and natural gas rate case for Wisconsin Public Service, where we have requested that the decoupling cap for both electric and natural gas be replaced by an earnings cap. Commission staff testimony for that case is due on August 20th, 2010. Additional details on this rate case are included in the Appendix on Slide 21.
We filed a retail electric rate case for Upper Peninsula Power on June 30th, 2010, and the details of that filing can also be found in the Appendix on Slide 22. The decoupling mechanism for Michigan Gas Utilities was approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission, and it becomes effective on September 1st, 2010. This mechanism relates only to customer usage and not weather. We have appealed the effective date in the Commission's order, requesting that the effective date for this decoupling mechanism be retroactive to January 1st, 2010.
Our commitment to managing costs, streamlining operations, and improving efficiency through our operational excellence initiative throughout our companies continues. We are essentially completed with our reduction in force initiative and have reduced our workforce by approximately 300 employees at the regulated utilities and Integrys Business Support, our shared services company, without compromising safety and customer service. We are now moving further into our operational excellence initiative by refining or redefining processes with our reduced staffing levels, and we expect to see the cost benefits related to this continue into the future.
Moving on to Slide 8, we are making good progress on implementing our strategy for retail natural gas and retail power business operations at Integrys Energy Services. Although power volumes have been lower than expected, per-unit margins have been higher and operating and maintenance costs lower, thus leading to net income within the range of our projections.
On Slide 8, we show where our retail natural gas and electric contracted volumes stand as of June 30th, 2010 for the calendar years 2010 and 2011. For calendar year 2010, we depict a combination of actual delivered volumes for the six months ended June 30th, 2010, as well as our estimate of the forward book volumes per the contracts we had in place at June 30th, 2010.
For 2011, we only depict our estimate of the forward book volumes for the next year based on contracts we have in place as of June 30th, 2010. Consequently, this excludes anticipated new retail energy contracts entered into subsequent to the June 30th, 2010 for volumes delivered starting in 2011 and beyond. We continue to evaluate our marketing and pricing strategies to optimize the portfolio across the various sizes and types of customers and products. We are currently targeting medium and smaller commercial and industrial customers.
In looking at our 2011 estimated contract forward book volumes for retail natural gas and retail electric as of June 30th, 2010 versus our targets for the full year 2011, our goal is to have the 2011 estimated contract volumes at approximately 50% of target by the end of 2010. We expect to contract in 2011 for the remainder of the targeted 2011 delivered volumes. Based on our progress to date, we remain confident that our core earnings target for 2011 is achievable.
Moving on to Slide 9, another key achievement for Integrys Energy Services in the second quarter was the sale of the retail electric marketing business in Texas, which is the last of several key divestitures we have made over the past year. As we continue the restructuring of Integrys Energy Services, 2010 will be a transition year. Since our strategy change began, we have reduced Integrys Energy Services' headcount by approximately 260 employees from its peak of about 570 in late 2008.
Financial results for 2010 will continue to be impacted by this transition and related restructuring items, such as the gains and losses on divestiture transactions, as well as the impacts of non-cash gains and losses related to derivative accounting. Due to the nature of the business, non-cash mark-to-market gains and losses will be significant, but much less than in past years.
As stated during our earnings conference call in May, we achieved our objective to recover $700 million of capital invested at Integrys Energy Services in April 2010, which was ahead of schedule. We remain on target to reduce Integrys Energy Group's corporate guarantees extended on behalf of Integrys Energy Services' steady-state retail energy businesses to $500 million by the end of 2010 from a high of $2.6 billion at March 31st, 2009. Slide 10 shows our historical progression on reducing our corporate guarantees, extended on behalf of Integrys Energy Services.
In summary, based on our current progress and results during the first half of 2010, we continue to believe that our earnings projections for all segments of Integrys Energy Group for 2010 and 2011 are reasonable and achievable, and we see progress that indicates implementation of our strategy is going according to our expectations.
So with that, I will now turn the call over to Joe O'Leary.

I will cover our results for the second quarter 2010 and briefly review our annual diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011. Beginning with Slide 11, during the period - during the second quarter of 2010, in accordance wit",1150,"Thank you, Charlie. I will cover our results for the second quarter 2010 and briefly review our annual diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011. Beginning with Slide 11, during the period - during the second quarter of 2010, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP, we recognized total diluted earnings per share of $1.01 for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 compared with $0.45 for the same quarter in 2009.
To arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted, we have removed net non-cash gains related to derivative and inventory accounting activities at Integrys Energy Services, the net gain on the dispositions related to the Integrys Energy Services' strategy change, restructuring charges, and settlement of certain Integrys Energy Services' supply contracts. Eliminating the impact of these special items, our second quarter 2010 diluted earnings per share adjusted of $0.47 was nearly double the $0.26 we reported in the second quarter of 2009. As Charlie mentioned, we showed improvement in each of our reporting segments, and the results were in line with our expectations.
On Slide 12, we have presented the changes in adjusted earnings by segment for the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of 2009. The related key drivers for each segment during the quarter can be found on Slides 29 through 33 in the Appendix. I will not go through the key drivers here, but I will answer any questions you may have on the drivers during our question-and-answer session.
As set forth in Slide 13 with one exception, our financing summary remains unchanged from what we presented to you during our first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. That exception is that we are now projecting Peoples Gas to raise approximately $50 million in long-term debt in 2011 to support our capital investment program. Recall that our accelerated cast iron replacement program and related infrastructure rider including a $45.3 million base was approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission earlier this year, and this is the incremental financing needed to support our investment program.
Also, note that in May 2010, Moody's maintained the credit rating for Integrys Energy Group, and improved the outlook from negative to stable. This also resulted in improved senior secured ratings for Wisconsin Public Service, Peoples Gas, and North Shore Gas. Please see our credit ratings exhibit in the Appendix on Slide 23 for further details.
To reiterate what we said in our previous conference call and what is summarized on Slide 24 in the Appendix, $1.3 billion of our total $2.2 billion credit line at the start of 2010 was scheduled to mature in the second quarter of 2010, and we were able to replace this with a $1.1 billion, three-year credit facility. The reduction in our credit facilities to $2 billion was by design due in part to the downsizing Integrys Energy Services and is in line with our goal to reduce our total credit facilities to $1.7 billion by December 31st, 2011. There are no changes to our expected capital expenditures, estimated depreciation, and net growth in regulated utility rate base investment for the three-year period 2010 through 2012. The slides from our first quarter conference call are included in the Appendix in Slides 25 through 27.
I would now like to turn our discussion to earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011, which begins on Slide 14. The key takeaway here is that on a consolidated basis, our guidance for 2010 diluted earnings per share adjusted of $2.89 to $3.17 per share is unchanged had we provided guidance for diluted earnings per share adjusted in May. This is a good demonstration of the effectiveness of our portfolio strategy and its beneficial impact on our earnings per share. I will have more to say on this when we get to Slide 16.
At our Investor and Analyst Meeting in February 2010, we provided diluted earnings per share guidance by segment on a GAAP basis. Additionally, we further broke down diluted earnings per share guidance for Integrys Energy Services into two components, Core, our representation of the operational earnings potential for this segment going forward; and Other, for items such as non-cash derivative and inventory accounting adjustments, as well as gains/losses on divestiture transactions and restructuring costs related to the strategy change. At that time, we cautioned that the Other line item for the Integrys Energy Services segment in 2010 would remain highly variable as we execute the strategy change at Integrys Energy Services. This line item is impacted by divestiture sales, energy prices, and contracts that are terminating throughout the year.
Subsequently, during our first quarter earnings conference call in May, we reduced our GAAP guidance for the one-time impact of the federal health care reform legislation. Our focus then remained on earnings per share on a GAAP basis, but we provided the information necessary to adjust our guidance for the one-time, non-recurring federal health care reform impact and the variable Integrys Energy Services, Other component.
Having completed the second quarter, we have further clarified our segment guidance. Our focus is now on a non-GAAP presentation of guidance for diluted earnings per share adjusted, which excludes special items such as gains and losses and certain other impacts related to divestiture transactions, restructuring costs, net non-cash gains or losses related to derivative accounting, and the non-cash impact on margin resulting from inventory accounting adjustments, as well as the impact of the federal health care reform legislation.
Slide 14 shows our guidance for Integrys Energy Group consolidated 2010 diluted earnings per share adjusted. We have revised 2010 guidance on a segment basis. We have increased our Regulated Electric Utility segment guidance to account for higher throughput and lower operating and maintenance expenses. The Regulated Natural Gas Utility segment has been revised downward to account for warmer weather, which caused lower throughput volumes, and lower large commercial and industrial sales at Wisconsin Public Service.
In the Integrys Energy Services segment, we have revised guidance, primarily due to the impact of the final order received from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission relating to the Seams Elimination Charge Adjustment or SECA.
Slide 15 shows our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted. The segment numbers have not changed. Finally, Slide 16 is a summary comparison of the 2010 and 2011 May guidance and the adjustments that lead to the guidance we are issuing today. To reiterate, the key takeaway here, is that on a consolidated basis, our guidance for 2010 diluted earnings per share adjusted of $2.89 to $3.17 per share is unchanged from May.
Additionally, our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted of $3.24 to $3.57 is also unchanged from what we presented in May. For further detail on 2010 guidance on an adjusted basis by segment, see Slide 28 in the Appendix.
Now, I will turn the call back over to Charlie Schrock. Charlie?

Before we take your questions, I will conclude by briefly reviewing the reasons why Integrys remains well-positioned for the future.
Please turn to Slide 17. First, the continued successful execution of our strategy is demonstrated by quarter-over-quarter increases in financial performance on an adjusted basis for all segments. As expected, these results have been driven by regulatory progress at our regulated utilities; continuing investment in American Transmission Company; focused performance at Integrys Energy Services that is in line with our plans and expectations; a reduction in force across our companies that is nearing completion; and our commitment to cost management, streamlined operations, and operational efficiency.
Our quarterly common stock dividend of $0.68 per share was declared payable on September 20 to shareholders of record on August 31st, 2010. Our guidance for 2010 diluted earnings per share adjusted on a consolidated basis of $2.89 to $3.17 remains unchanged, as Joe explained, with what we provided you during our first quarter earnings conference call on May 6, 2010. Our guidance for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted of $3.24 to $3.57 on a consolidated basis also remains unchanged from what we presented on May 6, 2010. And finally, we continue to expect earnings per share growth of 4% to 6% on an average annualized basis, with 2011 as the base year, through 2015.
We would now like to open the call up for questions.

So we have always said that that component was going to change. Now we are just trying to clarify and kind of exclude the impact of those in arriving at earnings per share adjusted. If you look at Slide 16, you will see that if you - if we had gone to earnings per share adjusted back in May, we would have come up with total consolidated earnings per share for 2010 of between $2.89 to $3.17, and we are doing the same this quarter.

Before we begin, I will advise everyone that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay through February 22, 2011.  
I need to direct you to Slide 3 and 4 of our presentation and point out that this presentation contains forward-looking statements within the definition of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Safe Harbor rules including projected results for Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries.  Forward-looking statements contain factors that are beyond the ability of Integrys Energy Group to control, and in many cases Integrys Energy Group cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements.  I also refer you to the forward-looking statement section of yesterday’s news release for further information.  Except as may be required by federal securities laws, Integrys Energy Group and its subsidiaries undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement contained in this presentation whether the result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
Slide 5 indicates that today’s presentation includes non-GAAP financial information related to diluted earnings per share adjusted and adjusted earnings or loss.  We believe that these are useful measures for providing investors with additional insight into our operating performance and the efforts of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next.  Please review the text of this slide regarding non-GAAP financial information.
I will now turn this call over to Charlie Schrock.  Charlie?

Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on the call today.

Joe O’Leary will then discuss our financials for the third quarter of 2010 in more detail and our guidance for 2010 and 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted.  We will conclude with a question and answer session.
Moving to Slide 6, we are emphasizing reported earnings on an adjusted basis as we did last quarter.  As a reminder, earnings per share adjusted excludes the effect of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next and is how we evaluate our financial performance. 
So with that explanation, we reported diluted earnings per share adjusted of $0.35 for the third quarter of 2010 versus $0.29 in the same quarter a year ago.  This quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily driven by increased sales at our regulated electric utility segment mainly due to warmer weather than in 2009.  As a reminder to what we released a week ago, our guidance range for 2010 diluted earnings per share adjusted is between $3.00 and $3.17; and as indicated in the news release that we issued last evening, we are reaffirming our guidance range for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted of between $3.24 and $3.57.
Please move to Slide 7 as I provide a brief operational overview of our regulated utilities and non-regulated retail energy supply and services subsidiary.  The performance of our regulated utilities was in line with our expectations.  In fact, for the regulated electric utility segment, the third quarter was strong as a result of the hottest summer since 1995 in Wisconsin and the upper peninsula of Michigan.  The addition of Weston 4 in 2008 in our efforts to adjust the operation of our generating plants to optimize their performance within the Midwest Independent System Operator energy market has resulted in benefits for both customers and shareholders.  
With weather much warmer than in 2009, electric consumption was up significantly, including residential consumption which was 15.2% over the same quarter of last year.  Even with higher demand, we were able to supply our customers with lower cost internally generated electricity as well as sell excess generation into the marketplace through opportunity sales.  Customers and shareholders in turn benefited as well because of our current position in the Wisconsin fuel window.
For the regulated natural gas segment, third quarter is traditionally our lowest quarter.  Additional detail is disclosed in our news release.  The performance of this segment was as expected.
From an economic standpoint, we saw signs that things are stabilizing with a slight improvement in our electric utilities service areas.  We have provided some additional economic data related to our service territories on Slide 22 in the Appendix.  
On the regulatory front, our rate cases at Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power are progressing according to schedule.  Details on each of these proceedings can be found in the Appendix on Slides 24 and 25.  
The decoupling mechanism for Michigan gas utilities was approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission effective retroactive to January 1, 2010.  For our Michigan gas utilities, this mechanism relates only to customer usage and not to weather.
Also in the works are plans to file a retail natural gas rate case for Minnesota Energy Resources with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission by the end of November.  Details will be available on our website once filed.  We expect to have more to share with you regarding this rate case during our fourth quarter conference call in February of next year.
With respect to our non-regulated retail energy supply and services subsidiary, our restructuring plan remains on track to be completed by year-end.  The retained businesses are showing quarter-over-quarter unit margin improvement.  Our investment plans related to assets with renewal attributes are also on track with our recently announced solar joint venture with Duke Energy Generation Services as an integral part of our go-forward plan.  We are excited about this joint venture as we believe it will provide increased opportunities for quality solar photovoltaic projects.  Additional details regarding this joint venture are provided in the Appendix on Slides 38 and 39.
Moving onto Slide 8, we are making good progress on the implementation of our strategy for retail natural gas and retail power business operations at Integrys Energy Services.  The volumes at September 30, 2010 that are contracted for delivery in 2010 and 2011 related to the natural gas and retail electric businesses show improvement versus what we reported to you in August for contracted volumes at June 30, 2010.
Expanding a bit more on our operational results through the third quarter of 2010, Slide 9 depicts the progress we are making during this transitional year.  For the quarter, the financial results for our retained businesses are up versus the comparable period a year ago.  Our volumes for retail natural gas are on target but the projected 2010 and 2011 retail electric volumes are falling short of the expectations we set in February of this year.  However, our unit margins for power are ahead of plan.  This resulted in overall unit margin improvement thus far in 2010 versus the same period in 2009.
As set forth on Slide 10 and as mentioned previously, we achieved our $700 million recovered capital target in April of this year, and we continue to remain on track to meet our corporate guarantee target level for our non-regulated retail business of $500 million by December 31, 2010 as set forth on Slide 10.
With that, I will now turn this (audio interference).

I’ll cover our results for the third quarter 2010 and briefly review our annual diluted earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011.  Beginning with Slide 11, during the third quarter of 2010 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we recognized diluted earnings per share of $0.26 for the quarter ended September 30, 2010, compared with $0.66 for the same quarter in 2009.  To arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted, we removed restructuring charges at Integrys Energy Group in addition to the following items related to Integrys Energy Services:  net non-cash gains related to a derivative in inventory accounting activities; the settlement of supply contracts related to divestitures; the impairment losses on property, plant and equipment; and the net loss on dispositions and foreign currency translation gain.  Eliminating the impact of these special items, our third quarter 2010 diluted earnings per share adjusted of $0.35 is more than 20% better than the $0.29 we reported in the third quarter of 2009.  Additional details by segment on an adjusted earnings or loss basis are provided on Slide 34 and on a diluted earnings per share adjusted basis on Slide 35.
Although I won’t go into the same detail for the year-to-date comparisons, Slide 11 provides the special item details to arrive at diluted earnings per share adjusted for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2010 and 2009 of $2.30 and $2.12 respectively.
On Slide 12, we present the changes in adjusted earnings by segment for the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009.  The related key drivers for each segment during the quarter can be found on Slides 29 through 33 in the Appendix.  I will not go through the key drivers here, but I will answer any questions you may have on the key drivers during our question and answer session.
Moving to Slide 13, we have provided an update for you on our capital expenditure plans for all our subsidiaries.  On a Company-wide basis, the total capital spending through 2012 is down about $20 million compared with what we indicated prior to this point.  The key highlights include a shifting and slight reduction in capital expenditures for Wisconsin Public Service due to the timing of certain environmental projects at our generating stations, and a $16 million reduction in capital expenditures for Integrys Energy Services in 2010 to reflect a shift in timing of some solar projects.  The actual investment level will depend on opportunities available in each of those years.  The balance of the changes is the result of modest adjustments to what we presented during our second quarter conference call in August, 2010.
These changes have also been reflected in the regulated utility depreciation schedule as set forth on Slide 14, as well as the summary of net growth and regulated utility rate base investments as set forth on Slide 15.
Moving to Slide 16, let me summarize the slight changes in our financing plan for the balance of 2010 and 2011.  In 2010, we completed two $50 million tranches, one in August and one in September, for Peoples Gas.  These were opportunistic financings to replace existing debt at lower interest rates.  For the balance of 2010, we expect to issue up to $250 million of debt at the Integrys Energy Group parent level to repay existing short-term debt, fund a portion of the repayment by Peoples Energy for its unsecured notes maturing in January 2011, and for general corporate purposes including pension contributions.
For 2011, we expect to issue between 100 million and $150 million of long-term debt for Wisconsin Public Service, and $50 million of long-term debt for Peoples Gas.  The latter we will use to support the accelerated natural gas main replacement program in Chicago.  Our equity financing plan remains as previously mentioned and our reference to 2010 credit rating actions by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s is repeated for your reference.  For specific credit rating details, you can turn to the Appendix on Slide 26.
I would now like to turn our discussion to earnings per share guidance for 2010 and 2011, which begins on Slide 17.  As we indicated in our news release of a week ago, our guidance range for 2010 diluted earnings per share adjusted is between $3.00 and $3.17.  This is an increase to the lower end of our range from $2.89 as presented on August 5, 2010, while the upper end of the guidance range for 2010 diluted earnings per share adjusted of $3.17 remains unchanged.  
Moving to Slide 18, I will walk through the segment changes which are essentially in line with our third quarter 2010 financial results.  For the regulated electric utility segment, the per-share increase of $0.11 to $0.15 is primarily attributable to weather with some additional benefit related to our cost management efforts.  For the regulated natural gas utility segment, the downward revision is reflective of our third quarter financial performance.  The electric transmission investment segment has been revised downward for the same reason.  For Integrys Energy Services, we expect modest improvements in earnings contribution from the core operations due to our better than forecasted unit margins and reduced operations and maintenance expenses carrying through to the end of the year.  
Finally, our holding company and other segment is down modestly due to higher effective tax rates offsetting reduced interest expenses.
In summary, the improved expectation that the regulated electric segment and for Integrys Energy Services core operations should more than offset the more modest expected earnings decline at the regulated natural gas utility and holding company and other segments.  Additional details of our 2010 earnings per share adjusted are provided on Slide 28.
As Charlie mentioned earlier, our guidance range for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted remains unchanged from what we presented on August 5, 2010 and remains between $3.24 and $3.57.  We have replicated the slide from our second quarter 2010 conference call as Slide 19.
Now I’ll turn the call back over to Charlie Schrock.

Before we take your questions, I will conclude by briefly reviewing why Integrys remains well positioned for the future.  Please turn to Slide 20.
First, the continued successful execution of our strategy as demonstrated by quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in financial performance on an adjusted basis for our consolidated company.  The execution of our business strategy is on track for the regulated utilities and our non-regulated retail energy supply and services subsidiary.  Our guidance range for 2010 diluted earnings per share adjusted that we provided in a news release on October 28, 2010 remains between $3.00 and $3.17.  Our guidance range for 2011 diluted earnings per share adjusted remains unchanged from what we provided last quarter of between $3.24 and $3.57.  
I feel that our ability to meet the financial projections that we shared with you about 18 months ago is noteworthy.  The plans we made then remain on track due to the effective use of cost controls, staff reduction and furloughs, and rate cases at our regulated utilities when necessary to meet our financial objectives.  Our operational excellence initiatives will help us permanently remove costs from the system.
We have nearly completed our strategy change at Integrys Energy Services and now have a smaller footprint with a focus on a few key areas - retail natural gas marketing, retail electric marketing, and asset generation investments with renewal attributes.  We have concentrated our efforts where we have solid capabilities and critical mass to enable cost-effective operations.  We have maintained the rate of our quarterly dividend per share and we are confident in our plan to bring our dividend payout ratio more in line with our utility peers over time.
And finally, we continue to expect diluted earnings per share adjusted growth of 4 to 6% on an average annualized basis with 2011 as the base year through 2015.
We will now open up the call for questions.

Morning, Paul.  Thanks very much for the question.  When we talk about pricing strategy, what we’re really talking about is given the way cost of capital has changed in the industry, the collateral that’s required to support this business, we are now projecting—for every transaction that we enter into, we project the potential collateral requirements under various market stress moves.  You know, we’ve talked always in the past about how we hedge the requirements to fulfill our customer contracts at the time of making those commitments to our customers.  And so we price in the maximum potential collateral that could be required to support that contract over the life, and then so that’s flowing through the margin line.  That’s one of the reasons why you’re seeing larger margins in this business when you’re looking at quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year comparisons.

So that’s why we’re projecting a continued ramp-up of the realized margins and we see our contracting activity reflecting those higher margins, so that’s what gives us the confidence in standing behind those higher margin projections.  We are seeing everyone in the industry do that.  We didn’t see it initially.  We put this approach in place back in 2009, even before we had decided the ultimate fate for this Company, and initially we didn’t see competitors do that and that really slowed down our contracting activity.  Over the several months after we began that pricing strategy, we began to see competitors do things very, very similar, and so the pricing strategy that we use today, we do that as an at-market pricing strategy.

I wanted to provide that 3 million megawatt hours as a ballpark reduction, but not providing a specific number per se because it’s—we’re just not focused on a volume number.  I think that when organizations put volume targets out there, you know, you can go get volume.  That’s not what this volume is about.  This business is about going and getting quality business that meets our needs in terms of the cost required to run this business, and meets customer needs in terms of delivering the value that they need from their energy supplier.  And we’re comfortable with the results that—the bottom line contribution that we included in our 2011 guidance, and that will be on a smaller volume than we had originally projected.  Frankly, I view that as a good thing.  Any time you can deliver the same results in a business on less volume, you’ve got less transactions risks, you’ve got lower capital costs associated with supporting that business; and so we’re pleased with what we see for the business heading into 2011.
