Welcome to the Hersey Company's Fourth Quarter 2009 Conference Call. Dave West, President and CEO; Bert Alfonso, Senior Vice President and CFO, and I will represent Hershey on this morning's call.

These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2008 filed with the SEC.If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website www.hersheys.com in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release are consolidated balance sheets and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as pro forma summary of consolidated statements of income quantitatively reconciled to GAAP.As we've said in the press release, the company uses these non-GAAP measures as a key metric for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP; rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings excluding certain items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.We will discuss our fourth quarter 2009 results excluding net pretax charges. The majority of these charges involve 2009 and 2008 are associated with the global supply chain transformation program. These pretax charges were $26.5 million and $79.7 million in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of net charges related to these business realignment initiatives. I'll now turn it over to Dave West."

I assume everyone on the call has had an opportunity to read our November 18th and January 22 press releases. After a thorough and complete examination, management and the Board of Directors unanimously concluded not to make an offer for Cadbury. Our Board of Directors and management team remains extremely confident in Hersey's consumer driven strategy and in the company's ability to execute and deliver long-term value for all stockholders. We will evaluate future acquisition opportunities in the same disciplined manner to ensure appropriate fit within our financial and strategic framework. We'll continue to follow this disciplined approach and we'll continue to invest in Hersey's existing brands and global infrastructure. With close to a 45% share of the U.S. chocolate market and strong and growing businesses in Canada and Mexico, and nearly a 20% compound annual growth rate outside of the U.S. and Canada over the past five years, we continue to be encouraged by our position in the marketplace and confident in continuing future success.Now for a discussion on our results. I'm very pleased with Hershey's fourth quarter and full-year performance. We finished the year on solid footing and over delivered on our earnings per share objective by growing adjusted earnings per share 15% year-over-year. We achieved this in an extremely challenging environment that included global economic uncertainty and challenging consumer conditions, commodity spot market price volatility, the implementation and execution of a major price increase, the continued rollout and evolution of our consumer driven approach to core brand investment, as well as the completion of our global supply chain transformation program. Despite these challenges, we delivered net sales and EPS growth that was significantly greater than the profile we shared with you at this time a year ago. For the full year 2009, net sales increased a bit more than 4% on a constant currency basis, up 3.2% reported. Gross and EBIT margins expanded meaningfully and our balance sheet and cash flow were very strong. We made excellent progress in 2009, and we look forward to delivering on our financial targets for the third consecutive year in 2010.In terms of Hershey's marketplace performance, for the 12 and 52 weeks ending January 2, 2010, using our custom database and this is in channels that account for over 80% of our Retail business. Total confections category retail consumer takeaway was up a strong 6% for the 12 weeks ending January 2, and it was up 7.2% for the year 2009. As a reminder, these channels include food, drug and mass. And mass here includes Wal-Mart and convenience stores.This growth rate is higher than the FDMx stated that most of you received from IRI or Nielsen on a quad basis. FDMx only captures about half of our retail takeaways and excludes one of our largest mass customers, with whom we had performed well and exclude C-stores. In addition, it also excludes value and club format stores.Within food drug and mass here excluding Wal-Mart and convenience, so FDMxC the category also continues to grow. In 2009, the CMG category in FDMxC increased 4.4%, greater than the historical growth rate which is usually around 3% to 4%. In the fourth quarter, the CMG category was up 4%. Again, this is excluding Wal-Mart. As we look into 2010, we would expect historical growth rates to prevail in the category.Total Hershey FDMxC retail takeaways of 2.6 in the fourth quarter was less than the category. And as we expected, resulted in a market share loss of 0.4 points. The decline was primarily driven by our decision to exit premium chocolates. Cacao Reserve, Starbucks and Joseph Schmidt, all of which played a role in gifting last year. And it contributed and it was also contributed to by the previously mentioned challenges in the drug class of trade. For the full-year 2009, in FDMxC, the category grew for 4.4%. Hershey retail takeaway for the year was 4.7%, resulting in a share gain for the year 2009 of the 0.1 points. Our marketplace results in measured channels were driven by our success in the food and convenience classes of trade. Our continued growth in these two areas, as a result of the targeted investments we make. Our in-store sales force remains a competitive advantage and has been a large part of our success. It differentiates us from our competitors. The investments we have made and will continue to make in Retail resources will be augmented by additional efforts in consumer insights, in-store merchandising and programming and will ensure we bring confectionary ideas and solutions to retailers to drive profitable growth for both Hershey and our customers.For the full-year 2009 in the food class of trade, the category grew 6%. With Hersey retail takeaway for the year up 6.3%, resulting in a share gain of 0.1 points. Fourth quarter food class of trade growth was 7.7% with Hershey takeaway at 7.3%, a bit lower than the category reflecting the earlier reference to Premium segment performance. As a result, food channel market share was off 0.1 points in the quarter. Hershey's Q4 class of trade in chocolate, the takeaway was up 7%. Again, a bit lower than the category with share off 0.1 points. Our non-chocolate foods takeaway was up 15.3%, resulting in a market share gain of 0.4 points in non-chocolate. These results were driven by core brand performance with Hershey's Bliss, Reese's, Kit Kat and Twizzlers retail takeaway, up double digits in the food class trade. We enjoyed solid Halloween sell-through, resulting in Hershey gaining one-full market share point for Halloween in food class of trade. And we did see slight improvement in our Kisses franchise and food, with takeaway up low-single digits due to advertising responsiveness to our baking merchandising and couponing.As it relates to the overall Halloween and Holiday seasons, as expected in Q4, total seasonal category retail sales were slightly up versus a year ago. Specifically in FDMx, Halloween retail category dollar growth was up 1.3% and Hershey FDMx Halloween performance was in line with our expectations as we gain 0.3 market share points driven by the solid performance in the food class of trade. FDMx Holiday retail category growth was up about 1.6%. Hershey's Holiday performance as expected was soft, given the discretionary challenges related to gifting and our decision to discontinue certain premium products that were in the marketplace last year or that would be in 2008 in the fourth quarter.We talk a little bit about C-store, where the category was up 2.3% in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, Hershey seized our takeaway increased 3.7%, resulting in a share gain of 0.3 points. In Q4 Hershey C-store chocolate and non-chocolate takeaway was up 5% and 7.2%, respectively. These gains were driven by core brand advertising, in-store selling and merchandising, and solid programming, including NCAA College Football promotion supported by on-air advertising, a nostalgic standard bar program, leveraging Hershey's iconic brand and the king-size launched of TWIZZLERS PULL-N-PEEL.As we stated in October, the drug class of trade continued to be a drag on our overall Q4 FDMxC marketplace results, with Hershey drug channel market share declining 1.9 points in the fourth quarter. The changes in our go-to-market model have not driven the type of performance in the drug class of trade relative to its success in other formats. As we entered 2010, we have worked with key drug retail customers to our mutually acceptable strategy that will drive category customer and Hershey growth. However, this channel will most likely remain a headwind on our overall marketplace performance during the first part of the year.As we look at 2010, we have many exciting products, promotions and programs in place, including an NCAA Final Four Basketball promotion following up on a very successful 2009 event. Sponsorship for the blockbuster Iron Man 2 movie, starring Robert Downey Jr., increased levels of Valentine's and Easter support, the continued rollout of Hershey's Special Dark, Almond Joy and York Pieces as well as Hershey's Bliss White Chocolate and the launch of selected limited editions, including Kit Kat Dark and Thingamajig, both back by popular demand from retailers. We have other innovation plan for the second half which we'll share with you as the year unfolds.Additionally, full-year advertising expense will increase approximately 25% to 30% year-over-year. We'll continue to support previously mentioned core brands, particularly Hershey's, Reese's, Hershey's Kisses and Bliss, Twizzlers and Kit Kat as well as new core brand advertising campaigns for the Almond Joy, Mounds and York brands. We'll also continue to build on a consumer insights where we started in 2009, understanding consumers and identifying trends is critical and as category capped and we take our obligation to providing category solutions for the retail very seriously. We're committed to the proprietary insights we have completed today, and we'll continue to develop on an ongoing basis as it is a critical part of our success. We'll share some of this work with you at CAGNY.Let me wrap up my comments. Despite the macroeconomic challenges facing the consumer, the category continues to grow across Retail channels, in both measured and non-measured outlets. Our advertising, consumer investments and insights will enable Hershey to consistently and predictively achieve its financial targets. We expect 2010 net sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term objective. Additionally, we have good visibility into our full-year cost structure, and expect our ongoing growth in adjusted earnings per share diluted to be within our long-term objective of 6% to 8%.As we look to the long-term, Hershey has many opportunities to leverage its global brands in U.S. scale. Our consumer full model is working in the U.S., and its approach is being adopted many of our international markets. Additionally, we are continuously examining our overall cost structure, and believe opportunities exist to maintain and/or improve margins while continually monitoring commodity market volatility. And we'll have again more on the cost structure at CAGNY.Our balance sheet and cash flows remained strong and we will continue to be disciplined, but open to sources of growth via M&A. Our executive management team and the Board of Directors are confident that this approach will continue to build value for all Hershey shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Bert Alfonso, who will provide you with some additional financial details."
98873,84945153,47966,"Hershey Co., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2010",2010-02-02,"Earnings Calls","The Hershey Company","Executives","Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. Net sales of adjusted earnings per share diluted from operations for the full-year 2009, exceeded initial ranges we communicated at the beginning of last year. Solid efforts during the year by the Sales, Marketing,",2036,"Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. Net sales of adjusted earnings per share diluted from operations for the full-year 2009, exceeded initial ranges we communicated at the beginning of last year. Solid efforts during the year by the Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain and Finance groups result in strong price realization, while volume declines were less than anticipated. Overall, we're pleased with our financial and marketplace performance in 2009, given the volatile environment in both commodity and financial markets, as well as the pressures facing consumers. Fourth quarter consolidated net sales of 1,407,000,000  increased to 2.2% versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS diluted of $0.63 increased 7%, primarily due to price realization, supply chain savings and a lower effective income tax rate which more than offset the impact of volume decline, higher input cost and increased marketing investment. In addition, fourth quarter results include a non-occurring benefit from LIFO accounting related to targeted inventory reductions. These essentially offset the cost advisory fees related to our consideration of a transaction with Cadbury. For the full year, net sales increased 3.2% or 4.2% on a constant currency basis. Resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $2.17, up 15.4%. In the fourth quarter, sales gains were driven primarily by pricing and improvements in our International business. Mid-single-digit pricing gains were partially offset by expected base volume declines associated with the U.S. pricing actions, and previously communicated positions to close our Online Gift business and discontinue certain premium chocolate products. Importantly in the fourth quarter, base volume declines improve sequentially from mid- to low-single digits. As we communicated in October due to timing, shipments of Valentine and Easter season cost were lower in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus 2008. All season benefits from the shipped in the first quarter of 2010. Also foreign currency exchange was about a one-point benefit in the quarter, a change from quarters one to three in which FX detracted from sales growth. Dave provided details related to our marketplace performance, so I'll now focus and I'll review the P&L, balance sheet and cash flow starting with gross margin.During the fourth quarter, adjusted gross margins increased 330 basis points, primarily driven by net price realization, supply-chain savings, productivity and lower levels of inventory that led to a favorable non-recurring 100 basis point benefit from LIFO accounting. These margin gains more than offset higher input costs about 150 basis points, primarily reflecting total consolidated cost increases for raw materials. Higher employee benefit costs, primarily pension expense or manufacturing facilities also reduce adjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter. For the full-year 2009, adjusted gross margin was 38.9% versus 35.8% in 2008, up 310 basis points as pricing and productivity initiatives inclusive of the World Supply Chain Transformation program [Global Supply Chain Transformation program] offset 200 basis points of unfavorable input costs. Adjusted EBIT margins increased 10 basis points in the fourth quarter as higher gross margin was substantially offset by advertising, up 50% in the quarter, marking the expenses including consumer promotions, employee-related costs including incentive and pension expense and advisory fees related to our consideration of a transaction with Cadbury. Adjusted EBIT for the full year increased 11.7% with EBIT margin up 120 basis points from 15% to 16.2%. The increase was driven by higher gross margin partially offset by increased advertising investments and employee-related costs. For the year, advertising increased 50% to 241 million.Now let me provide a brief update on our International businesses. During 2009, we made good progress in the international markets where we operate. Our International group face many of the same challenges as the U.S. counterparts including implementation of price increases in certain markets, economically impacting consumers and volatile foreign exchange rates. Overall, on a constant currency basis and excluding the Van Houten business that we acquired earlier in the year, International fourth quarter sales were up mid-single digits. So we reported International profitability was down versus a year ago, driven by brand building and investments in key markets. As we look in 2010, we'll continue to invest in our strategic international markets to increase the distribution of our products, enhance brand awareness and further develop our core to market capabilities.Moving down the P&L, for the fourth quarter, interest expense decreased coming in a 22 million versus 25 million last year. For the year, interest expense was 90 million versus 98 million in 2008. The fourth quarter and full year both benefited from lower short-term rates in our commercial paper and improvements in working capital. Lower debt levels also contributed to the lower interest expense as we significantly reduced our short-term debt during the year. In 2010, we expect interest expense to be in the 90 million to 100 million range.The tax rate in the fourth quarter was 33.6%, down 210 basis points versus a year ago. For the full year, tax rate was 35.5%, down 50 basis points versus a year ago. The change in the tax rate result in a $0.02 EPS benefit in the quarter and the full year. The improvement was primarily due to foreign tax benefits and a lower-than-expected tax rate in our moderate Monterrey, Mexico business. For the full-year 2010, we expect the effective income tax rate to be about 35%, primarily due to an increase in the federal manufacturing deduction from 6% to 9%. Additionally, on a quarterly basis, we expect the tax rate to be smoother in 2010 versus 2009, about 36% during the first half of the year and 34% in the back half.The fourth quarter of 2009 weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 229.6 million versus 228.5 million shares in 2008, leading to adjusted EPS diluted of $0.63, up 6.8% versus a year ago. For the year, in our Wisconsin is [ph] 220 times million consistent with 2008 levels, and adjusted EPS diluted for the full year was $2.17, up approximately 15%.Turning out to our balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the year, net trading capital decreased versus last year resulting in cash flow benefit of 156 million. Accounts receivable were down 45 million and remained extremely current and of high-quality. Year-over-year accounts receivable days outstanding improved about 4 days. Inventory declined 73 million and accounts payable increased 38 million. This represents the third consecutive year reductions in net trading capital, which is a key focus area. We expect net trading capital to further improve in 2010, but not at the rates achieved in 2009. In terms of other specific cash flow items, capital additions including software were 39 million for the quarter and 145 million for the full year. In line with the upper end of our previously revised capital expenditure range, for 2010 we're targeting total capital additions to be in the range of 150 million to 160 million. Depreciation and amortization was 44 million in the quarter, and includes accelerated depreciation related to the Global Supply Chain Transformation of 1 million. For the full-year 2009, depreciation and amortization expense was 182 million, of which accelerated depreciation and amortization was about 4 million. In 2010, we are forecasting total depreciation and amortization of about 180 million to 185 million.Dividends paid during the quarter was 66 million bringing the full year total to 263 million. We did not acquire any stock in the fourth quarter related to the current repurchase program. And there is 100 million outstanding on the current authorization of the Board approved in December 2006. Cash on hand at year end was 254 million, up 217 million versus a year ago. Our cash management strategy this year has been to pay down short-term debt with excess cash. Short-term debt in the current portion of long-term at year end was 39 million, down 462 million versus a year ago. And as it relates to our Short-term cash needs, the company is currently well-positioned. Our cash flow has been strong and we expect that to continue in 2010. And 97% of our current debt or 1.5 billion is in fixed rate notes with maturity starting in 2011.During the year, we made voluntary contributions to our qualified pensions plans of 9 million in the quarter and 54 million for the year to improve our funded status. In 2009, our pension asset returns were in line with that in the market indices. The increase in pension assets will result in reduced pension expense of approximately 14 million or $0.04 a share in 2010. Let me now provide an update on the Global Supply Chain Transformation program. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the program was concluded. I am pleased to confirm that the construction of our Monterrey, Mexico facility is complete. Total charges for the program were 629 million and included 85 million of non-cash pension settlement charges. Excluding pension settlement charges, total project costs were 544 million below the estimate of 575 million to 600 million previously communicated. And except for possible non-cash pension settlement charges, the company does not expect any significant charges related to the Global Supply Chain Transformation program in 2010. In 2009, total GAAP charges related to program were 99 million. A total of these charges reduced reported 2009 earnings by $0.27. During the fourth quarter, we reported Global Transformation charges of 26 million pretax, of which 24 million was related to non-cash pension settlement charges. The accumulated savings for the program are 160 million and in line with our forecast. The estimate of total ongoing annual savings by the end of 2010 is 175 million to 185 million with incremental savings being realized earlier in the year.This morning, we also announced a 7.6% increase in our quarterly dividend on our common shares. This increase as a result of the company's strong balance sheet and our confidence in the current business model. We believe our current strategies will enable the company to continue to meaningfully generate predictable cash flow from operations. As such, we continue to have Board level discussions related to capital structure and deployment of excess cash. And we'll continue to explore M&A related growth opportunities.Let me close by providing some context on our 2010 outlook. We have made investments where we have made investments, the business has responded. As such, we will continue to do the right things for our core brands and at key retail customers and channels that are driving our growth. During the first half of the year, we will continue with the distribution of our new products as well as new core branded investments behind on a Joy, Mounds and York brands. As a result, we expect full-year 2010 net sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% stated long-term objective.At this point, we have a good assessment of our 2010 [ph] and cost input basket. As a result, we expect gross margin expansion in 2010 although not at the same level achieved in 2009. The full-year increase in gross margin will be driven by different factors, including seasonal pricing and Global Supply Chain Transformation savings, that will be achieved during the first half of the year. We estimate that advertising will increase 25% to 30% supporting core brands in both the U.S. and international markets. During the year, we'll also continue to invest in consumer inside analysis, that will benefit all classes of trade including the drug channel to address current challenges.At Hershey, we are committed to category leadership and we'll strive to be the confectionery solution for all customers and in all channels. As a result, we expect to achieve growth of adjusted earnings per share in 2010, given our long-term objective of 6% to 8%.To conclude and as you work on your models, I remind you at the full-year 2010 gains in net sales and margins will most likely be driven in the first half and resulting from the following factors: The timing of seasonal pricing particularly Easter, newly-launched products achieving target ACV level by midyear, incremental Global Supply Chain Transformation savings are programmed for earlier in the year, foreign exchange which was a headwind for the first 2/3 of 2009 will most likely benefit in the first couple of quarters and a lower tax rate throughout the entire year. We will now open it up to questions."

Do you feel -- you seem quite confident about the top line for 2010 and kind of how you progressed in 2009. Maybe it's a discussion for CAGNY, but I guess with the 50% boost in advertising and not really much change in share, just kind of how are you judging the success of that program? And also, Dave, I think you said that one of the company's competitive advantages is the in-store effort. And maybe that's a bridge between the advertising to sales ratio that you show versus kind of what Wrigley was spending and what some of the other companies spend which is above your rate. And maybe that's the difference in terms of how we're viewing, how much advertising you really need to put back into the business over time?"

With respect to advertisin",535,"I think, Eric, there's a series of questions in there and they're all right on target in terms of our thinking about the business. And we will provide I think more depth for you at CAGNY. Let me try and take them on for you now. With respect to advertising to sales, we don't really think about -- we certainly don't think it about as the total company should have a ratio of x percent. We are certainly looking at it brand by brand, each of the brands is positioned in a way that it is speaking to either a need state or a certain set of consumers. And we believe that the way we are positioning the brand that those brands are incremental, at least somewhat incremental. So when we start to talk about bringing Mounds, Almond Joy and York, supporting with advertising for the first time in many, many years. We do that because we think they're positioned in a unique way, with consumers where we think that we'll get an incremental lift from that so that we're not switching brands of each other. We look at each of the brand on a monthly basis in terms of the ROI in the list. We're very encouraged. For example, we started Twizzlers and Kit Kat advertising in 2009 we drove mid- to high-single digit take away when you look at them across all channels on Twizzlers and Kit Kat for example, in 2009, and the advertising responsiveness was very good. Reese's which have been on-air for a number of years continues, the two top Reese's business continues to be up very, very strongly. So when you look at the response that we're getting and we tracked it on a regular basis. We feel pretty good about it. And therefore, we think that it's still make sense as an investment. The important thing that I think we do with that advertising is we then coupled the advertising and activated at retail with our sales force. So our programming has been very dramatic. I think we talked about how do, we've been doing it with Eastern Halloween, we've been running seasonal specific advertising and then we activate that at retail with the sales force. We think we've got it lined up and it seems to be working very well. In the face of a significant price increase of roughly 10% to 11% across the line, which we took in August of '08, and went in to the marketplace, an even higher than 10% on some of the promoted price points. We think that advertising is one of the reasons that we were able to improve the take away throughout the year. Our conversion and our volume declines certainly improved throughout the year. So as we head to 2010, we think the formula is right. We continue to have the advertising, we'll continue to invest in Retail. We have a little bit of carryover pricing, obviously in the Valentines, in the Easter seasons in the beginning of year here. We'll have more brands on air. And so I think we think we have the right model here to drive some decent top line growth here in 2010."

I also think that the comparison to the Wrigley advertising to sales numbers is a little misleading because you have to look at the total basket of spending including trade promotion, couponing, et cetera. When you look at gum and mint. Gum and mint tends to be a different, it's much more of a single totally impulse-oriented category. It's something that doesn't have, I'll business per se. It doesn't have a seasonal component. So I think the drivers have been different historically, in terms of the merchandising strategy. So I think the promotional lever in chocolate has tended to be more important. So when you look at the mix of what Wrigley would have spent, historically versus in a gum and mint portfolio versus something that's for us more skewed towards chocolate and sugar. I don't think that those are apples-to-apples in terms of the comparison. But I do think that we're at a place with the brands. We think that as we come to 2010 here, we had Mounds, Almond Joy and York. We think we're getting to competitive levels on those brands and feeling pretty good about the returns."

It's expandable, it's highly impulse oriented, it's a destination category because of the seasonal component of it. Certainly, three or four times a year, the retailer has a desire to display the category. The category growth rate last year was this is in FDMxC was up 4.4%. We are looking at a long-term 3% to 4% growth rate category. And so when you think about our ability to be advantaged in that category and continue to grow with or ahead of that category growth rate, we feel very confident in our ability to do that. Our international business outside of the U.S. and Canada has been growing almost 20% compound over the last five years. So that's a nice additive. We're pleased with that growth in terms of where we are. Then you also look at the rest of the world and even despite Mars and Wrigley and Kraft and Cadbury, if Kraft and Cadbury closes, it's still a fragmented global category with opportunities out there to expand. And as Bert has already mentioned, we have a very strong balance sheet. So we feel good about where we're positioned. We feel that we did the right things in terms of taking a disciplined look at an asset that was available. It didn't work for us within the framework that we had established, but that doesn't mean that we're not highly confident in our business model."

Your capacity utilization, then, you were citing was in the low 60s and you want to get to about 85% by 2010. Are you still on track to do that? It would seem like the denominator or the production in place you've made good progress in reducing.

Our operations folks have done a really fabulous job in what is a very complex and large project, the largest one in the company's history. And it has gone very smoothly and without a hiccup. And you see the improvements in our balance sheet and working capital numbers  are very, very strong and that's largely part of the footprint and the improvements in the operations. We'll continue to look at our cost structure. We are now in a position in 2010 to look at how we supplied the new supply chain, if you will. So we really focused in '08 and '09 on the manufacturing footprint and that now leaves us with a number of opportunities as we go into 2010 and 2011 in terms of how to supply into it, in terms of procurement. And then also how to deliver out of it with transportation, warehousing and logistics improvements. And we're very focused on those improvements here in 2010 and '11, but we're always going to constantly look at capacity utilization in our network to make sure it's optimized.

We supported it strongly in year two in 2009. We'll support it against strongly in year three in 2010. So in that trade up space, we feel very good about how Bliss is performing. And so when you talk about mainstream and trade up, we have fairly well defined those strategies. We obviously are -- while we are not launching anything in the premium space right now, we don't think it's appropriate, that doesn't mean that we're not working on that within our innovation pipeline. And when you think about the entire year 2010, one of the drivers for us in terms of improving our volume is our new products program in 2010 will be stronger than what we had in 2009.

I assume everyone on the call has had an opportunity to read our November 18th and January 22 press releases. After a thorough and complete examination, management and the Board of Directors unanimously concluded not to make an offer for Cadbury. Our Board of Directors and management team remains extremely confident in Hershey’s consumer driven strategy and in the company's ability to execute and deliver long-term value for all stockholders. We will evaluate future acquisition opportunities in the same disciplined manner to ensure appropriate fit within our financial and strategic framework. We'll continue to follow this disciplined approach and we'll continue to invest in Hershey’s existing brands and global infrastructure. With close to a 45% share of the U.S. chocolate market and strong and growing businesses in Canada and Mexico, and nearly a 20% compound annual growth rate outside of the U.S. and Canada over the past five years, we continue to be encouraged by our position in the marketplace and confident in continuing future success.Now for a discussion on our results. I'm very pleased with Hershey's fourth quarter and full-year performance. We finished the year on solid footing and over delivered on our earnings per share objective by growing adjusted earnings per share 15% year-over-year. We achieved this in an extremely challenging environment that included global economic uncertainty and challenging consumer conditions, commodity spot market price volatility, the implementation and execution of a major price increase, the continued rollout and evolution of our consumer driven approach to core brand investment, as well as the completion of our global supply chain transformation program. Despite these challenges, we delivered net sales and EPS growth that was significantly greater than the profile we shared with you at this time a year ago. For the full year 2009, net sales increased a bit more than 4% on a constant currency basis, up 3.2% reported. Gross and EBIT margin expanded meaningfully and our balance sheet and cash flow were very strong. We made excellent progress in 2009, and we look forward to delivering on our financial targets for a third consecutive year in 2010.In terms of Hershey's marketplace performance, for the 12 and 52 weeks ending January 2, 2010, using our custom database, and this is in channels that account for over 80% of our Retail business, total confections category retail consumer takeaway was up a strong 6% for the 12 weeks ending January 2, and it was up 7.2% for the year 2009. As a reminder, these channels include food, drug and mass. And mass here includes Wal-Mart and convenience stores.This growth rate is higher than the FDMx data that most of you received from IRI or Nielsen on a quad basis. FDMx only captures about half of our retail takeaway and excludes one of our largest mass customers, with whom we had performed well and excludes C-stores. In addition, it also excludes value and club format stores.Within food, drug and mass here excluding Wal-Mart and convenience, so FDMxC, the category also continues to grow. In 2009, the CMG category in FDMxC increased 4.4%, greater than the historical growth rate which is usually around 3% to 4%. In the fourth quarter, the CMG category was up 4%. Again, this is excluding Wal-Mart. As we look to 2010, we would expect historical growth rates to prevail in the category.Total Hershey FDMxC retail takeaway of 2.6 in the fourth quarter was less than the category, and as we expected resulted in a market share loss of 0.4 points. The decline was primarily driven by our decision to exit premium chocolates, Cacao Reserve, Starbucks and Joseph Schmidt, all of which played a role in gifting last year. And it contributed -- and it was also contributed to by the previously mentioned challenges in the drug class of trade. For the full year 2009 in FDMxC, the category grew 4.4%. Hershey retail takeaway for the year was 4.7%, resulting in a share gain for the year 2009 of 0.1 points. Our marketplace results in measured channels were driven by our success in the food and convenience classes of trade. Our continued growth in these two areas is a result of the targeted investments we make. Our in-store sales force remains a competitive advantage and has been a large part of our success. It differentiates us from our competitors. The investments we have made and will continue to make in Retail resources will be augmented by additional efforts in consumer insights, in-store merchandising and programming and will ensure we bring confectionary ideas and solutions to retailers to drive profitable growth for both Hershey and our customers.For the full-year 2009 in the food class of trade, the category grew 6%. With Hershey retail takeaway for the year up 6.3%, resulting in a share gain of 0.1 points. Fourth quarter food class of trade growth was 7.7% with Hershey takeaway at 7.3%, a bit lower than the category reflecting the earlier reference to Premium segment performance. As a result, food channel market share was off 0.1 points in the quarter. Hershey's Q4 class of trade in chocolate, the takeaway was up 7%. Again, a bit lower than the category with share off 0.1 points. Our non-chocolate foods takeaway was up 15.3%, resulting in a market share gain of 0.4 points in non-chocolate. These results were driven by core brand performance with Hershey's Bliss, Reese's, Kit Kat and Twizzlers retail takeaway, up double digits in the food class trade. We enjoyed solid Halloween sell-through, resulting in Hershey gaining one-full market share point for Halloween in food class of trade. And we did see slight improvement in our Kisses franchise and food, with takeaway up low-single digits due to advertising responsiveness to our baking merchandising and couponing.As it relates to the overall Halloween and Holiday seasons, as expected in Q4, total seasonal category retail sales were slightly up versus a year ago. Specifically in FDMx, Halloween retail category dollar growth was up 1.3% and Hershey FDMx Halloween performance was in line with our expectations as we gain 0.3 market share points driven by the solid performance in the food class of trade. FDMx Holiday retail category growth was up about 1.6%. Hershey's Holiday performance as expected was soft, given the discretionary challenges related to gifting and our decision to discontinue certain premium products that were in the marketplace last year or that would be in 2008 in the fourth quarter.We talk a little bit about C-store, where the category was up 2.3% in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, Hershey seized our takeaway increased 3.7%, resulting in a share gain of 0.3 points. In Q4 Hershey C-store chocolate and non-chocolate takeaway was up 5% and 7.2%, respectively. These gains were driven by core brand advertising, in-store selling and merchandising, and solid programming, including NCAA College Football promotion supported by on-air advertising, a nostalgic standard bar program, leveraging Hershey's iconic brand and the king-size launched of TWIZZLERS PULL-N-PEEL.As we stated in October, the drug class of trade continued to be a drag on our overall Q4 FDMxC marketplace results, with Hershey drug channel market share declining 1.9 points in the fourth quarter. The changes in our go-to-market model have not driven the type of performance in the drug class of trade relative to its success in other formats. As we entered 2010, we have worked with key drug retail customers to our mutually acceptable strategy that will drive category customer and Hershey growth. However, this channel will most likely remain a headwind on our overall marketplace performance during the first part of the year.As we look at 2010, we have many exciting products, promotions and programs in place, including an NCAA Final Four Basketball promotion following up on a very successful 2009 event. Sponsorship for the blockbuster Iron Man 2 movie, starring Robert Downey Jr., increased levels of Valentine's and Easter support, the continued rollout of Hershey's Special Dark, Almond Joy and York Pieces as well as Hershey's Bliss White Chocolate and the launch of selected limited editions, including Kit Kat Dark and Thingamajig, both back by popular demand from retailers. We have other innovation plan for the second half which we'll share with you as the year unfolds.Additionally, full-year advertising expense will increase approximately 25% to 30% year-over-year. We'll continue to support previously mentioned core brands, particularly Hershey's, Reese's, Hershey's Kisses and Bliss, Twizzlers and Kit Kat as well as new core brand advertising campaigns for the Almond Joy, Mounds and York brands. We'll also continue to build on a consumer insights where we started in 2009, understanding consumers and identifying trends is critical and as category capped and we take our obligation to providing category solutions for the retail very seriously. We're committed to the proprietary insights we have completed today, and we'll continue to develop on an ongoing basis as it is a critical part of our success. We'll share some of this work with you at CAGNY.Let me wrap up my comments. Despite the macroeconomic challenges facing the consumer, the category continues to grow across Retail channels, in both measured and non-measured outlets. Our advertising, consumer investments and insights will enable Hershey to consistently and predictively achieve its financial targets. We expect 2010 net sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term objective. Additionally, we have good visibility into our full-year cost structure, and expect our ongoing growth in adjusted earnings per share diluted to be within our long-term objective of 6% to 8%.As we look to the long-term, Hershey has many opportunities to leverage its global brands in U.S. scale. Our consumer full model is working in the U.S., and its approach is being adopted many of our international markets. Additionally, we are continuously examining our overall cost structure, and believe opportunities exist to maintain and/or improve margins while continually monitoring commodity market volatility. And we'll have again more on the cost structure at CAGNY.Our balance sheet and cash flows remained strong and we will continue to be disciplined, but open to sources of growth via M&A. Our executive management team and the Board of Directors are confident that this approach will continue to build value for all Hershey shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Bert Alfonso, who will provide you with some additional financial details."

Overall, we're pleased with our financial and marketplace performance in 2009, given the volatile environment in both commodity and financial markets, as well as the pressures facing consumers. Fourth quarter consolidated net sales of 1,407,000,000  increased to 2.2% versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS diluted of $0.63 increased 7%, primarily due to price realization, supply chain savings and a lower effective income tax rate which more than offset the impact of volume decline, higher input cost and increased marketing investment. In addition, fourth quarter results include a non-occurring benefit from LIFO accounting related to targeted inventory reductions. These essentially offset the cost advisory fees related to our consideration of a transaction with Cadbury. For the full year, net sales increased 3.2% or 4.2% on a constant currency basis. Resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $2.17, up 15.4%. In the fourth quarter, sales gains were driven primarily by pricing and improvements in our International business. Mid-single-digit pricing gains were partially offset by expected base volume declines associated with the U.S. pricing actions, and previously communicated positions to close our Online Gift business and discontinue certain premium chocolate products. Importantly in the fourth quarter, base volume declines improve sequentially from mid- to low-single digits. As we communicated in October due to timing, shipments of Valentine and Easter season cost were lower in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus 2008. All season benefits from the shipped in the first quarter of 2010. Also foreign currency exchange was about a one-point benefit in the quarter, a change from quarters one to three in which FX detracted from sales growth. Dave provided details related to our marketplace performance, so I'll now focus and I'll review the P&L, balance sheet and cash flow starting with gross margin.During the fourth quarter, adjusted gross margins increased 330 basis points, primarily driven by net price realization, supply-chain savings, productivity and lower levels of inventory that led to a favorable non-recurring 100 basis point benefit from LIFO accounting. These margin gains more than offset higher input costs about 150 basis points, primarily reflecting total consolidated cost increases for raw materials. Higher employee benefit costs, primarily pension expense or manufacturing facilities also reduce adjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter. For the full-year 2009, adjusted gross margin was 38.9% versus 35.8% in 2008, up 310 basis points as pricing and productivity initiatives inclusive of the World Supply Chain Transformation program [Global Supply Chain Transformation program] offset 200 basis points of unfavorable input costs. Adjusted EBIT margins increased 10 basis points in the fourth quarter as higher gross margin was substantially offset by advertising, up 50% in the quarter, marking the expenses including consumer promotions, employee-related costs including incentive and pension expense and advisory fees related to our consideration of a transaction with Cadbury. Adjusted EBIT for the full year increased 11.7% with EBIT margin up 120 basis points from 15% to 16.2%. The increase was driven by higher gross margin partially offset by increased advertising investments and employee-related costs. For the year, advertising increased 50% to 241 million.Now let me provide a brief update on our International businesses. During 2009, we made good progress in the international markets where we operate. Our International group face many of the same challenges as the U.S. counterparts including implementation of price increases in certain markets, economically impacting consumers and volatile foreign exchange rates. Overall, on a constant currency basis and excluding the Van Houten business that we acquired earlier in the year, International fourth quarter sales were up mid-single digits. So we reported International profitability was down versus a year ago, driven by brand building and investments in key markets. As we look in 2010, we'll continue to invest in our strategic international markets to increase the distribution of our products, enhance brand awareness and further develop our core to market capabilities.Moving down the P&L, for the fourth quarter, interest expense decreased coming in a 22 million versus 25 million last year. For the year, interest expense was 90 million versus 98 million in 2008. The fourth quarter and full year both benefited from lower short-term rates in our commercial paper and improvements in working capital. Lower debt levels also contributed to the lower interest expense as we significantly reduced our short-term debt during the year. In 2010, we expect interest expense to be in the 90 million to 100 million range.The tax rate in the fourth quarter was 33.6%, down 210 basis points versus a year ago. For the full year, tax rate was 35.5%, down 50 basis points versus a year ago. The change in the tax rate result in a $0.02 EPS benefit in the quarter and the full year. The improvement was primarily due to foreign tax benefits and a lower-than-expected tax rate in our moderate Monterrey, Mexico business. For the full-year 2010, we expect the effective income tax rate to be about 35%, primarily due to an increase in the federal manufacturing deduction from 6% to 9%. Additionally, on a quarterly basis, we expect the tax rate to be smoother in 2010 versus 2009, about 36% during the first half of the year and 34% in the back half.The fourth quarter of 2009 weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 229.6 million versus 228.5 million shares in 2008, leading to adjusted EPS diluted of $0.63, up 6.8% versus a year ago. For the year, in our Wisconsin is [ph] were approximately 220 times million consistent with 2008 levels, and adjusted EPS diluted for the full year was $2.17, up approximately 15%.Turning out to our balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the year, net trading capital decreased versus last year resulting in cash flow benefit of $156 million. Accounts receivable were down 45 million and remained extremely current and of high-quality. Year-over-year accounts receivable days outstanding improved about 4 days. Inventory declined $73 million and accounts payable increased $38 million. This represents the third consecutive year reductions in net trading capital, which is a key focus area. We expect net trading capital to further improve in 2010, but not at the rates achieved in 2009. In terms of other specific cash flow items, capital additions including software were $39 million for the quarter and $145 million for the full year. In line with the upper end of our previously revised capital expenditure range, for 2010 we're targeting total capital additions to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million. Depreciation and amortization was 44 million in the quarter, and includes accelerated depreciation related to the Global Supply Chain Transformation of $1 million. For the full-year 2009, depreciation and amortization expense was $182 million, of which accelerated depreciation and amortization was about $4 million. In 2010, we are forecasting total depreciation and amortization of about $180 million to $185 million.Dividends paid during the quarter was $66 million bringing the full year total to $263 million. We did not acquire any stock in the fourth quarter related to the current repurchase program. And there is $100 million outstanding on the current authorization of the Board approved in December 2006. Cash on hand at year end was $254 million, up $217 million versus a year ago. Our cash management strategy this year has been to pay down short-term debt with excess cash. Short-term debt in the current portion of long-term at year end was $39 million, down $462 million versus a year ago. And as it relates to our Short-term cash needs, the company is currently well-positioned. Our cash flow has been strong and we expect that to continue in 2010. And 97% of our current debt or $1.5 billion is in fixed rate notes with maturity starting in 2011.During the year, we made voluntary contributions to our qualified pensions plans of $9 million in the quarter and $54 million for the year to improve our funded status. In 2009, our pension asset returns were in line with that in the market indices. The increase in pension assets will result in reduced pension expense of approximately $14 million or $0.04 a share in 2010. Let me now provide an update on the Global Supply Chain Transformation program. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the program was concluded. I am pleased to confirm that the construction of our Monterrey, Mexico facility is complete. Total charges for the program were $629 million and included $85 million of non-cash pension settlement charges. Excluding pension settlement charges, total project costs were $544 million below the estimate of $575 million to $600 million previously communicated. And except for possible non-cash pension settlement charges, the company does not expect any significant charges related to the Global Supply Chain Transformation program in 2010. In 2009, total GAAP charges related to program were $99 million. A total of these charges reduced reported 2009 earnings by $0.27. During the fourth quarter, we reported Global Transformation charges of $26 million pretax, of which $24 million was related to non-cash pension settlement charges. The accumulated savings for the program are $160 million and in line with our forecast. The estimate of total ongoing annual savings by the end of 2010 is $175 million to 185 million with incremental savings being realized earlier in the year.This morning, we also announced a 7.6% increase in our quarterly dividend on our common shares. This increase as a result of the company's strong balance sheet and our confidence in the current business model. We believe our current strategies will enable the company to continue to meaningfully generate predictable cash flow from operations. As such, we continue to have Board level discussions related to capital structure and deployment of excess cash. And we'll continue to explore M&A related growth opportunities.Let me close by providing some context on our 2010 outlook. We have made investments where we have made investments, the business has responded. As such, we will continue to do the right things for our core brands and at key retail customers and channels that are driving our growth. During the first half of the year, we will continue with the distribution of our new products as well as new core branded investments behind on a Joy, Mounds and York brands. As a result, we expect full-year 2010 net sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% stated long-term objective.At this point, we have a good assessment of our 2010 cost input basket. As a result, we expect gross margin expansion in 2010 although not at the same level achieved in 2009. The full-year increase in gross margin will be driven by different factors, including seasonal pricing and Global Supply Chain Transformation savings, that will be achieved during the first half of the year. We estimate that advertising will increase 25% to 30% supporting core brands in both the U.S. and international markets. During the year, we'll also continue to invest in consumer inside analysis, that will benefit all classes of trade including the drug channel to address current challenges.At Hershey, we are committed to category leadership and we'll strive to be the confectionery solution for all customers and in all channels. As a result, we expect to achieve growth of adjusted earnings per share in 2010, given our long-term objective of 6% to 8%.To conclude and as you work on your models, I remind you at the full year 2010 gains in net sales and margins will most likely be driven in the first half and resulting from the following factors: The timing of seasonal pricing particularly Easter, newly-launched products achieving target ACV level by midyear, incremental Global Supply Chain Transformation savings are programmed for earlier in the year, foreign exchange which was a headwind for the first 2/3 of 2009 will most likely benefit in the first couple of quarters and a lower tax rate throughout the entire year. We will now open it up to questions."

And also, Dave, I think you said that one of the company's competitive advantages is the in-store effort. And maybe that's a bridge between the advertising to sales ratio that you show versus kind of what Wrigley was spending and what some of the other companies spend which is above your rate. And maybe that's the difference in terms of how we're viewing, how much advertising you really need to put back into the business over time?"

And we will provide I think more depth for you at CAGNY. Let me try and take them on for you now. With respect to advertising to sales, we don't really think about -- we certainly don't think it about as the total company should have a ratio of x percent. We are certainly looking at it brand by brand, each of the brands is positioned in a way that it is speaking to either a need state or a certain set of consumers. And we believe that the way we are positioning the brand that those brands are incremental, at least somewhat incremental. So when we start to talk about bringing Mounds, Almond Joy and York, supporting with advertising for the first time in many, many years. We do that because we think they're positioned in a unique way, with consumers where we think that we'll get an incremental lift from that so that we're not switching brands of each other. We look at each of the brand on a monthly basis in terms of the ROI in the list. We're very encouraged. For example, we started Twizzlers and Kit Kat advertising in 2009 we drove mid- to high-single digit take away when you look at them across all channels on Twizzlers and Kit Kat for example, in 2009, and the advertising responsiveness was very good. Reese's which have been on-air for a number of years continues, the two top Reese's business continues to be up very, very strongly. So when you look at the response that we're getting and we tracked it on a regular basis. We feel pretty good about it. And therefore, we think that it's still make sense as an investment. The important thing that I think we do with that advertising is we then coupled the advertising and activated at retail with our sales force. So our programming has been very dramatic. I think we talked about how do, we've been doing it with Eastern Halloween, we've been running seasonal specific advertising and then we activate that at retail with the sales force. We think we've got it lined up and it seems to be working very well. In the face of a significant price increase of roughly 10% to 11% across the line, which we took in August of '08, and went in to the marketplace, an even higher than 10% on some of the promoted price points. We think that advertising is one of the reasons that we were able to improve the take away throughout the year. Our conversion and our volume declines certainly improved throughout the year. So as we head to 2010, we think the formula is right. We continue to have the advertising, we'll continue to invest in Retail. We have a little bit of carryover pricing, obviously in the Valentines, in the Easter seasons in the beginning of year here. We'll have more brands on air. And so I think we think we have the right model here to drive some decent top line growth here in 2010."

I also think that the comparison to the Wrigley advertising to sales numbers is a little misleading because you have to look at the total basket of spending including trade promotion, couponing, et cetera. When you look at gum and mint. Gum and mint tends to be a different, it's much more of a single totally impulse-oriented category. It's something that doesn't have, I'll business per se. It doesn't have a seasonal component. So I think the drivers have been different historically, in terms of the merchandising strategy. So I think the promotional lever in chocolate has tended to be more important. So when you look at the mix of what Wrigley would have spent, historically versus in a gum and mint portfolio versus something that's for us more skewed towards chocolate and sugar. I don't think that those are apples-to-apples in terms of the comparison. But I do think that we're at a place with the brands. We think that as we come to 2010 here, we had Mounds, Almond Joy and York. We think we're getting to competitive levels on those brands and feeling pretty good about the returns."

Interest, we think we'll be a little bit higher as that it was this year, as rates start to climb, and we think that will happen towards the back half of the year. So that's the only other component that we didn't talked about. We did give the range of $90 million to $100 million."

We had expected that we would lose share. As we go into 2010, we would expect that there'll be a little bit of continued pressure. Valentine's is again a holiday that's got a lot of premium in gifting in it. We may not perform quite as well there. We think we'll do better at Easter. We had a very good Easter last year and we're very pleased with our Easter programming this year. And then as the year goes on, obviously, the advertising and other factors kick in. So I think, Rob, that the first quarter may look a little bit more in measured channels like the fourth did, but I think for the full year 2010 we would expect market share to be something that looks similar.

Our international business outside of the U.S. and Canada has been growing almost 20% compound over the last five years. So that's a nice additive.

Certainly, you saw that improvement, but relative to the pricing moderating, I'm not sure if you saw those kind of the sequential improvement as much as you would've liked to have seen. So is this still kind of in line with what you would have expected as pricing moderated that you would see a more moderate volume decline? And then my second question is just in terms of the C-store category. I think the category in the fourth quarter was up 2.3% which seems to be somewhat slower than the other channels.

So we're right about where we would have expected to be on the pricing and the conversion. With respect to convenience stores, obviously, the early part of 2009 had a much stronger pricing component in it. We were very pleased with our chocolate and non-chocolate takeaway in convenience channels throughout the fourth quarter. We underperformed on gum and that kind of dragged our takeaway down somewhat. Overall, we were up in a reasonable way in the fourth quarter. We feel very good about programming going forward in the convenience class of trade for 2010.

Welcome to The Hershey Company's Fourth Quarter 2009 Conference Call. Dave West, President and CEO; Bert Alfonso, Senior Vice President and CFO; and I will represent Hershey on this morning's call. We also welcome those of you listening via the webcast. Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors, such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2008 filed with the SEC.If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website, www.hersheys.com, in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release are consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as a pro forma summary of consolidated statements of income quantitatively reconciled to GAAP.As we've said in the press release, the company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metric for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP; rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.We will discuss our fourth quarter 2009 results, excluding net pretax charges. The majority of these charges in both 2009 and 2008 are associated with the Global Supply Chain Transformation program. These pretax charges were $26.5 million and $79.7 million in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of net charges related to these business realignment initiatives. I'll now turn it over to Dave West."

I assume that everyone on the call has had an opportunity to read our November 18 and January 22 press releases. After a thorough and complete examination, management and the Board of Directors unanimously concluded not to make an offer for Cadbury. Our Board of Directors and management team remain extremely confident in Hershey’s consumer-driven strategy and in the company's ability to execute and deliver long-term value for all stockholders. We will evaluate future acquisition opportunities in the same disciplined manner to ensure appropriate fit within our financial and strategic framework. We'll continue to follow this disciplined approach, and we'll continue to invest in Hershey’s existing brands and global infrastructure. With close to a 45% share of the U.S. chocolate market and strong and growing businesses in Canada and Mexico and nearly a 20% compounded annual growth rate outside of the U.S. and Canada over the past five years, we continue to be encouraged by our position in the marketplace and confident in continuing future success.Now for a discussion on our results. I'm very pleased with Hershey's fourth quarter and full year performance. We finished the year on solid footing and over delivered on our earnings per share objective by growing adjusted earnings per share 15% year-over-year. We achieved this in an extremely challenging environment that included global economic uncertainty and challenging consumer conditions, commodity spot market price volatility, the implementation and execution of a major price increase, the continued rollout and evolution of our consumer-driven approach to core brand investment, as well as the completion of our Global Supply Chain Transformation program. Despite these challenges, we delivered net sales and EPS growth that was significantly greater than the profile we shared with you at this time a year ago. For the full year 2009, net sales increased a bit more than 4% on a constant currency basis, up 3.2% reported. Gross and EBIT margin expanded meaningfully and our balance sheet and cash flow were very strong. We made excellent progress in 2009, and we look forward to delivering on our financial targets for a third consecutive year in 2010.In terms of Hershey's marketplace performance, for the 12 and 52 weeks ending January 2, 2010, using our custom database, and this is in channels that account for over 80% of our Retail business, total confections category retail consumer takeaway was up a strong 6% for the 12 weeks ending January 2, and it was up 7.2% for the year 2009. As a reminder, these channels include food, drug and mass. And mass here includes Wal-Mart and convenience stores.This growth rate is higher than the FDMx data that most of you received from IRI or Nielsen on a quad basis. FDMx only captures about half of our retail takeaway and excludes one of our largest mass customers, with whom we had performed well and excludes C-stores. In addition, it also excludes value and club format stores.Within food, drug and mass here excluding Wal-Mart and convenience, so FDMxC, the category also continues to grow. In 2009, the CMG category in FDMxC increased 4.4%, greater than the historical growth rate which is usually around 3% to 4%. In the fourth quarter, the CMG category was up 4%. Again, this is excluding Wal-Mart. As we look to 2010, we would expect historical growth rates to prevail in the category.Total Hershey FDMxC retail takeaway of 2.6 in the fourth quarter was less than the category, and as we expected resulted in a market share loss of 0.4 points. The decline was primarily driven by our decision to exit premium chocolates, Cacao Reserve, Starbucks and Joseph Schmidt, all of which played a role in gifting last year. And it contributed -- and it was also contributed to by the previously mentioned challenges in the drug class of trade. For the full year 2009 in FDMxC, the category grew 4.4%. Hershey retail takeaway for the year was 4.7%, resulting in a share gain for the year 2009 of 0.1 points. Our marketplace results in measured channels were driven by our success in the food and convenience classes of trade. Our continued growth in these two areas is a result of the targeted investments we make. Our in-store sales force remains a competitive advantage and has been a large part of our success. It differentiates us from our competitors. The investments we have made and will continue to make in Retail resources will be augmented by additional efforts in consumer insights, in-store merchandising and programming and will ensure we bring confectionery ideas and solutions to retailers to drive profitable growth for both Hershey and our customers.For the full-year 2009 in the food class of trade, the category grew 6%. With Hershey retail takeaway for the year up 6.3%, resulting in a share gain of 0.1 points. Fourth quarter food class of trade growth was 7.7% with Hershey takeaway at 7.3%, a bit lower than the category reflecting the earlier reference to Premium segment performance. As a result, food channel market share was off 0.1 points in the quarter. Hershey's Q4 class of trade in chocolate, the takeaway was up 7%. Again, a bit lower than the category with share off 0.1 points. Our non-chocolate foods takeaway was up 15.3%, resulting in a market share gain of 0.4 points in non-chocolate. These results were driven by core brand performance with Hershey's Bliss, Reese's, Kit Kat and Twizzlers retail takeaway, up double digits in the food class trade. We enjoyed solid Halloween sell-through, resulting in Hershey gaining one-full market share point for Halloween in food class of trade. And we did see slight improvement in our Kisses franchise and food, with takeaway up low-single digits due to advertising responsiveness to our baking merchandising and couponing.As it relates to the overall Halloween and holiday seasons, as expected in Q4, total seasonal category retail sales were slightly up versus year ago. Specifically in FDMx, Halloween retail category dollar growth was up 1.3%, and Hershey FDMx Halloween performance was in line with our expectations, as we gained 0.3 market share points, driven by the solid performance in the food class of trade. FDMx holiday retail category growth was up about 1.6%. Hershey's holiday performance, as expected, was soft, given the discretionary challenges related to gifting and our decision to discontinue certain premium products that were in the marketplace last year or that would be in 2008 in the fourth quarter.We talked a little bit about C-store, where the category was up 2.3% in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, Hershey C-store takeaway increased 3.7%, resulting in a share gain of 0.3 points. In Q4, Hershey C-store chocolate and non-chocolate takeaway was up 5% and 7.2%, respectively. These gains were driven by core brand advertising, in-store selling and merchandising and solid programming, including an NCAA College Football promotion supported by on-air advertising, a nostalgic standard bar program leveraging Hershey's iconic brands and the king-size launch of TWIZZLERS PULL 'N PEEL.As we stated in October, the drug class of trade continue to be a drag on our overall Q4 FDMxC marketplace results, with Hershey drug channel market share declining 1.9 points in the fourth quarter. The changes in our go-to-market model have not driven the type of performance in the drug class of trade relative to its success in other formats. As we entered 2010, we have worked with key drug retail customers toward a mutually acceptable strategy that will drive category customer and Hershey growth. However, this channel will most likely remain a headwind on our overall marketplace performance during the first part of the year.As we look at 2010, we have many exciting products, promotions and programs in place, including an NCAA Final Four Basketball promotion following up on a very successful 2009 event. Sponsorship for the blockbuster Iron Man 2 movie starring Robert Downey, Jr. increased levels of Valentine's and Easter support, the continued rollout of Hershey's Special Dark, Almond Joy and York Pieces, as well as Hershey's Bliss white chocolate and the launch of selected limited editions, including Kit Kat Dark and Thingamajig, both back by popular demand from retailers. We have other innovation plan for the second half, which we'll share with you as the year unfolds.Additionally, full year advertising expense will increase approximately 25% to 30% year-over-year. We'll continue to support previously mentioned core brands, particularly Hershey's, Reese's, Hershey's Kisses and Bliss, Twizzlers and Kit Kat, as well as new core brand advertising campaigns for the Almond Joy, Mounds and York brands. We'll also continue to build on a consumer insights work we started in 2009. Understanding consumers and identifying trends is critical. And as category captain, we take our obligation to providing category solutions to the retail very seriously. We're committed to the proprietary insights work we have completed to date, and we'll continue to develop on an ongoing basis, as it is a critical part of our success. We'll share some of this work with you at CAGNY.Let me wrap up my comments. Despite the macroeconomic challenges facing the consumer, the category continues to grow across Retail channels, in both measured and non-measured outlets. Our advertising, consumer investments and insights work will enable Hershey to consistently and predictively achieve its financial targets. We expect 2010 net sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% long-term objective. Additionally, we have good visibility into our full year cost structure and expect our ongoing growth and adjusted earnings per share diluted to be within our long-term objective of 6% to 8%.As we look to the long term, Hershey has many opportunities to leverage its global brands and U.S. scale. Our consumer full model is working in the U.S., and this approach is being adopted in many of our international markets. Additionally, we are continuously examining our overall cost structure and believe opportunities exist to maintain and/or improve margins while continually monitoring commodity market volatility. And we'll have again more on the cost structure at CAGNY.Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong, and we will continue to be disciplined, but open to sources of growth via M&A. Our executive management team and the Board of Directors are confident that this approach will continue to build value for all Hershey shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Bert Alfonso, who will provide you with some additional financial details."
98873,84945153,54985,"Hershey Co., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2010",2010-02-02,"Earnings Calls","The Hershey Company","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Net sales and adjusted earnings per share diluted from operations for the full year 2009 exceeded the initial ranges we communicated at the beginning of last year. Solid efforts during the year by the sales, marke",2036,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Net sales and adjusted earnings per share diluted from operations for the full year 2009 exceeded the initial ranges we communicated at the beginning of last year. Solid efforts during the year by the sales, marketing, supply chain and finance groups result in strong price realization, while volume declines were less than anticipated. Overall, we're pleased with our financial and marketplace performance in 2009, given the volatile environment in both commodity and financial markets, as well as the pressures facing consumers. Fourth quarter consolidated net sales of 1,407,000,000  increased 2.2% versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS diluted of $0.63 increased 7%, primarily due to price realization, supply chain savings and a lower effective income tax rate, which more than offset the impact of volume decline, higher input cost and increased marketing investment. In addition, fourth quarter results include a non-occurring benefit from LIFO accounting related to targeted inventory reductions. These essentially offset the cost of advisory fees related to our consideration of a transaction with Cadbury. For the full year, net sales increased 3.2% or 4.2% on a constant-currency basis, resulting in adjusted earnings per share diluted of $2.17, up 15.4%. In the fourth quarter, sales gains were driven primarily by pricing and improvements in our International business. Mid-single digit pricing gains were partially offset by expected base volume declines associated with the U.S. pricing actions, and previously communicated decisions to close our On-line Gift business and discontinue certain premium chocolate products. Importantly in the fourth quarter, base volume declines improved sequentially from mid- to low-single digits. As we communicated in October, due to timing, shipments of Valentine and Easter season cards were lower in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus 2008. All [ph](24:44) season benefit from the shipped into the first quarter of 2010. Also, foreign currency exchange was about a one-point benefit in the quarter, a change from quarters 1 to 3, in which FX detracted from sales growth. Dave provided details related to our marketplace performance, so I'll now focus on the review of the P&L, balance sheet and cash flow starting with gross margin.  During the fourth quarter, adjusted gross margin increased 330 basis points, primarily driven by net price realization, supply chain savings, productivity and lower levels of inventory that led to a favorable non-recurring 100 basis point benefit from LIFO accounting. These margin gains more than offset higher input costs of about 150 basis points, primarily reflecting total consolidated cost increases for raw materials. Higher employee benefit costs, primarily pension expense at our manufacturing facilities, also reduced adjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2009, adjusted gross margin was 38.9% versus 35.8% in 2008, up 310 basis points as pricing and productivity initiatives, inclusive of the Global Supply Chain Transformation program offset 200 basis points of unfavorable input costs. Adjusted EBIT margin increased 10 basis points in the fourth quarter, as higher gross margin was substantially offset by advertising, up 50% in the quarter, marking the expenses including consumer promotions; employee-related costs, including incentive and pension expense; and advisory fees related to our consideration of a transaction with Cadbury. Adjusted EBIT for the full year increased 11.7% with EBIT margin up 120 basis points from 15% to 16.2%. The increase was driven by higher gross margin, partially offset by increased advertising investment and employee-related costs. For the year, advertising increased 50% to $241 million.Now let me provide a brief update on our International businesses. During 2009, we made good progress in the international markets where we operate. Our International group faced many of the same challenges as the U.S. counterparts, including implementation of price increases in certain markets, economically impacted consumers and volatile foreign exchange rates. Overall, on a constant-currency basis and excluding the Van Houten business that we acquired earlier in the year, International fourth quarter sales were up mid-single digits. So our reported International profitability was down versus year ago, driven by brand building and investments in key markets. As we look to 2010, we'll continue to invest in our strategic international markets to increase the distribution of our products, enhance brand awareness and further develop our go-to-market capabilities.Moving down the P&L. For the fourth quarter, interest expense decreased, coming in at $22 million versus $25 million last year. For the year, interest expense was $90 million versus $98 million in 2008. The fourth quarter and full year both benefited from lower short-term rates in our commercial paper and improvements in working capital. Lower debt levels also contributed to the lower interest expense, as we significantly reduced our short-term debt during the year. In 2010, we expect interest expense to be in the $90 million to $100 million range.The tax rate in the fourth quarter was 33.6%, down 210 basis points versus year ago. For the full year, the tax rate was 35.5%, down 50 basis points versus year ago. The change in the tax rate result in a $0.02 EPS benefit in the quarter and the full year. The improvement was primarily due to foreign tax benefits and a lower-than-expected tax rate in our Monterrey, Mexico business. For the full year 2010, we expect the effective income tax rate to be about 35%, primarily due to an increase in the federal manufacturing deduction from 6% to 9%. Additionally, on a quarterly basis, we expect the tax rate to be smoother in 2010 versus 2009, about 36% during the first half of the year and 34% in the back half.In the fourth quarter of 2009, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 229.6 million versus 228.5 million shares in 2008, leading to adjusted EPS diluted of $0.63, up 6.8% versus year ago. For the year, shares outstanding were approximately 225 million, consistent with 2008 levels. And adjusted EPS diluted for the full year was $2.17, up approximately 15%.Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the year, net trading capital decreased versus last year, resulting in cash flow benefit of $156 million. Accounts receivable were down $45 million and remain extremely current and of high quality. Year-over-year accounts receivable days outstanding improved about 4 days. Inventory declined $73 million and accounts payable increased $38 million. This represents the third consecutive year reductions in net trading capital, which is a key focus area. We expect net trading capital to further improve in 2010, but not at the rates achieved in 2009. In terms of other specific cash flow items, capital additions, including software, were $39 million for the quarter and $145 million for the full year, in line with the upper end of our previously revised capital expenditure range. For 2010, we are targeting total capital additions to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million. Depreciation and amortization was $44 million in the quarter and includes accelerated depreciation related to the Global Supply Chain Transformation of $1 million. For the full year 2009, depreciation and amortization expense was $182 million, of which accelerated depreciation and amortization was about $4 million. In 2010, we are forecasting total depreciation and amortization of about $180 million to $185 million.Dividends paid during the quarter were $66 million, bringing the full year total to $263 million. We did not acquire any stock in the fourth quarter related to the current repurchase program. And there is $100 million outstanding on the current authorization that the Board approved in December 2006. Cash on hand at year end was $254 million, up $217 million versus year ago. Our cash management strategy this year has been to pay down short-term debt with excess cash. Short-term debt and the current portion of long-term debt at year end was $39 million, down $462 million versus a year ago. And as it relates to our short-term cash needs, the company is currently well positioned. Our cash flow has been strong, and we expect that to continue in 2010. And 97% of our current debt or $1.5 billion is in fixed-rate notes with maturity starting in 2011.During the year, we made voluntary contributions to our qualified pensions plans of $9 million in the quarter and $54 million for the year to improve our funded status. In 2009, our pension asset returns were in line with that of the market indices. The increase in pension assets will result in reduced pension expense of approximately $14 million or $0.04 a share in 2010. Let me now provide an update on the Global Supply Chain Transformation program.  During the fourth quarter of 2009, the program was concluded. I am pleased to confirm that the construction of our Monterrey, Mexico facility is complete. Total charges for the program were $629 million and included $85 million of non-cash pension settlement charges. Excluding pension settlement charges, total project costs were $544 million, below the estimate of $575 million to $600 million previously communicated. And except for possible non-cash pension settlement charges, the company does not expect any significant charges related to the Global Supply Chain Transformation program in 2010. In 2009, total GAAP charges related to the program were $99 million. A total of these charges reduced reported 2009 earnings by $0.27. During the fourth quarter, we reported Global Transformation charges of $26 million pretax, of which $24 million was related to non-cash pension settlement charges.  The cumulative savings for the program are $160 million and in line with our forecast. The estimate of total ongoing annual savings by the end of 2010 is $175 million to $185 million, with incremental savings being realized earlier in the year.This morning, we also announced a 7.6% increase in our quarterly dividend on our common shares. This increase is a result of the company's strong balance sheet and our confidence in the current business model. We believe our current strategies will enable the company to continue to meaningfully generate predictable cash flow from operations. As such, we continue to have Board-level discussions related to capital structure and deployment of excess cash. And we'll continue to explore M&A-related growth opportunities.Let me close by providing some context on our 2010 outlook. We have made investments, where we have made investments, the business has responded. As such, we will continue to do the right things for our core brands and at key retail customers and channels that are driving our growth. During the first half of the year, we'll continue with the distribution and rollout of our new products, as well as new core brand investments behind Almond Joy, Mounds and York brands. As a result, we expect full year 2010 net sales growth to be within our 3% to 5% stated long-term objective.At this point, we have a good assessment of our 2010 cost input basket. As a result, we expect gross margin expansion in 2010 although not at the same level achieved in 2009. The full year increase in gross margin will be driven by different factors, including seasonal pricing and Global Supply Chain Transformation savings, that will be achieved during the first half of the year. We estimate that advertising will increase 25% to 30%, supporting core brands in both the U.S. and international markets. During the year, we'll also continue to invest in consumer insight analysis, that will benefit all classes of trade, including the drug channel, to address current challenges.At Hershey, we are committed to category leadership, and we'll strive to be the confectionery solution for all customers and in all channels. As a result, we expect to achieve growth of adjusted earnings per share in 2010, given our long-term objective of 6% to 8%.To conclude and as you work on your models, I remind you that the full year 2010 gains in net sales and margins will most likely be driven in the first half and resulting from the following factors: The timing of seasonal pricing, particularly the Easter; newly-launched products achieving targeted ACV levels by midyear; incremental Global Supply Chain Transformation savings are programmed for earlier in the year; foreign exchange, which was a headwind for the first 2/3 of 2009 will most likely benefit the first couple of quarters; and a lower tax rate throughout the entire year. We will now open it up to questions."

And also, Dave, I think you said that one of the company's competitive advantages is the in-store effort. And maybe that's a bridge between the advertising-to-sales ratio that you show versus kind of what Wrigley was spending and what some of the other companies spend which is above your rate. And maybe that's the difference in terms of how we're viewing how much advertising you really need to put back into the business over time. You follow it?"

And we will provide I think more depth for you at CAGNY. Let me try and take them on for y",538,"I think I can. I think, Eric, there's a couple of, series of questions in there, and they're all right on target in terms of how we're thinking about that business. And we will provide I think more depth for you at CAGNY. Let me try and take them on for you right now. With respect to advertising to sales, we certainly don't think about it as, the total company should have a ratio of x percent. We are certainly looking at it brand by brand. Each of the brands is positioned in a way that it is speaking to an either a need state or a certain set of consumers. And we believe that the way we are positioning the brands, that those brands are incremental, at least somewhat incremental. So when we start to talk about bringing Mounds, Almond Joy and York, supporting it with advertising for the first time in many, many years, we do that because we think they're positioned in a unique way with consumers, where we think that we'll get an incremental lift from that so that we're not switching brands with each other. We look at each of the brands on a monthly basis in terms of the ROI in the list. what we're very encouraged, for example, we started Twizzlers and Kit Kat advertising in 2009. We drove mid- to high-single digit takeaway when you look at them across all channels on Twizzlers and Kit Kat, for example, in 2009. And the advertising responsiveness was very good. Reese's, which we've been on-air for a number of years, continues -- the two-cup Reese's business continues to be up very, very strongly. So when you look at the response that we're getting, and we track it on a regular basis, we feel pretty good about it. And therefore, we think that it still makes sense as an investment. The important thing that I think we do with that advertising is we then couple the advertising and activate it at retail with our sales force. So our programming has been very dramatic. I think we talked about how we've been doing it with Easter and Halloween. We've been running seasonal-specific advertising. And then we activate that at retail with the sales force. So we think we've got it lined up, and it seems to be working very well, in the face of a significant price increase of roughly 10% to 11% across the line, which we took in August of '08 and went into the marketplace, and even higher than 10% on some of the promoted price points. We think that advertising is one of the reasons that we were able to improve the takeaway throughout the year. Our conversion and our volume declines certainly improved throughout the year. So as we head to 2010, we think the formula is right. We continue to add to advertising. We'll continue to invest in Retail. We have a little bit of carryover pricing obviously in the Valentine's and Easter seasons in the beginning of the year here. We'll have more brands on air. And so I think we think we have the right model here to derive some decent top line growth here in 2010."

I also think that the comparison to the Wrigley advertising-to-sales numbers is a little misleading because, I think, you have to look at the total basket of spending, including trade promotion, couponing, et cetera. When you look at gum and mint, gum and mint tends to be a different -- it's a much more of a single, totally impulse-oriented category. It's something that doesn't have an aisle business per se. It doesn't have a seasonal component. So I think the drivers have been different historically in terms of the merchandising strategy. So I think the promotional lever in chocolate has tended to be more important. So when you look at the mix of what Wrigley would have spent historically in a gum and mint portfolio versus something that's for us more skewed towards chocolate and sugar, I don't think that those are apples-to-apples in terms of the comparison. But I do think that we're at a place with the brands. We think that as we come through 2010 here, we add Mounds, Almond Joy and York. We think we're at getting to competitive levels on those brands and feeling pretty good about the returns."

So we've been adding to the breadth, as well as getting those brands to what we think are sustaining levels of GRP. So I think we're now at the place where we have seven or eight core brands that we're promoting when you think about Hershey's Bliss and some of the work we're also doing on Ice Breakers. So we measure them all individually. And we will continue to view that as a good investment as long as the ROI is positive. And we look at the ROI on that spending, as well as the mix of the entire basket of promotion plus advertising. And we're making marginal spend decisions based on what is returning the best for our dollar.

So if you think about those, those are worth another couple of points. We had Valentine's and Easter that will ship in 2010 that shipped in the fourth quarter of the year ago. So when you think about it, it's roughly 10% or so pricing, some low-single-digit base volume declines and then also then the discontinued and seasonal shifts that kind of take you down where you were. So I think you're talking about roughly, I guess, David roughly say 7% or 8% on the pricing and then you take then take the volume buy-in, it's low single -- the volume base low single digits off and then the seasonal and the discontinued items is another couple of points.

The category growth rate last year was, and this is in FDMxC, was up 4.4%. We're certainly looking at a long-term 3% to 4% growth rate category. And so when you think about our ability to be advantaged in that category and continue to grow with or ahead of that category growth rate, we feel very confident in our ability to do that. Our International business outside of the U.S. and Canada has been growing in almost 20% compound over the last five years. So that's a nice additive. We're pleased with that growth in terms of where we are, but then you also look at the rest of the world. And even despite Mars and Wrigley and Kraft and Cadbury, if Kraft and Cadbury closes, it's still a fragmented global category with opportunities out there to expand. And as Bert has already mentioned, we have a very strong balance sheet. So we feel good about where we're positioned.

The global investments we have made in marketing and selling capabilities are starting to pay off and we see it in our reported results, retail take away and market share. Following three months into the year this high quality quarter has created the confidence and environment to allow us to deliver on both our financial objectives for 2010 while also making additional investments in our business, we’ll have more on this in a bit.
In the first quarter net sales increased 13.9% driven by a balance of volume gains and price realization. Volume growth was the result of our execution in the marketplace and the ramp up of investments in core brand advertising and selling capabilities made over the last two years. Base business volume increased, especially in channels where we have focused resources; at c-stores, food, and select mass customers. Price realization can carry over seasonal pricing also benefited the top line. Recall that Easter performance also benefited from the previously mentioned shift in seasonal business from Q4 2009 into Q1 2010. 
Looking at our retail take away, where we benefited slightly from the timing of an earlier Easter, remember in 2010 Easter occurred on April 4 and in 2009 it was on April 12. Therefore, the reported IRI and Nielsen data as of March 20, excludes the last two weekends in the Easter period. Our custom database and internal estimates of the 12 retail take away figures closer to Easter and not yet released to you, are in line with our first quarter sales performance. We gained market share for the 12 weeks ended March 20th and while results are not yet final, Easter sell through appear solid and we will again gain market share in this key season.
I’m very pleased with Hershey’s marketplace performance. Total CMG (Candy, Mint, Gum) category retail take away for the 12 weeks ending March 20, for our custom database, in channels that account for over 80% of our retail business, so here I’m talking about food, drug, mass including Wal-Mart, and convenience stores. That take away was up 7.5%. Excluding Wal-Mart, Hershey’s FDMXC retail take away was up 6.1%. 
Both of these amounts include Easter seasonal sales. If you look at excluding Easter sales, giving the timing changes, so excluded from the current year and the year ago period, Hershey’s FDMXC without Wal-Mart retail take away was up 4%. We gained market share when you include Easter or exclude Easter so both with or without Easter seasonal activity we gained market share. All in, including the seasonal activity, Hershey category market share in FDMXC increased 0.5 points.
Our marketplace results were solid and improved across all channels. We gained market share in all classes of trade except drug which, as expected, was down but did improve versus last quarter. Our marketplace performance was driven by the core brands we have focused on. Specifically, in FDMXC the combined retail take away on Hershey’s, Reese’s, Hershey’s Bliss, Hershey’s Kisses, Twizzlers, and Kit Kat brands, these are the brands where ad spend is ongoing, take away increased about 10%. York, Almond Joy, and Mounds, brands that we just started advertising in January posted FDMXC resale take away up in the teens.
Looking at the category, CMG continues to grow within the historical 3% to 4% range. In FDMXC excluding Wal-Mart the category grew 4.4%. Excluding Easter seasonal activity in the current and year ago periods the category FDMXC was up 3.3%. Other than Valentine’s there’s not a lot of pricing in that number.
Valentine’s was a headwind for the overall category in the quarter. Total category sales for the Valentine’s season, the smallest of the four seasons, were down mid single digits as gifting was particularly soft. The decline was primarily driven by the drug channel where Valentine’s category gifting sales declined double digits. In the food and mass channels, Valentine’s category sales were about flat. Hershey’s overall Valentine’s retail take away was down and resulted in a market share decline of slightly less than one point for the season.
Similar to the last few quarters, our marketplace results in measured channels were driven by our success in the food and convenience channels. The results are a function of the core brand advertising and strong selling, retail execution, and merchandising.
In the food class of trade, category growth was 8.1% including Easter and a robust 7.3% excluding Easter seasonal activity from the current and year ago periods. Hershey retail take away in this channel exceeded the category both with and without Easter seasonal activity. Overall this performance resulted in the 0.5 point market share gain the food channel.
Collectively the core brands that we’re supporting such as Kit Kat, Reese’s and Hershey’s drove this growth. Again, additionally we got very good early retail lift on York, Almond Joy and Mounds driven by the new advertising copy I mentioned earlier.
Let me now talk to you about the c-store class of trade where the category was up 2.3%. In the first quarter Hershey c-store take away increased for the eighth consecutive quarter and our take away was up 6.2% resulting in a gain of one full share point. In the first quarter, Hershey c-store chocolate, and non-chocolate take away were up 9.1% and 5% respectively driven by volume and mix. Strong in store consumer promotions and merchandising drove balanced growth across the core brands.
We believe the confectionary category will continue to see growth in the c-store channel as confections remains a strategic focus for these retailers considering about 50% of candy purchases are made on impulse and that candy is the number one category for cross merchandising opportunities in conveniences stores with over 80% of candy purchases made in conjunction with another category. Candy remains very profitable with the second highest gross margin in the c-store.
As we look to the remainder of the year, our effort will focus on core brand growth across all channels. We will meaningfully add to and refine levels of advertising and support on many key brands. Our net sales, retail take away and ongoing ROI analysis demonstrate the soundness of our advertising investment. We have high quality copy that is working and it’s made even more impactful when coordinated with in store selling, programming, and merchandising. This strategy will continue to drive our business.
We have already benefited from the good programming I just mentioned. Again this year in the first quarter our Reese’s NCAA Final Four Basketball event was a big success. In the second quarter, Reese’s will be one of the main sponsors of the Iron Man 2 movie. We’ll also kick off the summer time s’mores program in Q2 with Memorial Day promotions featuring Rascal Flatts. And just in time for summer movie releases the Hershey’s Kisses brand will anchor our Kisses movie night where we’re giving away a free movie ticket with multiple purchases of 10 oz bags of Hershey’s Kisses, Hershey’s Miniatures, Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, and York Peppermint Patties.
I’m also pleased with the launch and roll out of our new products and more importantly with the positive consumer reaction. In Q1 new products were a net positive for the first time in a number of years, contributing almost two points to our overall sales growth. The December launch of Almond Joy, Hershey’s Special Dark, and York Pieces is the primary driven of this growth. These results reflect our new innovation approach and discipline. 
Retailers were pleased with this lineup and we achieved our distribution and trial targets faster than anticipated. Pieces will be supported throughout the year not only by product specific advertising on Pieces but also by advertising on the parent brands.
We expect innovation to continue to be a top line driver and we’ll follow up the Pieces launch with the December introduction of Reese’s Mini Minis and Hershey’s Drops. As we’ve continued to demonstrate, we remain committed to doing the right things for the business in both the short and long term. Investments we have made are paying off and that is reflected in our overall performance over the last 18 months.
Ace business momentum in the first quarter was greater than we had expected. As such, we now have the flexibility to deliver on our financial objectives while also making additional investments in our business both in the US and Internationally. Over the remainder of the year, primarily in the second half, we’ll intensify our efforts on existing strategic projects related to consumer and customer insights as well as category management techniques that will benefit the business over the long term. 
Additionally, advertising expense will now increase 35% to 40% in 2010. We’ll increase advertising levels on some existing brands and in some geographies. We’ll also test ROI thresholds, driving techniques and expand our digital marketing capabilities. These additional investments were not included in the initial outlook we provided on February 2.
Now to wrap up, we’re pleased with our Q1 performance. The strong start to 2010 similar to 2009 will fuel additional investment in the business in the second half of the year. We believe the additional investments we’ll make will ensure the category and Hershey continue to perform well over the remainder of the year and into 2011. The category continues to grow. 
We have now completely cycled the August 2008 pricing actions and we’re seeing base volume growth. The overall macro economic environment appears to be getting better, albeit very slowly but it is still difficult to predict consumer sentiment and purchasing patterns. There are also some Valentine’s and Easter shifts out of Q4 2010 and into Q1 2011 and Bert Alfonso will give you more detail on this shortly.
We see net sales growing comfortably within our long term 3% to 5% net sales targets for the remainder of the year. For the full year we expect 2010 net sales growth of at least 6% including an approximate one point benefit from foreign currency exchange rates. For the full year we have good visibility into our cost structure and expect to achieve growth and EBIT margin expansion that will result in a low to mid teens increase in adjusted earnings per share diluted on a percentage basis versus 2009. This expectation includes plans to meaningfully invest in our business throughout the reminder of the year.
I’ll now turn it over to Bert who will provide some additional financial details.

98873,100477721,57105,"Hershey Co., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-22-2010",2010-04-22,"Earnings Calls","The Hershey Company","Executives","First quarter results were better than our earlier expectations with consolidated net sales of $1.4 billion up 13.9% versus the prior year, generating diluted EPS of $0.64. 68% EPS increase versus adjusted EPS from operations last year was driven by great",1437,"First quarter results were better than our earlier expectations with consolidated net sales of $1.4 billion up 13.9% versus the prior year, generating diluted EPS of $0.64. 68% EPS increase versus adjusted EPS from operations last year was driven by greater than anticipated base sales volume, net price realization, and new manufacturing efficiencies.
First quarter sales gains were driven primarily by balanced volume increases in focused channels, new products, carry over seasonal pricing, and price realization related to trade efficiency. Several factors contributed to the volume gains, these include base business volume that exceeded expectations driven by brand investments and retail trends discussed by Dave. 
The successful distribution and the launch of new products which exceeded expectations and contributed about two points of growth, and the seasonal shift we communicated in our fourth quarter call in January which moved volume from the fourth quarter ’09 to the first quarter 2010. In addition, our international business was up and foreign currency exchange was about one point of benefit.
Dave already provided details to our marketplace performance, however, again I remind you that Nielsen data as of March 20th excludes the last two weekends in the Easter period for our custom database for 12 week take away figures closer to Easter are in line with our first quarter factory shipments leaving inventory at key distributors and retailers at desired levels.
Turning now to margins, in the first quarter adjusted gross margin increased 630 basis points, this was driven by net price realization, supply chain efficiencies some of which is related to fixed cost absorption as volume was greater than year ago and better than expected versus our previous estimates and lower commodity input costs of about 130 basis points.
The favorable commodities are an anomaly in the first quarter but are projected to be higher than prior year for the remaining quarters in 2010. We have good visibility into our cost structure and we’ll achieve the expected 2010 Global Supply Chain Cost savings of $15 to $25 million by the end of the second quarter. In addition, normal levels of productivity are on track and we expect gross margin to expand for the full year 2010 but not at the rate realized in the first quarter.
EBIT margin increased 410 basis points in the first quarter as higher gross margin was only partially offset by advertising, up 67% or about 190 basis points, selling expenses as we added more US in store hours and continued to build global capabilities, higher employee related costs, and legal costs and advisory services related to our consideration of the transaction with Cadbury.
We are planning additional increases in advertising for the full year and expect advertising expense to increase 35% to 40% in 2010 which is greater than our previous estimate of 25% to 30%. Despite this increase we expect EBIT margin to increase for the full year driven by the first quarter gain offset by higher investments that will primarily occur during the second half of the year.
Now let me provide a brief update on our international businesses. On a reported and constant currency basis, net sales increased with solid performance in Canada, China, Mexico, and Brazil. Excluding Canada, our international sales increased 14% on an organic basis including FX. This is in line with our five year CAGR that we shared with you during Cagny presentations. Profits increased in Canada but declined over the remainder of our international businesses as we continued to make necessary investments to increase brand awareness and drive trial.
Moving down the P&L, for the quarter interest expense decreased slightly coming in at $23.7 million versus $23.9 million in the prior period. This was due to lower average debt balances. In 2010 we expect interest expense to be approximately $90 to $100 million.
The tax rate in the first quarter was 35.8% considerably less than a year ago when the rate was 41.9% due to the timing of certain tax events. We continue to expect the full year tax rate to be about 35% and roughly 36% in the second quarter.
In the first quarter 2010 weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 229.6 million versus 228.3 million in 2009 leading to EPS of $0.64 per share diluted.
Now let me turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the first quarter, net trading capital decreased versus last year’s first quarter resulting in a net cash inflow of $65 million. Accounts receivable was up $80 million. The year over year increase was a direct result of higher sales and Easter timing. We continuously monitor our accounts receivable aging and it remains extremely current and of high quality.
Inventory declined by $91 million and accounts payable increased by $55 million. Over the last two years we have made excellent progress on net working capital and at this point in time we would expect it to trend about at current levels for the remainder of the year. In terms of other specific cash flow items, capital additions including software were $36 million. For 2010 we continue to expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $150 to $160 million in line with previous communication. Depreciation and amortization was $47 million in the first quarter and in 2010 we are forecasting total depreciation and amortization of $180 million.
Dividends paid during the quarter were $71 million. We did not acquire any stock in the first quarter related to the current repurchase program and there remains $100 million outstanding on the authorization that the Board approved in 2006. During the quarter, however, we did repurchase 64 million of our common shares in the open market to replace shares issued in connection with stock option exercises.
Cash on hand at the end of the first quarter was $304 million up $50 million versus the year end balance. As it relates to our short term cash needs, the company is currency well positioned. Our cash flow continues to be strong and will improve as we grow earnings.
Now to summarize. In 2010 our goal is to continue the current marketplace momentum. To support this objective we’ll continue to invest in our brands and businesses in both the US and international markets. We’ll focus our efforts on advertising, which we expect to increase 35% to 40% as well as consumer insights and brand building initiatives that should enable the category and Hershey to grow this year and into 2011.
As a result, we expect net sales growth for the full year 2010 of at least 6% including an approximate one point benefit from foreign currency exchange rates. Despite commodity spot price volatility, we have good visibility into our 2010 cost structure and expect to achieve growth in EBIT margin expansion that result in 2010 adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of low to mid teens on a percentage basis versus 2009.
Before we go to Q&A as you work your models, let’s consider some of the unique first quarter drivers and there are many moving parts and factors affecting our business over the remainder of the year. To be more specific, as we exit the first quarter we have completed and lapped the August 2008 pricing action. The first quarter volume benefited from a seasonal shift from the fourth quarter 2009 into the first quarter 2010. The December ’09 to January 2010 seasonal shift and shipping patterns are likely to occur again at the end of this year with respect to Valentine’s and Easter.
Also, Easter is later next year, April 24th. As a result we expect the seasonal shift from the fourth quarter of ’10 to the first quarter of ’11 to be greater than the shift that occurs this quarter as we continue to refine seasonal orders and logistic requirements with our key customers.
The launch of Reese’s Minis and Hershey’s Drops is scheduled for December to align ourselves with retailer shelf resets. The majority of the incremental brand building initiatives which we mentioned will occur in the second half of the year. We do not expect the first quarter commodity favorability to continue for the remainder of the year nor do we expect the LIFO inventory accounting to be favorable in the fourth quarter 2010 as it was in the fourth quarter 2009.
We expect favorable exchange rate gains to decline each quarter as the year progresses. Finally, by the end of June we expect to achieve all of the Global Supply Chain Transformation program savings that we mentioned.
With all that out of the way, we’ll now open it up for questions.

On two channels, convenience stores and drug, particularly on convenience store, perhaps you could speak for the category, were you seeing a general sequential improvement in demand through the quarter and perhaps heading into this most recent month, that’s certainly what we have heard I just wanted to soft of confirm that that was happening.

For the most part we’re pretty pleased with our business and again we really saw volume return in convenience in a big way in the first quarter.
With respect to drug, we mentioned it before, as we had changed some of our go to market processes and the way we were approaching brand investment we found ourselves a bit misaligned with our drug customers and these are very important customers to us and customers where we enjoy long term relationships that are very important. We’ve been working very hard to come to a place where we’re back in sync with those retailers. I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to comment any further other than to say that we continue to work that and we did get sequentially better and hope that as the year goes on we continue to do that.

We do look at it by brand. We think there are break through levels for different brands so it is a granular question and I could probably answer it if we had a lot more time in a very granular way. We run the ROIs by brand as well. We continue to look at the spend and are very pleased with the results that we’re getting.

Seasons in the quarter are somewhere around a quarter to a third of our business in terms of the Easter shipments as factory shipments go. On a weighted basis we took a 10% to 11% price increase and it was on a third of the business in the quarter. Roughly do the math you’ll wind up with something in the 3% range on price as a contributor.
We did talk when we talked to you in the fourth quarter of last year about some volume shifting out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter so again a couple of points of shift. And we would have expected to see our new product contribution from Pieces add a little bit to sales and we would have expected international add a little bit to sales. Our expectation going in would have been around that, the little bit of carry over pricing, the Easter shift and then some new products and a little bit of international and foreign exchange gain.
Mid single digits would have been our expectation. We had three, I think, places where we exceeded our expectations. One of them was the ramp up of the new products and the ACV and the distribution build probably added an extra point of growth in the quarter. We were a bit more efficient between growth in net, our trade promotion efficiency was pretty good but we were also very good with mark downs on saleables as we continue to get our inventories in line we continue to do a little bit better sweating down from growth to net if you will.
Then the rest of it is really base volume. We had good base volume where we’ve invested so the brands we’ve invested advertising, particularly where we invested late in the year last year but also at the customers and the retail outlets so convenience certain mass and certain food accounts where we put more retail and selling resources in, we saw very good volume gain in the first quarter. 
As you carry forward into the year we’ll continue to expect to see the new products will contribute and we continue to expect to see, now that we’re lapped through the price increase we’ll get base volume. I hope that gives you an explanation of how we’re thinking about the year. I’ll let Bert talk a little bit about the cost absorption.

As you think about the rest of the year, right now we’re thinking more in line with what we would have planned. We plan for volume increase this year as you would imagine in terms of our total plan. 
We had some pricing coming into the year and as you’ve already mentioned that exhausted itself in the first quarter. We were planning for volume increase; we got a bit more in the first quarter. We’re looking out at the remaining quarters to be closer to the initial plans. Even with the shift that occurs at year end that product is largely produced within 2010. Think of the shift not as an absorption shift but more as a shift in sales in terms of shipping. 
Overall, cost of goods is favorable in the first quarter for the number of things which you’ve already mentioned; global supply chain transformation being heavier in the first half, particularly in the first quarter, we had better commodity year on year which we do not expect in the remaining quarters, and our ongoing productivity is pretty spread out throughout the year so that stays and has been coming in as we expected.

What I mean by that is that Mars hasn’t produced a bar, you guys haven’t produced an enrobed product like a Snickers. 
They haven’t gone after peanut butter and you guys haven’t gone after M&Ms. My sense is that that’s changing and I’m wondering why shouldn’t I be worried about that. The pieces product looks like its going right after M&Ms and the Bliss product seems to go really right after Dove. I just worry that what had been each others territory and rarely maybe playing around the fringes but now it seems like you’re going right up against some of their core products.

We think about the business by consumer usage occasion, and by forms and by how our brands are best positioned. When you think about the Pieces lineup what we’re really doing is you remember when we talk about loyalist consumers, the loyal consumers who are looking for the coconut experience that Mounds, Almond Joy provide or looking for the mint and chocolate experience that York provides, they’re unable to get that in the category right now up until we launched Pieces in a hand to mouth format. 
What we’re really doing is taking some of our brands where consumers are the most loyal and providing that flavor experience that we think our brands uniquely capture and providing that to them in a different usage occasion. When we think about how we segment the category we really do look at it from the consumers view and then that’s how we also position our brands and think about investments. The category growth is robust. When you look at 52 week growth rates we’re up 7%. 
As people invest in the category and others including Mars Wrigley, including Linton Ghirardelli and Kraft Cadbury it’s an expandable category, consumers purchase it on impulse so as people continue to invest in the category the category will expand and grow and we think that’s a healthy thing. We’re doing it based on a consumer view and brand view and that’s how we look at it.

One of them is the category dynamic and the relationships, we are very proud of our relationships and have built those relationships over many, many years in convenience with retailers and so I think what’s happened as we’ve gone through some bumps in the road and the economy and the relationship the category has in that class of trade is very strong. We’ve continued to provide solutions. Some of the points that I mentioned, the second highest margin category is certainly the highest margin in the category is something that has velocity in the convenience stores. I think there’s probably higher margin in health and beauty but not a lot of that gets sold. 
We’re a high margin category, we are a very good bundled category, confections goes with a beverage often times so you can incent a higher dollar ring if you will when you can bundle confections together. It’s still a very much impulse oriented category. In a world where you’re trips are precious if you’re worried about the number of trips you’re getting you definitely want to have impulsive stuff right up close to the front of the register to take full advantage of those trips. I think the category dynamics are very good. 
On top of it the programming has been very good, I think we’ve all learned together the retailers and us, particularly about what works and what doesn’t work, what the right assortment is, where the aisle ought to be. The category management expertise that for example Max has helped their retailers with has I think really started to pay off for the category in terms of making it a destination. We’re pleased with it, we’ve hung in there with them for years in terms of building those relationships and I think it’s really paying off for us.

We clearly over delivered in the first quarter both on the top line and on the bottom line. Q1 benefited from some of the really difficult but I think sound decisions that we made in prior months and years. For example, the change in our business model in terms of pricing, now that winds itself up, the August of ’08 pricing winds itself up in the first quarter. The Global Supply Chain Transformation largely winds itself up here in the first half so we’ll get the savings in the first half. We start to benefit from the advertising that we’ve certainly been doing, not start, we continue to benefit from the advertising.
When you look at the first quarter we got good benefits from the Global Supply Chain and the carry over pricing, those things tend to wind themselves up in the front half. We had really strong earnings delivery in the first part of the year, the first quarter and it’ll carry over a little bit here going forward, really good earnings here.
The investment part where we’re going to now take a look at, based on the strength we have in the first quarter, reinvesting some of that earnings momentum, that investment comes in the second half of the year where we’re in a more normalized business model, if you will. We’re now more of a steady state model once we’re through the pricing and through the Global Supply Chain Transformation we’ll start to see a little bit more normalized volumes if you will going forward once we’re through the price increase and we will invest significantly in the back part of the year in advertising and in capabilities.
I think that’s the way to think about it is a more normalized business model going forward with some pretty strong investments for the future.

I think overall we’re through the pricing from August ’08; we’re starting to see the volumes return. As I said, we’re comfortable in that 3% to 5% long term sales guidance that we have out there for the rest of the year and then again I guess there’s a little bit of a mismatch between the productivity and the margin expansion and then the expansion of SM&A we spend a little bit more in the back half and we have a little bit more productivity in the front half.

Again, on a macro level what we’ve really done is invested in our brands in advertising and consumer promotion. We took the price increase in August of ’08 because the commodity costs were very, very high and the profile had kind of changed in a step function way. 
As part of that increase we not only change list prices we also saw promotional prices move up in the marketplace. As part of that move up in promotional prices is needing less trade promotion on some level to hit what would have been historically lower prices. There’s a little bit of that that goes with the new pricing model and the pricing structure. Overall its so customer and event specific I think we saw overall we’re spending more absolute dollars in promotion because we have more volume. 
On a rate basis we did see an improvement in the first quarter and we’re pleased with that, although I’m not sure that we would tell you to trend that forward.

Remember that these brands are incredibly profitable, very high margin brands for us so when you think about York and you think about Mounds and Almond Joy these are brands that have, they’re not solid milk chocolate they have a lot of inclusion and they’re enrobed bars so they’re very high margin for us. 
We’re not spending at the level we’re spending on Hershey’s or on Reese’s on these brands. We think with a modest level of brand investment we can get really good awareness on some of these brands that have high margins and get them activated that way and reengage some consumers who we haven’t talked to in seven, eight, nine, or ten years. That’s how we’re thinking about it and again we got really good lift initially and these are ones that we’ll watch very closely to make sure that we continue to see lift and run the ROIs on them.
It’s kind of a natural evolution once you get through getting the big brands to the right place that you now go into other part as we talked about in the consumer demand landscape and see how you can activate the brands and we’re pleased to date with it but it’s only a quarters worth of results so we’ll watch the ROIs carefully.

First, how much of having more feet on the street has made you more efficient in terms of promotions and ability to maybe be more efficient with your pricing and trade promotions.

We think we’re very good within our category and we think we’re actually think of ourselves as pretty comparable in consumer packaging goods because we had a pretty efficient cost because we’re so focused on one category can deliver pretty good benefit. 
You’re right; we started in ’07 specific to retail, investing in certain classes of trade, certain mass customers, a little bit in food and certainly quite a bit in convenience stores. We’re at full complement but we’re also actually adding again this year in terms of in store hours. There is an investment in RS, if you look at our SM&A line there is an investment inherent in that line this year for more sales coverage. It is paying out. 
One of the things that I would also tell you is it’s not a static sales force if you will, we can reroute that sales force on a monthly basis based on activity by customer based on who’s running promotional activity and where we need to sell at retail. We do that and we continue to look at how to continuously improve our routing to be more efficient and productive. Also, as the economy has shifted in the last 12 to 18 months we’ve certainly shifted and grown with the growing customers if you will and made sure that our resources are in the right place. 
It is a strong competitive advantage for us and one that we continually invest in and I think it makes the advertising investment that much more efficient and effective when you actually get to retail and product that you’re advertising is in the right spot with consumer promotion and merchandising vehicles that tie to the advertising. 
The NCAA March Madness promotion, for example we ran great Reese’s copy throughout March and at store level you saw walls of orange when you came into store in terms of display so that the consumer once they got to the store we could activate. We think it works very well together, we’ve invested in both capabilities and we’re going to continue to do that.

What that says to me is the rumble of the new product news seems to be happening in the wake of a period which Hershey has been gaining share through just advertising behind the core and having that virtuous cycle going. Do you think it’s appropriate for Hershey to stay the course here very limited new product news for a while and that this soft of cycle can continue or do you think it’s appropriate maybe for Hershey to fold in more new product news here particularly with the competition and perhaps the consumer being ready for it?

There is a role for news in this category as a variety seeking category. Consumers have more than one brand that they are willing to sample so there is a role for innovation.

We’ve do it, I think in a way that works for our supply chain and for our business model at the current time. 
Other people have their own view of how to go about their brands and their business and there’s no one right answer. The answer for us right now, we had a very strong first quarter coming off of a good year last year. The model is working, we continue to run the ROIs on all of the marketing mix; advertising, consumer promotion, and trade promotion. We’ll continue to dial as we go along. 
For us right now we think we’re in a good place and as I said we don’t have the only model there are any number of models to make things work.

Hershey's first quarter results were strong and reflect the momentum of our core brand in the marketplace. The global investments we have made in marketing and selling capabilities are starting to pay off, and we see it in our reported results, retail takeaway and market share. While only three months into the year, this high-quality quarter has created the confidence in environment to allow us to deliver on both our financial objectives for 2010, while also making additional investments in our business. We'll have more on this in a bit.
In the first quarter, net sales increased 13.9%, driven by a balance of volume gains and price realization. Volume growth was the result of our execution in the marketplace and the ramp-up of investments in core-brand advertising and selling capabilities made over the last two years. 
Base business volume increased, especially in channels where we have focused resources, that’s C Stores, food and select mass customers. Price realization from carryover seasonal pricing also benefited the top line.
Recall that Easter performance also benefited from the previously mentioned shift in seasonal business from Q4 2009 into Q1 2010. Looking at our retail takeaway, where we benefited slightly from the timing of an earlier Easter. Remember in 2010, Easter occurred on April 4, and in 2009, it was on April 12. Therefore, the reported IRI and Neilsen data, as of March 20, excludes the last two weekends in the Easter period. Our custom database and internal estimates of the 12-week retail takeaway figure is closer to Easter, and not yet released to you, are in line with our first quarter sales performance. We gained market share for the 12 weeks ended March 20, and while results are not yet final, Easter sales-through appears solid, and we will again gain market share in this key season.
I'm very pleased with Hershey's marketplace performance. Total CNG, that's candy, mint and gum, category, retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending March 20 for our custom database in channels that account for over 80% of our retail business, so here I'm talking about food, drug, mass, including Wal-Mart and convenience stores, that takeaway was up 7.5%. Excluding Wal-Mart, Hershey's FDMxC retail takeaway was up 6.1%. 
Both of these amounts include Easter seasonal sales. So if you look at excluding Easter sales, given the timing changes, so let's exclude it from the current year and the year-ago period, Hershey's FDMxC without Wal-Mart, retail takeaway was up 4%. We gain market share when you include Easter or exclude Easter. So both with and without Easter seasonal activity we gained market share. All in, including the seasonal activity, Hershey category market share and FDMxC increased 0.5 points. Our marketplace results were solid and improved across all channels. We gained market share in all classes of trade except drug, which as expected, was down but did improve versus last quarter.
Our marketplace performance was driven by the core brands we have focused on. Specifically, in FDMxC, the combined retail takeaway on Hershey's, Reese’s, Hershey's Bliss, Hershey's Kisses, Twizzlers and Kit Kat brands, and these are brands where ad spend is ongoing, takeaway increased about 10%. York, Almond Joy and Mounds, brands that we just started advertising in January, posted FDMxC retail takeaway up in the teens.
Looking at the category, C&G continues to grow within the historical 3% to 4% range. In FDMxC, excluding Wal-Mart, the category grew 4.4%. Excluding Easter seasonal activity in the current and year-ago periods, the category FDMxC was up 3.3%. And other than Valentine’s, there's not a lot of pricing in that number. Valentine's was a headwind for the overall category in the quarter. Total category sales for the Valentine’s season, the smallest of the four seasons, were down mid-single digits, as gifting was particularly soft. The decline was primarily driven by the drug channel, where Valentine’s category gifting sales declined double digits.
In the food and mass channels, Valentine’s category sales were about flat. Hershey's overall Valentine’s retail takeaway was down and resulted in a market share decline of slightly less than one point for the season.
Similar to the last few quarters, our marketplace results in measured channels were driven by our success in the food and convenience channels. The results are a function of the core-brand advertising and strong selling, retail execution and merchandising. In the food class of trade, category growth was 8.1%, including Easter, and a robust 7.3%, excluding Easter seasonal activity from the current and year-ago periods. Hershey retail takeaway in this channel exceeded the category, both with and without Easter seasonal activity. Overall, this performance resulted in a 0.5 market share gain in the food channel.
Collectively, the core brands that we're supporting, such as Kit Kat, Reese's and Hershey's, drove this growth. And again, initially, we got very good early retail lift on York, Almond Joy and Mounds, driven by the new advertising copy I mentioned earlier. 
Well, now, I’ll talk to you about the C-store class of trade, where the category was up 2.3%. In the first quarter, Hershey C-store takeaway increased for the eighth consecutive quarter, and our takeaway was up 6.2%, resulting in a gain of one full share point. In the first quarter, Hershey C-store chocolate and non-chocolate takeaway were up 9.1% and 5% respectively, driven by volume and mix. Strong in-store consumer promotions and merchandising drove balanced growth across the core brands.
We believe the confectionery category will continue to see growth in the C-store channel, as confections remains a strategic focus for these retailers, considering that about 50% of candy purchases are made on impulse and that candy is the number-one category for cross-merchandising opportunities in convenience stores, with over 80% of candy purchases made in conjunction with another category. And candy remains very profitable, with the second-highest gross margin in the C store.
As we look to the remainder of the year, our effort will focus on core-brand growth across all channels. We will meaningfully add to and refine levels of advertising and support on many key brands. Our net sales, retail takeaway and ongoing ROI analysis demonstrate the soundness of our advertising investment. We have high-quality copy that is working, and it's made even more impactful when coordinated with in-store selling, programming and merchandising. This strategy will continue to drive our business. 
We have already benefited from the good programming I just mentioned. Again, this year, in the first quarter, our Reese’s NCAA Final Four basketball event was a big success. In the second quarter, Reese’s will be one of the main sponsors of the Iron Man 2 movie. We'll also kick off the summertime S’mores program in Q2 with Memorial Day promotions featuring Rascal Flatts. And just in time for summer movie releases, the Hershey Kisses brand will anchor our Kisses movie night, where we’re giving away a free movie ticket with multiple purchases of 10-ounce bags of Hershey's Kisses, Hershey's Miniature's, Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, York Peppermint Patties. 
I'm also pleased with the launch and rollout of our new products and more importantly, with the positive consumer reaction. In Q1, new products were a net positive for the first time in a number of years, contributing almost two points to our overall sales growth. The December launch of Almond Joy, Hershey's Special Dark and York Pieces is the primary driver of this growth. These results reflect our new innovation approach and discipline. Retailers were pleased with this lineup, and we achieved our distribution and trial targets faster than anticipated. 
Pieces will be supported throughout the year not only by product-specific advertising on Pieces, but also by advertising on the parent brands. We expect innovation to continue to be a top line driver and will follow up the Pieces launched with the December introduction of Reese’s Mini Minis and Hershey's Drops. 
As we’ve continued to demonstrate, we remain committed to doing the right things for the business in both the short and long term. The investments we have made are paying off, and that is reflected in our overall performance over the last 18 months.
Ace [ph] business momentum in the first quarter was greater than we had expected. As such, we now have the flexibility to deliver on our financial objectives while also making additional investments in our business, both in the U.S. and internationally. Over the remainder of the year, primarily in the second half, we'll intensify our efforts on existing strategic projects related to consumer and customer insights, as well as category management techniques that will benefit the business over the long term. Additionally, advertising expense will now increase 35% to 40% in 2010. We'll increase advertising levels on some existing brands and in some geographies.
We'll also our test ROI thresholds, flighting techniques and expand our digital marketing capabilities. These additional investments were not included in the initial outlook we have provided on February 2. 
Now to wrap up. We're pleased with our Q1 performance. The strong start to 2010, similar to 2009, will fuel additional investment in the business in the second half of the year. We believe the additional investments we’ll make will ensure the category and Hershey continue to perform well over the remainder of the year and into 2011. The category continues to grow. We have now completely cycled the August 2008 pricing action, and we’re seeing base-volume growth. The overall macroeconomic environment appears to be getting better, albeit very slowly, but it is still difficult to predict consumer sentiment and purchasing patterns.
There are also some Valentine’s and Easter shifts out of Q4 2010 and into Q1 of 2011, and Bert Alfonso will give you more detail on this shortly. We see net sales growing comfortably within long-term 3% to 5% net sales target for the remainder of the year. So for the full year, we expect 2010 net sales growth of at least 6%, including an approximate one point benefit from foreign currency exchange rates.
For the full year, we have good visibility into our cost structure, and expect to achieve growth and EBIT margin expansion that will result in a low- to mid-teens increase in adjusted earnings per share diluted on a percentage basis versus 2009. This expectation includes plans to meaningfully invest in our business throughout the remainder of the year. I'll now turn it over to Bert, who will provide some additional financial detail."

First quarter results were better than our earlier expectations, with consolidated net sales of $1.4 billion, up 13.9% versus the prior year, generating diluted EPS of $0.64. The 68% EPS increase versus adjusted EPS from operations last year was driven by greater than anticipated base sales volume, net price realization and new manufacturing efficiencies. First quarter sales gain were driven primarily by balance volume increases in focused channels, new products, carryover seasonal pricing and price realization related to trade efficiency. 
Several factors contributed to the volumes gains, and these include base business volume that exceeded expectations, driven by brand investments in retail trends, discussed by Dave; the successful distribution and the launch of new products, which exceeded expectations and contributed about two points of growth; and the seasonal shift we communicated in our fourth quarter call in January, which moved volume from the fourth quarter of '09 to the first quarter of 2010. In addition, our international business was up and foreign currency exchange was about one point of benefit. 
We have already provided details related to our marketplace performance. However, again I remind you that Nielsen data as of March 20 excludes the last two weekends in the Easter period. For our custom database, the 12-week retail takeaway figures closer to Easter are in line with our first quarter factory shipment, leaving inventory and key distributors and retailers at desired levels. 
Turning now to margins, in the first quarter, adjusted gross margin increased 630 basis points. This was driven by net price realization; supply-chain efficiencies, some of which is related to fixed cost absorption as volume was greater than year ago and better-than-expected versus our previous estimates; and lower commodity input costs of about 130 basis points. The favorable commodities are anomaly in the first quarter but are projected to be higher than prior year for the remaining quarters in 2010. We have good visibility into our cost structure and will achieve the expected 2010 goal of supply-chain cost savings of $15 million to $25 million by the end of the second quarter. In addition, normal levels of productivity are on track, and we expect gross margin to expand for the full year 2010 but not at the rate realized in the first quarter.
EBIT margin increased 410 basis points in the first quarter, as higher gross margin was only partially offset by advertising, up 67%, or about 190 basis points; selling expenses as we added more U.S. in-store hours and continued to build global capabilities; higher employee-related costs; and legal costs and advisory services related to our consideration of the transaction with Cadbury. We are planning additional increases in advertising for the full year and expect advertising expense to increase 35% to 40% in 2010, which is greater than our previous estimate of 25% to 30%. Despite this increase, we expect EBIT margin to increase for the full year, driven by the first quarter gain, offset by higher investments that will primarily occur during the second half of the year.
Now let me provide a brief update on our international businesses. On a reported and constant-currency basis, net sales increased, with solid performances in Canada, China, Mexico and Brazil. Excluding Canada, our international sales increased 14% on an organic basis, including FX. This is in line with our five-year CAGR that we shared with you during CAGNY presentations. Profits increased in Canada but declined over the remainder of our international businesses, as we continue to make necessary investments to increase brand awareness and drive trial. 
Moving down to P&L. For the quarter, interest expense decreased slightly, coming in at $23.7 million versus $23.9 million in the prior period. This was due to lower average debt balances. In 2010, we expect interest expense to be approximately $90 million to $100 million. The tax rate in the first quarter was 35.8%, considerably less than a year ago, when the rate was 41.9% due to the timing of certain tax events. We continue to expect the full-year tax rate to be about 35% and roughly 36% in the second quarter.
In the first quarter of 2010, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were $229.6 million versus $228.3 million in 2009, leading to EPS of $0.64 per share diluted. 
Now let me turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the first quarter, net trading capital decreased versus last year's first quarter, resulting in a net cash inflow of $65 million. Accounts receivable was up $80 million. The year-over-year increase was a direct result of higher sales and Easter timing. We continuously monitor our accounts receivable aging, and it remains extremely current and of high quality. Inventory declined by $91 million, and accounts payable increased by $55 million. Over the last two years, we have made excellent progress on net working capital, and at this point in time, we would expect it to trend about at current levels for the remainder of the year.
In terms of other specific cash flow items, capital additions including software were $36 million. For 2010, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million, in line with previous communication. Depreciation and amortization was $47 million in the first quarter. And in 2010, we are forecasting total depreciation and amortization of $180 million. Dividends paid during the quarter were $71 million. We did not acquire any stock in the first quarter related to the current repurchase program, and there remains 100 $million outstanding on the authorization that the Board approved in 2006. During the quarter, however, we did repurchase 64 million of our common shares in the open market to replace shares issued in connection with stock option exercises. 
Cash on hand at the end of the first quarter was $304 million, up $50 million versus the year-end balance. As it relates to our short-term cash needs, the company is currently well-positioned. Our cash flow continues to be strong and will improve as we grow earnings.
Now to summarize. In 2010, our goal is continue the current marketplace momentum. To support this objective, we'll continue to invest in our brand and businesses in both the U.S. and international markets. We'll focus our efforts on advertising, which we expect to increase 35% to 40%, as well as consumer insights and brand building initiatives that should enable the category and Hershey to grow this year and into 2011. As a result, we expect net sales growth for the full-year 2010 of at least 6%, including an approximate one-point benefit from foreign currency exchange rates. 
Despite commodity stock price volatility, we have good visibility into our 2010 cost structure and expect to achieve growth in EBIT margin expansion that will result in 2010 adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of low- to mid-teens on a percentage basis versus 2009.
Before we go to Q&A, as you work your model, let's consider some of the unique first quarter drivers, and there are many moving parts and factors affecting our business over the remainder of the year. To be more specific, as we exit the first quarter, we have completed and lapped the August 2008 pricing action. The first quarter volume benefited from a seasonal shift from the fourth quarter of 2009 into the first quarter of 2010. The December '09 to January 2010 seasonal shift in shipping patterns are likely to occur again at the end of this year with respect to Valentine and Easter. Also, Easter is later next year, April 24. As a result, we expect the seasonal shift from the fourth quarter of '10 to the first quarter of '11 to be greater than the shift that occurred this quarter, as we continue to refine seasonal orders and logistic requirements with our key customers. 
The launch of Reese’s Minis and Hershey’s Drops is scheduled for December to align ourselves with retailer shelf resets. The majority of the incremental brand building initiatives, which we mentioned, will occur in the second half of the year. We do not expect the first quarter commodity favorability to continue over the remainder of the year, nor do we expect the LIFO inventory accounting to be favorable in the fourth quarter of 2010 as it was in the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect favorable exchange-rate gains to decline each quarter as the year progresses. And finally, by the end of June, we expect to achieve all of the global supply chain transformation program savings that we mentioned. With all that out of the way, we'll now open it up for questions."

But so for the most part, we're pretty pleased with our business, and again, we really saw volume return in convenience in a big way in the first quarter. With respect to drug, we mentioned it before. As we had changed some of our go-to-market processes and some of the way we were approaching brand investment, we found ourselves a bit misaligned with our drug customers, and these are very important customers to us, and customers where we enjoy long-term relationships that are very important. We've been working very hard to come to a place where we're back in sync with those retailers. I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment any further, other than to say that we continue to work that.

So we do look at it by brand. We think there are breakthrough levels for different brands. So it is a granular question. And I could probably answer it if we had a lot more time in a very granular way. And we run the ROIs by brand as well. So we continue to look at the spend and are very pleased with the result that we're getting, and when you look at a top line growth rate like we had this quarter and starting to see base volume come back, we think we're pretty pleased with how the advertising’s working."

But I just wanted to get a sense of where you were in the first quarter, whether you thought the trend going to the balance of the year was conservative relative to your guidance and then also how we should think about the fixed cost absorption, the improvement there that's likely to come?"

We were up 14%. We have -- if you think about Easter carryover pricing, which was the end of the 2008, certainly the last part of the business that saw the price increase, it seems in the quarter, somewhere around a quarter to a third of our business, in terms of the Easter shipments as factory shipments go. So on a weighted basis, we took a 10% to 11% price increase, and it was on a third of the business in the quarter. So roughly do the math. You'll wind up with something in the 3% range on price as a contributor. We did talk, when we talked to you in the fourth quarter of last year, about some volume shifting out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter. So again, a couple of points of shift. And we would've expected to see our new product contribution from Pieces add a little bit to sales. And we would've expected international to add a little bit to sales. So our expectation going in would've been around that, the little bit of carryover pricing in the Easter shift, and then some new products and a little bit of international and foreign exchange gain. So kind of mid-single digits would've been our expectation. We had three, I think, places where we exceeded our expectations. One of them was the ramp-up of the new products, and the ACD and the distribution build probably added an extra point of growth in the quarter. We were a bit more efficient between growth and net. Our trade promotion efficiency was pretty good, but we were also very good with markdowns on saleables. As we continued to get our inventories in line, we continued to do a little bit better sweating down from growth to net, if you will. But then the rest of it is base volume. We have good base volume where we've invested. So in the brands we've invested advertising, particularly where we invested late in the year last year, but also at the customers in the retail outlets, so convenience, certain mass, and certain food accounts where we’ve put more retail and selling resources in, we saw very good volume gain in the first quarter. So as you carry forward into the year, we'll continue to expect to see the new products will contribute. And we continue to expect to see that now that we're lapped through the price increase, we'll get base volume. So I hope that kind of gives you an explanation of how we're thinking about the year. And then I'll let Bert talk a little bit about cost absorption."

As you think about the rest of the year, right now, we're thinking more in line with what we would have planned. And we planned for volume increase this year, as you would imagin, in terms of our total plan. We had some pricing coming into the year, and as you've already mentioned, that exhausted itself in the first quarter. So we were planning for volume increase. We got a bit more in the first quarter. We're looking out at the remaining quarters to be closer to the initial plans. And even with the shift that occurs at year end, that product is largely produced within 2010. So think of the shift not as an absorption shift, but more as a shift in sales, in terms of shipping. Overall, cost of goods is favorable in the first quarter for the number of the things which you've already mentioned, supply chain transformation being heavier in the first half, particularly the first quarter. We had better commodity year-on-year, which we do not expect in the remaining quarters. And our ongoing productivity is pretty spread out throughout the year. So that stays and has been coming in as we expected."

So what we're really doing is taking some of our brands where consumers are the most loyal and providing that flavor experience that we think our brands uniquely capture and providing that to them a different usage occasion. So when we take about how we segment the category, we really do look at it from the consumer's view. And then that's how we also position our brands and think about investment. So the category growth is robust. We've seen when you look at 52-week growth rates, we're up 7%. I think that as people invest in the category, us and others, including Mars, Wrigley, including Lindt and Ghiradelli and Kraft Cadbury, it's an expandable category. Consumers purchase it on impulse. So as people continue to invest in the category, the category will expand and grow, and we think that's a healthy thing. We're doing it based on a consumer view and brand view.

I think it's a combination of a couple of things. One of them is the category dynamic and the relationships. We are very proud of our relationships and have built those relationships over many, many years in convenience, with retailers, and so I think what's happened as we've gone through some bumps in the road and the economy is our relationships and the relationship the category has in that class of trade is very strong. We’ve continued to provide solutions. Again, I think some of the points that I mentioned, the highest or second highest margin category, and certainly the highest margin in the category is something that has velocity in the convenience stores. I mean, I think there’s probably higher margin in health and beauty but not a lot of that gets sold. So we're a high-margin category. We are a very good bundled category, if you will. Confections goes with a beverage oftentimes. So you can incent a higher dollar ring, if you will, when you can bundle confections together. And it's still a very much an impulse-oriented category. So in a world where your trips are precious, if you get -- if you’re worried about the number of trips you’re getting, you definitely want to have impulsive stuff right up close to the front of the register to take full advantage of those trips. So I think the category dynamics are very good. And then on top of it, the programming has been very good. I think we've all learned together, the retailers and us, particularly about what works and what doesn't work, what the right assortment is, where the aisle ought to be, so the category management expertise that, for example, Max has helped their retailers with has, I think, really started to pay off for the category in terms of making it a destination. So we're pleased with it. We’ve hung in there with it for years in terms of building those relationships. And I think it's really paying off for us."

So I understand that we have lapped the pricing. But I'm just trying to get an understanding on how we model out like these next three quarters.

We clearly over-delivered in the first quarter both on the top line and on the bottom line. And Q1 benefited from some of the really difficult but I think sound decisions that we made in prior months and years. So, for example, the change in our business model in terms of pricing, now that’s wind itself up, the August of ’08 pricing winds itself up in the first quarter, the global supply chain transformation largely winds itself up here in the first half. So we see we'll get the savings in the first half. And we start to benefit from the advertising that we've certainly been doing -- we’ve not started, we’ve continued to benefit from the advertising. So but when you look at the first quarter, we got good benefits from the global supply chain and the carryover pricing. Those things tend to wind themselves up in the front half. So we had really strong earnings delivery in the first part of the year, the first quarter. And it’ll carry over a little bit here going forward. But really good earnings here. The investment part where we're going to now take a look at based on the strength we have in the first quarter, reinvesting some of that earnings momentum, that investment comes in the second half of the year, where we're in a more normalized business model, if you will. So we're now more of a steady state model. Once we’re through the pricing and through the global supply chain transformation, we'll start to see a little bit more normalized volume, if you will, going forward once we’re through the price increase. And we will invest significantly in the back part of the year in advertising and in capabilities. So I think that's the way to think about it is a more normalized business model going forward with some pretty strong investments for the future."

I think what you're saying is that over the next three quarters, you still have massive investments going into advertising.

So we may be a little mismatched in terms of how the productivity flows into the P&L versus how some of the investment flows out. But I think overall, we're through the pricing from August of '08. We're starting to see the volumes return. I think, as I said, we're comfortable in that 3% to 5% long-term sales guidance that we have out there for the rest of the year. And then, again, I guess there's a little bit of a mismatch between the productivity and the margin expansion and then the expansion of SM&A.

And again, it's -- on a macro level what we've really done is invested in our brands in advertising and consumer promotion. We took the price increase in August of '08 because the commodity costs were very, very high and the profile had tried to change in a step-function way. So as part of that increase, we not only changed the list prices, we also saw promotional prices move up in the marketplace. So as -- part of that move up in promotional prices is needing less trade promotion on some levels to hit what would've been historically lower prices. So there's a little bit of that goes with the new pricing model and the pricing structure. But overall, it's so customer- and event-specific, Christine. I think we saw -- overall, we're spending more absolute dollars in promotion because we have just more volume. But on a rate basis, we did see an improvement in the first quarter.

It's kind of a natural evolution once you get through getting the big brands to the right place that you now go into other parts, as we talked about in the consumer demand landscape, and see how you can activate the brands. And we're pleased to date with it. But it's only a quarter’s worth of results, so we'll watch the ROIs carefully."

I guess you've spoken a bit about how much the increase in advertising is helping to drive some volume and has made your pricing effective. But I'm also just curious. I guess it was the fall of '07, you started to increase the size of your sales force, mainly in -- or at least especially in convenience stores. And I just have the impression that it really wasn't until last year that you've had a lot, most of these people fully trained and sort of in place and with all the tools they needed to do their job. So I guess my question is, first, how much of having just more feet on the street has made you more efficient in terms of promotions and ability to maybe be more efficient with your pricing and trade promotion? And then also in terms of reinvestment, is that on the table as well, sort of increasing the size of your sales force and making a bigger investment in your sales force?"

We think we're",410,"We continue to believe and have always believed that our selling capabilities, our sales force, if you will, so I’m talking not only about feet on the street but also our category management capabilities and our headquarters capabilities. We think we're very good within our category. And we think we're -- actually like to think of ourselves as pretty comfortable in consumer packaged goods because we had a pretty efficient cost, because we're so focused on one category, can deliver pretty good benefit. You're right, we started in '07 specific to retail, investing in certain classes of trade, mass, certain mass customers, a little bit in food and certainly quite a bit in convenience stores. We're at full complement, but we are also actually adding again this year in terms of in-store hours, so there is an investment in our -- if you look at our FM&A line, there is an investment inherent in that line this year for more sales coverage. It is paying out. One of the things that I would also tell you is it's not a static sales force, if you will. We can re-route that sales force on a monthly basis based on activities by customer, based on who's running promotional activity and where we need to sell at retail. And so we do that and we continue to look at how to continuously improve our routing to be more efficient and productive. And also, as the economy has shifted in the last 12 to 18 months, we’ve certainly shifted and kind of grown with the growing customers, if you will, and made sure that our resources are in the right place. So it is, I think, a strong competitive advantage for us and one that we continually invest in. And I think it makes the advertising investment that much more efficient and effective when you actually get to retail and the product that you're advertising is in the right spot with consumer promotion and merchandising vehicles that tie to the advertising. So the NCAA March Madness promotion, for example, we ran great Reese’s copy throughout March. And at store level, you saw walls of orange, if you will, when you came into the store in terms of display so that the consumer, once they got to the store, we could activate. So we think it works very well together. We've invested in both sets of capabilities and we’re going to continue to do that."

Maybe not to the level of the old Hershey Limited Edition strategy, but certainly they seem to be tried to stimulate new demand with new products, or at least we hear that’s going to happen with M&M's with pretzels in them and stuff like that. What that’s saying to me is the level of the new-product news seems to be happening in the wake of a period in which Hershey has been gaining share through sort of just advertising behind the core and having that virtuous cycle going. Do you think it's like appropriate for Hershey to just kind of stay the course here, very limited new product news for a while, and that this sort of cycle can continue? Or do you think it's appropriate maybe for Hershey to sort of fold in more new product news here through -- particularly the competition and perhaps the consumer being ready for it?"

And there's no one right answer. The answer for us right now -- I mean, we had a very strong first quarter coming off of a good year last year. The model is working. We continue to run the ROIs on all of the marketing mix, advertising, consumer promotion and trade promotion. So we'll continue to dial as we go along.

Hershey's first quarter results were strong and reflect the momentum of our core brand in the marketplace.

Hershey's first quarter results were strong and reflect the momentum of our core brand in the marketplace. The global investments we have made in marketing and selling capabilities are starting to pay off, and we see it in our reported results, retail takeaway and market share. While only three months into the year, this high-quality quarter has created the confidence in environment to allow us to deliver on both our financial objectives for 2010, while also making additional investments in our business. We'll have more on this in a bit.
In the first quarter, net sales increased 13.9%, driven by a balance of volume gains and price realization. Volume growth was the result of our execution in the marketplace and the ramp-up of investments in core-brand advertising and selling capabilities made over the last two years. 
Base business volume increased, especially in channels where we have focused resources, that’s C Stores, Food and select Mass customers. Price realization from carryover seasonal pricing also benefited the top line.
Recall that Easter performance also benefited from the previously mentioned shift in seasonal business from Q4 2009 into Q1 2010. Looking at our retail takeaway where we benefited slightly from the timing of an earlier Easter. Remember in 2010, Easter occurred on April 4, and in 2009, it was on April 12. Therefore, the reported IRI and Nielsen data as of March 20 excludes the last two weekends in the Easter period. Our custom database and internal estimates of the 12-week retail takeaway figure is closer to Easter and not yet released to you, are in line with our first quarter sales performance. We gained market share for the 12 weeks ended March 20, and while results are not yet final, Easter sell-through appears solid, and we will again gain market share in this key season.
I'm very pleased with Hershey's marketplace performance. Total CMG, that's Candy, Mint and Gum category retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending March 20 for our custom database in channels that account for over 80% of our retail business, so here I'm talking about Food, Drug, Mass including Wal-Mart and Convenience stores, that takeaway was up 7.5%. Excluding Wal-Mart, Hershey's FDMxC retail takeaway was up 6.1%. Both of these amounts include Easter seasonal sales. 
So if you look at excluding Easter sales, given the timing changes, so let's exclude it from the current year and the year-ago period, Hershey's FDMxC without Wal-Mart, retail takeaway was up 4%. We gain market share when you include Easter or exclude Easter. So both with and without Easter seasonal activity, we gained market share. All in, including the seasonal activity, Hershey category market share and FDMxC increased 0.5 points. Our marketplace results were solid and improved across all channels. We gained market share in all classes of trade except Drug, which as expected, was down but did improve versus last quarter.
Our marketplace performance was driven by the core brands we have focused on. Specifically, in FDMxC, the combined retail takeaway on Hershey's, Reese’s, Hershey's Bliss, Hershey's Kisses, Twizzlers and Kit Kat brands, and these are brands where ad spend is ongoing, takeaway increased about 10%. York, Almond Joy and Mounds, brands that we just started advertising in January, posted FDMxC retail takeaway up in the teens.
Looking at the category, CMG continues to grow within the historical 3% to 4% range. In FDMxC, excluding Wal-Mart, the category grew 4.4%. Excluding Easter seasonal activity in the current and year-ago periods, the category FDMxC was up 3.3%. And other than Valentine’s, there's not a lot of pricing in that number. Valentine's was a headwind for the overall category in the quarter. Total category sales for the Valentine’s season, the smallest of the four seasons, were down mid single digits, as gifting was particularly soft. The decline was primarily driven by the Drug channel, where Valentine’s category gifting sales declined double digits.
In the Food and Mass channels, Valentine’s category sales were about flat. Hershey's overall Valentine’s retail takeaway was down and resulted in a market share decline of slightly less than one point for the season.
Similar to the last few quarters, our marketplace results in measured channels were driven by our success in the Food and Convenience channels. The results are a function of the core-brand advertising and strong selling, retail execution and merchandising. In the Food class of trade, category growth was 8.1% including Easter, and a robust 7.3% excluding Easter seasonal activity from the current and year-ago periods. Hershey retail takeaway in this channel exceeded the category, both with and without Easter seasonal activity. Overall, this performance resulted in a 0.5 point market share gain in the Food channel.
Collectively, the core brands that we're supporting, such as Kit Kat, Reese's and Hershey's, drove this growth. And again, initially, we got very good early retail lift on York, Almond Joy and Mounds, driven by the new advertising copy I mentioned earlier. 
Well, now, I’ll talk to you about the C store class of trade, where the category was up 2.3%. In the first quarter, Hershey C store takeaway increased for the eighth consecutive quarter, and our takeaway was up 6.2%, resulting in a gain of one full share point. In the first quarter, Hershey C store chocolate and non-chocolate takeaway were up 9.1% and 5% respectively, driven by volume and mix. Strong in-store consumer promotions and merchandising drove balanced growth across the core brands.
We believe the confectionery category will continue to see growth in the C store channel, as confections remains a strategic focus for these retailers, considering that about 50% of candy purchases are made on impulse and that candy is the number-one category for cross-merchandising opportunities in convenience stores, with over 80% of candy purchases made in conjunction with another category. And candy remains very profitable, with the second-highest gross margin in the C store.
As we look to the remainder of the year, our effort will focus on core-brand growth across all channels. We will meaningfully add to and refine levels of advertising and support on many key brands. Our net sales, retail takeaway and ongoing ROI analysis demonstrate the soundness of our advertising investment. We have high-quality copy that is working, and it's made even more impactful when coordinated with in-store selling, programming and merchandising. This strategy will continue to drive our business. 
We have already benefited from the good programming I just mentioned. Again, this year, in the first quarter, our Reese’s NCAA Final Four basketball event was a big success. In the second quarter, Reese’s will be one of the main sponsors of the Iron Man 2 movie. We'll also kick off the summertime S’mores program in Q2 with Memorial Day promotions featuring Rascal Flatts. And just in time for summer movie releases, the Hershey Kisses brand will anchor our Kisses movie night, where we’re giving away a free movie ticket with multiple purchases of 10-ounce bags of Hershey's Kisses, Hershey's Miniature's, Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, York Peppermint Patties. 
I'm also pleased with the launch and rollout of our new products and more importantly, with the positive consumer reaction. In Q1, new products were a net positive for the first time in a number of years, contributing almost two points to our overall sales growth. The December launch of Almond Joy, Hershey's Special Dark and York Pieces is the primary driver of this growth. These results reflect our new innovation approach and discipline. Retailers were pleased with this lineup, and we achieved our distribution and trial targets faster than anticipated. 
Pieces will be supported throughout the year not only by product-specific advertising on Pieces, but also by advertising on the parent brands. We expect innovation to continue to be a top line driver and will follow up the Pieces launched with the December introduction of Reese’s Mini Minis and Hershey's Drops. 
As we’ve continued to demonstrate, we remain committed to doing the right things for the business in both the short and long term. The investments we have made are paying off, and that is reflected in our overall performance over the last 18 months.
Ace [ph] (32:18) business momentum in the first quarter was greater than we had expected. As such, we now have the flexibility to deliver on our financial objectives while also making additional investments in our business, both in the U.S. and internationally. Over the remainder of the year, primarily in the second half, we'll intensify our efforts on existing strategic projects related to consumer and customer insights, as well as category management techniques that will benefit the business over the long term. Additionally, advertising expense will now increase 35% to 40% in 2010. We'll increase advertising levels on some existing brands and in some geographies.
We'll also our test ROI thresholds, flighting techniques and expand our digital marketing capabilities. These additional investments were not included in the initial outlook we have provided on February 2. 
Now to wrap up. We're pleased with our Q1 performance. The strong start to 2010, similar to 2009, will fuel additional investment in the business in the second half of the year. We believe the additional investments we’ll make will ensure the category and Hershey continue to perform well over the remainder of the year and into 2011. The category continues to grow. We have now completely cycled the August 2008 pricing action, and we’re seeing base-volume growth. The overall macroeconomic environment appears to be getting better, albeit very slowly, but it is still difficult to predict consumer sentiment and purchasing patterns.
There are also some Valentine’s and Easter shifts out of Q4 2010 and into Q1 of 2011, and Bert Alfonso will give you more detail on this shortly. We see net sales growing comfortably within long-term 3% to 5% net sales target for the remainder of the year. So for the full year, we expect 2010 net sales growth of at least 6%, including an approximate one point benefit from foreign currency exchange rates.
For the full year, we have good visibility into our cost structure, and expect to achieve growth and EBIT margin expansion that will result in a low- to mid-teens increase in adjusted earnings per share diluted on a percentage basis versus 2009. This expectation includes plans to meaningfully invest in our business throughout the remainder of the year. I'll now turn it over to Bert, who will provide some additional financial detail."

First quarter results were better than our earlier expectations, with consolidated net sales of $1.4 billion, up 13.9% versus the prior year, generating diluted EPS of $0.64. The 68% EPS increase versus adjusted EPS from operations last year was driven by greater than anticipated base sales volume, net price realization and new manufacturing efficiencies. First quarter sales gains were driven primarily by balance volume increases in focused channels, new products, carryover seasonal pricing and price realization related to trade efficiency. 
Several factors contributed to the volumes gains, and these include base business volume that exceeded expectations driven by brand investments in retail trends discussed by Dave, the successful distribution and the launch of new products, which exceeded expectations and contributed about two points of growth, and the seasonal shift we communicated in our fourth quarter call in January, which moved volume from the fourth quarter of '09 to the first quarter of 2010. In addition, our International business was up and foreign currency exchange was about one point of benefit. 
We've already provided details related to our marketplace performance. However, again I remind you that Nielsen data as of March 20 excludes the last two weekends in the Easter period. For our custom database, the 12-week retail takeaway figures closer to Easter are in line with our first quarter factory shipments, leaving inventory at key distributors and retailers at desired levels. 
Turning now to margins, in the first quarter, adjusted gross margin increased 630 basis points. This was driven by net price realization; supply chain efficiencies, some of which is related to fixed cost absorption as volume was greater than year ago and better-than-expected versus our previous estimates, and lower commodity input costs of about 130 basis points. The favorable commodities are anomaly in the first quarter but are projected to be higher than prior year for the remaining quarters in 2010. We have good visibility into our cost structure and will achieve the expected 2010 goal of supply chain cost savings of $15 million to $25 million by the end of the second quarter. In addition, normal levels of productivity are on track, and we expect gross margin to expand for the full year 2010 but not at the rate realized in the first quarter.
EBIT margin increased 410 basis points in the first quarter, as higher gross margin was only partially offset by advertising, up 67%, or about 190 basis points; selling expenses as we added more U.S. in-store hours and continued to build global capabilities; higher employee-related costs; and legal costs and advisory services related to our consideration of the transaction with Cadbury. We are planning additional increases in advertising for the full year and expect advertising expense to increase 35% to 40% in 2010, which is greater than our previous estimate of 25% to 30%. Despite this increase, we expect EBIT margin to increase for the full year, driven by the first quarter gain, offset by higher investments that will primarily occur during the second half of the year.
Now let me provide a brief update on our International businesses. On a reported and constant-currency basis, net sales increased with solid performances in Canada, China, Mexico and Brazil. Excluding Canada, our international sales increased 14% on an organic basis including FX. This is in line with our five-year CAGR that we shared with you during CAGNY presentations. Profits increased in Canada but declined over the remainder of our International businesses, as we continue to make necessary investments to increase brand awareness and drive trial. 
Moving down to P&L. For the quarter, interest expense decreased slightly, coming in at $23.7 million versus $23.9 million in the prior period. This was due to lower average debt balances. In 2010, we expect interest expense to be approximately $90 million to $100 million. The tax rate in the first quarter was 35.8%, considerably less than a year ago, when the rate was 41.9% due to the timing of certain tax events. We continue to expect the full year tax rate to be about 35% and roughly 36% in the second quarter.
In the first quarter of 2010, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were $229.6 million versus $228.3 million in 2009, leading to EPS of $0.64 per share diluted. 
Now let me turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the first quarter, net trading capital decreased versus last year's first quarter, resulting in a net cash inflow of $65 million. Accounts receivable was up $80 million. The year-over-year increase was a direct result of higher sales and Easter timing. We continuously monitor our accounts receivable aging, and it remains extremely current and of high quality. Inventory declined by $91 million and accounts payable increased by $55 million. Over the last two years, we have made excellent progress on net working capital, and at this point in time, we would expect it to trend about at current levels for the remainder of the year.
In terms of other specific cash flow items, capital additions including software were $36 million. For 2010, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million, in line with previous communication. Depreciation and amortization was $47 million in the first quarter. And in 2010, we are forecasting total depreciation and amortization of $180 million. Dividends paid during the quarter were $71 million. We did not acquire any stock in the first quarter related to the current repurchase program, and there remains 100 $million outstanding on the authorization that the board approved in 2006. During the quarter, however, we did repurchase 64 million of our common shares in the open market to replace shares issued in connection with stock option exercises. 
Cash on hand at the end of the first quarter was $304 million, up $50 million versus the year-end balance. As it relates to our short-term cash needs, the company is currently well-positioned. Our cash flow continues to be strong and will improve as we grow earnings.
Now to summarize. In 2010, our goal is continue the current marketplace momentum. To support this objective, we'll continue to invest in our brand and businesses in both the U.S. and international markets. We'll focus our efforts on advertising, which we expect to increase 35% to 40%, as well as consumer insights and brand building initiatives that should enable the category and Hershey to grow this year and into 2011. As a result, we expect net sales growth for the full-year 2010 of at least 6%, including an approximate one-point benefit from foreign currency exchange rates. 
Despite commodity stock price volatility, we have good visibility into our 2010 cost structure and expect to achieve growth in EBIT margin expansion that will result in 2010 adjusted earnings per share diluted growth of low- to mid-teens on a percentage basis versus 2009.
Before we go to Q&A, as you work your model, let's consider some of the unique first quarter drivers, and there are many moving parts and factors affecting our business over the remainder of the year. To be more specific, as we exit the first quarter, we have completed and lapped the August 2008 pricing action. The first quarter volume benefited from a seasonal shift from the fourth quarter of 2009 into the first quarter of 2010. The December '09 to January 2010 seasonal shift in shipping patterns are likely to occur again at the end of this year with respect to Valentine and Easter. Also, Easter is later next year, April 24. As a result, we expect the seasonal shift from the fourth quarter of '10 to the first quarter of '11 to be greater than the shift that occurred this quarter, as we continue to refine seasonal orders and logistic requirements with our key customers. 
The launch of Reese’s Minis and Hershey’s Drops is scheduled for December to align ourselves with retailer shelf resets. The majority of the incremental brand building initiatives, which we mentioned, will occur in the second half of the year. We do not expect the first quarter commodity favorability to continue over the remainder of the year, nor do we expect the LIFO inventory accounting to be favorable in the fourth quarter of 2010 as it was in the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect favorable exchange-rate gains to decline each quarter as the year progresses. And finally, by the end of June, we expect to achieve all of the global supply chain transformation program savings that we mentioned. 
With all that out of the way, we'll now open it up for questions."

Perhaps, you could sort of speak for the category. Were you seeing a general sequential improvement in demand through the quarter and perhaps heading into this most recent month?

But so for the most part, we're pretty pleased with our business, and again, we really saw volume return in Convenience in a big way in the first quarter. With respect to Drug, we mentioned it before. As we had changed some of our go-to-market processes and some of the way we were approaching brand investment, we found ourselves a bit misaligned with our Drug customers. And these are very important customers to us, and customers where we enjoy long-term relationships that are very important. We've been working very hard to come to a place where we're back in sync with those retailers.

So we do look at it by brand. We think there are breakthrough levels for different brands. So it is a granular question. And I could probably answer it if we had a lot more time in a very granular way. And we run the ROIs by brand as well. So we continue to look at the spend and are very pleased with the result that we're getting, and when you look at a top line growth rate like we had this quarter and starting to see base volume come back, we think we're pretty pleased with how the advertising’s working."

But I just wanted to get a sense of where you were in the first quarter, whether you thought the trend going to the balance of the year was conservative relative to your guidance and then also how we should think about the fixed cost absorption, the improvement there that's likely to come?"

We were up 14%. We have -- if you think about Easter carryover pricing, which was the end of the 2008, certainly the last part of the business that saw the price increase, it seems in the quarter, somewhere around a quarter to a third of our business, in terms of the Easter shipments as factory shipments go. So on a weighted basis, we took a 10% to 11% price increase, and it was on a third of the business in the quarter. So roughly do the math. You'll wind up with something in the 3% range on price as a contributor. We did talk, when we talked to you in the fourth quarter of last year, about some volume shifting out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter. So again, a couple of points of shift. And we would've expected to see our new product contribution from Pieces add a little bit to sales. And we would've expected international to add a little bit to sales. So our expectation going in would've been around that, the little bit of carryover pricing in the Easter shift, and then some new products and a little bit of international and foreign exchange gain. So kind of mid-single digits would've been our expectation. We had three, I think, places where we exceeded our expectations. One of them was the ramp-up of the new products, and the ACD and the distribution build probably added an extra point of growth in the quarter. We were a bit more efficient between growth and net. Our trade promotion efficiency was pretty good, but we were also very good with markdowns on saleables. As we continued to get our inventories in line, we continued to do a little bit better sweating down from growth to net, if you will. But then the rest of it is base volume. We have good base volume where we've invested. So in the brands we've invested advertising, particularly where we invested late in the year last year, but also at the customers in the retail outlets, so Convenience, certain Mass, and certain Food accounts where we’ve put more retail and selling resources in, we saw very good volume gain in the first quarter. So as you carry forward into the year, we'll continue to expect to see the new products will contribute. And we continue to expect to see that now that we're lapped through the price increase, we'll get base volume. So I hope that kind of gives you an explanation of how we're thinking about the year. And then I'll let Bert talk a little bit about cost absorption."

As you think about the rest of the year, right now, we're thinking more in line with what we would have planned. And we planned for volume increase this year, as you would imagin, in terms of our total plan. We had some pricing coming into the year, and as you've already mentioned, that exhausted itself in the first quarter. So we were planning for volume increase. We got a bit more in the first quarter. We're looking out at the remaining quarters to be closer to the initial plans. And even with the shift that occurs at year end, that product is largely produced within 2010. So think of the shift not as an absorption shift, but more as a shift in sales, in terms of shipping. Overall, cost of goods is favorable in the first quarter for the number of the things which you've already mentioned, supply chain transformation being heavier in the first half, particularly the first quarter. We had better commodity year-on-year, which we do not expect in the remaining quarters. And our ongoing productivity is pretty spread out throughout the year. So that stays and has been coming in as we expected."

So what we're really doing is taking some of our brands where consumers are the most loyal and providing that flavor experience that we think our brands uniquely capture and providing that to them a different usage occasion. So when we take about how we segment the category, we really do look at it from the consumer's view. And then that's how we also position our brands and think about investment. So the category growth is robust. We've seen when you look at 52-week growth rates, we're up 7%. I think that as people invest in the category, us and others, including Mars, Wrigley, including Lindt and Ghiradelli and Kraft Cadbury, it's an expandable category. Consumers purchase it on impulse. So as people continue to invest in the category, the category will expand and grow, and we think that's a healthy thing. We're doing it based on a consumer view and brand view.

I mean, I think there’s probably higher margin in health and beauty but not a lot of that gets sold. So we're a high-margin category. We are a very good bundled category, if you will. Confections goes with a beverage oftentimes. So you can incent a higher dollar ring, if you will, when you can bundle confections together. And it's still a very much an impulse-oriented category. So in a world where your trips are precious, if you get -- if you’re worried about the number of trips you’re getting, you definitely want to have impulsive stuff right up close to the front of the register to take full advantage of those trips. So I think the category dynamics are very good. And then on top of it, the programming has been very good. I think we've all learned together, the retailers and us, particularly about what works and what doesn't work, what the right assortment is, where the aisle ought to be, so the category management expertise that, for example, Max has helped their retailers with has, I think, really started to pay off for the category in terms of making it a destination. So we're pleased with it. We’ve hung in there with it for years in terms of building those relationships. And I think it's really paying off for us."

We were pretty communicative in the CAGNY around our continued look into the marketplace, particularly in the international space, around being acquisitive and seeing if there are opportunities there.

So I understand that we have lapped the pricing. But I'm just trying to get an understanding on how we model out like these next three quarters. Given the guidance and the factors that you're seeing, it looks like it would be flat pricing and relatively good solid volume growth, 3-ish, 4-ish% volume growth and then you would get some margin expansion.

We clearly over-delivered in the first quarter both on the top line and on the bottom line. And Q1 benefited from some of the really difficult but I think sound decisions that we made in prior months and years. So, for example, the change in our business model in terms of pricing, now that’s wind itself up, the August of ’08 pricing winds itself up in the first quarter, the global supply chain transformation largely winds itself up here in the first half. So we see we'll get the savings in the first half. And we start to benefit from the advertising that we've certainly been doing -- we’ve not started, we’ve continued to benefit from the advertising. So but when you look at the first quarter, we got good benefits from the global supply chain and the carryover pricing. Those things tend to wind themselves up in the front half. So we had really strong earnings delivery in the first part of the year, the first quarter. And it’ll carry over a little bit here going forward. But really good earnings here. The investment part where we're going to now take a look at based on the strength we have in the first quarter, reinvesting some of that earnings momentum, that investment comes in the second half of the year, where we're in a more normalized business model, if you will. So we're now more of a steady state model. Once we’re through the pricing and through the global supply chain transformation, we'll start to see a little bit more normalized volume, if you will, going forward once we’re through the price increase. And we will invest significantly in the back part of the year in advertising and in capabilities. So I think that's the way to think about it is a more normalized business model going forward with some pretty strong investments for the future."

I think what you're saying is that over the next three quarters, you still have massive investments going into advertising. But we're not going to see that pricing component of it hit the top line in the next three quarters. So then that really has to come from somewhere, and that's why the earnings growth would get back to a much more normalized level. Would you agree with that statement?"

So we may be a little mismatched in terms of how the productivity flows into the P&L versus how some of the investment flows out. But I think overall, we're through the pricing from August of '08. We're starting to see the volumes return. I think, as I said, we're comfortable in that 3% to 5% long-term sales guidance that we have out there for the rest of the year. And then, again, I guess there's a little bit of a mismatch between the productivity and the margin expansion and then the expansion of SM&A.

So that's kind of the recurring theme, similar to kind of how we thought about investment last year. As we had good results through 2009, we continued to decide to reinvest some of that, and we did that throughout the balance of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. And we feel very good that that fourth quarter '09 investment certainly has gotten us out of the blocks pretty quickly here in '10.

So I think what we've really done is let our business model kind of settle its way out. And as I said, I think we’re -- as we get through first quarter here in 2010, from a supply-chain and a kind of go-to-market standpoint, we’re kind of through a lot of those moving parts. And I think the economy is getting a little bit better, although consumer sentiment may not show that all the time. So I think we're in a more normalized level.

I think showed an interesting chart at CAGNY in terms of how we’ve thought about shifting the mix of our spending between pull and push. And again, it's -- on a macro level what we've really done is invested in our brands in advertising and consumer promotion. We took the price increase in August of '08 because the commodity costs were very, very high and the profile had tried to change in a step-function way. So as part of that increase, we not only changed the list prices, we also saw promotional prices move up in the marketplace. So as -- part of that move up in promotional prices is needing less trade promotion on some levels to hit what would've been historically lower prices. So there's a little bit of that goes with the new pricing model and the pricing structure. But overall, it's so customer- and event-specific, Christine. I think we saw -- overall, we're spending more absolute dollars in promotion because we have just more volume. But on a rate basis, we did see an improvement in the first quarter.

And then also in terms of reinvestment, is that on the table as well, sort of increasing the size of your sales force and making a bigger investment in your sales force?"

We think we're",410,"We continue to believe and have always believed that our selling capabilities, our sales force, if you will, so I’m talking not only about feet on the street but also our category management capabilities and our headquarters capabilities. We think we're very good within our category. And we think we're -- actually like to think of ourselves as pretty comfortable in consumer packaged goods because we had a pretty efficient cost, because we're so focused on one category, can deliver pretty good benefit. You're right, we started in '07 specific to retail, investing in certain classes of trade, mass, certain mass customers, a little bit in Food and certainly quite a bit in Convenience Stores. We're at full complement, but we are also actually adding again this year in terms of in-store hours, so there is an investment in our -- if you look at our FM&A line, there is an investment inherent in that line this year for more sales coverage. It is paying out. One of the things that I would also tell you is it's not a static sales force, if you will. We can re-route that sales force on a monthly basis based on activities by customer, based on who's running promotional activity and where we need to sell at retail. And so we do that and we continue to look at how to continuously improve our routing to be more efficient and productive. And also, as the economy has shifted in the last 12 to 18 months, we’ve certainly shifted and kind of grown with the growing customers, if you will, and made sure that our resources are in the right place. So it is, I think, a strong competitive advantage for us and one that we continually invest in. And I think it makes the advertising investment that much more efficient and effective when you actually get to retail and the product that you're advertising is in the right spot with consumer promotion and merchandising vehicles that tie to the advertising. So the NCAA March Madness promotion, for example, we ran great Reese’s copy throughout March. And at store level, you saw walls of orange, if you will, when you came into the store in terms of display so that the consumer, once they got to the store, we could activate. So we think it works very well together. We've invested in both sets of capabilities and we’re going to continue to do that."

Maybe not to the level of the old Hershey Limited Edition strategy, but certainly they seem to be tried to stimulate new demand with new products, or at least we hear that’s going to happen with M&M's with pretzels in them and stuff like that. What that’s saying to me is the level of the new-product news seems to be happening in the wake of a period in which Hershey has been gaining share through sort of just advertising behind the core and having that virtuous cycle going. Do you think it's like appropriate for Hershey to just kind of stay the course here, very limited new product news for a while, and that this sort of cycle can continue? Or do you think it's appropriate maybe for Hershey to sort of fold in more new product news here through -- particularly the competition and perhaps the consumer being ready for it?"

And there's no one right answer. The answer for us right now -- I mean, we had a very strong first quarter coming off of a good year last year. The model is working. We continue to run the ROIs on all of the marketing mix, advertising, consumer promotion and trade promotion. So we'll continue to dial as we go along.

Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty.
Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2009 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on the corporate website, www.hersheys.com, in the Investor Relations section. 
Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP, within the note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP.  
As we said within the notes, the company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP, rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. 
We will discuss our second quarter 2010 results excluding pretax charges. The 2010 charges related to the Project Next Century and the Godrej Hershey goodwill impairment charge, while the 2009 charges are associated with the Global Supply Chain Transformation program. These pretax charges were $86.2 million in the second quarter of 2010 and $42.7 million in the second quarter of 2009. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Dave West."

Net sales increased a strong 5.3% and adjusted earnings per share grew 18.6% as core brand continue to perform well in the marketplace. These high-quality results are driven primarily by volume, regained U.S. market share in the second quarter and are pleased with how our brands continue to respond to the investments we made. 
Overall, the Confectionary category remains healthy, increasing at the high end of its historical growth rate. Investments in the category in the form of advertising and/or innovation are present from most major manufacturers. Given the high household penetration and the impulsivity of the category, as well as affordable price points, we believe retailers will continue to value the Confectionary category. As a result, we would expect the category to continue to consistently secure key merchandising space and programming. 
As reported in the IRI and Nielsen's syndicate data, our U.S. retail takeaway and market share performance for the most part has been balanced across channels. Growth has predominantly been driven by volume gains as consumers have migrated to higher retail price points. This is allowing us to continue to be efficient with our trade promotion dollars, as trade promotion rate was about flat versus year ago during the quarter. Similar to Q1, this is better than our initial expectations. This is noteworthy in the context of the volume gains we've achieved in 2010. 
Now let's take a look at retail takeaway. The IRI and Nielsen data in the second quarter encompasses the period from March 21 to June 12. In 2010, Easter occurred on April 4, and in 2009, on April 12. While the first quarter of this year benefited slightly from an earlier Easter, the timing did not materially impact our second quarter marketplace performance. In fact, we gained share in both the first and second quarters. My remarks related to marketplace performance include seasonal data in all periods. 
We're pleased with Hershey's marketplace progress. Total U.S. CMG, that's candy, mint and gum, or total category retail takeaway for the year-to-date period through June 12, for the custom database in channels that account for over 80% of our Retail business, so here, I'm talking about food, drug and mass, including Wal-Mart and convenient stores, so on a year-to-date basis, was up 5.6%. Excluding Wal-Mart, Hershey's year-to-date FDMxC retail takeaway is up 5.1%. 
Hershey's second quarter retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending June in FDM, including Wal-Mart and convenience, was up 4%. Excluding Wal-Mart, Hershey's FDMxC retail takeaway was up 4.1% in the 12 weeks. 
The launch and rollout of new items such as Pieces is progressing nicely. And in the second quarter, again, new products were a net positive to the top line, about a one point contribution to our overall net sales growth. We gain market share on all classes of trade, except drug, which, as expected, was down but sequentially improved for the second quarter in a row. 
Hershey's seasonal Easter retail takeaway increased, up 6.7% and sell-through was solid, as we gain Easter market share of 1.3 points. Our market share in the ski season expanded to over 37%. 
Similar to the last few quarters, our performance was driven by the core brands upon which we are focused. Specifically, in FDMxC, the combined retail takeaway in Hershey's, Reese's, Hershey's Bliss and Hershey's Kisses, Twizzlers and Kit Kat brands increased mid-single digits. York, Almond Joy and Mounds, brands that we have just started advertising in January, posted FDMxC retail takeaway up in the low-double digits, excluding the Pieces' new products. 
Now for some further details. In the food class of trade, confection category growth was 5.4% in the second quarter. Hershey's retail takeaway in this channel exceeded the category, driven by chocolate, up 7.7% and non-chocolate, up 5.9%, resulting in a total market share gain of 0.5 points in the food channel. 
In the convenience store class of trade, the CMG category growth rate accelerated in the second quarter, as the category grew 3.3% versus 2.3% in the first quarter. In the second quarter, Hershey's Easter takeaway increased for the ninth consecutive quarter and was up 5.4%, resulting in a market share gain of 0.5 points. 
In the second quarter, Hershey's C Store chocolate and non-chocolate takeaway was up 8% and 4.5% respectively, driven by volume and mix as both standard, loose and king-size pack types perform nicely. Strong in-store merchandising and programming, driven by the Ironman movie tie-in and the Coca-Cola and Reese's joint promotion, drove balanced growth across core brands. 
We believe the category will continue to grow in C Stores. Category dynamics, as well as investments by CMG category participants, continues to drive variety, news and excitement and thus, category growth. 
As we have exited the second quarter, the targeted number of C Store associates were on board to deliver the overall 8% increase in in-store hours that we plan for 2010. As a result, we expect our C Store business to maintain its momentum in the second half of the year. 
Looking at the overall category, CMG continues to grow within its historical range, that's 3% to 4%. In FDMxC, here, excluding Wal-Mart, the CMG category grew 3% and 3.9% respectively in the second quarter and year-to-date. We are gaining share with our roughly 4% takeaway. 
Hershey marketplace performance is tracking nicely and selling, and merchandising initiatives are in place for the second half of the year. In pace of category of new product introductions in the marketplace is picking up in 2010, that the mix of in-and-out products, as well as permanent items. We have concentrated on the latter permanent items and feel very good about our base business, current new product performance and our upcoming December launches. 
As we look at the remainder of year, we'll continue to focus on the strategic whole-model initiatives that are driving the business. This include in-store focus to sell and display activity, new innovation on our Reese's and Hershey's franchises, increases and greater frequency of quality merchandising and programming, and further core-brand advertising investments.  
I'm pleased that the merchandising and programming in place for the third quarter, including to name just a few, the Reese's LOVES YOU BACK promotion, where we'll be giving away up to $2 million in cash prices. Consumers went instantly as they open specially marked Reese's product and include the game Piece worth $25 or $100. 
With the Twizzlers, are Irresistible Summer promotion to win money towards a summer vacation and they have the combined Almond Joy and Mounds contest to win a grand prize trip to the Caribbean, and we will continue our summertime S'mores programming, as well as the launch of our Halloween programs. 
During the Global Sweets and Snacks Expo in Chicago at the end of May, Reese's Mini Minis and Hershey's Drops were broadly displayed. Customers are excited about the December launch of these new products, which will be available at both the king-sized instant consumable items as well as a resealable stand-up pouch. 
We continue the strategic work we discussed related to Insights Driven Performance or IDP. We are engaged in working with select retailers to understand their specific opportunities and how to jointly leverage them to our proprietary business techniques, capabilities and category management insights. 
Additionally, advertising expense will now increase 45% to 50% in 2010. This is greater than our previous estimate of a 35% to 40% increase. Due to timing, the majority of this advertising will not be broadcast until later in the year, and we expect this impact on net sales to occur primarily in 2011. This pattern of investment is similar to what that which we executed in the later part of 2009 and which has clearly aided our strong start to 2010. 
Lower-than-planned trade promotion expense and earlier-than-expected achievement of a portion of the productivity savings discussed at CAGNY Conference in February, both of which we largely achieved in the second quarter, will offset a portion of this additional 2010 advertising investment. The acceleration of advertising in 2010 allows us to reach desired on-air continuity levels on many U.S. brands faster than our initial expectations. It also enables us to invest at higher levels in key international markets. 
While it is premature to offer specific 2011 details, we expect advertising to be up year-over-year in 2011, however, not nearly at the level of the last couple of years. The brand investments we've made have traveled well internationally. Where we have made investments internationally, our brands are responding.
Following macroeconomic challenges of last year, our business in Mexico is performing well this year and our business in Brazil, which underline a restructuring in late 2008 and 2009, is performing nicely, as is, our business in China. We continue to grow in India, although we have not gained traction as quickly as we planned. The Indian market remains a strategic growth market for the company. 
The non-cash goodwill impairment charge we announced today reflects revised and achievable growth targets for the business. They have been developed given the increases in local input cost, primarily sugar, the macroeconomic environment, which slowed distribution expansion plans and the slower implementation of products targeted at new price points that we had planned when we enter the joint venture in 2007. We will continue to apply our global confectionary know-how and strong balance sheet and cash flow to actively invest in India and other existing international markets, as well look for new opportunities in key strategic geographies. Our flexibility to acquire, and our partner leaves us with many potential opportunities, which we will pursue in a disciplined manner. 
Let me wrap up. Our brand continue to perform well in the marketplace. We have solid relationships with retailers in all channels, including select mass customers and value formats. Recently, we received Supplier of the Year Awards from a large mass customer and a national convenience store for the economic value that Hershey brings to the retailer and consumer. We will continue to build on these relationships. 
The CMG category continues to grow and it is being driven by volume gains. Macroeconomic challenges still exist. However, we feel good about the prospects as the Confectionary category is unique. It's highly impulsive, it's a destination category, especially in the second half of the year. It's expandable and profitable for the retailer and affordable for the consumer. 
There are some seasonal shifts out of Q4 2010 into Q1 of 2011, and Bert will have more on this shortly. Despite the shift, the brand-building investment initiatives we have in place are expected to drive net sales growth at the top end of our long-term net sales target for the balance of the year. Therefore, for the full year 2010, we expect net sales growth of about 7%, including an approximate one point benefit from foreign currency exchange rates. 
For the full year, we have good visibility into our cost structure, and expect to achieve adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBIT margin expansion that will result in adjusted earnings per share diluted in the $2.47 to $2.52 range, an increase of the low- to mid-teens on a percentage basis versus 2009. I'll now turn it over to Bert, who will provide some more detailed financial information."

Hershey post another quarter of quality results as second quarter consolidated net sales of $1.233 billion increased 5.3% versus the prior year and adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.51, increase",2144,"Well, thank you, Dave, and good morning to everyone. Hershey post another quarter of quality results as second quarter consolidated net sales of $1.233 billion increased 5.3% versus the prior year and adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.51, increased 18.6%. Overall, results were driven by sales volume increases, price realization from lower U.S. markdown, list price realization outside of the U.S. and supply-chain savings. These items more than offset higher input costs, increased marketing investments and a higher effective tax rate of 37.7%, that was 940 basis points above last year's second quarter. 
Investment spending in the latter part of last year has resulted in a good start in 2010 as demonstrated by our financial results in the IRI and Nielsen market share data. Similar to last year, solid first half results have given us the financial flexibility to increase brand building initiatives in the second half of 2010, while delivering on our previously communicated financial commitments. 
From a margin perspective, the year has progressed slightly ahead of expectation. And as we communicated during the first quarter call, full year adjusted gross and EBIT margin expansion will be driven primarily by first half results. Over the remainder of the year, our adjusted gross margin will improve at a slower rate, as we have now achieved all of the global supply chain transformation savings, lastly August 2008 price increase and expect input cost to be higher in the back half compared to last year. Adjusted EBIT margin will be slightly down in the second half of the year, reflecting increases related to various growth initiatives, including advertising and investments in go-to-market capabilities as well as our work in IDT. 
In addition to that, second half of the year will be impacted by sales mix, as this period is driven more by seasonal SKUs and take-home pack types that have a somewhat lower margins than our instant consumable brand. I'll provide further details related to the outlook in my closing remarks. Overall, we're pleased with our financial and marketplace performance, given the volatile commodity markets and the continuing pressures facing consumers. 
Now for some of the details. The second quarter sales gain of 5.3% was driven primarily by U.S. core brand volume increases, new products, lower returns and markdowns and growth in our International businesses. Favorable foreign currency exchange also contributed approximately one point of growth. We also shift slightly less Halloween in the second quarter of 2010 versus 2009, impacting the top line by about one point. 
During the second quarter, adjusted gross margin increased 540 basis points, driven primarily by sales mix, supply-chain efficiencies, some of which are related to fixed-cost absorption as volume was greater than a year ago and supply-chain productivity improvements. These margin gains were partially offset by higher input costs of about 60 basis points, reflecting total consolidated cost increases for raw materials and packaging. We have good visibility into our cost structure for the remainder of the year and expect continued adjusted gross margin expansion in 2010, although at lower rates than year-to-date. 
Second half adjusted gross margin expansion was slow as a result of input costs are expected to be higher, mix has impacted to the higher seasonal pack types versus Q1 and Q2, trade promotion efficiencies expected to subside, given the higher seasonal merchandising in the back half and we do not expect LIFO inventory accounting to be favorable as it was in Q4 2009, which at that time contributed about $12 million. 
Second quarter adjusted income before interest and income taxes increased 32.2% resulting in adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 350 basis points to 17.1% from 13.6% last year. This was driven primarily by higher adjusted gross margin, partially offset by higher advertising expense of about 50% or 200 basis points. Selling expenses and other marketing expenses as we added more U.S. in-store hours and continue to build global capabilities and hire employee-related administrative and legal cost. 
As Dave stated earlier, we continue to invest in our core brand and expect full year advertising expense to increase from 45% to 50% in 2010, and this is greater than the previously communicated estimate of 35% to 40%. 
Due to timing, the majority of the added advertising, we'll broadcast in the latter half of the year, therefore we expect it to have a greater impact on net sales in 2011. But despite these advertising increases, as well as the timing of other growth initiatives, we expect adjusted EBIT margins to increase for the full year, although it will be slightly lower than 2009 and the remainder of 2010. We believe that business investments we are making will enable us to maintain momentum as we close out 2010 and enter 2011. 
Now let me provide an update on our International businesses. On a reported and constant-currency basis, net sales increased in our key international markets, including Canada, Mexico, India and Asia. Overall, our referred international sales increased low-double digits. 
On a reported basis, including FX, where profitability improved across the majority of our international markets in Q2, we're going to continue the necessary investments in increasing brand awareness and driving trial, including higher advertising in Q3 and Q4 in certain international markets. 
The Godrej Hershey joint venture remains a focus business and is a strategic growth market. We entered India in 2007, when global financial markets were more positive and business valuations were generally richer. But the change in global macroeconomic environment, we have adjusted our plans for in-country expansion, the implementation of new price points, the launch of new products and portfolio rationalization. We believe that the revised outlook is more inline with how we see the business going forward, although it does require us to record a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $45 million or $0.20 per share diluted. 
Despite this charge, this has not changed how we feel about the business or the Indian market. Going forward, we plan to apply some of the same consumer-oriented demand landscape learning that we have successfully executed in the U.S. and other markets including India. 
Now moving down to P&L. For the quarter, interest expense is relatively flat coming in at $22.8 million versus $22.7 million for the period. For the full year 2010, we expect interest expense to be in the $90 million to $95 million range. Adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was 37.7% due to the timing of certain tax events and the related accounting, although we continue to expect the full year tax rate to be about 35%. 
In the second quarter of 2010, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were $230.3 million versus $228.5 million in 2009, leading to adjusted earnings per share, diluted of $0.51, up 19% versus year ago. 
Now let me to provide you a quick recap of the year-to-date adjusted results. Net sales increased 9.7% in the first half, adjusted gross margin was 43.2% year-to-date versus 37.4% last year or 580 basis points higher. Gains were driven primarily by sales mix, net price realization, productivity improvement and supply-chain efficiencies. Adjusted income before interest and income taxes increased 40%, resulting in EBIT margin gain of 380 basis points to 17.6% from 13.8%, and advertising increased 59% year-to-date and earnings per share, diluted in the first half, increased 42% to $1.15 per share. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the second quarter, net trading capital decreased versus last year's second quarter resulting in a cash inflow of $16 million. Accounts receivable was up $49 million, and we continuously monitor our accounts receivable aging, which remains extremely current and of high quality. Inventory declined by $39 million and accounts payable increased by $25 million. 
In terms of other specific cash flow items, capitalizations, including software, were $39 million in the quarter. For 2010, we are targeting total capitalizations to be in the $190 million to $210 million range. This range includes base business CapEx of about $150 million, plus project and expense-free CapEx of approximately $55 million. Depreciation and amortization was $46 million in the second quarter, including accelerated depreciation of approximately $1 million. Therefore, operating depreciation and amortization was $45 million. 
For the full year 2010, we are forecasting total operating depreciation and amortization of $175 million to $185 million, while accelerated depreciation and amortization related to Project Next Century is estimated to be $10 million to $15 million. 
Dividends paid during the quarter were $71 million. We did not acquire any stock in the second quarter related to the current repurchase program and there remains $100 million outstanding in that authorization. During the quarter, we did repurchase $69 million of our common shares in the open market to replace shares issued in connection with stock-option exercises. And year-to-date, approximately $133 million of common shares have been repurchased to replace shares issued in connection with stock-option exercises. 
Cash on hand at the end of the second quarter was $249 million. This was up significantly versus year-ago period and relatively in line with the 2009 year-end balance. As we exit the second quarter, we are well positioned to manage the seasonal working capital needs of the business, which speak in the third quarter, as well as higher capital expenditure requirements related to the Project Next Century. 
Now let me provide an update on Project Next Century. The forecast for total pretax GAAP charges and non-recurring project implementation cost remains at $140 million to $170 million. Note that this morning's press release appendix was updated to reflect the most current thinking and the expected timing of events. Specifically, we now expect to record $75 million to $85 million program charges in 2010. While this is a $25 million increase versus our initial estimate, you'll note that 2011 and 2012, there is a combined $25 million decrease. The changes due to the accounting timing of racked severance-related costs and does not change the timing of cash flow for the project. We're moving forward with our plan to have initiated construction in West Hershey, where our new facility will be built. While difficult, decisions made were necessary to ensure that Hershey has a flexible and cost-competitive supply chain. Savings from the project will give us the flexibility to make investments that will deliver core business growth and position us for the long-term success in the competitive confectionary marketplace. 
By 2014, ongoing annual savings are expected to be approximately $60 million to $80 million, and in terms of timing, savings from Project Next Century will not be realized until late 2011, with the majority coming in 2012 and 2013. 
Now let me summarize. Our goal for the second half of the year is to maintain our marketplace momentum as we exit 2010 and enter 2011. To support this objective, we plan to increase full year advertising expense by 45% to 50%. In addition, we will continue to invest in consumer insights and brand-building initiatives, as well as selling and go-to-market capabilities in the U.S., as well as other markets. 
Therefore, we expect full year net sales to increase about 7%, including an approximate one point benefit from foreign exchange. While stock prices for some of our major commodities continue to fluctuate, we have good visibility into our cost structure for the remainder 2010, and expect gross margin expansion during the remainder of the year, although not at the same rate realized during the first half. We expect adjusted EBIT margin to increase for the full year and adjusted earnings per share diluted in the $2.47 to $2.52 range on a percentage increase of low to mid teens versus 2009. 
Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to summarize some unique items that impact our financial results in the second half. And as you work on your models, please note the following: We expect a shift in seasonal shipping patterns from Q4 2010 into Q1 2011 to be greater than the similar shift that occurred at the end of last year. This will impact top line by a couple of points in the fourth quarter of 2010. Favorable trade promotion expenses should have abate going forward, as the second half of the year is driven by higher seasonal sales, which by nature, are more heavily merchandised. 
In Q4 2009, LIFO inventory accounting was favorable and we do not expect this to repeat in 2010. As we've discussed, the revised advertising increase in Q3 and Q4, but also recall that investments in category management, selling capabilities and other global growth initiatives are also back-half weighted. Higher than earlier expected achievement of a portion of productivity savings discussed at CAGNY Conference in February will offset some of the higher-brand investments in the back half of the year. And finally, we continue to expect full year tax rate to remain at about 35%. We'll now open it up for Q&A."

It's a little premature for us during the mid-year to talk a lot about 2011. But what we did say is that our gross margin expansion was a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be, and some of that clearly comes from the better volumes. So that's giving us a better absorption rate to our factories. We've also had some lower markdowns. And that's helped as our seasonal sales have been better. And clearly, what we are seeing is a continuation of good productivity with our normal continuous improvement programs, but the second quarter, in particular, benefited from some of the productivity that we talked about at CAGNY. At CAGNY, we talked about realizing $80 million to about $100 million over the next two to three years, primarily in non-packaging and non-raw material areas. And so that includes logistics and other services, and we've had more traction on that in the second quarter than we expected. And so that's coming in a little bit faster in the year and giving us a better gross margin year-to-date. In the back half, one thing we wanted to be clear on is that we do continue to expect gross margin to expand in Q3 and Q4, and obviously for the year, but it would not be at the rates that we've seen in the first half of the year. With respect to commodities, we did mention that commodity increases do happen throughout the year. If you recall the first quarter call, we actually had a favorable commodity in terms of the way we accounted for dairy one year versus another, but we've seen commodity increases in the second quarter versus last year and that continues throughout the year and certainly dairy is one component of that, that continues. In terms of the cocoa news that you've seen, obviously, we followed very closely. We think it's unusual. Obviously, a very large purchase of beans by a hedge fund that otherwise would normally purchase financial products versus the commodity itself. Our commodities remain very volatile right now and we're starting to gain some visibility towards 2011, and we'll certainly be providing more information on that as the year progresses."

I would have probably would have filed an 8-K and I would've known. With respect to Mars, Wrigley and actually within the category, I think what you're seeing is increases in innovation, particularly you're seeing some of the competitors in chocolate, some of the other competitors in chocolate are a little more focused on some in-and-out type innovation. We are at focus a little bit more on permanent items, but within the chocolate part of the business we're seeing a little bit more innovation. And then in gum, between Cadbury and Wrigley, there is some innovation and some pretty good activity there. So we are seeing innovation pickup. I mean, we believe overall that's helping drive category growth rate in some of the volume in the category. As we look to the rest of the year, it becomes a seasonal -- seasons become a larger part of the equation and it's a destination category across -- but everybody in the category tends to benefit from the destination nature of Halloween and holiday. So our overall, we're seeing good gross margin expansion, we're seeing volume in the category, we're seeing better-than-historical category growth rates. So right now, we feel pretty good about how the category overall is positioned and most of the majors are holding their own and enjoying some pretty good growth."

So you're starting to see some, at least on some moderation in the Premium and the Trade Up segments. But most of the growth and most of the attention from the retailer and consumer remains in the mainstream segment. So from a programming standpoint and the actual current investment, you're seeing us really focus on mainstream right now, because we think that's where the bang to the bucket and that's where consumers and retailers are going.

I mean, we bought that business and went into the joint venture in 2007 at a time when marketplace expectations on a number of fronts, including overall market growth rates, commodity markets, financial markets. We're at a very different place. And so as I think about when we set the initial assumptions for evaluation of that business, we set it up at a time in 2007  when I think there are a lot of frothy expectations around a number of things. Our key expectations of that business -- the two areas, I think the two biggest is where we fall in short from a  marketplace standpoint was the brand themselves where and still are to a large extent, it's sugar confectionery brands, household names. In certain regions, we are expecting to get national a lot more quickly distribution-wise. And then the other thing is we were hoping through innovation to get to higher price points, by giving the consumer innovations. So moving off of the half a rupee price point and our rupee price point and up. And given some of the macroeconomic issues that proved to be a little bit harder than we initially expected. And then when you layer in on top of that the poor Indian sugar crop over the last 18 months, those three factors, I think, were where we missed in the model. The business is still growing. We're starting to see our plans in terms of getting the cost structure right, and the commodity market coming back. So while we're short of the initial expectations and the timeframe they were set, it still remains a growth market for us but I wouldn't read in anything competitively. Again, it's in the sugar confectionery part of the marketplace, not where Cadbury would have a strong chocolate position per se. So I would say it's a little bit more about how we set expectations for the business and we're able to execute. And I would say that that's not necessarily a marketplace phenomenon. It was more our inability to get some certain of the assumptions done."

If you remember back in the first quarter, we actually had trade promotion rate below prior year. So we actually had two to three points of growth in the first quarter net sales that were related to having lower trade promotion rates. In the second quarter, our trade promotion rate versus year ago was roughly flat. And so we weren't lower, but it was better than our expectations going into the quarter. So for the first half, we have better trade promotion efficiency. As we get into the back part of the year, we're looking for -- that's probably not going to be the case. And if you think about it, it makes some sense because the second half of the year for us is much more merchandising intensive given the seasonal nature of the business. So I think what you're seeing from us, realistically, is we are investing in new items and were investing in our existing core brands with advertising. So our base velocities are increasing. And so when you look at the mix of base versus promoted, you're seeing us do a much better job with base and therefore on a relative basis, not as much promoted. And so I think that's one of the things in the category. And then the other thing is the category. Because it is such a destination category, we're going to continue to get good merchandising. And that's just a factor where that historically of it, the retailer knows that it's a consumer destination and we're going to get our level of display. And so I think it's just one of those virtues of the category."

In the first quarter, we were up roughly 14% on the top line. We said half of that was price-related, so it's less price plus the trade promotion efficiency and a little bit of foreign exchange. So seven of the 14 then we realistically had in the first quarter, 7% volume. 2% of it is was a shift from '09 into '10 related to seasons. And then we got new products and base velocities that added up to about 5%. So our new products were a couple of points and base velocity is around 3%. That was the first quarter. Here the second quarter, we're up roughly 5%. Trade efficiency and foreign exchange add a point or two. And so when you look at base velocities, it's again around 3% to 4%. And we shipped a little less Halloween in the second quarter than we normally would, so base velocity between the new items are still that roughly 3% to 4%, same as they would have been in the first quarter. And then if you look at the second half of year, we don't expect to get any of the trade promotion or pricing efficiency that we got in the first half. We're talking about being close to the top end of our 3% to 5% long-term range for the back half of the year. So that would imply, again, the same kind of 4% to 5% from base volume in new items. Remember, we have the two new items in the back part of year on pipeline, which will be the Reese's Mini Minis and the Hershey's Drop. So I think throughout the year, you're going to see similar volume trends facing you across the balance of the year. And then the difference really is in the first half.

Food grew very nicely, so I think as you listen to the conference calls and other talk out there in the market, there seems to be a little bit of a shift back towards food and closer to home shopping a little bit more of the traditional pattern. Convenience store trips were up. As the quarter went on, we saw a nice improvement in convenience store traffic through the quarter. And then I think our Drugstore business is improving albeit slowly. So I think overall, that there was probably a little bit of a shift and it's consistent with what you would read externally in the news about kind of some of the traffic moving from mass and food being up a little bit. Convenience continues to look good. And then the drug and the club store, the dollar in club classes of trade continue to be very good. Our relationships at the major mass retailers continue to be very good. We did win an award at Wal-Mart for one of the more toward adding value to the consumer within. So we feel good about the relationships and overall the category growth rates still remains pretty good."

Our first half sales growth rate is close to 10%. And we think that's reflective of really kind of getting fairly strong and aggressive in terms of our advertising spend in the latter part of last year",612,"Let me characterize it in kind of two different ways. Our first half sales growth rate is close to 10%. And we think that's reflective of really kind of getting fairly strong and aggressive in terms of our advertising spend in the latter part of last year. But particularly heavying up on some brands like Reese's and Kit Kat late in the year. Getting prepared, doing the preproduction work on brands like Pieces, Almond Joy, Mounds and York, and getting them on air right out of the gate in January of this year. So we think that leaning in to the advertising spend in the back half of last year is a large reason why we've been able to grow strongly in the first half of this year. And so we originally when we started the year, we're looking at growth rates on the top line within our the historical 3% to 5% rate. We're now closer to something around 7%. So if you think about the upside, which has really occurred here in the first half and then as we look to the rest of the year to the higher range of the 5%, we think that's really a lot about the way we've invested in the brand, the new brands particularly. And so as we've generated that favorability, if you will, if you think about the difference between the original 3% to 5% and about 7%, a lot of that would essentially have fallen through because our EPS when we started thinking about the year was in the 6% to 8% range. And now we're in the mid-teens range. What is a little bit more virtuous to us is the fact that not only have we gotten that top line, we've also got the productivity gains and a little bit more trade promotion efficiencies faster. So we've been very favorable in the gross margin versus our initial expectations in the first half, and what we're doing with that favorability is investing it. So the top line favorability if you think about it, let's say, it's fallen through but the gross margin favorability we've decided. We've got gross margin favorability in the first half, we're investing it in SM&A programming in the second half with the belief that we're still getting good ROI on our marketing spend. And therefore, as you continue to virtually circle and help up us get cold 10 facts and get off to a good start on the top line in '11, we're going to go heavier getting towards continuity programming on a lot of the brands we're already on. So some of the brands we started such as the York and Mounds and Almond Joy, looking at the copy on some other brands starting digital and getting from international spending going here in the latter part of the year, we're getting to those continuity levels on those brands a lot faster. So as I said in my remarks, as we look forward into next year, you should see a much more normalized level because we've gotten a lot of the brands on air and to continuity levels a lot faster. But we think at this point in time, it's the right time to do it. At the time when the consumer is looking towards our category for value and some indulgence and when retailers are looking forward to us because we have a relatively attractive entry price points and we're a destination category, we think it's the right time for us to invest into the brand. And so far, so good. We are seeing good ROIs and so we think it's the appropriate thing to do."

They embrace that business model, and then when we kind of step back and relook at the business model and went much more towards a poor-oriented advertising based system, that didn't match up as well with their go-to-market strategy. And so while we got great traction in some other places as we move more towards the full strategy, the one class of trade where our business model was out of step with what they were trying to do within drug. We took a period of correction as we took a lot of items out of the system and have managed our way through that. There's also a class of trade where we don't have retail coverage, so it's a little hard for us to correct for the new business model and get the retail right as quickly as we normally would've like to. We still have very good relationships. These are large customers. It's turning sequentially for us. We're feeling good about the direction we're headed in.

We think we're getting our penetration rate higher on most of the brands in our portfolio. That's the long-term healthier situation for us to be in. Innovation is starting to be [ph] and a lot of the competitors are coming into the market with innovation, which we think because of the way the category works, it's an expandable category and the consumer has a number of brands that are acceptable to them on the menu. We think that those kind of things will expand the category. And so this is not a category because of the expandable on the way it gets merchandised. It's not a zero-some gain kind of a category. So we think that it is a way that we could see category growing at greater than historical 3% to 4% growth rates in the U.S. business. But again, everything is against a macroeconomic backdrop of consumer confidence as well as retailers. There's a lot of retail channel issues and blurring out there. And so it's not the most certain time in the world that we think what we're doing is the right investment. We continue to feel good, we set our long-term growth algorithms back in the middle of '08 at 3% to 5% and 6% to 8%. That was against very volatile commodity backdrop as well as a very volatile macroeconomic environment. That hasn't really changed. So we've been pretty transparent about our ability in the short term to be ahead of those numbers, and will continue to be very transparent about that over the long term. And I think there will be a time that we'll get a little more clarity here, as we head towards 2011 and beyond to give a little bit more of certainty around our model."

I mean, if you look at last couple of years, the one thing that hasn't changed is we continue to generate strong cash flow. And that's been something that's obviously helping us very much in the business. There has been some change in terms of the profile with respect to cash. And so I talked about the fact that we had about $250 million of cash on the balance sheet. Last year, in a pretty volatile economy, we chose to pay down short-term debt and we sort of pretty much gotten out of the commercial paper market at this stage. We did increase the dividend earlier in the year by 7.5%. And so going forward, we think there are a couple of ways with the board's counsel, we think about the cash. Certainly, one is the new Next Century requirements. And so there will be some requirements that wouldn't have been prior to that discussion in terms of capital and some of the cash requirements of Next Century. And we think we certainly have those well in hand. But given the level of cash flow that we generate, they've already talked about it. We do believe there could be M&A opportunities and we're actively trying to pursue some of those that could give us expansion into the geographic areas that we're already interested in. And so that certainly is on the list. And then as we build cash and the fact that we are out of the short-term debt market, questions around further dividend increases and maybe even buy backs is certainly on the agenda for the board and management discussions. So I think those are the major buckets to think about. And right now, we're very pleased with the continued good cash flow of the company. And we're very happy with the credit rating that we have and they give us the ability to have those types of flexibilities in those areas."

One of the things that makes us so attractive is that we're going to get displayed just because it's what we're offering as a category.

Consumers have clearly started to adjust to those price points because you're seeing volume and the category come back at pretty good levels. So I think that the over arching dynamics here is that we are seeing volume in the category at what our higher than historical promoted price points. So as you go to the back part of the year as a destination category, there's going to be Halloween display. There's going to be holiday display. There's S'mores displays for our business, for example. Those are already destination events that are out there from a retailer perspective. So I think, again, the confectionery category because it is a unique destination category is already going to get that kind of display. Some retailers will make their own choices about what price points they may or may not want to go market within. I don't think it's appropriate for us to comment on the individual conversations about their go-to-market strategy.

As I said, I think from a timing perspective, it was when we bought that business and with our partner Godrej in 2007, we had a set of assumptions about some macroeconomic, some commodity assumptions and also when you think about valuation assumptions in '07, they're probably a little different than you might see today. So I wouldn't read into the impairment charge or anything other than with the business that's still growing, I think we've learned a lot since 2007, if you will about go-to-market capabilities. So since 2007, we've done some things in Brazil and in China on route to market and have some learning there. And we've also done some great learning I think in certain markets like Mexico, for example, and China about the consumer demand landscape and how that ought to work. So I think we have learned a lot since that acquisition itself. And that's clearly going to be applicable to how we think about growth of the markets around the distribution capabilities, innovation capabilities and the ability to get products to market. So I would say we have learned quite a bit and will apply it not only on the businesses we're ready in, but as we look at M&A in the future about how to think about valuation and modeling on the way in, so we'll be very disciplined about that. So that's the learning. With respect to IDP, as I've said, retailers have been very receptive to the conversations. I think the thing that we're the most pleased about is that we are building collaborative relationships with retailers. We're talking about data in a different way, sharing data in a different way than we would have in the past. Much more strategic in our mutual approaches to it. And really, trying to find the intersection between -- we talk about our consumers and retailers talk about the shoppers. They are one and the same. It's the same person. But when we talk about our consumer and they talk about their shopper, they have always tended to come out at much more on a trip mission basis and we've come out much more on a consumer demand landscape basis, and we're trying to marry those two things up.

What I will say is we've gotten great visibility into gross margin when we look in 2012 and '13 from the Project Next Century. So what you're seeing from a gross margin expansion standpoint right now is a lot of the Global Supply Chain Transformation has lifted the gross margin level on a systemic basis. And when get to Project Next Century and build that out in late '11, '12 and '13, you will also see the same kind of systemic lift. We're also starting to see some good expansion in our International business. That's not going to necessarily come at the same margin, and so that will always be a governor against what we're doing. But we've done things systemically that we think are pretty good in the supply chain. We are starting to also in the short-term here, capture some of the productivity that we talked about at CAGNY, which is kind of a non-raw material productivity, if you will. So we feel good about the programs, the continuous improvement programs and then some of the structural things going forward.

And the progress, so of the $60 million to $80 million that we talked about in terms of savings, you'll really start to see that in '12 and '13.

Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty.
Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2009 filed with the SEC. If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on the corporate website, www.hersheys.com, in the Investor Relations section. 
Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP, within the note section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP.  
As we said within the notes, the company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP, rather, the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. 
We will discuss our second quarter 2010 results excluding pretax charges. The 2010 charges related to the Project Next Century and the Godrej Hershey goodwill impairment charge, while the 2009 charges are associated with the Global Supply Chain Transformation program. These pretax charges were $86.2 million in the second quarter of 2010 and $42.7 million in the second quarter of 2009. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges. With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Dave West."

Results for the second quarter were solid. Net sales increased a strong 5.3% and adjusted earnings per share grew 18.6% as core brand continue to perform well in the marketplace.

Net sales increased a strong 5.3% and adjusted earnings per share grew 18.6% as core brand continue to perform well in the marketplace. These high-quality results are driven primarily by volume, regained U.S. market share in the second quarter and are pleased with how our brands continue to respond to the investments we made. 
Overall, the Confectionary category remains healthy, increasing at the high end of its historical growth rate. Investments in the category in the form of advertising and/or innovation are present from most major manufacturers. Given the high household penetration and the impulsivity of the category, as well as affordable price points, we believe retailers will continue to value the Confectionary category. As a result, we would expect the category to continue to consistently secure key merchandising space and programming. 
As reported in the IRI and Nielsen's syndicate data, our U.S. retail takeaway and market share performance for the most part has been balanced across channels. Growth has predominantly been driven by volume gains as consumers have migrated to higher retail price points. This is allowing us to continue to be efficient with our trade promotion dollars, as trade promotion rate was about flat versus year ago during the quarter. Similar to Q1, this is better than our initial expectations. This is noteworthy in the context of the volume gains we've achieved in 2010. 
Now let's take a look at retail takeaway. The IRI and Nielsen data in the second quarter encompasses the period from March 21 to June 12. In 2010, Easter occurred on April 4, and in 2009, on April 12. While the first quarter of this year benefited slightly from an earlier Easter, the timing did not materially impact our second quarter marketplace performance. In fact, we gained share in both the first and second quarters. My remarks related to marketplace performance include seasonal data in all periods. 
We're pleased with Hershey's marketplace progress. Total U.S. CMG, that's candy, mint and gum, or total category retail takeaway for the year-to-date period through June 12, for the custom database in channels that account for over 80% of our Retail business, so here, I'm talking about food, drug and mass, including Wal-Mart and convenient stores, so on a year-to-date basis, was up 5.6%. Excluding Wal-Mart, Hershey's year-to-date FDMxC retail takeaway is up 5.1%. 
Hershey's second quarter retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending June in FDM, including Wal-Mart and convenience, was up 4%. Excluding Wal-Mart, Hershey's FDMxC retail takeaway was up 4.1% in the 12 weeks. 
The launch and rollout of new items such as Pieces is progressing nicely. And in the second quarter, again, new products were a net positive to the top line, about a one point contribution to our overall net sales growth. We gain market share on all classes of trade, except drug, which, as expected, was down but sequentially improved for the second quarter in a row. 
Hershey's seasonal Easter retail takeaway increased, up 6.7% and sell-through was solid, as we gain Easter market share of 1.3 points. Our market share in the ski season expanded to over 37%. 
Similar to the last few quarters, our performance was driven by the core brands upon which we are focused. Specifically, in FDMxC, the combined retail takeaway in Hershey's, Reese's, Hershey's Bliss and Hershey's Kisses, Twizzlers and Kit Kat brands increased mid-single digits. York, Almond Joy and Mounds, brands that we have just started advertising in January, posted FDMxC retail takeaway up in the low-double digits, excluding the Pieces' new products. 
Now for some further details. In the food class of trade, confection category growth was 5.4% in the second quarter. Hershey's retail takeaway in this channel exceeded the category, driven by chocolate, up 7.7% and non-chocolate, up 5.9%, resulting in a total market share gain of 0.5 points in the food channel. 
In the convenience store class of trade, the CMG category growth rate accelerated in the second quarter, as the category grew 3.3% versus 2.3% in the first quarter. In the second quarter, Hershey's Easter takeaway increased for the ninth consecutive quarter and was up 5.4%, resulting in a market share gain of 0.5 points. 
In the second quarter, Hershey's C Store chocolate and non-chocolate takeaway was up 8% and 4.5% respectively, driven by volume and mix as both standard, loose and king-size pack types perform nicely. Strong in-store merchandising and programming, driven by the Ironman movie tie-in and the Coca-Cola and Reese's joint promotion, drove balanced growth across core brands. 
We believe the category will continue to grow in C Stores. Category dynamics, as well as investments by CMG category participants, continues to drive variety, news and excitement and thus, category growth. 
As we have exited the second quarter, the targeted number of C Store associates were on board to deliver the overall 8% increase in in-store hours that we plan for 2010. As a result, we expect our C Store business to maintain its momentum in the second half of the year. 
Looking at the overall category, CMG continues to grow within its historical range, that's 3% to 4%. In FDMxC, here, excluding Wal-Mart, the CMG category grew 3% and 3.9% respectively in the second quarter and year-to-date. We are gaining share with our roughly 4% takeaway. 
Hershey marketplace performance is tracking nicely and selling, and merchandising initiatives are in place for the second half of the year. In pace of category of new product introductions in the marketplace is picking up in 2010, that the mix of in-and-out products, as well as permanent items. We have concentrated on the latter permanent items and feel very good about our base business, current new product performance and our upcoming December launches. 
As we look at the remainder of year, we'll continue to focus on the strategic whole-model initiatives that are driving the business. This include in-store focus to sell and display activity, new innovation on our Reese's and Hershey's franchises, increases and greater frequency of quality merchandising and programming, and further core-brand advertising investments.  
I'm pleased that the merchandising and programming in place for the third quarter, including to name just a few, the Reese's LOVES YOU BACK promotion, where we'll be giving away up to $2 million in cash prices. Consumers went instantly as they open specially marked Reese's product and include the game Piece worth $25 or $100. 
With the Twizzlers, are Irresistible Summer promotion to win money towards a summer vacation and they have the combined Almond Joy and Mounds contest to win a grand prize trip to the Caribbean, and we will continue our summertime S'mores programming, as well as the launch of our Halloween programs. 
During the Global Sweets and Snacks Expo in Chicago at the end of May, Reese's Mini Minis and Hershey's Drops were broadly displayed. Customers are excited about the December launch of these new products, which will be available at both the king-sized instant consumable items as well as a resealable stand-up pouch. 
We continue the strategic work we discussed related to Insights Driven Performance or IDP. We are engaged in working with select retailers to understand their specific opportunities and how to jointly leverage them to our proprietary business techniques, capabilities and category management insights. 
Additionally, advertising expense will now increase 45% to 50% in 2010. This is greater than our previous estimate of a 35% to 40% increase. Due to timing, the majority of this advertising will not be broadcast until later in the year, and we expect this impact on net sales to occur primarily in 2011. This pattern of investment is similar to what that which we executed in the later part of 2009 and which has clearly aided our strong start to 2010. 
Lower-than-planned trade promotion expense and earlier-than-expected achievement of a portion of the productivity savings discussed at CAGNY Conference in February, both of which we largely achieved in the second quarter, will offset a portion of this additional 2010 advertising investment. The acceleration of advertising in 2010 allows us to reach desired on-air continuity levels on many U.S. brands faster than our initial expectations. It also enables us to invest at higher levels in key international markets. 
While it is premature to offer specific 2011 details, we expect advertising to be up year-over-year in 2011, however, not nearly at the level of the last couple of years. The brand investments we've made have traveled well internationally. Where we have made investments internationally, our brands are responding.
Following macroeconomic challenges of last year, our business in Mexico is performing well this year and our business in Brazil, which underline a restructuring in late 2008 and 2009, is performing nicely, as is, our business in China. We continue to grow in India, although we have not gained traction as quickly as we planned. The Indian market remains a strategic growth market for the company. 
The non-cash goodwill impairment charge we announced today reflects revised and achievable growth targets for the business. They have been developed given the increases in local input cost, primarily sugar, the macroeconomic environment, which slowed distribution expansion plans and the slower implementation of products targeted at new price points that we had planned when we enter the joint venture in 2007. We will continue to apply our global confectionary know-how and strong balance sheet and cash flow to actively invest in India and other existing international markets, as well look for new opportunities in key strategic geographies. Our flexibility to acquire, and our partner leaves us with many potential opportunities, which we will pursue in a disciplined manner. 
Let me wrap up. Our brand continue to perform well in the marketplace. We have solid relationships with retailers in all channels, including select mass customers and value formats. Recently, we received Supplier of the Year Awards from a large mass customer and a national convenience store for the economic value that Hershey brings to the retailer and consumer. We will continue to build on these relationships. 
The CMG category continues to grow and it is being driven by volume gains. Macroeconomic challenges still exist. However, we feel good about the prospects as the Confectionary category is unique. It's highly impulsive, it's a destination category, especially in the second half of the year. It's expandable and profitable for the retailer and affordable for the consumer. 
There are some seasonal shifts out of Q4 2010 into Q1 of 2011, and Bert will have more on this shortly. Despite the shift, the brand-building investment initiatives we have in place are expected to drive net sales growth at the top end of our long-term net sales target for the balance of the year. Therefore, for the full year 2010, we expect net sales growth of about 7%, including an approximate one point benefit from foreign currency exchange rates. 
For the full year, we have good visibility into our cost structure, and expect to achieve adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBIT margin expansion that will result in adjusted earnings per share diluted in the $2.47 to $2.52 range, an increase of the low- to mid-teens on a percentage basis versus 2009. I'll now turn it over to Bert, who will provide some more detailed financial information."

Hershey post another quarter of quality results as second quarter consolidated net sales of $1.233 billion increased 5.3% versus the prior year and adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.51, increase",2145,"Well, thank you, Dave, and good morning to everyone. Hershey post another quarter of quality results as second quarter consolidated net sales of $1.233 billion increased 5.3% versus the prior year and adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.51, increased 18.6%. Overall, results were driven by sales volume increases, price realization from lower U.S. markdown, list price realization outside of the U.S. and supply-chain savings. These items more than offset higher input costs, increased marketing investments and a higher effective tax rate of 37.7%, that was 940 basis points above last year's second quarter. 
Investment spending in the latter part of last year has resulted in a good start in 2010 as demonstrated by our financial results in the IRI and Nielsen market share data. Similar to last year, solid first half results have given us the financial flexibility to increase brand building initiatives in the second half of 2010, while delivering on our previously communicated financial commitments. 
From a margin perspective, the year has progressed slightly ahead of expectation. And as we communicated during the first quarter call, full year adjusted gross and EBIT margin expansion will be driven primarily by first half results. Over the remainder of the year, our adjusted gross margin will improve at a slower rate, as we have now achieved all of the global supply chain transformation savings, lastly August 2008 price increase and expect input cost to be higher in the back half compared to last year. Adjusted EBIT margin will be slightly down in the second half of the year, reflecting increases related to various growth initiatives, including advertising and investments in go-to-market capabilities as well as our work in IDT. 
In addition to that, second half of the year will be impacted by sales mix, as this period is driven more by seasonal SKUs and take-home pack types that have a somewhat lower margins than our instant consumable brand. I'll provide further details related to the outlook in my closing remarks. Overall, we're pleased with our financial and marketplace performance, given the volatile commodity markets and the continuing pressures facing consumers. 
Now for some of the details. The second quarter sales gain of 5.3% was driven primarily by U.S. core brand volume increases, new products, lower returns and markdowns and growth in our International businesses. Favorable foreign currency exchange also contributed approximately one point of growth. We also shift slightly less Halloween in the second quarter of 2010 versus 2009, impacting the top line by about one point. 
During the second quarter, adjusted gross margin increased 540 basis points, driven primarily by sales mix, supply-chain efficiencies, some of which are related to fixed-cost absorption as volume was greater than a year ago and supply-chain productivity improvements. These margin gains were partially offset by higher input costs of about 60 basis points, reflecting total consolidated cost increases for raw materials and packaging. We have good visibility into our cost structure for the remainder of the year and expect continued adjusted gross margin expansion in 2010, although at lower rates than year-to-date. 
Second half adjusted gross margin expansion was slow as a result of input costs are expected to be higher, mix has impacted to the higher seasonal pack types versus Q1 and Q2, trade promotion efficiencies expected to subside, given the higher seasonal merchandising in the back half and we do not expect LIFO inventory accounting to be favorable as it was in Q4 2009, which at that time contributed about $12 million. 
Second quarter adjusted income before interest and income taxes increased 32.2% resulting in adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 350 basis points to 17.1% from 13.6% last year. This was driven primarily by higher adjusted gross margin, partially offset by higher advertising expense of about 50% or 200 basis points. Selling expenses and other marketing expenses as we added more U.S. in-store hours and continue to build global capabilities and hire employee-related administrative and legal cost. 
As Dave stated earlier, we continue to invest in our core brand and expect full year advertising expense to increase from 45% to 50% in 2010, and this is greater than the previously communicated estimate of 35% to 40%. 
Due to timing, the majority of the added advertising, we'll broadcast in the latter half of the year, therefore we expect it to have a greater impact on net sales in 2011. But despite these advertising increases, as well as the timing of other growth initiatives, we expect adjusted EBIT margins to increase for the full year, although it will be slightly lower than 2009 and the remainder of 2010. We believe that business investments we are making will enable us to maintain momentum as we close out 2010 and enter 2011. 
Now let me provide an update on our international businesses. On a reported and constant-currency basis, net sales increased in our key international markets, including Canada, Mexico, India and Asia. Overall, our referred international sales increased low-double digits. 
On a reported basis, including FX, our profitability improved across the majority of our international markets in Q2. We're going to continue making the necessary investments in increasing brand awareness and driving trial, including higher advertising in Q3 and Q4 in certain international markets. 
The Godrej Hershey joint venture remains a focused business and is a strategic growth market. We entered India in 2007, when global financial markets were more positive and business valuations were generally richer. With the change in global macroeconomic environment, we have adjusted our plans for in-country expansion, the implementation of new price points, the launch of new products and portfolio rationalization. We believe that the revised outlook is more in line with how we see the business going forward, although it does require us to record a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $45 million or $0.20 per share diluted. 
Despite this charge, this has not changed how we feel about the business or the Indian market. Going forward, we plan to apply some of the same consumer-oriented demand landscape learning that we have successfully executed in the U.S. in other markets including India. 
Now moving down to P&L. For the quarter, interest expense is relatively flat coming in at $22.8 million versus $22.7 million for the period. For the full year 2010, we expect interest expense to be in the $90 million to $95 million range. Adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was 37.7% due to the timing of certain tax events and the related accounting, although we continue to expect the full year tax rate to be about 35%. 
In the second quarter of 2010, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were $230.3 million versus $228.5 million in 2009, leading to adjusted earnings per share, diluted of $0.51, up 19% versus year ago. 
Now let me to provide a quick recap of the year-to-date adjusted results. Net sales increased 9.7% in the first half, adjusted gross margin was 43.2% year-to-date versus 37.4% last year or 580 basis points higher. Gains were driven primarily by sales mix, net price realization, productivity improvement and supply-chain efficiencies. Adjusted income before interest and income taxes increased 40%, resulting in EBIT margin gain of 380 basis points to 17.6% from 13.8%, and advertising increased 59% year-to-date and earnings per share, diluted in the first half, increased 42% to $1.15 per share. 
Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the second quarter, net trading capital decreased versus last year's second quarter resulting in a cash inflow of $16 million. Accounts receivable was up $49 million, and we continuously monitor our accounts receivable aging, which remains extremely current and of high quality. Inventory declined by $39 million and accounts payable increased by $25 million. 
In terms of other specific cash flow items, capitalizations, including software, were $39 million in the quarter. For 2010, we are targeting total capitalizations to be in the $190 million to $210 million range. This range includes base business CapEx of about $150 million, plus project and expense-free CapEx of approximately $55 million. Depreciation and amortization was $46 million in the second quarter, including accelerated depreciation of approximately $1 million. Therefore, operating depreciation and amortization was $45 million. 
For the full year 2010, we are forecasting total operating depreciation and amortization of $175 million to $185 million, while accelerated depreciation and amortization related to Project Next Century is estimated to be $10 million to $15 million. 
Dividends paid during the quarter were $71 million. We did not acquire any stock in the second quarter related to the current repurchase program and there remains $100 million outstanding in that authorization. During the quarter, we did repurchase $69 million of our common shares in the open market to replace shares issued in connection with stock-option exercises. And year-to-date, approximately $133 million of common shares have been repurchased to replace shares issued in connection with stock-option exercises. 
Cash on hand at the end of the second quarter was $249 million. This was up significantly versus year-ago period and relatively in line with the 2009 year-end balance. As we exit the second quarter, we are well positioned to manage the seasonal working capital needs of the business, which peak in the third quarter, as well as higher capital expenditure requirements related to the Project Next Century. 
Now let me provide an update on Project Next Century. The forecast for total pretax GAAP charges and non-recurring project implementation cost remains at $140 million to $170 million. Note that this morning's press release appendix was updated to reflect the most current thinking and the expected timing of events. Specifically, we now expect to record $75 million to $85 million in program charges in 2010. While this is a $25 million increase versus our initial estimate, you'll note that 2011 and 2012, there is a combined $25 million decrease. The change is due to the accounting timing of racked severance-related costs and does not change the timing of cash flow for the project. We're moving forward with our plan to have initiated construction in West Hershey, where our new facility will be built. While difficult, decisions made were necessary to ensure that Hershey has a flexible and cost-competitive supply chain. Savings from the project will give us the flexibility to make investments that will deliver core business growth and position us for the long-term success in the competitive confectionary marketplace. 
By 2014, ongoing annual savings are expected to be approximately $60 million to $80 million, and in terms of timing, savings from Project Next Century will not be realized until late 2011, with the majority coming in 2012 and 2013. 
Now let me summarize. Our goal for the second half of the year is to maintain our marketplace momentum as we exit 2010 and enter 2011. To support this objective, we plan to increase full year advertising expense by 45% to 50%. In addition, we will continue to invest in consumer insights and brand-building initiatives, as well as selling and go-to-market capabilities in the U.S., as well as other markets. 
Therefore, we expect full year net sales to increase about 7%, including an approximate one point benefit from foreign exchange. While stock prices for some of our major commodities continue to fluctuate, we have good visibility into our cost structure for the remainder 2010, and expect gross margin expansion during the remainder of the year, although not at the same rate realized during the first half. We expect adjusted EBIT margin to increase for the full year and adjusted earnings per share diluted in the $2.47 to $2.52 range on a percentage increase of low to mid-teens versus 2009. 
Before we go to Q&A, I'd like to summarize some unique items that impact our financial results in the second half. And as you work on your models, please note the following: We expect a shift in seasonal shipping patterns from Q4 2010 into Q1 2011 to be greater than a similar shift that occurred at the end of last year. This will impact top line by a couple of points in the fourth quarter of 2010. Favorable trade promotion expenses should abate going forward, as the second half of the year is driven by higher seasonal sales, which by nature, are more heavily merchandised. 
In Q4 2009, LIFO inventory accounting was favorable and we do not expect this to repeat in 2010. As we've discussed, the revised advertising increase in Q3 and Q4, but also recall that investments in category management, selling capabilities and other global growth initiatives are also back-half weighted. Higher than earlier expected achievement of a portion of productivity savings discussed at CAGNY Conference in February will offset some of the higher-brand investments in the back half of the year. And finally, we continue to expect full year tax rate to remain at about 35%. We'll now open it up for Q&A."

It's a little premature for us during the mid-year to talk a lot about 2011. But what we did say is that our gross margin expansion was a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be, and some of that clearly comes from the better volumes. So that's giving us a better absorption rate to our factories. We've also had some lower markdowns. And that's helped as our seasonal sales have been better. And clearly, what we are seeing is a continuation of good productivity with our normal continuous improvement programs, but the second quarter, in particular, benefited from some of the productivity that we talked about at CAGNY. At CAGNY, we talked about realizing $80 million to about $100 million over the next two to three years, primarily in non-packaging and non-raw material areas. And so that includes logistics and other services, and we've had more traction on that in the second quarter than we expected. And so that's coming in a little bit faster in the year and giving us a better gross margin year-to-date. In the back half, one thing we wanted to be clear on is that we do continue to expect gross margin to expand in Q3 and Q4, and obviously for the year, but it would not be at the rates that we've seen in the first half of the year. With respect to commodities, we did mention that commodity increases do happen throughout the year. If you recall the first quarter call, we actually had a favorable commodity in terms of the way we accounted for dairy one year versus another, but we've seen commodity increases in the second quarter versus last year and that continues throughout the year and certainly dairy is one component of that, that continues. In terms of the cocoa news that you've seen, obviously, we followed very closely. We think it's unusual. Obviously, a very large purchase of beans by a hedge fund that otherwise would normally purchase financial products versus the commodity itself. Our commodities remain very volatile right now and we're starting to gain some visibility towards 2011, and we'll certainly be providing more information on that as the year progresses."

I would have probably would have filed an 8-K and I would've known. With respect to Mars, Wrigley and actually within the category, I think what you're seeing is increases in innovation, particularly you're seeing some of the competitors in chocolate, some of the other competitors in chocolate are a little more focused on some in-and-out type innovation. We are at focus a little bit more on permanent items, but within the chocolate part of the business we're seeing a little bit more innovation. And then in gum, between Cadbury and Wrigley, there is some innovation and some pretty good activity there. So we are seeing innovation pickup. I mean, we believe overall that's helping drive category growth rate in some of the volume in the category. As we look to the rest of the year, it becomes a seasonal -- seasons become a larger part of the equation and it's a destination category across -- but everybody in the category tends to benefit from the destination nature of Halloween and holiday. So our overall, we're seeing good gross margin expansion, we're seeing volume in the category, we're seeing better-than-historical category growth rates. So right now, we feel pretty good about how the category overall is positioned and most of the majors are holding their own and enjoying some pretty good growth."

So you're starting to see some, at least on some moderation in the Premium and the Trade Up segments. But most of the growth and most of the attention from the retailer and consumer remains in the mainstream segment. So from a programming standpoint and the actual current investment, you're seeing us really focus on mainstream right now, because we think that's where the bang to the bucket and that's where consumers and retailers are going. That doesn't mean that we're not working in our pipeline and in innovation on the Premium segment.

I mean, we bought that business and went into the joint venture in 2007 at a time when marketplace expectations on a number of fronts, including overall market growth rates, commodity markets, financial markets. We're at a very different place. And so as I think about when we set the initial assumptions for evaluation of that business, we set it up at a time in 2007  when I think there are a lot of frothy expectations around a number of things. Our key expectations of that business -- the two areas, I think the two biggest is where we fall in short from a  marketplace standpoint was the brand themselves where and still are to a large extent, it's sugar confectionery brands, household names. In certain regions, we are expecting to get national a lot more quickly distribution-wise. And then the other thing is we were hoping through innovation to get to higher price points, by giving the consumer innovations. So moving off of the half a rupee price point and our rupee price point and up. And given some of the macroeconomic issues that proved to be a little bit harder than we initially expected. And then when you layer in on top of that the poor Indian sugar crop over the last 18 months, those three factors, I think, were where we missed in the model. The business is still growing. We're starting to see our plans in terms of getting the cost structure right, and the commodity market coming back. So while we're short of the initial expectations and the timeframe they were set, it still remains a growth market for us but I wouldn't read in anything competitively. Again, it's in the sugar confectionery part of the marketplace, not where Cadbury would have a strong chocolate position per se. So I would say it's a little bit more about how we set expectations for the business and we're able to execute. And I would say that that's not necessarily a marketplace phenomenon. It was more our inability to get some certain of the assumptions done."

If you remember back in the first quarter, we actually had trade promotion rate below prior year. So we actually had two to three points of growth in the first quarter net sales that were related to having lower trade promotion rates. In the second quarter, our trade promotion rate versus year ago was roughly flat. And so we weren't lower, but it was better than our expectations going into the quarter. So for the first half, we have better trade promotion efficiency. As we get into the back part of the year, we're looking for -- that's probably not going to be the case. And if you think about it, it makes some sense because the second half of the year for us is much more merchandising intensive given the seasonal nature of the business. So I think what you're seeing from us, realistically, is we are investing in new items and were investing in our existing core brands with advertising. So our base velocities are increasing. And so when you look at the mix of base versus promoted, you're seeing us do a much better job with base and therefore on a relative basis, not as much promoted. And so I think that's one of the things in the category. And then the other thing is the category. Because it is such a destination category, we're going to continue to get good merchandising. And that's just a factor where that historically of it, the retailer knows that it's a consumer destination and we're going to get our level of display. And so I think it's just one of those virtues of the category."

In the first quarter, we were up roughly 14% on the top line. We said half of that was price-related, so it's less price plus the trade promotion efficiency and a little bit of foreign exchange. So seven of the 14 then we realistically had in the first quarter, 7% volume. 2% of it is was a shift from '09 into '10 related to seasons. And then we got new products and base velocities that added up to about 5%. So our new products were a couple of points and base velocity is around 3%. That was the first quarter. Here the second quarter, we're up roughly 5%. Trade efficiency and foreign exchange add a point or two. And so when you look at base velocities, it's again around 3% to 4%. And we shipped a little less Halloween in the second quarter than we normally would, so base velocity between the new items are still that roughly 3% to 4%, same as they would have been in the first quarter. And then if you look at the second half of year, we don't expect to get any of the trade promotion or pricing efficiency that we got in the first half. We're talking about being close to the top end of our 3% to 5% long-term range for the back half of the year. So that would imply, again, the same kind of 4% to 5% from base volume in new items. Remember, we have the two new items in the back part of year on pipeline, which will be the Reese's Mini Minis and the Hershey's Drop. So I think throughout the year, you're going to see similar volume trends facing you across the balance of the year. And then the difference really is in the first half. We got better pricing trade efficiency."

So overall for the first half, we're up 5% FDMxC and 5.7% FDMxCW. So you did see a bit of a slowdown in the overall math kind of customers in the second quarter. Food grew very nicely, so I think as you listen to the conference calls and other talk out there in the market, there seems to be a little bit of a shift back towards food and closer to home shopping a little bit more of the traditional pattern. Convenience store trips were up. As the quarter went on, we saw a nice improvement in convenience store traffic through the quarter. And then I think our Drugstore business is improving albeit slowly. So I think overall, that there was probably a little bit of a shift and it's consistent with what you would read externally in the news about kind of some of the traffic moving from mass and food being up a little bit. Convenience continues to look good. And then the drug and the club store, the dollar in club classes of trade continue to be very good. Our relationships at the major mass retailers continue to be very good. We did win an award at Wal-Mart for one of the more toward adding value to the consumer within.

Our first half sales growth rate is close to 10%.

Our first half sales growth rate is close to 10%. And we think that's reflective of really kind of getting fairly strong and aggressive in terms of our advertising spend in the latter part of last year. But particularly heavying up on some brands like Reese's and Kit Kat late in the year. Getting prepared, doing the preproduction work on brands like Pieces, Almond Joy, Mounds and York, and getting them on air right out of the gate in January of this year. So we think that leaning in to the advertising spend in the back half of last year is a large reason why we've been able to grow strongly in the first half of this year. And so we originally when we started the year, we're looking at growth rates on the top line within our the historical 3% to 5% rate. We're now closer to something around 7%. So if you think about the upside, which has really occurred here in the first half and then as we look to the rest of the year to the higher range of the 5%, we think that's really a lot about the way we've invested in the brand, the new brands particularly. And so as we've generated that favorability, if you will, if you think about the difference between the original 3% to 5% and about 7%, a lot of that would essentially have fallen through because our EPS when we started thinking about the year was in the 6% to 8% range. And now we're in the mid-teens range. What is a little bit more virtuous to us is the fact that not only have we gotten that top line, we've also got the productivity gains and a little bit more trade promotion efficiencies faster. So we've been very favorable in the gross margin versus our initial expectations in the first half, and what we're doing with that favorability is investing it. So the top line favorability if you think about it, let's say, it's fallen through but the gross margin favorability we've decided. We've got gross margin favorability in the first half, we're investing it in SM&A programming in the second half with the belief that we're still getting good ROI on our marketing spend. And therefore, as you continue to virtually circle and help up us get cold 10 facts and get off to a good start on the top line in '11, we're going to go heavier getting towards continuity programming on a lot of the brands we're already on. So some of the brands we started such as the York and Mounds and Almond Joy, looking at the copy on some other brands starting digital and getting from international spending going here in the latter part of the year, we're getting to those continuity levels on those brands a lot faster. So as I said in my remarks, as we look forward into next year, you should see a much more normalized level because we've gotten a lot of the brands on air and the continuity level's a lot faster. But we think at this point in time, it's the right time to do it. At a time when the consumer is looking towards our category for value and some indulgence and when retailers are looking forward to us because we have a relatively attractive entry price points and we're a destination category, we think it's the right time for us to invest into the brand. And so far, so good. We are seeing good ROIs and so we think it's the appropriate thing to do."

They embrace that business model, and then when we kind of step back and relooked at the business model and went much more towards a polar-oriented, advertising-based system, that didn't match up as well with their go-to-market strategy. And so while we got great traction in some other places as we move more towards the full strategy, the one class of trade where our business model was out of step with what they were trying to do was in drug. We took a period of correction as we took a lot of items out of the system and have managed our way through that. There's also a class of trade where we don't have retail coverage, so it's a little hard for us to correct for the new business model and get the retail right as quickly as we normally would've liked to. We still have very good relationships. These are large customers. It's turning sequentially for us. We're feeling good about the direction we're headed in.

We think we're getting our penetration rates higher on most of the brands in our portfolio. That's the long-term healthier situation for us to be in. Innovation is starting to be additive and a lot of the competitors are coming into the market with innovation, which we think because of the way the category works, it's an expandable category and the consumer has a number of brands that are acceptable to them on the menu. We think that those kind of things will expand the category. And so this is not a category because of the expandable on the way it gets merchandised. It's not a zero-sum game kind of a category. So we think that it is a way that we could see category growing at greater than historical 3% to 4% growth rates in the U.S. business. But again, everything is against a macroeconomic backdrop of consumer confidence as well as retailers. There's a lot of retail channel issues and blurring out there. And so it's not the most certain time in the world that we think what we're doing is the right investment. We continue to feel good, we set our long-term growth algorithms back in the middle of '08 at 3% to 5% and 6% to 8%. That was against very volatile commodity backdrop as well as a very volatile macroeconomic environment. That hasn't really changed. So we've been pretty transparent about our ability in the short term to be ahead of those numbers, and we'll continue to be very transparent about that over the long term.

And that's been something that's obviously helping us very much in the business. There has been some change in terms of the profile with respect to cash. And so I talked about the fact that we had about $250 million of cash on the balance sheet. Last year, in a pretty volatile economy, we chose to pay down short-term debt and we sort of pretty much gotten out of the commercial paper market at this stage. We did increase the dividend earlier in the year by 7.5%. And so going forward, we think there are a couple of ways that, with the board's counsel, we think about the cash. Certainly, one is the new Next Century requirements. And so there will be some requirements that wouldn't have been there prior to that discussion in terms of capital and some of the cash requirements of Next Century. And we think we certainly have those well in hand. But given the level of cash flow that we generate, certainly they've already talked about it. We do believe there could be M&A opportunities and we're actively trying to pursue some of those that could give us expansion into the geographic areas that we're already interested in. And so that certainly is on the list. And then as we build cash and the fact that we are out of the short-term debt market, questions around further dividend increases and maybe even buybacks is certainly on the agenda for the board and management discussions. So I think those are the major buckets to think about. And right now, we're very pleased with the continued good cash flow of the company.

So we're somewhat advantaged and we might be an outlier in the form of the conversation you're talk about, about how to drive merchandising and volume."

What we've seen in especially the food class of trade is retailers promoting out of their own pockets, right? So soft drinks have been really promoted pretty heavily this summer, for instance, and a lot of that funding has come from retailers and the motivation there is to drive traffic. Since you're a destination category, you would think that for retailers thinking that way that maybe they'd promote confections more aggressively around the holiday or at least going into the fall. So can you just talk about whether that's been a conversation with retailers or a topic of conversation with retailers, and just your perspective on the potential for retailer-funded promotion in the second half."

And we also saw a category promoted price points move up pretty strongly in 2009. Consumers have clearly started to adjust to those price points because you're seeing volume and the category come back at pretty good levels. So I think that the over arching dynamics here is that we are seeing volume in the category at what our higher than historical promoted price points. So as you go to the back part of the year as a destination category, there's going to be Halloween display. There's going to be holiday display. There's S'mores displays for our business, for example. Those are already destination events that are out there from a retailer perspective. So I think, again, the confectionery category because it is a unique destination category is already going to get that kind of display. Some retailers will make their own choices about what price points they may or may not want to go market within. I don't think it's appropriate for us to comment on the individual conversations about their go-to-market strategy. I think as I said in our remarks, we're pretty pleased about the kind of attention the category's getting from both retailers and consumers. We're investing in our brands behind that. I wouldn't want to comment on which specific retailer may or may not be doing it. It's really up to them and their go-to-market strategy."

As I said, I think from a timing perspective, it was when we bought that business and with our partner Godrej in 2007, we had a set of assumptions about some macroeconomic, some commodity assumptions and also when you think about valuation assumptions in '07, they're probably a little different than you might see today. So I wouldn't read into the impairment charge or anything other than with the business that's still growing, I think we've learned a lot since 2007, if you will about go-to-market capabilities. So since 2007, we've done some things in Brazil and in China on route to market and have some learning there. And we've also done some great learning I think in certain markets like Mexico, for example, and China about the consumer demand landscape and how that ought to work. So I think we have learned a lot since that acquisition itself. And that's clearly going to be applicable to how we think about growth of the markets around the distribution capabilities, innovation capabilities and the ability to get products to market. So I would say we have learned quite a bit and will apply it not only on the businesses we're ready in, but as we look at M&A in the future about how to think about valuation and modeling on the way in, so we'll be very disciplined about that. So that's the learning. With respect to IDP, as I've said, retailers have been very receptive to the conversations. I think the thing that we're the most pleased about is that we are building collaborative relationships with retailers. We're talking about data in a different way, sharing data in a different way than we would have in the past. Much more strategic in our mutual approaches to it. And really, trying to find the intersection between -- we talk about our consumers and retailers talk about the shoppers. They are one and the same. It's the same person. But when we talk about our consumer and they talk about their shopper, they have always tended to come out at much more on a trip mission basis and we've come out much more on a consumer demand landscape basis, and we're trying to marry those two things up. And I think what we've been very pleased with is as we start to exchange data, initially what we're finding is that there ways to win together. And actually kind of either satisfy unmet demand or be more efficient in the way that we are satisfying existing demand. So, so far so good."

What I will say is we've gotten great visibility into gross margin when we look in 2012 and '13 from the Project Next Century. So what you're seeing from a gross margin expansion standpoint right now is a lot of the Global Supply Chain Transformation has lifted the gross margin level on a systemic basis. And when get to Project Next Century and build that out in late '11, '12 and '13, you will also see the same kind of systemic lift. We're also starting to see some good expansion in our International business. That's not going to necessarily come at the same margin, and so that will always be a governor against what we're doing. But we've done things systemically that we think are pretty good in the supply chain. We are starting to also in the short-term here, capture some of the productivity that we talked about at CAGNY, which is kind of a non-raw material productivity, if you will. So we feel good about the programs, the continuous improvement programs and then some of the structural things going forward.

Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2009 filed with the SEC.
If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website www.hersheys.com in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP.
As we've said within the note, the company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP, rather the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
We will discuss our third quarter 2010 results, excluding net pretax charges. The 2010 charges relate to the Project Next Century program, while the 2009 charges are associated with the Global Supply Chain Transformation. These pretax charges were $4.5 million in the third quarter of 2010 and $11 million in the third quarter of 2009. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.
With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Dave West."

I'm pleased that despite the macro economic challenges that persists, Hershey delivered another strong quarter of operating the marketplace results. During the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis, the CMG,",1663,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased that despite the macro economic challenges that persists, Hershey delivered another strong quarter of operating the marketplace results. 
During the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis, the CMG, that's candy, mint and gum category, continues to grow, outpacing salty snacks, cookies, crackers and bakery snacks. Our business is solid in all parts of the trade, and our retail partners value the importance of the confectionery category and the leadership that Hershey provides.
During these challenging times, retailers are looking for traffic and the profitable solutions, and confectionery is one of the answers to both of these objectives.
Hershey's third quarter net sales reflected continued momentum of our brands. Net sales increased 4.2%, driven primarily by volume gains in both the U.S. and international markets as we continue to invest and execute in the marketplace.
Additionally, as we exited the third quarter, the timing of some seasonal shift has dampened third quarter net sales by approximately one point. These shipments have already occurred in early October and will be reflected in our fourth quarter results.
In terms of Hershey's marketplace performance, preliminary CMG consumer takeaway for the 12 weeks ending October 2 and the year-to-date periods for our custom database in channels that account for over 80% of our income business was up about 4% and 5%, respectively.
As a reminder, these challenges include food, drug, mass, including Wal-Mart and convenience stores. In the third quarter, I was particularly pleased with the sequential improvement in retail takeaway trend at one of our larger retail customers and in the drugstore channel.
We do want to note that during the third quarter, we opened the contact of some of their customers, including Hershey, and informed them that they are currently reviewing the projection methodology of their C Store universe for syndicated data. This is a C Store channel specific issue, impacting a number of categories and manufacturers with the impact limited to Q3 data.
We believe the data we have been provided and that we are sharing with you today is directionally correct, and that any potential adjustment will not materially impact our overall reported market share.
We continue to feel very good about our Convenience Store business. In the NACS conference, that's the National Association of Convenience Stores, two weeks ago, we had the opportunity to meet with our C Store customers. The constant thing was that Hershey and the confectionery category remains solid. 
Within FDMxC, that's food, drug, mass and convenience, here we're excluding Wal-Mart, preliminary Hershey and category growth for the 12 weeks ending October 2 and year-to-date period for our custom database increased relatively in line with the category's historical growth rate. Hershey's preliminary U.S. CMG market share is up 0.2 points for the year-to-date period and was flat in the third quarter. 
The category continues to perform well despite the macro economic challenges as confectionery is among the highest with respect to household penetration and impulse purchases. This impulsivity continues to translate to merchandising opportunities. And as we move to the balance of the year, the category is a seasonal destination, with our branded products remaining available at reasonable price points. As a result, we would expect the category to continue to consistently secure key merchandising and programming space and to grow within the historical 3% to 4% range. 
The category continues to be driven by mainstream everyday confections, as trade up, gifting and novelty subsegments remain soft.
Year-to-date, premium and trade up chocolate on a net basis is about flat. As we stated in July, as expected, there were investments by major manufacturers in this category in the form of innovation and trial inducing programs during the quarter. Activity varies by channel, and despite this, Hershey retail takeaway increased in all channels.
In the third quarter, food process trade category growth was plus 4.2%. Hershey retail takeaway increased 2.5% in the third quarter, resulting in a market share decline of 0.5 points in Q3 in the food class trade. However, Hershey's food channel market share is still up 0.1 points year-to-date. Q3 results were due to the year-over-year timing of innovation, merchandising and program. Marketplace activity can and will vary from quarter-to-quarter, and our programming for the balance of the year in the food class trade is solid.
This following season is marked by a bit of an unusual calendar. Labor Day was late, September 6 and October 31 falls on a Sunday. With this pattern, we expect continued purchases to be especially compressed towards the end of the season. To date, customer holding all orders and retail sell-through are tracking in line with our expectations, although we will not have a complete read on sell-through for another couple of weeks.
Halloween-specific seasonal promotions, merchandising and advertising are being executed. We believe we made the necessary investments to ensure solid category sell-through, and we work closely with key customers over the next 10 days to monitor consumer reaction and shopping behavior.
Turning now to the C Store class trade. In Q3, Hershey's preliminary C Store takeaway increased for the 10th consecutive quarter and was up within historical category growth rate, resulting in a share gain of approximately 0.2 points. On a year-to-date basis in the C Store channel, syndicated data indicates we have gained 0.6 market share points. 
In Q3, Hershey's C Store chocolate and non-chocolate performance was solid, driven by volume and mix as both standard loose bars and king-sized performed well in the marketplace behind the Reese's DOUBLE THE LOVE promotion and the 2 for $2.50 king-sized promotion and the Hershey's Pure Happiness standard bar program.
In the fourth quarter, we expect convenience stores to remain on track behind NCAA football clients, as well as additional king-sized and standard bar programming. 
In the third quarter, our business in the Drops class to trade in food. For the 12 weeks ended October 2, Hershey's retail takeaway net channel increased 3.2%, resulting in a market share gain of 0.6 points. While this is partly a result of easier comps versus a year-ago period, we have notably increased our level of investment and focus on this channel and are markedly improving our results.
As we look to the remainder of the year, we have strong initiatives in place during the fourth quarter across all channels. Some of the core brand merchandising and consumer promotions include NCAA football promotion, and for the holiday season, we're offering consumers a free customized photo calendar and coffee mug in conjunction with snapfish with the purchase of two participating Hershey's candy products.
We're also adding excitement for our traditional holiday and baking programming, with the bake share and win promotion. And we are most excited about the December launch of Hershey's Drops and Reese's Mini's.
In Q4, versus our previous expectation, we'll accelerate the timing of and begin execution of certain aspects of our strategic plan. Therefore, SG&A spending will rise sharply and be driven by higher levels of incremental investments in the building out of the Insights Driven Performance initiative, further going market strategies involve the U.S. and other markets around the world as we had selling capability and points of distribution and global markets, such as Mexico and China.
We'll increase sampling supporting new products, especially in the markets where we are adding points of distribution. Advertising expense will increase and for the full year is now expected to be up 50% to 60%. This is greater than our previous estimate of a 45% to 50% increase. We'll increase spending on brands on which we initiated activity earlier this year. Reese's, Mounds, Almond Joy and York have responded to ad spending and will accelerate towards constant levels of GRPs on these brands. We will also begin airing a copy of Hershey's Syrup and PayDay for the first time since 2001. And we'll be adding to our consumer spending in Mexico, China and Canada as we complete and implement our demand landscape learning in these geographies.
Over the remainder of the year, we expect the macro economic challenges facing this consumer to continue. Category growth rate will most likely to continue to fluctuate from to quad-to-quad. Importantly, the inherent characteristics of the category I spoke about earlier should endure, resulting in the category grown within its historical growth rate of 3% to 4% in                             2010 and 2011. 
Our plans are in place for the upcoming key seasonal periods. As a result, we reiterate our full year  2010 net sales target outlook of about 7% increase including approximately one point benefit from foreign currency exchange rates.
For the full year, we have good visibility in our cost structure, and while input cost will be higher in the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBIT margin to expand. Therefore, we have increased our full year adjusted earnings per share diluted outlook and expected to be in the $2.52 to $2.56 range, an increase of mid- to high-teens on a percentage basis versus 2009,   and greater than our previously estimated range of $2.47 to $2.52.   
As we plan for 2011, we believe macro economic challenges and consumer confidence will continue to be a headwind. However, we believe category dynamics, similar to those I've discussed, and continued support of our brands will enable the category and Hershey to grow.
In 2011, we expect our advertising expense to increase. However, the year-over-year percentage increase will not be at the rate achieved over the last two years. As a result, our initial expectation for 2011 is for net sales growth within our 3% to 5% long-term objective. While do anticipate higher input cost in 2011, productivity and cost-saving initiatives are in place to help mitigate the impact. Therefore, based on our current views and expectations for 2011, we expect growth and adjusted earnings per share diluted within our current long-term target of 6% to 8%.
I'll now turn it over to Bert who will provide some additional financial details."
98873,113876854,80934,"Hershey Co., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","The Hershey Company","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Hershey posted another quarter of quality results, as third quarter consolidated net sales of $1,547,000,000 increased 4.2% versus the prior year and adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.79 increased 8.2%.O",1813,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Hershey posted another quarter of quality results, as third quarter consolidated net sales of $1,547,000,000 increased 4.2% versus the prior year and adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.79 increased 8.2%.
Overall, year-over-year result were driven by volume, mix, net price realization and supply chain savings which more than offset increases in marketing investments and selling capabilities. The third quarter sales gain of 4.2% was driven primarily by the continued growth of our core brands including new products. As we ended the quarter, the timing of some seasonal shipments lowered our third quarter net sales by about one point. Therefore, our fourth quarter seasonal shipments will be greater than the prior year, maintaining our full year net sales outlook of about 7%. In addition, lower levels of customer returns in markdowns, as well as the July 2009 carryover pricing in Canada, generated net price realization of about one point, while favorable foreign currency rates contributed approximately a half point.
During the third quarter, adjusted gross margin increased 290 basis points, driven by favorable supply chain efficiencies, including continued higher productivity, favorable sales mix and lower levels of obsolescence. Input costs were about flat in the quarter and favorable versus our previous estimate as a result of certain commodity strategies executed in Q3. We currently have good visibility for our cost structure for the remainder of the year and expect input cost to be higher in the fourth quarter versus prior year. Despite this increase, year-over-year adjusted gross margin is expected to be a bit higher in the fourth quarter but below the rate achieved in the third quarter.
Third quarter adjusted EBIT margins of 19.7% is up 10 basis points. This is driven primarily by higher adjusted gross margin, offset by higher advertising expense, up about  46%; selling expenses, as we continue to invest in consumer insight in building global capabilities and employee-related expenses. As Dave stated earlier, we continue to invest in our core brands and expect full year advertising expense to increase 50% to 60%, greater than our previous estimate of 45% to 50%. 
So as the last year, as previously communicated, we are planning additional advertising in the fourth quarter in both the U.S. and other key markets to enable a strong start to 2011. We expect adjusted EBIT margin to expand for the full year, although it will be lower versus the fourth quarter of last year.
And that's due to lower gross margin expansion as well as business investments, which Dave already described.
Now let me provide an update on our international businesses. Overall, our reported sales outside the U.S. increased low double digits. And on a reported and constant-currency basis, sales increased in our largest international markets. While in Asia, we focused on preparing for the upcoming Chinese New Year. During the third quarter, strategic investments in brand building and go-to-market strategies were higher, including an advertising increase of 65% outside of North America.
As a result of our local currency basis, operating income increased in Canada but declined in the rest of our emerging market businesses. We are committed to investing in our international businesses. And we anticipate that these investments will generate meaningful brand awareness and some raw faith over time.
Moving further down to P&L. For the quarter, interest expense was $22.3 million, consistent with the prior period. In 2010, we're now expecting interest expense to be down about 1% versus 2009. The tax rate for the third quarter was 35.1% or 210 basis points less than the prior year due to the impact of interim tax accounting and a favorable income mix among geographies. For the full year, we now expect the tax rate to be about 35% to 35.5%, slightly higher than our previous estimate of 35%.
In the third quarter of 2010, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were $230.5 million versus $229.6 million in 2009, leading to adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.79, up 8.2% versus a year ago.
Let me provide a quick recap of our year-to-date results. Net sales increased 7.6%. Adjusted gross margin was 43% year-to-date versus 38.3% last year. Gains were driven primarily by favorable supply chain efficiencies including volume and greater levels of productivity. Favorable mix and low obsolescence also contributed. Adjusted EBIT increased 23.5%, thus resulting an EBIT margin gain of 230 basis points to 18.3% from 16%. Advertising increased 54% on a year-to-date basis. And adjusted earnings per share diluted for the nine-month increased 26% to $1.94 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the third quarter, net turning capital is relatively in line with last year. Accounts receivable was up $38 million and remains extremely current of quality. We continuously monitor our accounts receivable aging, and despite current macro economic conditions, we have not seen an impact on our customers' payment patterns to date. 
Inventory increased $35 million, driven partially by previously mentioned timing of the third quarter sales, while accounts payable increased by $65 million. We do expect net turning capital to improve in the fourth quarter, as we cycle through the peak seasonal period of our business. 
In terms of other specific cash flow items, capital in additions,  including software, were $49 million in the third quarter and $124 million year-to-date. The amounts included $20 million of Project Next Century capital expenditures. For 2010, we're targeting total capital additions to be in the $190 million to $210 million range. This range includes base ongoing CapEx of $140 million to $160 million plus Project Next Century CapEx of approximately $50 million. 
Depreciation and amortization was $52 million in the period, including a solid depreciation of approximately $6 million. Year-to-date, reported depreciation amortization was $146 million and included $7 million of accelerated depreciation related to the Next Century program. 
Therefore, adjusted operating depreciation and amortization year-to-date was approximately $139 million. In 2010, we are forecasting total operating depreciation and amortization of  $175 million to $185 million, while accelerated depreciation amortization related to Project Next Century is expected to be $10 million to $15 million.
Dividend space during the quarter were $71 million. We did not acquire stock in the third quarter related to the outstanding stock repurchase program. There remains 100 million outstanding on the current authorization. Year-to-date, approximately 133 million of our common shares have been repurchased to replace shares issued in conjunction with stock option exercises and option replacement is about current at quarter end.
Cash on hand at the end of the third quarter was $245 million, up versus the year ago period and relatively in line with 2009 year-end balance. As we exit the third quarter, we are well positioned to manage the capital needs of the business as well as higher capital expenditure requirements of Project Next Century. 
Now let me provide an update on Project Next Century. I'm pleased to confirm that we have begun work on expansion on West Hershey plant expansion. Excavation on the property has begun, and we expect to begin receiving manufacturing equipment during the third quarter of 2011. We also anticipate initial production line startup during the fourth quarter of 2011 with continued rollout and implementation throughout 2012.
The forecast for total pretax GAAP charges and nonrecurring project implementation cost remains at $140 million to $170 million. For 2010, total GAAP charges related to program are expected to $75 million to $85 million. 
By 2014, when we continue to expect annual savings of approximately $60 million and $80 million. In terms of the timing, savings for Project Next Century will not be realized until late 2011 with the majority coming in 2012 and 2013. During the quarter, we recorded net pretax charges of $4.5 million for Project Next Century, consisting mostly of accelerated depreciation. 
Now let me summarize. We are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results. Our goal for the remainder of the year is to successfully launch new products, including Hershey's Drops and Reese's Mini's and to maintain our marketplace momentum as we exit 2010 and enter 2011.
To support this objective, we plan to increase full year advertising expense by 50% to 60%. In addition, we expect to see some shift in 2011 seasonal orders from the fourth quarter 2010 into the first quarter of 2011 due to the timing and refinement of shipments. As a result, we reaffirm our full year 2010 net sales outlook of about 7% versus 2009, including an approximate one point benefit from current foreign currency exchange rates.
We have good visibility for our cost structure for the remainder of 2010 and expect input costs to be higher than the fourth quarter. Despite this increase, adjusted gross margin expected to be a bit higher in the fourth quarter, but not at the rate achieved in Q3, a potentially subject to the volatility of the dairy markets. Additionally, we do not expect LIFO inventory to be favorable as it was in Q4 2009. 
Given our strong business results, we will make additional fourth quarter strategic investments in both the U.S. and international markets that we do not initially plan. These investments will benefit Hershey both in the short and long term.
Aside from the aforementioned increase in advertising plans, this include acceleration and increase of Insights Driven Performance, additional selling and go-to-market strategies in both the U.S. and international markets and higher sampling to support new products and distribution. Given our continued momentum, we have increased our full year adjusted earnings per share diluted outlook and expect to be in the $2.52 to $2.56 range, an increase of mid- to high-teens on a percentage basis versus 2009 and greater than our previously estimated range of $2.47 to $2.52. 
As we look to 2011, we'll continue to focus on our core brands and leverage Hershey's scale at retail. Advertising expense is expected to increase in 2011. However, the year-over-year percentage will be lower than the previous two years.
Our current expectation for 2011 is for net sales growth to be within 3% to 5% long-term target. While we anticipate higher input cost in 2011, productivity and cost saving initiatives are in place to help mitigate the impact. Included in our productivity outlook is a portion of the additional $80 million to $100 million we identified at CAGNY. While we achieved more of these savings in the second half of 2010 that we initially estimated primarily in cost of sales, the majority of these savings will still be attained in 2011 and 2012. Although starting next year, some of these savings will also flow through the SM&A line.
Therefore, while still early, given our current use regarding business investment and cost structure, we expect 2011 growth in adjusted earnings per share diluted to be within our long-term target of 6% to 8%.
Let's now open it up for Q&A."

And then, within that category growth assumption, say, we don't see anything changes that longer-term growth algorithm for 2011. And we would expect to be competitive with respect to programming and share. So in the third quarter here, we were flattish on share. We're still up on a share this year on a year-to-date basis. And we would expect to get into takes in the marketplace as such that you start with that 3% to 4% assumption and assume we're going to be competitive within the share gain. And that's kind of how we start the algorithm. There is a lot of activity in the third quarter which we had talked to you about in July.

In the third quarter, we spent some time building out distribution. We will support our brand in China in the fourth quarter, when I talk about the incremental advertising spending that we're having in the fourth quarter. China is one of the places where we are certainly adding some sampling and some support behind our brand.

But remember, we have the Hershey's Drops and the Reese's Mini's that will ship in December, and so that innovation that becomes additive for us next year. We have other innovation in our pipeline for 2011 that we feel very good about. And so that will be an additive component for us next year. We are advertising and added some GRPs across the number of brands this year. We are in the fourth quarter, increasing the GRP levels on Mounds and Almond Joy and York. And then, we're were adding some advertising support across PayDay and Hershey's Syrup for the first time since 2001. So that will have to -- we think that the impression of the brand, and then we're also continuing to look at better sales force execution. And we're gaining some distribution points in the communities class of trade, as we brought on extra resources this year. So we have a number of additive leverage that we've invested in this year. And we'll start to test Insights Driven Performance, which we are investing in here pretty significantly in the back half of the year. It will be more on a pilot form next year. We think it will help us as we get set up for the last part of '11 and into 2012."

On a year-to-date basis, FDMxC W, so that's kind of 80% of the universe. So I'm talking year-to-date. Our takeaway is up 4.7%. So that's barely solid nine months through '10 to take away. And if you look at the third quarter takeaway, we were up roughly 3.5%. So our FDMxC W takeaway was 3.5%, and we held share within that 3.5%. So we still are seeing 3.5%, pick a number, 3.5%, 4.5% category in terms of takeaway growth. So good numbers. Within the third quarter, we were sequentially much better in the drug class trade for the first time in the number of quarters. We actually gained share in drug. And we talked about 3.2% takeaway and a 60 basis point gain in share in drug. And we were very pleased with the sequential improvement in the mass retailers. And in convenience, we held and gained a little bit of share, as well in the quarter. Where we lost share, the one area which I talked about, was we lost the last half of a share point in food, off of the 2.5% takeaway growth. And that's really where we lost some merchandising in the third quarter. We had talked about some new items that some of the other chocolate competitors were coming with in the third quarter. We lost some merchandising in food. And we also moved away from a promoted price point on one of our price that we didn't like particularly much in food that wasn't as profitable for us. 
So when I we think about the business overall in the third quarter, still a good category growth rate, although a little bit more of shared [indiscernible] remember, our innovation comes in the fourth quarter in the form of Reese's Mini's and Hershey's Drops. So overall, the category is still growing very well. We feel very good about it. We've got volume returns in this category, and I think the growth rates are pretty good. So the advertising it's working on the brands, we're putting in. And then we significantly added some advertising spending. We've been fortunate to be performing pretty well in the last few years within the U.S. business. And as that U.S. business has performed well, we've taken advantage of opportunity to go up and take the demand landscape, learning that worked so well for us in the U.S. And we used that learning in Canada, Mexico, China for example, and what we're now doing is accelerating our investments in go-to-market capabilities, as well as in brand building in those markets. So we've absorbed that type of ramp-up in spending in the international markets in our results for the last two years. And when we talk about next year, we also see similar kinds of investments in international within the long term, 6% to 8% number that we gave you. So we're able to continue to grow our earnings base and still do those international investments."

Clearly, brands with scale are the ones that will give you the better ROI. So you're right, there's certainly is a lag effect in terms of advertising spend today and brand building in consumer's minds and purchases in the future. 
So as we think about fourth quarter spend in particular, we do expect them, and we have our own internal calculations. I've had that impact in the first couple of quarters of next year. And certainly, there's a positive correlation. We look at those ROIs on a brand basis, on a monthly basis as well. So it's not something that we do at long intervals. We keep a constant review of what that ad spend is. When Dave mentioned Syrup and PayDay, which we haven't had on air since 2009. Certainly, there was a lot of analytical and work done around that -- our 2001, rather, a lot of analytical work beyond that to determine whether those were right two brands put on air and at what levels. 
So the only thing that I would add to that, which is a different dynamic, is in international markets, ROI certainly are lower. And that gets back to the scale comment that I meant earlier, the larger the brand, the greater lift you're going to get simply based on that scale. And so in the international market, it's more about long-term brand building. But in the U.S., their payoffs are much more immediate. And they normally, as we think of it, come in the next couple of quarters."

And in with respect to international, in the last two years, we've already made those investments. I think Bert mentioned the number was about 65% or so increase in ad spending in the international markets outside the U.S. in the third quarter. So that's already in our numbers. And so when you see the increases in advertising as we kind of roll through the year, what we are doing is really accelerating some of the strategic plan work that we're doing, with respect to the demand landscape work that we've shared with you to get some of the brands where we think we can activate some pretty smartly because they have some unique characteristics.

And competitively, we'd like to keep our particular commodity strategies a little bit more closer to the depth. I think in principle, Andrew, what you're seeing is absolutely right. Over time, you would like to offset and pass on the appropriate increase in your cost basket. We have been particularly aggressive, I think, within our supply chain, obviously, with the Global Supply Chain Transformation project that we completed, where we closed seven  facilities and built the new one in Monterrey, Mexico. We have what we're calling Project Next Century where we're working very hard to continue to improve the efficiencies of our bakeries -- of our plant here in Hershey, rebuilding a new facility and then invest a couple of hundred million dollars here in our whole market. 
So we look at those productivity program, as well as just better efficiency in the business by focusing on the core to have given us the flexibility to meet the issues within our cost basket, as well as our investment needs. But on a go-forward basis, I think in principle, I would say, we would like to be able to deal with input pressures and eventually be able to pass those along to the consumers as appropriate. But I think the other thing that's somewhat unique about the category is that it's so promotionally intensive and some of much of it was in the merchandising it's really less about list pricing and how come consumers think about promoted price points over time. And those are a little harder to move. They tend to move in bigger increments than simple list prices. So there's an algorithm for us that maybe a little bit more difficult to implement because of the significant portion of our business, which is seasonal and merchandise in that way. We have historically, as a category, tended to move in bigger increments on promoted prices. And then maybe you'd see in other categories. But we do, over time expect that we'd like to pass on those kinds of costs."

Those two segments are not contributing on a combined basis. They're not really contributing to category growth. It really still is very much a mainstream story. I think when we did take our pricing action that we announced in August of '08 and implemented really in '09 and then it still gets a little bit into early 2010, we did see volumes return a little more quickly than we would've expected from our modeling. So we were very encouraged by that. 
What we all have to continue to monitor is consumer behavior and where consumers are today and they're thinking about value. One of the big beautiful things about our category is it is an approachable luxury and/or indulgence at the time when consumers are looking for that. So the category dynamics right now, as I've said, we've got good growth in the category. It's a very volume-oriented category. And people are playing innovation approach right now in the category. We've looked very good about that. So we think the category growth rates are strong where they are. I don't want to talk very much about forward pricing. I think the one of the other factors is, as you taking a look at pricing, is what's happening around the entire rest of the basket. And I think there seems to be some inflationary pressure. Retailers are talking about it. And it looks like some other folks are also, in other categories are going to do some things. 
So that's also a big factor -- is our prices in any category moving up by themselves or are they moving in context of the entire basket? So all of those things, I think, would impact the way the modeling would work' for us. We clearly model it out constantly. And I think what I would say right now is, we're pretty comfortable with where our businesses and that we've got volume returning. And beyond, I don't think I'll comment any further on anything that's happened in the market."

But again, we are very anchored in the demand landscape in terms of what's incremental to the portfolio and where white spaces in the category. And I think we'll share some more of that when we get into the early part of the year, probably at CAGNY."

So this is something that we continuously look at, source of supply not just in Monterrey but throughout our network. We have experienced no issues in Monterrey with respect to our manufacturing facility. And we haven't experienced any issues bringing products across the borders, et cetera. As a matter of fact, that project went very well for us. It achieved its milestone. The productivity that we got from that back in '09 and closed up this year is very strong. So we're pleased with how that's gone. It's no different than any other supply situation. You continue to monitor your inventory levels, and it is something that's part of an ERM program we look at, but we are pleased with where we are."

And also, very focused against the productivity programs of which right now, we mentioned the CAGNY programs that starts to deliver even more next year, not just on cost of goods line but also below that. So at the moment, we feel pretty balanced the fact that we expect certainly commodity prices to be higher for next year. And then just put it in perspective, the only comment I made was that this year, our gross margin, as we all know, has really been terrific. We don't expect to see that next year.

It is a longer Easter season and therefore, you would expect just to probably have more Easter shipments than we would. But then as we've talked about Valentine's and Easter moving out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter, one of the reasons is because each is a little bit later. I think what you would expect though is to see it's really anomaly in aberration and takeaway. Because as Easter gets later into April, we get the first quarter data and first quarter market share. The category might look a little slower than normal. Because the stuff fills later in each of the large component and what happens in the March, April timeframe. So I think market share and takeaway might be more affected by the later Easter. But I think shipments will still fall within the first quarter. 
With respect to productivity, if you remember, we got the last slug of Global Supply Chain Transformation productivity in the first quarter of this year. And then we don't see the Next Century productivity for the fourth quarter of 2011. So those are the two big buckets. Other than that, we are on a standard cost system. So essentially, the cost increases that Bert talked about will get spread largely across the year, based on as volumes flows out. So you kind of come up with an average projected price for yourself on a standard basis that it just flows throughout the year. So for the most part, most of that commodity gets absorbed. But commodity increases, as Bert talked about, will just get absorbed across the year with a couple of caveats around the supply chain stuff."

Let me remind everyone listening that today's conference call may contain statements, which are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations, which are subject to risk and uncertainty. Actual results may vary materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those listed in this morning's press release and in our 10-K for 2009 filed with the SEC.
If you have not seen the press release, a copy is posted on our corporate website www.hersheys.com in the Investor Relations section. Included in the press release is a consolidated balance sheet and a summary of consolidated statements of income prepared in accordance with GAAP. Within the notes section of the press release, we have provided adjusted pro forma reconciliations of select income statement line items quantitatively reconciled to GAAP.
As we've said within the note, the company uses these non-GAAP measures as key metrics for evaluating performance internally. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP, rather the company believes the presentation of earnings, excluding certain items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations.
We will discuss our third quarter 2010 results, excluding net pretax charges. The 2010 charges relate to the Project Next Century program, while the 2009 charges are associated with the Global Supply Chain Transformation. These pretax charges were $4.5 million in the third quarter of 2010 and $11 million in the third quarter of 2009. Our discussion of any future projections will also exclude the impact of these net charges.
With that out of the way, let me turn the call over to Dave West."

I'm pleased that despite the macro economic challenges that persist, Hershey delivered another strong quarter of operating the marketplace results. During the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis, the CMG,",1666,"Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased that despite the macro economic challenges that persist, Hershey delivered another strong quarter of operating the marketplace results. 
During the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis, the CMG, that's candy, mint and gum category, continues to grow, outpacing salty snacks, cookies, crackers and bakery snacks. Our business is solid in all parts of the trade, and our retail partners value the importance of the confectionery category and the leadership that Hershey provides.
During these challenging times, retailers are looking for traffic and profitable solutions, and confectionery is one of the answers to both of these objectives.
Hershey's third quarter net sales reflected continued momentum of our brands. Net sales increased 4.2%, driven primarily by volume gains in both the U.S. and international markets as we continue to invest and execute in the marketplace.
Additionally, as we exited the third quarter, the timing of some seasonal shipments dampened third quarter net sales by approximately one point. These shipments have already occurred in early October and will be reflected in our fourth quarter results.
In terms of Hershey's marketplace performance, preliminary CMG consumer takeaway for the 12 weeks ending October 2 and the year-to-date periods for our custom database in channels that account for over 80% of our income business was up about 4% and 5%, respectively.
As a reminder, these challenges include food, drug, mass, including Wal-Mart and convenience stores. In the third quarter, I was particularly pleased with the sequential improvement in retail takeaway trend at one of our larger retail customers and in the drugstore channel.
We do want to note that during the third quarter, Nielsen contacted of some of their customers, including Hershey, and informed them that they are currently reviewing the projection methodology of their C Store universe for syndicated data. This is a C Store channel specific issue, impacting a number of categories and manufacturers with the impact limited to Q3 data.
We believe the data we have been provided and that we are sharing with you today is directionally correct, and that any potential adjustment will not materially impact our overall reported market share.
We continue to feel very good about our Convenience Store business. In Atlanta at the NACS conference, that's the National Association of Convenience Stores, two weeks ago, we had the opportunity to meet with our C Store customers. The constant theme was that Hershey and the confectionery category remains solid. 
Within FDMxC, that's food, drug, mass and convenience, here we're excluding Wal-Mart, preliminary Hershey and category growth for the 12 weeks ending October 2 and year-to-date period for our custom database increased relatively in line with the category's historical growth rate. Hershey's preliminary U.S. CMG market share is up 0.2 points for the year-to-date period and was flat in the third quarter. 
The category continues to perform well despite the macro economic challenges as confectionery is among the highest with respect to household penetration and impulse purchases. This impulsivity continues to translate to merchandising opportunities. And as we move to the balance of the year, the category is a seasonal destination, with our branded products remaining available at reasonable price points. As a result, we would expect the category to continue to consistently secure key merchandising and programming space and to grow within the historical 3% to 4% range. 
The category continues to be driven by mainstream everyday confections, as trade up, gifting and novelty sub segments remain soft.
Year-to-date, premium and trade up chocolate on a net basis is about flat. As we stated in July, as expected, there were investments by major manufacturers in this category in the form of innovation and trial inducing programs during the quarter. Activity varies by channel, and despite this, Hershey retail takeaway increased in all channels.
In the third quarter, food process trade category growth was plus 4.2%. Hershey retail takeaway increased 2.5% in the third quarter, resulting in a market share decline of 0.5 points in Q3 in the food class trade. However, Hershey's food channel market share is still up 0.1 points year-to-date. Q3 results were due to the year-over-year timing of innovation, merchandising and program. Marketplace activity can and will vary from quarter-to-quarter, and our programming for the balance of the year in the food class trade is solid.
This year's Halloween season is marked by a bit of an unusual calendar. Labor Day was late, September 6 and October 31 falls on a Sunday. With this pattern, we expect consumer purchases to be especially compressed towards the end of the season. To date, customer Halloween orders and retail sell-through are tracking in line with our expectations, although we will not have a complete read on sell-through for another couple of weeks.
Halloween-specific seasonal promotions, merchandising and advertising are being executed. We believe we made the necessary investments to ensure solid category sell-through, and we work closely with key customers over the next 10 days to monitor consumer reaction and shopping behavior.
Turning now to the C Store class trade. In Q3, Hershey's preliminary C Store takeaway increased for the 10th consecutive quarter and was up within historical category growth rate, resulting in a share gain of approximately 0.2 points. On a year-to-date basis in the C Store channel, syndicated data indicates we have gained 0.6 market share points. 
In Q3, Hershey's C Store chocolate and non-chocolate performance was solid, driven by volume and mix as both standard loose bars and King Size pack types performed well in the marketplace behind the Reese's DOUBLE THE LOVE promotion and the 2 for $2.50 King Size promotion and the Hershey's Pure Happiness standard bar program.
In the fourth quarter, we expect convenience stores to remain on track behind NCAA football tie-ins, as well as additional King Size and standard bar programming. 
In the third quarter, our business in the drug class trade improved. For the 12 weeks ended October 2, Hershey's retail takeaway in this channel increased 3.2%, resulting in a market share gain of 0.6 points. While this is partly a result of easier comps versus a year-ago period, we have notably increased our level of investment and focus on this channel and are markedly improving our results.
As we look to the remainder of the year, we have strong initiatives in place during the fourth quarter across all channels. Some of the core brand merchandising and consumer promotions include NCAA football promotion, and for the holiday season, we're offering consumers a free customized photo calendar and coffee mug in conjunction with snapfish with the purchase of two participating Hershey's candy products.
We're also adding excitement for our traditional holiday and baking programming, with the Bake Share and Win promotion. And we are most excited about the December launch of Hershey's Drops and Reese's Mini's.
In Q4, versus our previous expectation, we'll accelerate the timing of and begin execution of certain aspects of our strategic plan. Therefore, SG&A spending will rise sharply and be driven by higher levels of incremental investments in the building out of the Insights Driven Performance initiative, further going market strategies in both the U.S. and other markets around the world as we add selling capability and points of distribution in global markets, such as Mexico and China.
We'll increase sampling supporting new products, especially in the markets where we are adding points of distribution. Advertising expense will increase and for the full year is now expected to be up 50% to 60%. This is greater than our previous estimate of a 45% to 50% increase. We'll increase spending on brands on which we initiated activity earlier this year. Reese's, Mounds, Almond Joy and York have responded to ad spending and will accelerate towards continuity levels of GRPs on these brands. We will also begin airing copy on Hershey's Syrup and PayDay for the first time since 2001. And we'll be adding to our consumer spending in Mexico, China and Canada as we complete and implement our demand landscape learning in these geographies.
Over the remainder of the year, we expect the macro economic challenges facing this consumer to continue. Category growth rates will most likely to continue to fluctuate from to quad-to-quad. Importantly, the inherent characteristics of the category I spoke about earlier should endure, resulting in the category grown within its historical growth rate of 3% to 4% in                             2010 and 2011. 
Our plans are in place for the upcoming key seasonal periods. As a result, we reiterate our full year  2010 net sales target outlook of about 7% increase including approximately one point benefit from foreign currency exchange rates.
For the full year, we have good visibility in our cost structure, and while input cost will be higher in the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBIT margin to expand. Therefore, we have increased our full year adjusted earnings per share-diluted outlook and expected to be in the $2.52 to $2.56 range, an increase of mid- to high-teens on a percentage basis versus 2009,   and greater than our previously estimated range of $2.47 to $2.52.   
As we plan for 2011, we believe macro economic challenges and consumer confidence will continue to be a headwind. However, we believe category dynamics, similar to those I've discussed, and continued support of our brands will enable the category and Hershey to grow.
In 2011, we expect our advertising expense to increase. However, the year-over-year percentage increase will not be at the rates achieved over the last two years. As a result, our initial expectation for 2011 is for net sales growth within our 3% to 5% long-term objective. While we do anticipate higher input cost in 2011, productivity and cost-saving initiatives are in place to help mitigate the impact. Therefore, based on our current views and expectations for 2011, we expect growth and adjusted earnings per share diluted within our current long-term target of 6% to 8%.
I'll now turn it over to Bert who will provide some additional financial details."
98873,113876854,81023,"Hershey Co., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","The Hershey Company","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Hershey posted another quarter of quality results, as third quarter consolidated net sales of $1,547,000,000 increased 4.2% versus the prior year and adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.79 increased 8.2%.O",1813,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Hershey posted another quarter of quality results, as third quarter consolidated net sales of $1,547,000,000 increased 4.2% versus the prior year and adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.79 increased 8.2%.
Overall, year-over-year result were driven by volume, mix, net price realization and supply chain savings which more than offset increases in marketing investments and selling capabilities. The third quarter sales gain of 4.2% was driven primarily by the continued growth of our core brands including new products. As we ended the quarter, the timing of some seasonal shipments lowered our third quarter net sales by about one point. Therefore, our fourth quarter seasonal shipments will be greater than the prior year, maintaining our full year net sales outlook of about 7%. In addition, lower levels of customer returns in markdowns, as well as the July 2009 carryover pricing in Canada, generated net price realization of about one point, while favorable foreign currency rates contributed approximately a half point.
During the third quarter, adjusted gross margin increased 290 basis points, driven by favorable supply chain efficiencies, including continued higher productivity, favorable sales mix and lower levels of obsolescence. Input costs were about flat in the quarter and favorable versus our previous estimate as a result of certain commodity strategies executed in Q3. We currently have good visibility for our cost structure for the remainder of the year and expect input cost to be higher in the fourth quarter versus prior year. Despite this increase, year-over-year adjusted gross margin is expected to be a bit higher in the fourth quarter but below the rate achieved in the third quarter.
Third quarter adjusted EBIT margins of 19.7% is up 10 basis points. This is driven primarily by higher adjusted gross margin, offset by higher advertising expense, up about  46%; selling expenses, as we continue to invest in consumer insight in building global capabilities and employee-related expenses. As Dave stated earlier, we continue to invest in our core brands and expect full year advertising expense to increase 50% to 60%, greater than our previous estimate of 45% to 50%. 
So as the last year, as previously communicated, we are planning additional advertising in the fourth quarter in both the U.S. and other key markets to enable a strong start to 2011. We expect adjusted EBIT margin to expand for the full year, although it will be lower versus the fourth quarter of last year.
And that's due to lower gross margin expansion as well as business investments, which Dave already described.
Now let me provide an update on our international businesses. Overall, our reported sales outside the U.S. increased low double digits. And on a reported and constant-currency basis, sales increased in our largest international markets. While in Asia, we focused on preparing for the upcoming Chinese New Year. During the third quarter, strategic investments in brand building and go-to-market strategies were higher, including an advertising increase of 65% outside of North America.
As a result of our local currency basis, operating income increased in Canada but declined in the rest of our emerging market businesses. We are committed to investing in our international businesses. And we anticipate that these investments will generate meaningful brand awareness and some raw faith over time.
Moving further down to P&L. For the quarter, interest expense was $22.3 million, consistent with the prior period. In 2010, we now expect interest expense to be down about 1% versus 2009. The tax rate for the third quarter was 35.1% or 210 basis points less than the prior year due to the impact of interim tax accounting and a favorable income mix among geographies. For the full year, we now expect the tax rate to be about 35% to 35.5%, slightly higher than our previous estimate of 35%.
In the third quarter of 2010, weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were $230.5 million versus $229.6 million in 2009, leading to adjusted earnings per share diluted of $0.79, up 8.2% versus a year ago.
Let me provide a quick recap of our year-to-date results. Net sales increased 7.6%. Adjusted gross margin was 43% year-to-date versus 38.3% last year. Gains were driven primarily by favorable supply chain efficiencies including volume and greater levels of productivity. Favorable mix and low obsolescence also contributed. Adjusted EBIT increased 23.5%, thus resulting an EBIT margin gain of 230 basis points to 18.3% from 16%. Advertising increased 54% on a year-to-date basis. And adjusted earnings per share diluted for the nine-month period increased 26% to $1.94 per share.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. At the end of the third quarter, net trading capital is relatively in line with last year. Accounts receivable was up $38 million and remains extremely current and of high quality. We continuously monitor our accounts receivable aging, and despite current macro economic conditions, we have not seen an impact on our customers' payment patterns to date. 
Inventory increased $35 million, driven partially by previously mentioned timing of the third quarter sales, while accounts payable increased by $65 million. We do expect net trading capital to improve in the fourth quarter, as we cycle through the peak seasonal period of our business. 
In terms of other specific cash flow items, capital additions,  including software, were $49 million in the third quarter and $124 million year-to-date. The amounts included $20 million of Project Next Century capital expenditures. For 2010, we're targeting total capital additions to be in the $190 million to $210 million range. This range includes base ongoing CapEx of $140 million to $160 million plus Project Next Century CapEx of approximately $50 million. 
Depreciation and amortization was $52 million in the period, including a solid depreciation of approximately $6 million. Year-to-date, reported depreciation amortization was $146 million and included $7 million of accelerated depreciation related to the Next Century program. 
Therefore, adjusted operating depreciation and amortization year-to-date was approximately $139 million. In 2010, we are forecasting total operating depreciation and amortization of  $175 million to $185 million, while accelerated depreciation amortization related to Project Next Century is expected to be $10 million to $15 million.
Dividend space during the quarter were $71 million. We did not acquire stock in the third quarter related to the outstanding repurchase program. There remains 100 million outstanding on the current authorization. Year-to-date, approximately 133 million of our common shares have been repurchased to replace shares issued in conjunction with stock option exercises and option replenishment is about current at quarter end.
Cash on hand at the end of the third quarter was $245 million, up versus the year ago period and relatively in line with 2009 year-end balance. As we exit the third quarter, we are well positioned to manage the capital needs of the business as well as higher capital expenditure requirements of Project Next Century. 
Now let me provide an update on Project Next Century. I'm pleased to confirm that we have begun work on West Hershey plant expansion. Excavation on the property has begun, and we expect to begin receiving manufacturing equipment during the third quarter of 2011. We also anticipate initial production line startup during the fourth quarter of 2011 with continued rollout and implementation throughout 2012.
The forecast for total pretax GAAP charges and nonrecurring project implementation costs remains at $140 million to $170 million. For 2010, total GAAP charges related to the program are expected to be $75 million to $85 million. 
By 2014, when we continue to expect annual savings of approximately $60 million and $80 million. In terms of the timing, savings for Project Next Century will not be realized until late 2011 with the majority coming in 2012 and 2013. During the quarter, we recorded net pretax charges of $4.5 million for Project Next Century, consisting mostly of accelerated depreciation. 
Now let me summarize. We are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results. Our goal for the remainder of the year is to successfully launch new products, including Hershey's Drops and Reese's Mini's and to maintain our marketplace momentum as we exit 2010 and enter 2011.
To support this objective, we plan to increase full year advertising expense by 50% to 60%. In addition, we expect to see some shift in 2011 seasonal orders from the fourth quarter 2010 into the first quarter of 2011 due to the timing and refinement of shipments. As a result, we reaffirm our full year 2010 net sales outlook of about 7% versus 2009, including an approximate one point benefit from current foreign currency exchange rates.
We have good visibility for our cost structure for the remainder of 2010 and expect input costs to be higher in the fourth quarter. Despite this increase, adjusted gross margin expected to be a bit higher in the fourth quarter, but not at the rate achieved in Q3, a potentially subject to the volatility of the dairy markets. Additionally, we do not expect LIFO inventory to be favorable as it was in Q4 2009. 
Given our strong business results, we will make additional fourth quarter strategic investments in both the U.S. and international markets that we do not initially plan. These investments will benefit Hershey both in the short and long term.
Aside from the aforementioned increase in advertising plans, these include acceleration and increase of Insights Driven Performance, additional selling and go-to-market strategies in both the U.S. and international markets and higher sampling to support new products and distribution. Given our continued momentum, we have increased our full year adjusted earnings per share-diluted outlook and expect to be in the $2.52 to $2.56 range, an increase of mid- to high-teens on a percentage basis versus 2009 and greater than our previously estimated range of $2.47 to $2.52. 
As we look to 2011, we'll continue to focus on our core brands and leverage Hershey's scale at retail. Advertising expense is expected to increase in 2011. However, the year-over-year percentage will be lower than the previous two years.
Our current expectation for 2011 is for net sales growth to be within 3% to 5% long-term target. While we anticipate higher input cost in 2011, productivity and cost saving initiatives are in place to help mitigate the impact. Included in our productivity outlook is a portion of the additional $80 million to $100 million we identified at CAGNY. While we achieved more of these savings in the second half of 2010 that we initially estimated primarily in cost of sales, the majority of these savings will still be attained in 2011 and 2012. Although starting next year, some of these savings will also flow through the SM&A line.
Therefore, while still early, given our current views regarding business investments and cost structure, we expect 2011 growth in adjusted earnings per share diluted to be within our long-term target of 6% to 8%.
Let's now open it up for Q&A."

This is a 3% of 4% growth category. Actually, on a year-to-date basis, this is growing a little bit better than that 4%. So we would start with the category growth assumption. And then, within that category growth assumption, say, we don't see anything changes that longer-term growth algorithm for 2011. And we would expect to be competitive with respect to programming and share. So in the third quarter here, we were flattish on share. We're still up on a share this year on a year-to-date basis. And we would expect the gives and the takes in the marketplace are such that you start with that 3% to 4% assumption and assume we're going to be competitive within the share gain. And that's kind of how we start the algorithm. There was a lot of activity in the third quarter, which we had talked to you about in July. That was around innovation for some of the competitors in gum and in chocolate. And that happened in the third quarter.

And we're gaining some distribution points in the convenience class of trade, as we brought on extra resources this year. So we have a number of additive leverage that we've invested in this year. And we'll start to test Insights Driven Performance, which we are investing in here pretty significantly in the back half of the year. It will be more on a pilot form next year. We think it will help us as we get set up for the last part of '11 and into 2012."

I'll probably just give you some perspective. On a year-to-date basis, FDMxC W, so that's kind of 80% of the universe. So I'm talking year-to-date. Our takeaway is up 4.7%. So that's barely solid nine months through '10 to take away.",505,"Good questions, Rob. I'll probably just give you some perspective. On a year-to-date basis, FDMxC W, so that's kind of 80% of the universe. So I'm talking year-to-date. Our takeaway is up 4.7%. So that's barely solid nine months through '10 to take away. And if you look at the third quarter takeaway, we were up roughly 3.5%. So our FDMxC W takeaway was 3.5%, and we held share within that 3.5%. So we still are seeing 3.5%, pick a number, 3.5%, 4.5% category in terms of takeaway growth. So good numbers. Within the third quarter, we were sequentially much better in the drug class trade for the first time in the number of quarters. We actually gained share in drug. And we talked about 3.2% takeaway and a 60 basis point gain in share in drug. And we were very pleased with the sequential improvement in the mass retailers. And in convenience, we held and gained a little bit of share, as well in the quarter. Where we lost share, the one area, which I talked about, was we lost the last half of a share point in food, off of the 2.5% takeaway growth. And that's really where we lost some merchandising in the third quarter. We had talked about some new items that some of the other chocolate competitors were coming with in the third quarter. We lost some merchandising in food. And we also moved away from a promoted price point on one of our pack types that we didn't like particularly much in food that wasn't as profitable for us. 
So when I we think about the business overall in the third quarter, still good category growth rates, although a little bit more of share skirmish. And remember, our innovation comes in the fourth quarter in the form of Reese's Mini's and Hershey's Drops. So overall, the category is still growing very well. We feel very good about it. We've got volume returns in this category, and I think the growth rates are pretty good. So the advertising it's working on the brands, we're putting in. And then we significantly added some advertising spending. We've been fortunate to be performing pretty well in the last few years within the U.S. business. And as that U.S. business has performed well, we've taken advantage of the opportunity to go up and take the demand landscape learning that worked so well for us in the U.S. And we used that learning in Canada, Mexico, China for example, and what we're now doing is accelerating our investments in go-to-market capabilities, as well as in brand building in those markets. So we've absorbed that type of ramp-up in spending in the international markets in our results for the last two years. And when we talk about next year, we also see similar kinds of investments in international within the long term, 6% to 8% number that we gave you. So we're able to continue to grow our earnings base and still do those international investments."

Clearly, brands with scale are the ones that will give you the better ROI. So you're right, there's certainly is a lag effect in terms of advertising spend today and brand building in consumer's minds and purchases in the future. 
So as we think about fourth quarter spend in particular, we do expect them, and we have our own internal calculations of how that impacts the first couple of quarters of next year. And certainly, there's a positive correlation. We look at those ROIs on a brand basis, on a monthly basis as well. So it's not something that we do at long intervals. We keep a constant review of what that ad spend is. When Dave mentioned Syrup and PayDay, which we haven't had on air since 2009. Certainly, there was a lot of analytical and work done around that -- or 2001, rather, a lot of analytical work beyond that to determine whether those were right two brands to put on air and at what levels. 
So the only thing that I would add to that, which is a different dynamic, is in international markets, ROIs certainly are lower. And that gets back to the scale comment that I meant earlier, the larger the brand, the greater lift you're going to get simply based on that scale. And so in the international market, it's more about long-term brand building. But in the U.S., their payoffs are much more immediate. And they normally, as we think of it, come in the next couple of quarters."

And in with respect to international, in the last two years, we've already made those investments. I think Bert mentioned the number was about 65% or so increase in ad spending in the international markets outside the U.S. in the third quarter. So that's already in our numbers. And so when you see the increases in advertising as we kind of roll through the year, what we are doing is really accelerating some of the strategic plan work that we're doing, with respect to the demand landscape work that we've shared with you to get some of the brands where we think we can activate them pretty smartly because they have some unique characteristics.

And competitively, we'd like to keep our, particularly our commodity strategies a little bit more closer to the vest. I think in principle, Andrew, what you're saying is absolutely right. Over time, you would like to offset and pass on the appropriate increase in your cost basket. We have been particularly aggressive, I think, within our supply chain, obviously, with the Global Supply Chain Transformation project that we completed, where we closed seven  facilities and built the new one in Monterrey, Mexico. We have what we're calling Project Next Century where we're working very hard to continue to improve the efficiencies of our bakeries -- of our plant here in Hershey, rebuilding a new facility, we're going to invest a couple of hundred million dollars here in our home market. 
So we look at those productivity programs, as well as just better efficiency in the business by focusing on the core to have given us the flexibility to meet the issues within our cost basket, as well as our investment needs. But on a go-forward basis, I think in principle, I would say, we would like to be able to deal with input pressures and eventually be able to pass those along to the consumers as appropriate. But I think the other thing that's somewhat unique about the category is that it's so promotionally intensive and so much of it moves under merchandising, it's really less about list pricing and how come consumers think about promoted price points over time. And those are a little harder to move. They tend to move in bigger increments than simple list prices. So there's an algorithm for us that maybe a little bit more difficult to implement because of the significant portion of our business, which is seasonal and merchandised in that way. We have historically, as a category, tended to move in bigger increments on promoted prices than maybe you'd see in other categories. But we do, over time expect that we'd like to pass on those kinds of costs."

Premium and trade up when you look at it at an aggregate is about roughly flat for the year. Those two segments are not contributing on a combined basis. They're not really contributing to category growth. It really still is very much a mainstream story. I think when we did take our pricing action that we announced in August of '08 and implemented really in '09 and then it spilled over a little bit into early 2010, we did see volumes return a little more quickly than we would've expected from our modeling. So we were very encouraged by that. 
What we all have to continue to monitor is consumer behavior and where consumers are today and how they're thinking about value. One of the big beautiful things about our category is it is an approachable luxury and/or indulgence at a time when consumers are looking for that. So the category dynamics right now, as I've said, we've got good growth in the category. It's a very volume-oriented category. And people are playing the innovation approach right now in the category. We've feel very good about that. So we think the category growth rates are strong where they are. I don't want to talk very much about forward pricing. I think the one of the other factors is, as you’re taking a look at pricing, is what's happening around you in the entire rest of the basket. And I think there seems to be some inflationary pressure. Retailers are talking about it. And it looks like some other folks are also, in other categories are going need to do some things. 
So that's also a big factor -- is our prices in any category moving up by themselves or are they moving in context of the entire basket? So all of those things, I think, would impact the way the modeling would work' for us. We clearly model it out constantly. And I think what I would say right now is, we're pretty comfortable with where our businesses and that we've got volume returning. And beyond, I don't think I'll comment any further on anything that's happened in the market."

We have experienced no issues in Monterrey with respect to our manufacturing facility. And we haven't experienced any issues bringing products across the borders, et cetera. As a matter of fact, that project went very well for us. It achieved its milestone. The productivity that we got from that back in '09 and closed up this year is very strong. So we're pleased with how that's gone. It's no different than any other supply situation. You continue to monitor your inventory levels, and it is something that's part of an ERM program we look at, but we are pleased with where we are."

Certainly, at this time of the year, we start to get some reasonable visibility. In terms of next year, we're very focused on being able to say more about that later on. And also, very focused against the productivity programs of which right now, we mentioned the CAGNY programs that starts to deliver even more next year, not just on cost of goods line but also below that. So at the moment, we feel pretty balanced despite the fact that we expect certainly commodity prices to be higher for next year. And then just put it in perspective, the only comment I made was that this year, our gross margin, as we all know, has really been terrific. We don't expect to see that next year.

In terms of mix, the Reese's Minis and the Hershey's Drops will be in both take-home, stand-up bags, as well as in King Size formats on the front end. So I think from a mix standpoint, probably looks similar to the what the rest of the portfolio would look like, although we are very excited about the ability to get some hand-to-mouth activity on our biggest brands, Hershey and Reese's which we haven't had. So we hope that it will become a very good and consumable item in the convenience and front ends of the stores.

It is a longer Easter season and therefore, you would expect just to probably have more Easter shipments than we would. But then as we've talked about Valentine's and Holiday moving out of the -- Valentine's moving out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter, one of the reasons is because Easter is a little bit later. I think what you would expect, though, is to see it's really anomaly in aberration and takeaway. Because as Easter gets later into April, when you look at first quarter data and first quarter market share, the category might look a little slower than normal because the stuff fills later. Easter is a large component of what happens in that March, April timeframe. So I think market share and takeaway might be more affected by the later Easter. But I think shipments will still fall within the first quarter. 
With respect to productivity, if you remember, we got the last slug of Global Supply Chain Transformation productivity in the first quarter of this year. And then we don't see the Next Century productivity for the fourth quarter of 2011. So those are the two big buckets. Other than that, we are on a standard cost system. So essentially, the cost increases that Bert talked about will get spread largely across the year, based on as volumes flows out. So you kind of come up with an average projected price for yourself on a standard basis and it just flows throughout the year. So for the most part, most of that commodity gets absorbed. But commodity increases, as Bert talked about, will just get absorbed across the year with a couple of caveats around the supply chain stuff."
