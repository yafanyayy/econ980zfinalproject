With me on the call today is our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Hirsch. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We will make forward-looking statements about, among other matters, adjusted revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating margins, free cash flow, sales pipelines, and our strategic initiative, Fiserv 2.0. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release, which can be found on our website at fiserv.com, for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our earnings release for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call and for a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional, meaningful comparisons between current results and prior-reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods.Let me say upfront that we are pleased with our results for the quarter. Adjusted internal revenue growth was back into positive territory, capitalizing on the strong fundamentals of our business model. Earlier in the year, we shared our belief that revenue growth momentum was building, which would produce quarter-over-quarter improvements and positive revenue growth by year end. As you've seen by our results today, we delivered on that expectation. That said, 2009 was, by any measure, a challenge. We began the year with an unprecedented level of economic uncertainty. The financial services sector, was a bit weaker to the point where some industry pundits question the long-term viability of the entire system. Through the economic turbulence, we were confident and remain so today, in the long-term prospects of the financial services industry and also that the structure of the U.S. banking system would persevere. I will comment about the industry environment later in the call. Our confidence in the longevity of the industry was matched by the strength of our business model and the diversity of our client base. We finished 2009 on a high note, with strong fourth quarter financial performance and December sales results that were the highest in the company's history. Each of these markers is an important sign leading to higher levels of sustainable revenue and earnings growth. Our 2% adjusted internal revenue growth rate in the quarter was at the top end of our recent guidance, with total GAAP revenue also increasing 2% to $1.06 billion.Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter were $0.94 and free cash flow in the quarter exceeded $160 million. Despite market conditions, we grew adjusted earnings per share 10% in 2009 to a record level of $3.66. Free cash flow of $668 million was also an all-time high. And as important, free cash flow per share was up sharply to $4.30.We clearly felt the impact of the environment on our top line, with adjusted revenue declining just under 1% for the year. This decline included headwinds such as significant reductions in termination fees, which were indicative of the market challenges. Full year adjusted operating margin increased more than 100 basis points due to favorable shifts in our business mix and strong execution of our operational effectiveness initiatives. Based on strong performance in the quarter and for the full year, we increased the amount of our discretionary profit-sharing as compared to 2008. As Tom will explain in a moment, the incremental accrual negatively impacted our consolidated margin in the quarter by about 100 basis points. We ask our associates do our work hard as ever in 2009 while managing costs extraordinarily well, faced up after the challenge, delivered strong results and continue to partner with our clients.You will recall that we had a three key enterprise priorities in 2009. First, to meet our earnings commitments while maintaining capital flexibility. Next, to continue the integration efforts with an increased focus on revenue opportunities and product innovation. And third, to enhance our go-to-market approach, leading to increased sales results to new and existing clients.To our first priority, we delivered 2009 earnings within our original guidance range. For the year, we grew adjusted earnings to a record level of $3.66 per share and increased adjusted operating margin by 110 basis points. Our earnings growth is particularly notable in light of the significant decline in high-margin termination fees and float income versus 2008.We delivered $668 million in free cash flow during 2009, up 11% for the year and at the very top of our original guidance. We also actively managed our capital in 2009 through the repurchase of 4.1 million shares of stock and $475 million of debt repayment. We continue to focus on our second priority of delivering market facing integration. We had a strong finish to the year, generating over $40 million of integrated sales in the quarter and $117 million for the full year. This was 30% more than our 2009 objective of $90 million and 36% higher than 2008. Our numerous sales wins, many of which were competitive takeaways, validates that Fiserv clients want the integration of our market-leading products such as online banking, bill payment, source capture and debit processing, with our industry-leading account processing solutions.These client benefits were evident across our payment solutions with 407 bill payment wins and 215 new debit clients this year. Over the last two years since the acquisition of CheckFree, we have added 1,370 new client relationships in these two strategic payment solutions, and we still have a significant amount of penetration opportunity ahead.We also capitalized on several product innovation opportunities in 2009. We invested in Acumen, a powerful new account processing platform for credit unions, which has experienced tremendous success in Canada, winning a substantial majority of all of the deals at play. Importantly, we recently won our first U.S. client, Christian Community Credit Union, a $500 million credit union, that is within the larger segment of that market where we expect Acumen to gain material share over the next several years.  We also continued to invest next generation products such as Mobile Money, P2P [person-to-person] payments and analytics as a service, all of which are center stage in the dialogue with our clients.We continued to optimize our expense structure in 2009, generating over $100 million of cost savings well ahead of our $60 million target for the year. The majority of the above target savings came from better-than-expected cost synergies resulting from the CheckFree acquisition. While we are ahead of our original timetable with our cost saves, we continued to identify new opportunities to optimize our overall cost structure. The over performance and cost saves have provided a larger opportunity to invest during a dynamic time in the market. We are committed to making strategic investments and products today that will create value for clients and secure our market leadership position for years to come.To our third priority, as we shared with you at Investor Day, we believe we can to improve our growth rate by changing how we go to market. We made important progress, which is reflected in our sales results and in particular, in the fourth quarter this year. We won several large integrated account processing transactions during the year, such as American Savings Bank and Tesco Bank, which are illustrative proved points of our market strategy. Importantly, the changes that we have made over the last several years made these types of deals possible, and we expect there will be even more market recognition of our strategy moving forward.In addition to the steps we took last year, we have made organizational changes in 2010, deferred to capitalize on significant market opportunity, with increased speed, agility and focus. As part of these changes, we've added leadership talent to the organization and also reconfigured our go-to-market approach. First, we created a single global sales organization, which will include new sales and enterprise account management. Tom Warsop, who as you know, was one of our Group Presidents, will assume the Chief Sales Officer role and lead our go-to-market efforts. In addition to Tom's three years at Fiserv, he spent nearly 18 years at EDS [Electronic Data Systems} in a variety of leadership roles, with the majority of his time focused on leading their efforts in large, complex enterprise sales and also service delivery across the financial services industry. As we witnessed at Investor Day, Tom brings a high degree of experience, expertise and passion to the position. Our organization is excited and enthusiastic about these changes as they recognize the power of going to market as one Fiserv.  We expect these changes to lead to increased win rates, as well as higher levels of product penetration across the mid and large tiers of the market. We also combined the majority of our payments in Internet Banking businesses under one group, which will be led by Steve Olsen. We believe that the convergence and payments technologies, along with our focus to unlock the material DDA-based [demand deposit account] payments opportunity, warranted the combination of these important market-facing solutions.Our Account Processing and related businesses will now be led by Steve Tait, who joined Fiserv in November 2009. Steve brings over 25 years of progressive senior leadership experience, with roles at Xerox, the Gartner Group and was most recently, President and CEO of RSM McGladrey. Steve has a deep understanding of technology and services, which will serve us well in leading this important area of the company.Mike Giannoni, who most recently led our Investment Services business, becomes the Group President, leading our Financial Institutions group. In addition to Investment Services, this area includes risks, lending and revenue enhancement solutions, which are delivered around the world. We are excited about the changes we are sharing with you today. We believe they will have a positive impact on our results in 2010 and well beyond. We are focused on achieving heightened levels of profitable growth, and we will continue to lead in a way that delivers superior results for our clients, our shareholders and our associates.  Now, let me turn the call over to Tom for a deeper dive on the financial results."

I am pleased to report that we closed the divestitures of our Loan Fulfillment Solutions business and the remaining portion of our Trust business, known as ask Fiserv ISS [Investment Support Services] in the fourth quarter. These dispositions complete the majority of the work that we started several years ago to reshape your company.As we shared at Investor Day, this repositioning has allowed us to focus our resources on a more tightly integrated set of complementary businesses with attractive scale, network economics and better long-term growth prospects. So for my discussion today, I will refer to the supplemental information included in the slide presentation. You will note this quarter that our results are a bit easier to understand, as the dispositions and one-time items are largely behind us.Our fourth quarter adjusted internal revenue grew 2% over the prior year, which is at the top end of our guidance for the quarter. Total GAAP revenue also increased 2% to $1.06 billion. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.94, up 6% compared with the prior year and excludes a $0.04 per share per benefit, primarily related to the reversal of a pre-acquisition liability associated with the acquisition of CheckFree.Adjusted operating income was $283 million for the quarter and $1.11 billion for the year. Our year-to-date adjusted operating margin of 28.7% increased to 110 basis points compared to 2008, due to an improved business mix and operating efficiencies.Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter was 28.1%, a decline of 20 basis points in 2008. As Jeff mentioned, given our strong performance in the quarter and the year, we elected to double the amount of discretionary profit-sharing for all eligible associates in 2009, which resulted in approximately $10 million of incremental expense in the quarter.  This item, which negatively impacted margin by roughly 100 basis points in the quarter, was intended to reward the strong performance of our associates and to partially offset compensation actions instituted in 2009. Turning to Slide 6, adjusted revenue for the year was down slightly, just under 1%, as our business model showed its resiliency during one of the most challenging years that the financial industry has ever seen. This resiliency is the product of our high level of recurring revenue, large client base, long-term client contracts and the mission-critical nature of our products and services. Not withstanding the environment, the quality of our earnings has never been better. We generated record adjusted earnings of $3.66 per share, an increase of 10% over the prior year and expanded operating margin by more than 100 basis points compared with 2008. In fact, since 2006, we have sustainably improved company operating margin by almost 600 basis points from 22.9% to 28.7%.Our earnings and margin growth in 2009 is even more notable in light of the reduction in high margin termination fees and float income. We generated a record $668 million of free cash flow for the year. On a per-share basis, free cash flow per share grew 16% in 2009 to $4.30 per share, compared with $3.70 per share in 2008. Our free cash flow per share was 17% higher than our adjusted earnings per share in 2009. These results reflect strong working capital management and consistent capital allocation. While we recognized that free cash flow per share will not grow at a level that far in excess of earnings each year, we do believe our model will provide free cash flow in excess of adjusted earnings over the long term.Now onto the segment results. The Payment segment generated 2% adjusted internal revenue growth in the quarter, with adjusted revenue of $513 million. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted revenue was $1.95 billion, up 1% over the prior year. We continue to see attractive growth in our Debit, Online Banking and Bill Payment businesses, which make up a majority of the Payment segment.Transaction volumes from our debit products continue to accelerate much more rapidly than the market. As an example, debit and network transactions grew with strong 24% in the quarter and 20% over the prior year. The above market growth rates are a result of strong integrated sales to our account processing base and the earlier adoption of debit by consumers served by our community-based institutions, who are still building up their monthly usage. The debit client base continues to expand at a healthy level, with over 200 client wins in 2009, which are larger in size and term that in the prior year. New bill payment sales were also strong with the signing of over 400 clients in 2009, many of which are competitive takeaways. While most of our clients transaction volume grew at double-digit rates in 2009, overall transaction volume growth for the year was somewhat muted by lower-than-anticipated volume at some larger clients. And also the acquisition of a remittance only client, which specifically impacted fourth quarter growth versus the same quarter last year.  We remain very bullish in that solutions set and the underlying revenue growth, which we can see today. Adjusted operating income for the Payment segment was $164 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin of 32.1% was up 80 basis points over the last year. For the year, segment adjusted operating income was up 7% to $670 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 170 basis points to 31.7%. The increase in adjusted operating margin in this segment for both the fourth quarter and year, was driven primarily by strong operating leverage in our Transaction-Based businesses and operational efficiencies from the CheckFree acquisition.The Financial Institution segment generated revenue of $497 million in the quarter, up 1% compared with the prior year. For the full year, revenue was down 3% to $1.94 billion compared to the prior year. Adjusted internal revenue was flat in the quarter and declined 4% for the year. Excluding a $7 million reduction in termination fees in the quarter, internal revenue growth would have been approximately 2%. And for the full year, excluding the $35 million decline in termination fees, internal revenue would have declined about 2%.The very low termination fees reflect slowdown in voluntary merger and acquisition activity among financial institutions that we have witnessed all year. Although we expect termination fees to remain at low levels in 2010, they will not be material drag on our revenue growth rate. In spite of the tough environment, we managed the segment well and finished the year strong. We continue to generate high-quality earnings in this the segment, reflecting the power of thousands of privilege relationships, market-leading products and proactive management. While adjusted revenue in the Financial segment declined by $50 million or 3% for the year, expenses in this segment declined by $74 million or 5%, leading to an increase in adjusted operating income for the period of $24 million to $569 million. These results drove 190 basis point expansion in margin to 29.3%. The strong margin improvement was driven by several factors, including strength in our Account Processing businesses and disciplined focus on operational efficiency, which serve to offset the negative impact of the reduction in high margin termination fees. For the quarter, operating margin in the segment increased 90 basis points to 28.5% compared with the prior year, due primarily to the strength in our recurring revenue, Account Processing businesses, strong license revenue from add-on products and renewals and operating efficiencies. These positive benefits were partially offset by the accrual of the incremental profit-sharing, continued expense actions to align our revenue, and cost in businesses, such as item processing and higher commissions and employee costs related to the very strong finish through the year. We continue to proactively manage capital expenditures, ending the year at $198 million, the same as last year's level or approximately 5% of adjusted revenue. We also recognized that capital expenditures are only one component of how we invest in our products and solutions, with labor and operating costs being the most significant element of our investment costs, a majority of which is  expensed directly to the income statement. Our strong fourth quarter free cash flow allowed us to repay $140 million of debt in the fourth quarter, of which $120 million was the pre-payment of our December 2010 debt payment and $475 million for the year.Net interest expense was $51 million for the quarter and $212 million for year. We expect that the combination of expired fixed rate interest rate hedges and debt reduction will reduced interest expense at least $15 million for 2010, subject to the timing of borrowings, repayments and other areas of capital deployment. We repurchased 1.1 million shares for $47 million in the quarter and more than 4.1 million shares in 2009, for a total of $175 million. As of year end, we had 2.2 million shares remaining in our repurchase authorization.2009 was the first year in our 25-year history that we did not make an acquisition, a clear sign of our capital discipline across the company. However, we will continue to evaluate potential acquisition that allow us to expand our solutions set and build scale. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.3% and 38.1% for the year, which excludes the impact of a $7 million GAAP income tax benefit or $0.04 per share related to the final settlement of a CheckFree purchase accounting tax reserve in the third quarter, which also was excluded from adjusted EPS.  We anticipate our 2010 tax rate to approximate our 2009 rate of 38.1%. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."

Fourth quarter sales, in December in particular, was strong across the spectrum of financial institutions in both new client wins and integrated sales to existing clients. In addition to winning more than our fair share in the community secto",1343,"Thanks, Tom. Fourth quarter sales, in December in particular, was strong across the spectrum of financial institutions in both new client wins and integrated sales to existing clients. In addition to winning more than our fair share in the community sector, we provided new services to clients, including Bank of the West, First Bank and Wells Fargo, as evidence of our increasing penetration among larger financial institutions. As a result of our strong finish, we achieved exactly 100% of sales quota for the year. We actually achieved an incredible 250% of quota for the month of December, giving us even more revenue growth momentum entering 2010.Although our better-than-expected fourth quarter sales results have unexpectedly reduced pipelines, we remain encouraged by the breadth and depth of the sales opportunities we are pursuing going into the new year. We expect that the combination of new opportunities and enhanced go-to-market approach would lead to even better sales results in 2010. That said, we continue to expect long sales cycles and somewhat unpredictable timing of actual sales attainment throughout the year, given the external environment.As I mentioned upfront, we made great progress going to market as one Fiserv, with $42 million of integrated sales in the quarter, an increase of 40% over the prior year. We finished the full year with $117 million in integrated sales, 30% ahead of '09 and 36% ahead of 2008. The leading areas of integrated sales were in payments, customer channels, such as Internet banking and branch and efficiency-based products. Before I get to our 2010 outlook, let me update you on our view of the environment and our key priorities for the year. In 2009, there were 158 regulatory actions impacting 140 banks and 18 credit unions, well within our range of expectations for the year and slightly less than 1% of all institutions. This, combined with the very low level of organic acquisition, serves to slow the extrapolated decline rate of depository institutions in the U.S. in 2009. As we have now seen, the assets and accounts of failed institutions don't go away. They are almost always assumed by another institution. We are intimately involved with these activities and track closely the impact of these wins and losses on our client base.  Since the beginning of the acceleration and regulatory actions in 2008, our account processing client base is down a net of two clients, stated in terms of where the FI [financial institution] subject to the resolution, lands from a core account processing perspective. Given the size and diversity of our client base, we continue to believe that the net impact on our core account processing base, in terms of numbers of clients, will be about neutral over time and very similar to that of normal M&A activity. For 2010, we expect the number of regulatory actions to accelerate and to be within the range of 200 to 250, with actions likely tapering off towards the end of the year. We expect the noble activity in 2010 to remain at low levels, with some slight uptick possible towards the end of the year depending on the regulatory environment.Additionally, we believe that the number of institutions that switch their core account processing systems will, as we witnessed in 2009, remain at lower levels that we have seen historically. For context, we believe that the number of actual core account processing buying decisions made during the year dropped by about 30% from the 2008 level. Combining the fact that fewer institutions will likely switch their account processing with our substantially increased win percentage, over 50% of all core switchers chose Fiserv in 2009 versus 42% last year, should go well for us, given the size and diversity of our client base.We have three key priorities for 2010, when taken together, should position Fiserv to expand its industry-leading position and build long-term shareholder value. Our priorities are: First, to deliver positive internal revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments; second, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to improved enterprise win rates and a higher share of our strategic products; third, to provide innovative solutions that increase differentiation and importantly, enhance results for our clients. Our outlook for 2010 is based on a core assumption that the environment will be generally similar to that of 2009, albeit, less volatile as we marched towards 2011. We expect financial institutions to continue to be pragmatic with their technology-spending decisions and that overall budgets will be in a range of flat to slightly up.However, we believe that spending may bias towards the second half of the year and expect new material client investments to be moderated against their business results. We also assume that discretionary M&A activity will again be low, given the number of likely regulatory actions, and therefore, termination fees will remain at an extremely low level.  Last, given the current interest rate outlook, we expect float revenue in 2010 to be similar to 2009.  We expect our 2010 adjusted internal revenue growth to be in a range of 1% to 3%, which should include stronger growth in the Payment segment. Our guidance for the year includes the impact of foreign currency, which should not be significant. Given market conditions, we expect 2010 adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% to 11% or in a range of $3.96 to $4.07, and compared with the $3.66 earned in 2009. We expect earnings to be stronger in the second half of the year due to our normal business cycle and the timing of revenue recognition from new sales wins. We expect the company adjusted operating margin will increase at least 50 basis points over the 28.7% achieved in 2009. We will continue to make investments in 2010 that support stronger competitive differentiation and higher levels of revenue growth. These investments include: Areas such as our Acumen account processing platform, small business services, person-to-person payments, biller network, integrated debit, Mobile Money and sales and account management. As always, we will balance our level of investment with our earnings commitments, adjusting our investment levels as necessary for changes in the market environment.We anticipate free cash flow will approximate operating earnings growth and increase 5% to 8% over the record level attained in 2009 of $668 million. Our integrated sales target for 2010 is $105 million, and our target for incremental operational effectiveness is $40 million. Based on reaching the 2010 target level phase, we will achieved our goal of $250 million of operational efficiences, a full year earlier that originally anticipated. Given our strong our performance in this area over the last several years, we will update you with the revised operational effectiveness goal at our 2010 Investor Day. We are pleased to have provided our owners with earlier access to that value.Finally, our 2010 guidance considers various scenarios for the allocation of capital, including internal investment, debt repayment, acquisitions and share repurchase. We will make actual capital allocations determination throughout the year, as appropriate, under the circumstances. 2009 was a challenging year by any definition. In the most difficult macroeconomic conditions in the last 70 years, we delivered record levels of earnings per share and free cash flow. As important, we continue to enhance the quality of our earnings, as seen through adjusted operating margin. We exceeded our integrated sales and operational effectiveness goals by a wide margin and continue to deepen the integration of our solutions and enhance how we go to market.We didn't expect it to be easy and it wasn't. The strength of our 20,000 associates to make it happen everyday, is one of our key differentiators. I'm proud of what our people have done over the last year to help our clients navigate the turbulence and find unique opportunities to win. This attribute, along with the leading technology solutions in the industry, forms our basis for optimism moving forward. While we expect 2010 to continue to be challenging, we are up to the task and more than ready for what lies ahead. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions."

The reason why, especially on these transactions that tend to be competitive takeaways, you've got the near-term license fees or the simple products that are add-on products to get put in a fairly short period of time. But for most of our revenue, as you know, they tend to be client conversions. They take a fairly long amount of time. People can sign an agreement in December for something that doesn't expire until June or April or even September, depending on how long those conversions are, and we are able to recognize the revenue until a later point of time. So that's really -- we saw a lot of that in our sales in the month of December and really in the fourth quarter. And so because of our recurring revenue model, we can start to see how that's going to layer in."

We talked during the year that the biggest challenge that we had in thinking about acquisitions was, how to price transactions given what was going on in the market environment.

We just didn't see transactions that either made sense for us or that got over the finish line by the end of the year. We still see a lot of interesting opportunities especially in areas that take advantage of our network economics. So products that might be in the payments area, risk area of those kinds of things. And it -- just as importantly, acquisitions that take advantage of the scale of Fiserv. So we're looking -- but we maintain a pretty high standard in how we're going to allocate our capital and whether that's to share repurchase or acquisitions or to debt repayment. We view them all equally important, but I suspect you'll continue to see us pretty active in the acquisition market."

Clearly, we have some incremental higher margins, one that additional business comes on. So I do continue to believe the we have opportunity to expand margins, going forward, clearly, because of that revenue model. And secondarily as we highlighted, we continued to have a lot of programs on the operational efficiency side. We've made very good strides in there. And I know I highlighted on Investor Day, some of the opportunities we still have for efficiency around data center and shared services and other things that we'll continue to work on in the company. I don't think you can say year-over-year, we're going to 200 basis points but our guidance for 2010 is 50 basis points plus and I think over the longer term, the model continues to have available leverage in it."

But probably most important is, building credibility as a partner to those institutions so they trust you with the next alternative solution or the next problem that you can solve together. And one of the big benefits of acquiring CheckFree was, CheckFree had relationships with 21 of the top 25 institutions on bill payment and a variety of relationships that came out of the legacy character businesses. And so we have found ourselves, and to some extent, I think the enviable position of having great relationships at pretty important levels in these institutions. And they take time to work, but we find a fair amount of creativity in those institutions in working with us on a variety of our current and some of the solutions that we're working on today that are new and not even in market, looking at how can we do things with some of those folks, maybe in areas like P2P and analytics where we can work together to change some of the paradigms in the financial services product delivers system today.

And I'm sorry I have to give a little bit of that motherhood and apple pie answer, but that really is the answer. So what do we have in our portfolio that's going to help the clients. And the clients have been focused on areas around operational efficiencies. So things like source capture, some risk management solutions, things like that. Payments are big, very big news. There's a lot of energy around what can you do as these payment types begin to converge. A lot of discussion on P2P mobile. So, kind of, the ability to access -- I've been frankly surprised that the energy around mobile, where you're seeing the financial institutions well ahead really of the application capability that's in the market, but mobile is a big deal. And then for us, we're very focused on where we have solutions that we believe are strategic to the company and strategic to the client. So Internet banking, embedded with bill payment, with analytics capabilities, the ability to talk to consumers, where they are with targeted personalized messages, all around digital transformation. Those are very big deals that's why you're seeing 1,370 payment sales over the last two years. I'd like that to be substantially higher, moving forward. Because those kinds of solutions, not only are they strategic for the client, but they create sticky relationships between the consumer and that FI and that benefits us over the longer haul."

We will fall within that range. So you think about this year, we were negative one on our internal revenue growth and about 10% on EPS. This year we'd given guidance of 1% to 3%, which wraps the bottom end of that. And we've given guidance on adjusted EPS of 8% to 11%. So again, it wraps the bottom of it. What I would tell you is, we have a couple of things that we're paying a lot of attention to. And that is, there are competitive dynamics in the market right now that give us a lot of energy around investing in products, many of which we talked about today, whether they be our Acumen processing platform, our new integrated debit platform, P2P analytics to name a few, but that the importance of getting them into the market quickly and planting those flags because we see the clients want those kinds of services right now, has had us increase our investment to levels that are going to be higher than we would do if we were, kind of, normally running the business. So we are basically moving more investment into this period. And we believe that will lead to better revenue growth in 2011 and better earnings growth in 2011 because we're basically consolidating more investment into this period. And as a safety net, in the event that the world doesn't perform the way we believe it is, we'll have the ability to cut back on that. And as you know, most of our investment is not in the form of CapEx, it's in the form of OpEx, which runs through our P&L. So we bear the full cost of those investments in the year we make them or in the years that we make them. And that's the downside. The upside is, we get the leverage later on. And I would say the last thing that probably matters a lot to us is, given all of the uncertainty in the environment, we just don't see any reason to get ahead of ourselves. We want to put out numbers that we are very confident in. And then we will manage to those numbers as we see the environment shaping up as we get somewhere past February 2."

We always have certain add-backs like share-based comp that are normally going to enhance your free cash flow over time over adjusted earnings. So I think all I'm saying is that over time, over the long haul, our free cash flow is going to grow at or above our adjusted earnings. And mainly because of the add-back of a share-based comp, the work we do around  our working capital, and really the capital discipline that we have on capital expenditures, which we just have that throughout our organization as you can see, we typically have less or about the same of CapEx as depreciation.

But it's roughly in line with our overall adjusted earnings growth in 2010. And clearly, as we look into 2010, if you look back at '08 and '09, we've actually had a very positive benefit of working capital changes mainly because we've driven down our accounts receivable, our CapEx et cetera. And I think as we look into '10, with our planned increase in revenue growth, receivables are just going to build a little bit more CapEx.

And I think 1% of that is about $7 million. It doesn't take much to get that change. But again, over any extended period of time, we'll end up outperforming EPS on a free cash flow side. On the competitive side, there are really two dynamics that are causing us to want to increase our level of investment. Number one, it is just all of the transformation that's going on and how financial services are being delivered to consumers. And the regulatory pressure that's being put on there. So whether it is around analytics, what we need, how can we help our financial institution clients to better understand their customers so they can serve them the way they want to, or whether it's delivering a new payments-oriented technology or technologies that help the client to reduce fraud as debit is growing so rapidly. We see a lot of interest in because the institutions have seen the sea change occurring, they're looking and motivated to view new technologies that could actually change how they do business. And that's a good thing. On the competitive front, as it relates to our competitors, that is actually less of the issue that is on the transformational side. I would say that one of the reasons that we didn't do a transaction in 2009 is, we did not want to be distracted by the integration that it takes to do a deal. And we know what that's like because we spent the last year and a half prior to that working on integration. And we are proud of the work that we did there. But we know it takes a lot of time and effort. And we wanted to shift our energy from really being focused on cost reduction to being focused on innovation and how you can serve the market in a better way.

Some institutions are spending a lot of money, and some institutions are not spending any money. And so while in the aggregate, it comes out to be this, kind of, what we think is flat to slightly up.

One quick housekeeping note. Please mark your calendars for our annual Investor Day to be held on Tuesday, October 5, in New York City. Invitations will be sent out in August. 
So let me say upfront that our Q1 results were consistent with our internal expectations, given our strong fourth quarter's performance, a tight spending environment and the relative strength in last year's Q1. We delivered record free cash flow, solid growth and adjusted earnings per share and continued to make new product investments. Most important, our full year guidance remains unchanged, and we are right on track to achieve it. 
Our bellwether, recurring-revenue base businesses, namely Account Processing, Electronic Banking and Card Services, performed well in the quarter. Despite positive revenue growth in many of our business lines, total adjusted revenue in the quarter declined by 1% to $954 million. 
There were three primary drivers of the revenue decline that were generally anticipated going into the quarter. First, revenue was comparatively weak in Output Solutions against a very strong first quarter in 2009; next, continued sectoral weakness in the check processing space negatively impacted revenue growth; and last, we experienced the decline in license fees and specialty consulting services in the quarter. Tom will provide more detail in a few minutes. 
Adjusted earnings per share was up 6% to $0.95 compared with the first quarter of 2009, in line with our expectations. Adjusted operating margin was 28.9% in the first quarter, down a mere 20 basis points below 2009's high watermark of 29.1% in last year's first quarter. 
Margin was up sequentially over Q4, and importantly, was 20 basis points higher than the 2009 full year result. We're satisfied with our margin performance in the quarter, given the decline in some higher-margin revenue, the extremely low levels of termination fees and float income, and our increased investments in new products 
Free cash flow continued to be excellent, generating an all-time high at $225 million in the quarter, an increase of 15% over the prior year's quarter. As you know, we have three key enterprise priorities for 2010. First, to deliver positive adjusted internal revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments; next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to improved enterprise win rates and a higher share of our strategic products; and third, to provide innovative solutions that increase differentiation and enhance result for our clients. 
As I mentioned, we're on track to attain [ph] full year revenue growth and earnings per share targets. We continue to see steady growth in our recurring-revenue businesses, and we'll also benefit from a large number of new implementations coming online during the year. I can't overstate the importance of our second priority, centering the Fiserv culture on growth. 
As I mentioned on our last call, we created a single global sales organization, which includes new sales and enterprise account management. The sales changes have been very well received and momentum is high. Sales for the first quarter were better than expected, and the pipeline has grown substantially from the end of the year. In addition, there were several significant transactions in the pipeline that we expect will close in the second quarter. In fact, one has already closed, which should have a positive impact on 2010 revenue. 
We closed 139 new debit and bill payment clients in the quarter, reinforcing our commitment to increase the size of our Strategic Payments businesses. We're also in full swing with our new person-to-person payment's capability, and recently announced that over 40 institutions have committed to launch our new product this summer with the pool of millions of potential users from our CheckFree RXP user base. 
Centering on a growth culture is not just about sales. It's also how we serve clients, the quality of our service delivery and the ability to develop technology solutions, which anticipate the needs of an evolving market. We're confident that our transformation will enhance loyalty, expand wallet share and increase win rates even further. 
To our third priority, we're continuing to invest in areas that will increase value to clients and enhance the power of our existing solutions. For example, products such as Mobile Money, P2P and integrated debit will create both standalone and new revenue, and also accelerate transaction growth across our existing Payment businesses. 
Late in the quarter, we hosted our Bank Solutions conference, which is one of the largest client events of the year. We had nearly 1,000 account processing clients, about 1,500 attendees, who clearly see the value of adding new and differentiating capabilities to their institution. Our solution center was jampacked, showcasing many of the Fiserv wide technology solutions. As a result, clients requested over 2,400 product and solutions sales proposals this year, more than twice the number of requested last year, providing us with increased confidence in the direction of our solutions and the sales opportunities ahead. 
As important, that level of increased activity is a positive sign of a potential return to a more normalized technology-spending environment. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom for more details on the financial results"
128209,100417380,58794,"Fiserv Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Throughout my discussion, I will refer to the supplemental information included in the slide presentation. As shown on Slide 3, adjusted revenue in the quarter was down 1% to $954 million, compared with the fi",1586,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Throughout my discussion, I will refer to the supplemental information included in the slide presentation. 
As shown on Slide 3, adjusted revenue in the quarter was down 1% to $954 million, compared with the first quarter of 2009, and consistent with our expectations that we will produce stronger second half revenue and earnings growth. As Jeff mentioned in his remarks, we saw growth in a number of our areas, including our core Account Processing, Electronic Banking and Card Services businesses. This performance was offset by several factors, including a tough year-over-year comparison in our Output Solutions business, related to higher-margin revenue in 2009 that did not recur in 2010. This, alone, negatively impacted our revenue growth rate by one percentage point in the quarter. 
The revenue in this business will generally have more quarter-to-quarter variability than our typical recurring-revenue base businesses. In addition, declines in license and specialty consulting revenue, compared to a strong first quarter of 2009, negatively impacted quarterly revenue growth by one percentage point. Finally, volume reductions in our Check Processing business contributed an additional one percentage point drag on overall revenue growth in the quarter. 
We remain confident in our full year adjusted internal revenue growth guidance of 1% to 3% due primarily to the following factors: first, our core businesses continue to perform well, particularly in the account processing and payment areas, which represent the majority of our revenue. We expect revenue growth to be stronger in the second half of 2010. Second, as Jeff mentioned, we expect to win several significant transactions this year that will positively impact 2010 revenue. And as we shared, one of these large deals has already closed. 
Third, there are a number of client conversions in process from sales in 2009, some of which are quite large that should ramp up as we progress through 2010. Examples of these significant wins include American Savings Bank and Tesco. Typically, these larger transactions have significant professional services revenue included in the relationship. This overall effect has contributed to a $10 million increase in deferred revenue in the current year, and a $17 million increase over the prior year's first quarter, which should convert to revenue in the coming months. Fourth, the combination of an uptick in client-buying patterns and improved sales execution should boost performance as we proceed through the year. Finally, we don't expect to grow over [ph] issues in businesses, such as Output Solutions, to persist. 
Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.95, up 6% compared with the prior year. You will note that there are no income statement adjustments for CheckFree integration costs or similar items, given the time that has elapsed since the acquisition. However, we still expect to incur a couple of million dollars, per quarter this year, of integration cost, severance and various other expenses, which have been incorporated into our full year guidance. 
On balance, we do not consider these amounts to be material to our results. For example, in this quarter, we incurred nearly $3 million of incremental cost for call center consolidation in our Payments segment that previously would have been treated as integration cost. 
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 28.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from the first quarter of 2009. Given the increase in investments and the decline in higher-margin revenue in the quarter, we are satisfied with the results. Additionally, as Jeff mentioned, adjusted operating margin was up sequentially for the quarter, and 20 basis points better than the full year 2009 result. We are on track for our expected full year margin improvement. 
Now on to the segment results. The Payment segment generated adjusted revenue of $486 million in the quarter, which, as shown on Slide 4, was roughly flat with the first quarter of 2009. Growth in our Electronic Banking and Card Services businesses were primarily offset by the decrease in the Output Solutions business, which negatively impacted the segment growth rate by two percentage points. 
We also have lower license fees in the segment and a large client, which took the management of its ATMs in-house at the beginning of 2010. Although this is relatively low-margin revenue, it will negatively impact segment revenue growth by about one percentage point for the year. This did not have an impact on our traditional ATM-driving business. 
We are also seeing strong interest in our channel solutions domestically and around the world. We anticipate some significant wins in this arena, which should positively impact revenue growth in 2010. Full income in the quarter was basically nonexistent as interest rates remained at historically low levels. Growth in Card Services was driven primarily by a continued strong, double-digit growth in transaction volumes from our debit products. 
Our combined debit processing and network transactions grew 23% versus the prior year's first quarter. These strong results reflect the continued macro trend towards debit card usage and strong integrated sales to our account processing base. 
Bill payment transactions grew 6% in the quarter, compared with the first quarter of 2010. Excluding volume from a remittance only large bank client that was acquired in 2008 and moved up of our platform in the fourth quarter of 2009. Overall transaction volume growth was negatively impacted by cyclically weak volume at some larger clients that have higher levels of bill payment penetration. 
Turning to Slide 5, operating income for the Payments segment was $148 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin of 30.5% was down 140 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2009. The reduction in adjusted operating margin for this segment was driven primarily by decreases in higher-margin revenue in our Output Solutions and Risk Management businesses, the margin impact of product development investments that we have highlighted previously, and as I mentioned, incremental integration costs, including severance of nearly $3 million related to a call center consolidation expensed within the segment. These impacts were partially offset by continued operating leverage and overall attainment of operational efficiencies. 
The Financial segment generated revenue of $472 million in the quarter, down 3% compared with the first quarter of 2009. Decline in volume in the Check Processing business accounted for two percentage points of the segment revenue headwind in the quarter. Decreases in license fees and specialty consulting revenue also negatively impacted segment revenue growth in the quarter by an additional two percentage points. 
Importantly, in spite of these historically low termination fees and lower levels of discretionary spending by our clients, the Account Processing business continued to exhibit steady growth in the quarter. As Jeff mentioned, we saw demand increasing for a number of products, and we expect that to translate to a stronger second half of the year. 
We continue to efficiently manage our business, reducing overall operating expenses in the segment by 3% compared with the first quarter of 2009. We are using these efficiencies to help offset the impact of increased investment funding in areas such as Acumen, our state-of-the-art account processing platform for large credit unions and our new PEP+ ACH ASP solution. We are also building innovative deposit transformation solutions, designed to help financial institutions deal with the impact of financial regulation, including Reg E, which will have a significant impact on fee revenue for the financial industry. 
Operating income in the quarter was $136 million, and adjusted operating margin was 28.8%, a 50 basis point decline compared with the first quarter of 2009. The reduction in adjusted operating margin in the segment was driven by decreases in higher-margin license and specialty consulting revenue and the impact of incremental product investments, partially offset by operational effectiveness benefits. 
Adjusted operating loss in our Corporate and Other segment improved by approximately $7 million in the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009, due to a combination of reduced corporate spending and a gain on the sale of an operating facility of $4.5 million. 
Capital expenditures were $42 million in the quarter, down 7% compared with the first quarter of 2009. Our capital expenditure primarily reflect investments in technology equipment and purchase software. Most of the labor and operating costs related to product development are expensed directly through the income statement. 
We had record free cash flow in a single quarter, generating $225 million, a 15% increase compared with the first quarter of 2009. Free cash flow per share grew 16% in the quarter to $1.46 compared with $1.26 in 2009. We used our strong free cash flow to prepay $126 million of debt in the quarter, representing nearly one half of our debt repayment obligations for the entire year. As a result, our total debt is approximately $3.5 billion at March 31, resulting in a trailing 12-month debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.7x. 
Net interest expense was $45 million in the quarter, as compared to $54 million in the first quarter of 2009. The decline resulted from lower debt balances and the expected positive impact of interest rate hedges that rolled off at the end of 2009. 
We also repurchased 1.4 million shares for $67 million in the quarter. As of March 31, we had 5.8 million shares remaining in our outstanding repurchase authorizations. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter of approximately 38% was negatively impacted by the R&D credit not being authorized in the first quarter of 2010 compared to 2009. This had a negative impact of about $0.01 per share in the first quarter earnings compared to 2009. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."
128209,100417380,58794,"Fiserv Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. As you know, our fourth quarter sales were quite strong, and December, in particular, was the highest sales month in the history of the company.

As you know, our fourth quarter sales were quite strong, and December, in particular, was the highest sales month in the history of the company. Sales in January and February started slow, and we rebounded a bit in March ending the quarter at about 82% attainment. While this is short of our laudable full year objective, it's important to note that the quarter for 2010 was again increased versus the 2009 level. 
The total contract value of closed transactions was higher in the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009. We had numerous competitive takeaways in the Account Processing and Payments businesses, and new clients often continued to buy multiple Fiserv solutions. We were also encouraged by how quickly the sales pipeline was replenished during the quarter. 
We continue to expect longer and somewhat unpredictable sales cycles times given the environment. However, given our visibility into the pipeline, we expect to meet or exceed sales targets for the year. 
Integrated sales were $23 million in the quarter, a 22% attainment level against our full year target of $105 million and 15% growth over the first quarter's attainment in 2009. We are on track to meet our integrated sales target for the year. The leading areas of integrated sales continue to be payments, customer channels, such as Internet banking and brands and efficiency-based products. 
As I mentioned up front, we signed 93 new bill payment clients and 46 new debit clients in the quarter. Since the acquisition of CheckFree in late 2007, we have added over 1,500 new client relationships in these two strategic payment solution areas, and we still have significant room to grow. 
We generated over $19 million of cost savings through our operational effectiveness initiatives in the quarter, almost 50% of our $40 million full year target. While we don't expect to attain cost saves at this pace through the remainder of the year, we fully expect to meet or exceed our operational effectiveness target for 2010. 
As we said in our last call, we believe there are significant opportunities to further optimize our cost structure, which we will share with you in more detail at our Investor Day. 
Before we take questions, let me update you on our view of the environment and guidance for the year. There have been 64 regulatory actions through April 23, 31 more than at the same time last year. This increase in resolutions is within our range of expectations for the full year. Even at these levels, the number of institutions impacted in 2010 would represent between 1% and 2% of the more than 16,000 financial institutions in the country, and much less than the 3% average decline in the number of financial institutions seen over the last 20 years or so prior to 2009. Overall, we are down slightly in terms of wins and losses since the beginning of the regulatory actions in 2008, and we still expect to be about neutral over time. 
On balance, we expect to lose far fewer clients to regulatory action than many thought possible at the start of the banking crisis. Although capital is still tight within the financial institution landscape, there does appear to be a loosening in discretionary spending. And although this will be more prevalent in those institutions that are healthier, there is a broad realization that some level of discretionary spending is required for any institution to be able to move forward. 
In addition, there are early-stage conversations happening in the industry around organic or non-resolution acquisition by institutions who want to quickly capitalize on market opportunity instead of waiting to see what maybe available via the resolution channel. We believe our wide range of market-leading solutions, along with the portfolio of new product investments we are making, have us extremely well positioned to accelerate revenue growth as the financial industry moves closer to a new normal. 
As I mentioned upfront, our 2010 expectations remain unchanged from the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. We continue to expect 2010 adjusted internal revenue growth to be in a range of 1% to 3%, which should include stronger growth in the Payment segment. And as we have said several times, revenue growth will be stronger in the second half of the year. 
We expect 2010 adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% to 11%, and that full year free cash flow will increase between 5% and 8% to over $700 million. Lastly, we anticipate that adjusted operating margin for the company will expand by at least 50 basis points for the full year. 
Although the market has not returned to its pre-crisis level, there are some early signs of improvement. We continue to make the strategic moves necessary to position Fiserv to deliver client and shareholder value. We would not be where we are today if it were not for the tireless efforts of our nearly 20,000 associates around the world. I continue to be impressed by the quality of our people and their commitment to delivering superior service and value to our clients. 
With that, Carlisle, let's open the line for questions."

As we've talked about, historically, and I think, I know you're aware of this, Bryan, the license revenue for the company is a about, typically, an average about 5%. And each quarter, that can vary from anywhere from 4% to 6%. Clearly in 2009, we had a very strong fourth quarter, which is at the higher end of that particular range.

And clearly, this year, as we indicated, as our pipelines for billing and demand, we anticipate that those license fees will continue to accelerate as we go through the year. Regarding the professional services, to the second part of your question, really, the professional services revenue was pretty solid in the first quarter. We do have a Specialty Consulting business that we talked about, and that's a revenue-enhancement Consulting business and we have really transformed that business over the last six to nine months to really focus on the new financial regulation, Reg E, and have retooled that for our clients. And that's been a lot of investment dollars in that in rebuilding our pipeline over the last six to nine months.

That business probably won't generate any material business until the second half of the year. So we basically have had to retool that business because it used to be based significantly on optimizing fee revenue for financial institutions into a new consulting operating, which is catching a lot of steam on -- now looking for different ways and institutions to make up for the fee revenue that there no longer going to have. And so, we wouldn't see that generating any material revenue into the second half of the year. So that's, for an example. I think the other caveat that, unfortunately, I think every one of us in the industry right now has put on this is sales cycles are just not predictable. And some of the sales, like license revenue, they just happen once in a quarter or it doesn't happen in a quarter. And the challenge that we have, Dave, as you know is, we've been pretty disciplined about not managing the business on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And so, we really look at things on a full year basis. And so, we're quite comfortable on the 1% to 3% per full year basis. But it's difficult for me to say, will it be two weeks quarter?

What we began to see in the first quarter, perhaps a continuation of what we saw in the fourth quarter is more early preliminary buying signs coming from the institution. So I think that for the majority of the community-based institutions out there right now, it's relatively clear who the survivors are going to be, and that group is certainly looking to ramp up their level of spend. I do believe that people have already internalized the fact that there's going to be a significant financial regulation, and so they have been thinking about it. And to the point we were making earlier around the Specialty Consulting, we have a lot of different products that we are bundling together to deliver a deposit-transformation solution, which is our basically, our nomenclature for filling the hole that's going to be created by some of the interchange oriented and fee-oriented issues. So we do see a lot of interest on that front for institutions to look for ways to fill that hole. And there is no question that EFT and some of the other payment solutions are going to play an important role in that, especially given where we talked about where our clients are on the general maturity curve relative to others. So I do think that, that will continue, that discretionary spending will continue to loosen up over the next couple of years. I don't think we're going to get to a normal level for a while. But I think it will slowly move up as people have to take actions against some of the negatives that will obviously be included in the financial regulation. Now who knows what that regulation will finally end up looking like? So there may be things in there that could offset some of that desire clients have to fill those holes and close those gaps. But for now we think that will actually be net positive. As far as is there anything in there that could impact us? For the most part -- not for the most part, we don't actually have revenue-tied fees. We don't have revenue tied to interchange. So the extent that consumers continue to act generally as they have, I think that should not have any material impact on us. I suspect that depending on how some of the card legislation is impacted, if it ends up changing how consumers transact, that could be something that affects everyone in the Card business.

So if you think about the Check Processing business, that business, which is also known as Item Processing, is literally the processing of paper. And so today, there are, in theory, less checks being written. We know that. And there's also the conversion of paper to electronic. And So that item itself no longer has to clear. So we have technologies like Source Capture that are in the middle of that. We have our Source Capture suite. We have, obviously, bill pay and debit and other products. So we are benefiting from that. The challenge is that even though we're getting benefit on one side, we have the loss coming on the other side, on the Item Processing business itself. And while the team has, frankly, done a yeoman's job in realigning our cost structure against that, it just takes time for that to happen.

With me on the call today is our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Hirsch. 
Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We will make forward-looking statements about, among other matters, adjusted internal revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating margin, free cash flow, sales pipelines and our strategic initiative Fiserv 2.0. 
Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release, which can be found on our website at www.fiserv.com for a discussion of these risk factors. 
You should also refer to our earnings release for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call and for a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior-reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. 
One quick housekeeping note. Please mark your calendars for our annual Investor Day to be held on Tuesday, October 5, in New York City. Invitations will be sent out in August. 
So let me say upfront that our Q1 results were consistent with our internal expectations, given our strong fourth quarter's performance, a tight spending environment and the relative strength in last year's Q1. We delivered record free cash flow, solid growth and adjusted earnings per share and continued to make new product investments. Most important, our full year guidance remains unchanged, and we are right on track to achieve it. 
Our bellwether, recurring-revenue base businesses, namely Account Processing, Electronic Banking and Card Services, performed well in the quarter. Despite positive revenue growth in many of our business lines, total adjusted revenue in the quarter declined by 1% to $954 million. 
There were three primary drivers of the revenue decline that were generally anticipated going into the quarter. First, revenue was comparatively weak in Output Solutions against a very strong first quarter in 2009; next, continued sectoral weakness in the check processing space negatively impacted revenue growth; and last, we experienced the decline in license fees and specialty consulting services in the quarter. Tom will provide more detail in a few minutes. 
Adjusted earnings per share was up 6% to $0.95 compared with the first quarter of 2009, in line with our expectations. Adjusted operating margin was 28.9% in the first quarter, down a mere 20 basis points below 2009's high watermark of 29.1% in last year's first quarter. 
Margin was up sequentially over Q4, and importantly, was 20 basis points higher than the 2009 full year result. We're satisfied with our margin performance in the quarter, given the decline in some higher-margin revenue, the extremely low levels of termination fees and float income, and our increased investments in new products 
Free cash flow continued to be excellent, generating an all-time high at $225 million in the quarter, an increase of 15% over the prior year's quarter. As you know, we have three key enterprise priorities for 2010. First, to deliver positive adjusted internal revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments; next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to improved enterprise win rates and a higher share of our strategic products; and third, to provide innovative solutions that increase differentiation and enhance result for our clients. 
As I mentioned, we're on track to attain [ph] full year revenue growth and earnings per share targets. We continue to see steady growth in our recurring-revenue businesses, and we'll also benefit from a large number of new implementations coming online during the year. I can't overstate the importance of our second priority, centering the Fiserv culture on growth. 
As I mentioned on our last call, we created a single global sales organization, which includes new sales and enterprise account management. The sales changes have been very well received and momentum is high. Sales for the first quarter were better than expected, and the pipeline has grown substantially from the end of the year. In addition, there were several significant transactions in the pipeline that we expect will close in the second quarter. In fact, one has already closed, which should have a positive impact on 2010 revenue. 
We closed 139 new debit and bill payment clients in the quarter, reinforcing our commitment to increase the size of our Strategic Payments businesses. We're also in full swing with our new person-to-person payment's capability, and recently announced that over 40 institutions have committed to launch our new product this summer with the pool of millions of potential users from our CheckFree RXP user base. 
Centering on a growth culture is not just about sales. It's also how we serve clients, the quality of our service delivery and the ability to develop technology solutions, which anticipate the needs of an evolving market. We're confident that our transformation will enhance loyalty, expand wallet share and increase win rates even further. 
To our third priority, we're continuing to invest in areas that will increase value to clients and enhance the power of our existing solutions. For example, products such as Mobile Money, P2P and integrated debit will create both standalone and new revenue, and also accelerate transaction growth across our existing Payment businesses. 
Late in the quarter, we hosted our Bank Solutions conference, which is one of the largest client events of the year. We had nearly 1,000 account processing clients, about 1,500 attendees, who clearly see the value of adding new and differentiating capabilities to their institution. Our solution center was jampacked, showcasing many of the Fiserv wide technology solutions. As a result, clients requested over 2,400 product and solutions sales proposals this year, more than twice the number of requested last year, providing us with increased confidence in the direction of our solutions and the sales opportunities ahead. 
As important, that level of increased activity is a positive sign of a potential return to a more normalized technology-spending environment. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom for more details on the financial results
"

Throughout my discussion, I will refer to the supplemental information included in the slide presentation. As shown on Slide 3, adjusted revenue in the quarter was down 1% to $954 million, compared with the fi",1586,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Throughout my discussion, I will refer to the supplemental information included in the slide presentation. 
As shown on Slide 3, adjusted revenue in the quarter was down 1% to $954 million, compared with the first quarter of 2009, and consistent with our expectations that we will produce stronger second half revenue and earnings growth. As Jeff mentioned in his remarks, we saw growth in a number of our areas, including our core Account Processing, Electronic Banking and Card Services businesses. This performance was offset by several factors, including a tough year-over-year comparison in our Output Solutions business, related to higher-margin revenue in 2009 that did not recur in 2010. This, alone, negatively impacted our revenue growth rate by one percentage point in the quarter. 
The revenue in this business will generally have more quarter-to-quarter variability than our typical recurring-revenue base businesses. In addition, declines in license and specialty consulting revenue, compared to a strong first quarter of 2009, negatively impacted quarterly revenue growth by one percentage point. Finally, volume reductions in our Check Processing business contributed an additional one percentage point drag on overall revenue growth in the quarter. 
We remain confident in our full year adjusted internal revenue growth guidance of 1% to 3% due primarily to the following factors: first, our core businesses continue to perform well, particularly in the account processing and payment areas, which represent the majority of our revenue. We expect revenue growth to be stronger in the second half of 2010. Second, as Jeff mentioned, we expect to win several significant transactions this year that will positively impact 2010 revenue. And as we shared, one of these large deals has already closed. 
Third, there are a number of client conversions in process from sales in 2009, some of which are quite large that should ramp up as we progress through 2010. Examples of these significant wins include American Savings Bank and Tesco. Typically, these larger transactions have significant professional services revenue included in the relationship. This overall effect has contributed to a $10 million increase in deferred revenue in the current year, and a $17 million increase over the prior year's first quarter, which should convert to revenue in the coming months. Fourth, the combination of an uptick in client-buying patterns and improved sales execution should boost performance as we proceed through the year. Finally, we don't expect to grow over [ph] issues in businesses, such as Output Solutions, to persist. 
Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.95, up 6% compared with the prior year. You will note that there are no income statement adjustments for CheckFree integration costs or similar items, given the time that has elapsed since the acquisition. However, we still expect to incur a couple of million dollars, per quarter this year, of integration cost, severance and various other expenses, which have been incorporated into our full year guidance. 
On balance, we do not consider these amounts to be material to our results. For example, in this quarter, we incurred nearly $3 million of incremental cost for call center consolidation in our Payments segment that previously would have been treated as integration cost. 
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 28.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from the first quarter of 2009. Given the increase in investments and the decline in higher-margin revenue in the quarter, we are satisfied with the results. Additionally, as Jeff mentioned, adjusted operating margin was up sequentially for the quarter, and 20 basis points better than the full year 2009 result. We are on track for our expected full year margin improvement. 
Now on to the segment results. The Payment segment generated adjusted revenue of $486 million in the quarter, which, as shown on Slide 4, was roughly flat with the first quarter of 2009. Growth in our Electronic Banking and Card Services businesses were primarily offset by the decrease in the Output Solutions business, which negatively impacted the segment growth rate by two percentage points. 
We also have lower license fees in the segment and a large client, which took the management of its ATMs in-house at the beginning of 2010. Although this is relatively low-margin revenue, it will negatively impact segment revenue growth by about one percentage point for the year. This did not have an impact on our traditional ATM-driving business. 
We are also seeing strong interest in our channel solutions domestically and around the world. We anticipate some significant wins in this arena, which should positively impact revenue growth in 2010. Full income in the quarter was basically nonexistent as interest rates remained at historically low levels. Growth in Card Services was driven primarily by a continued strong, double-digit growth in transaction volumes from our debit products. 
Our combined debit processing and network transactions grew 23% versus the prior year's first quarter. These strong results reflect the continued macro trend towards debit card usage and strong integrated sales to our account processing base. 
Bill payment transactions grew 6% in the quarter, compared with the first quarter of 2010. Excluding volume from a remittance only large bank client that was acquired in 2008 and moved up of our platform in the fourth quarter of 2009. Overall transaction volume growth was negatively impacted by cyclically weak volume at some larger clients that have higher levels of bill payment penetration. 
Turning to Slide 5, operating income for the Payments segment was $148 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin of 30.5% was down 140 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2009. The reduction in adjusted operating margin for this segment was driven primarily by decreases in higher-margin revenue in our Output Solutions and Risk Management businesses, the margin impact of product development investments that we have highlighted previously, and as I mentioned, incremental integration costs, including severance of nearly $3 million related to a call center consolidation expensed within the segment. These impacts were partially offset by continued operating leverage and overall attainment of operational efficiencies. 
The Financial segment generated revenue of $472 million in the quarter, down 3% compared with the first quarter of 2009. Decline in volume in the Check Processing business accounted for two percentage points of the segment revenue headwind in the quarter. Decreases in license fees and specialty consulting revenue also negatively impacted segment revenue growth in the quarter by an additional two percentage points. 
Importantly, in spite of these historically low termination fees and lower levels of discretionary spending by our clients, the Account Processing business continued to exhibit steady growth in the quarter. As Jeff mentioned, we saw demand increasing for a number of products, and we expect that to translate to a stronger second half of the year. 
We continue to efficiently manage our business, reducing overall operating expenses in the segment by 3% compared with the first quarter of 2009. We are using these efficiencies to help offset the impact of increased investment funding in areas such as Acumen, our state-of-the-art account processing platform for large credit unions and our new PEP+ ACH ASP solution. We are also building innovative deposit transformation solutions, designed to help financial institutions deal with the impact of financial regulation, including Reg E, which will have a significant impact on fee revenue for the financial industry. 
Operating income in the quarter was $136 million, and adjusted operating margin was 28.8%, a 50 basis point decline compared with the first quarter of 2009. The reduction in adjusted operating margin in the segment was driven by decreases in higher-margin license and specialty consulting revenue and the impact of incremental product investments, partially offset by operational effectiveness benefits. 
Adjusted operating loss in our Corporate and Other segment improved by approximately $7 million in the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009, due to a combination of reduced corporate spending and a gain on the sale of an operating facility of $4.5 million. 
Capital expenditures were $42 million in the quarter, down 7% compared with the first quarter of 2009. Our capital expenditure primarily reflect investments in technology equipment and purchase software. Most of the labor and operating costs related to product development are expensed directly through the income statement. 
We had record free cash flow in a single quarter, generating $225 million, a 15% increase compared with the first quarter of 2009. Free cash flow per share grew 16% in the quarter to $1.46 compared with $1.26 in 2009. We used our strong free cash flow to prepay $126 million of debt in the quarter, representing nearly one half of our debt repayment obligations for the entire year. As a result, our total debt is approximately $3.5 billion at March 31, resulting in a trailing 12-month debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.7x. 
Net interest expense was $45 million in the quarter, as compared to $54 million in the first quarter of 2009. The decline resulted from lower debt balances and the expected positive impact of interest rate hedges that rolled off at the end of 2009. 
We also repurchased 1.4 million shares for $67 million in the quarter. As of March 31, we had 5.8 million shares remaining in our outstanding repurchase authorizations. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter of approximately 38% was negatively impacted by the R&D credit not being authorized in the first quarter of 2010 compared to 2009. This had a negative impact of about $0.01 per share in the first quarter earnings compared to 2009. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.

128209,100417380,58802,"Fiserv Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. As you know, our fourth quarter sales were quite strong, and December, in particular, was the highest sales month in the history of the company. Sales in January and February started slow, and we rebounded a bit in March ending the quarter at",857,"Thanks, Tom. As you know, our fourth quarter sales were quite strong, and December, in particular, was the highest sales month in the history of the company. Sales in January and February started slow, and we rebounded a bit in March ending the quarter at about 82% attainment. While this is short of our laudable full year objective, it's important to note that the quarter for 2010 was again increased versus the 2009 level. 
The total contract value of closed transactions was higher in the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009. We had numerous competitive takeaways in the Account Processing and Payments businesses, and new clients often continued to buy multiple Fiserv solutions. We were also encouraged by how quickly the sales pipeline was replenished during the quarter. 
We continue to expect longer and somewhat unpredictable sales cycles times given the environment. However, given our visibility into the pipeline, we expect to meet or exceed sales targets for the year. 
Integrated sales were $23 million in the quarter, a 22% attainment level against our full year target of $105 million and 15% growth over the first quarter's attainment in 2009. We are on track to meet our integrated sales target for the year. The leading areas of integrated sales continue to be payments, customer channels, such as Internet banking and brands and efficiency-based products. 
As I mentioned up front, we signed 93 new bill payment clients and 46 new debit clients in the quarter. Since the acquisition of CheckFree in late 2007, we have added over 1,500 new client relationships in these two strategic payment solution areas, and we still have significant room to grow. 
We generated over $19 million of cost savings through our operational effectiveness initiatives in the quarter, almost 50% of our $40 million full year target. While we don't expect to attain cost saves at this pace through the remainder of the year, we fully expect to meet or exceed our operational effectiveness target for 2010. 
As we said in our last call, we believe there are significant opportunities to further optimize our cost structure, which we will share with you in more detail at our Investor Day. 
Before we take questions, let me update you on our view of the environment and guidance for the year. There have been 64 regulatory actions through April 23, 31 more than at the same time last year. This increase in resolutions is within our range of expectations for the full year. Even at these levels, the number of institutions impacted in 2010 would represent between 1% and 2% of the more than 16,000 financial institutions in the country, and much less than the 3% average decline in the number of financial institutions seen over the last 20 years or so prior to 2009. Overall, we are down slightly in terms of wins and losses since the beginning of the regulatory actions in 2008, and we still expect to be about neutral over time. 
On balance, we expect to lose far fewer clients to regulatory action than many thought possible at the start of the banking crisis. Although capital is still tight within the financial institution landscape, there does appear to be a loosening in discretionary spending. And although this will be more prevalent in those institutions that are healthier, there is a broad realization that some level of discretionary spending is required for any institution to be able to move forward. 
In addition, there are early-stage conversations happening in the industry around organic or non-resolution acquisition by institutions who want to quickly capitalize on market opportunity instead of waiting to see what maybe available via the resolution channel. We believe our wide range of market-leading solutions, along with the portfolio of new product investments we are making, have us extremely well positioned to accelerate revenue growth as the financial industry moves closer to a new normal. 
As I mentioned upfront, our 2010 expectations remain unchanged from the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. We continue to expect 2010 adjusted internal revenue growth to be in a range of 1% to 3%, which should include stronger growth in the Payment segment. And as we have said several times, revenue growth will be stronger in the second half of the year. 
We expect 2010 adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% to 11%, and that full year free cash flow will increase between 5% and 8% to over $700 million. Lastly, we anticipate that adjusted operating margin for the company will expand by at least 50 basis points for the full year. 
Although the market has not returned to its pre-crisis level, there are some early signs of improvement. We continue to make the strategic moves necessary to position Fiserv to deliver client and shareholder value. We would not be where we are today if it were not for the tireless efforts of our nearly 20,000 associates around the world. I continue to be impressed by the quality of our people and their commitment to delivering superior service and value to our clients. 
With that, Carlisle, let's open the line for questions.

That business probably won't generate any material business until the second half of the year. So we basically have had to retool that business because it used to be based significantly on optimizing fee revenue for financial institutions into a new consulting operating, which is catching a lot of steam on -- now looking for different ways and institutions to make up for the fee revenue that there no longer going to have. And so, we wouldn't see that generating any material revenue into the second half of the year. So that's, for an example. I think the other caveat that, unfortunately, I think every one of us in the industry right now has put on this is sales cycles are just not predictable. And some of the sales, like license revenue, they just happen once in a quarter or it doesn't happen in a quarter. And the challenge that we have, Dave, as you know is, we've been pretty disciplined about not managing the business on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And so, we really look at things on a full year basis. And so, we're quite comfortable on the 1% to 3% per full year basis. But it's difficult for me to say, will it be two weeks quarter? Will it be one and three? How will it all stack? I just don't know right now.

What we began to see in the first quarter, perhaps a continuation of what we saw in the fourth quarter is more early preliminary buying signs coming from the institution. So I think that for the majority of the community-based institutions out there right now, it's relatively clear who the survivors are going to be, and that group is certainly looking to ramp up their level of spend. I do believe that people have already internalized the fact that there's going to be a significant financial regulation, and so they have been thinking about it. And to the point we were making earlier around the Specialty Consulting, we have a lot of different products that we are bundling together to deliver a deposit-transformation solution, which is our basically, our nomenclature for filling the hole that's going to be created by some of the interchange oriented and fee-oriented issues. So we do see a lot of interest on that front for institutions to look for ways to fill that hole. And there is no question that EFT and some of the other payment solutions are going to play an important role in that, especially given where we talked about where our clients are on the general maturity curve relative to others. So I do think that, that will continue, that discretionary spending will continue to loosen up over the next couple of years. I don't think we're going to get to a normal level for a while. But I think it will slowly move up as people have to take actions against some of the negatives that will obviously be included in the financial regulation. Now who knows what that regulation will finally end up looking like? So there may be things in there that could offset some of that desire clients have to fill those holes and close those gaps. But for now we think that will actually be net positive. As far as is there anything in there that could impact us? For the most part -- not for the most part, we don't actually have revenue-tied fees. We don't have revenue tied to interchange. So the extent that consumers continue to act generally as they have, I think that should not have any material impact on us. I suspect that depending on how some of the card legislation is impacted, if it ends up changing how consumers transact, that could be something that affects everyone in the Card business. And given where our process are, there could be something there. But for right now at least on the surface, we don't see anything that will have a material impact on our business model.

There is no question that our sales force did a phenomenal job in Q4. And we walked into the quarter knowing that it was going to be some tough slugging out there. I would say that we have been very pleasantly surprised at how quickly we were able to refill that pipeline. And not just refill it, that pipeline is actually larger than it was at the beginning of Q4. So the pipeline is very strong. Part of it is because again we have some larger transactions in the pipe, which helps us. But we've got a lot of fundamental activity. Our sales force is very focused on the activity. We're very focused on managing it. One of the things that we announced at the end of the year was the creation of a new global sales organization, and that has raised a ton of visibility across the company. So myself and Tom and others, we're getting a lot more visibility to what's into the pipe. We're helping to make sure that deals are getting done. And we're very close to that level of activity. So part of it is we're a lot closer to know that we're going to get there. Part of it is we're involved, and we know we're going to get there. And part of it is we've got some wonderful momentum that tells us we're going to get there. So it's really those three factors combined that give us the confidence that we're going to either meet or exceed our sales number for the full year.

So we have technologies like Source Capture that are in the middle of that. We have our Source Capture suite. We have, obviously, bill pay and debit and other products. So we are benefiting from that. The challenge is that even though we're getting benefit on one side, we have the loss coming on the other side, on the Item Processing business itself.

One quick housekeeping note. Please mark your calendars for our annual Investor Day to be held on Tuesday, October 5, in New York City. Invitations will be sent out in August. 
So let me say upfront that our Q1 results were consistent with our internal expectations, given our strong fourth quarter's performance, a tight spending environment and the relative strength in last year's Q1. We delivered record free cash flow, solid growth and adjusted earnings per share and continued to make new product investments. Most important, our full year guidance remains unchanged, and we are right on track to achieve it. 
Our bellwether, recurring-revenue base businesses, namely Account Processing, Electronic Banking and Card Services, performed well in the quarter. Despite positive revenue growth in many of our business lines, total adjusted revenue in the quarter declined by 1% to $954 million. 
There were three primary drivers of the revenue decline that were generally anticipated going into the quarter. First, revenue was comparatively weak in Output Solutions against a very strong first quarter in 2009; next, continued sectoral weakness in the check processing space negatively impacted revenue growth; and last, we experienced the decline in license fees and specialty consulting services in the quarter. Tom will provide more detail in a few minutes. 
Adjusted earnings per share was up 6% to $0.95 compared with the first quarter of 2009, in line with our expectations. Adjusted operating margin was 28.9% in the first quarter, down a mere 20 basis points below 2009's high watermark of 29.1% in last year's first quarter. 
Margin was up sequentially over Q4, and importantly, was 20 basis points higher than the 2009 full year result. We're satisfied with our margin performance in the quarter, given the decline in some higher-margin revenue, the extremely low levels of termination fees and float income, and our increased investments in new products 
Free cash flow continued to be excellent, generating an all-time high at $225 million in the quarter, an increase of 15% over the prior year's quarter. As you know, we have three key enterprise priorities for 2010. First, to deliver positive adjusted internal revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments; next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to improved enterprise win rates and a higher share of our strategic products; and third, to provide innovative solutions that increase differentiation and enhance result for our clients. 
As I mentioned, we're on track to attain [ph] full year revenue growth and earnings per share targets. We continue to see steady growth in our recurring-revenue businesses, and we'll also benefit from a large number of new implementations coming online during the year. I can't overstate the importance of our second priority, centering the Fiserv culture on growth. 
As I mentioned on our last call, we created a single global sales organization, which includes new sales and enterprise account management. The sales changes have been very well received and momentum is high. Sales for the first quarter were better than expected, and the pipeline has grown substantially from the end of the year. In addition, there were several significant transactions in the pipeline that we expect will close in the second quarter. In fact, one has already closed, which should have a positive impact on 2010 revenue. 
We closed 139 new debit and bill payment clients in the quarter, reinforcing our commitment to increase the size of our Strategic Payments businesses. We're also in full swing with our new person-to-person payment's capability, and recently announced that over 40 institutions have committed to launch our new product this summer with the pool of millions of potential users from our CheckFree RXP user base. 
Centering on a growth culture is not just about sales. It's also how we serve clients, the quality of our service delivery and the ability to develop technology solutions, which anticipate the needs of an evolving market. We're confident that our transformation will enhance loyalty, expand wallet share and increase win rates even further. 
To our third priority, we're continuing to invest in areas that will increase value to clients and enhance the power of our existing solutions. For example, products such as Mobile Money, P2P and integrated debit will create both standalone and new revenue, and also accelerate transaction growth across our existing Payment businesses. 
Late in the quarter, we hosted our Bank Solutions conference, which is one of the largest client events of the year. We had nearly 1,000 account processing clients, about 1,500 attendees, who clearly see the value of adding new and differentiating capabilities to their institution. Our solution center was jampacked, showcasing many of the Fiserv wide technology solutions. As a result, clients requested over 2,400 product and solutions sales proposals this year, more than twice the number of requested last year, providing us with increased confidence in the direction of our solutions and the sales opportunities ahead. 
As important, that level of increased activity is a positive sign of a potential return to a more normalized technology-spending environment. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom for more details on the financial results"
128209,100417380,60519,"Fiserv Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Throughout my discussion, I will refer to the supplemental information included in the slide presentation. As shown on Slide 3, adjusted revenue in the quarter was down 1% to $954 million, compared with the fi",1585,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Throughout my discussion, I will refer to the supplemental information included in the slide presentation. 
As shown on Slide 3, adjusted revenue in the quarter was down 1% to $954 million, compared with the first quarter of 2009, and consistent with our expectations that we will produce stronger second half revenue and earnings growth. As Jeff mentioned in his remarks, we saw growth in a number of our areas, including our core Account Processing, Electronic Banking and Card Services businesses. This performance was offset by several factors, including a tough year-over-year comparison in our Output Solutions business, related to higher-margin revenue in 2009 that did not recur in 2010. This, alone, negatively impacted our revenue growth rate by one percentage point in the quarter. 
The revenue in this business will generally have more quarter-to-quarter variability than our typical recurring-revenue base businesses. In addition, declines in license and specialty consulting revenue, compared to a strong first quarter of 2009, negatively impacted quarterly revenue growth by one percentage point. Finally, volume reductions in our Check Processing business contributed an additional one percentage point drag on overall revenue growth in the quarter. 
We remain confident in our full year adjusted internal revenue growth guidance of 1% to 3% due primarily to the following factors: first, our core businesses continue to perform well, particularly in the account processing and payment areas, which represent the majority of our revenue. We expect revenue growth to be stronger in the second half of 2010. Second, as Jeff mentioned, we expect to win several significant transactions this year that will positively impact 2010 revenue. And as we shared, one of these large deals has already closed. 
Third, there are a number of client conversions in process from sales in 2009, some of which are quite large that should ramp up as we progress through 2010. Examples of these significant wins include American Savings Bank and Tesco. Typically, these larger transactions have significant professional services revenue included in the relationship. This overall effect has contributed to a $10 million increase in deferred revenue in the current year, and a $17 million increase over the prior year's first quarter, which should convert to revenue in the coming months. Fourth, the combination of an uptick in client-buying patterns and improved sales execution should boost performance as we proceed through the year. Finally, we don't expect to grow over [ph] issues in businesses, such as Output Solutions, to persist. 
Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.95, up 6% compared with the prior year. You will note that there are no income statement adjustments for CheckFree integration costs or similar items, given the time that has elapsed since the acquisition. However, we still expect to incur a couple of million dollars, per quarter this year, of integration cost, severance and various other expenses, which have been incorporated into our full year guidance. 
On balance, we do not consider these amounts to be material to our results. For example, in this quarter, we incurred nearly $3 million of incremental cost for call center consolidation in our Payments segment that previously would have been treated as integration cost. 
Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 28.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from the first quarter of 2009. Given the increase in investments and the decline in higher-margin revenue in the quarter, we are satisfied with the results. Additionally, as Jeff mentioned, adjusted operating margin was up sequentially for the quarter, and 20 basis points better than the full year 2009 result. We are on track for our expected full year margin improvement. 
Now on to the segment results. The Payment segment generated adjusted revenue of $486 million in the quarter, which, as shown on Slide 4, was roughly flat with the first quarter of 2009. Growth in our Electronic Banking and Card Services businesses were primarily offset by the decrease in the Output Solutions business, which negatively impacted the segment growth rate by two percentage points. 
We also have lower license fees in the segment and a large client, which took the management of its ATMs in-house at the beginning of 2010. Although this is relatively low-margin revenue, it will negatively impact segment revenue growth by about one percentage point for the year. This did not have an impact on our traditional ATM-driving business. 
We are also seeing strong interest in our channel solutions domestically and around the world. We anticipate some significant wins in this arena, which should positively impact revenue growth in 2010. Full income in the quarter was basically nonexistent as interest rates remained at historically low levels. Growth in Card Services was driven primarily by a continued strong, double-digit growth in transaction volumes from our debit products. 
Our combined debit processing and network transactions grew 23% versus the prior year's first quarter. These strong results reflect the continued macro trend towards debit card usage and strong integrated sales to our account processing base. 
Bill payment transactions grew 6% in the quarter, compared with the first quarter of 2010, excluding volume from a remittance only large bank client that was acquired in 2008 and moved off of our platform in the fourth quarter of 2009. Overall transaction volume growth was negatively impacted by cyclically weak volume at some larger clients that have higher levels of bill payment penetration. 
Turning to Slide 5, operating income for the Payments segment was $148 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin of 30.5% was down 140 basis points compared with the first quarter of 2009. The reduction in adjusted operating margin for the segment was driven primarily by decreases in higher-margin revenue in our Output Solutions and Risk Management businesses, the margin impact of product development investments that we have highlighted previously, and as I mentioned, incremental integration costs, including severance, of nearly $3 million related to a call center consolidation expensed within the segment. These impacts were partially offset by continued operating leverage and overall attainment of operational efficiencies. 
The Financial segment generated revenue of $472 million in the quarter, down 3% compared with the first quarter of 2009. Decline in volume in the Check Processing business accounted for two percentage points of the segment revenue headwind in the quarter. Decreases in license fees and specialty consulting revenue also negatively impacted segment revenue growth in the quarter by an additional two percentage points. 
Importantly, in spite of the historically low termination fees and lower levels of discretionary spending by our clients, the Account Processing business continued to exhibit steady growth in the quarter. As Jeff mentioned, we saw demand increasing for a number of products, and we expect that to translate to a stronger second half of the year. 
We continue to efficiently manage our business, reducing overall operating expenses in the segment by 3% compared with the first quarter of 2009. We are using these efficiencies to help offset the impact of increased investment funding in areas such as Acumen, our state-of-the-art account processing platform for large credit unions, and our new PEP+ ACH ASP solution. We are also building innovative deposit transformation solutions, designed to help financial institutions deal with the impact of financial regulation, including Reg E, which will have a significant impact on fee revenue for the financial industry. 
Operating income in the quarter was $136 million, and adjusted operating margin was 28.8%, a 50 basis point decline compared with the first quarter of 2009. The reduction in adjusted operating margin in the segment was driven by decreases in higher-margin license and specialty consulting revenue and the impact of incremental product investments, partially offset by operational effectiveness benefits. 
Adjusted operating loss in our Corporate and Other segment improved by approximately $7 million in the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009, due to a combination of reduced corporate spending and a gain on the sale of an operating facility of $4.5 million. 
Capital expenditures were $42 million in the quarter, down 7% compared with the first quarter of 2009. Our capital expenditures primarily reflect investments in technology equipment and purchase software. Most of the labor and operating costs related to product development are expensed directly through the income statement. 
We had record free cash flow in a single quarter, generating $225 million, a 15% increase compared with the first quarter of 2009. Free cash flow per share grew 16% in the quarter to $1.46 compared with $1.26 in 2009. We used our strong free cash flow to prepay $126 million of debt in the quarter, representing nearly one half of our debt repayment obligations for the entire year. As a result, our total debt is approximately $3.5 billion at March 31, resulting in a trailing 12-month debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.7x. 
Net interest expense was $45 million in the quarter, as compared to $54 million in the first quarter of 2009. The decline resulted from lower debt balances and the expected positive impact of interest rate hedges that rolled off at the end of 2009. 
We also repurchased 1.4 million shares for $67 million in the quarter. As of March 31, we had 5.8 million shares remaining in our outstanding repurchase authorizations. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter of approximately 38% was negatively impacted by the R&D credit not being authorized in the first quarter of 2010 compared to 2009. This had a negative impact of about $0.01 per share in first quarter earnings compared to 2009. 
Now I'll turn the call back over to Jeff."
128209,100417380,60519,"Fiserv Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tom. As you know, our fourth quarter sales were quite strong, and December, in particular, was the highest sales month in the history of the company. Sales in January and February started slow, and we rebounded a bit in March ending the quarter at",858,"Thanks, Tom. As you know, our fourth quarter sales were quite strong, and December, in particular, was the highest sales month in the history of the company. Sales in January and February started slow, and we rebounded a bit in March ending the quarter at about 82% attainment. While this is short of our laudable full year objective, it's important to note that the quarter for 2010 was again increased versus the 2009 level. 
The total contract value of closed transactions was higher in the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2009. We had numerous competitive takeaways in the Account Processing and Payments businesses, and new clients often continued to buy multiple Fiserv solutions. We were also encouraged by how quickly the sales pipeline was replenished during the quarter. 
We continue to expect longer and somewhat unpredictable sales cycles times given the environment. However, given our visibility into the pipeline, we expect to meet or exceed sales targets for the year. 
Integrated sales were $23 million in the quarter, a 22% attainment level against our full year target of $105 million and 15% growth over the first quarter's attainment in 2009. We are on track to meet our integrated sales target for the year. The leading areas of integrated sales continue to be payments, customer channels, such as Internet banking and brands and efficiency-based products. 
As I mentioned up front, we signed 93 new bill payment clients and 46 new debit clients in the quarter. Since the acquisition of CheckFree in late 2007, we have added over 1,500 new client relationships in these two strategic payment solution areas, and we still have significant room to grow. 
We generated over $19 million of cost savings through our operational effectiveness initiatives in the quarter, almost 50% of our $40 million full year target. While we don't expect to attain cost saves at this pace through the remainder of the year, we fully expect to meet or exceed our operational effectiveness target for 2010. 
As we said in our last call, we believe there are significant opportunities to further optimize our cost structure, which we will share with you in more detail at our Investor Day. 
Before we take questions, let me update you on our view of the environment and guidance for the year. There have been 64 regulatory actions through April 23, 31 more than at the same time last year. This increase in resolutions is within our range of expectations for the full year. Even at these levels, the number of institutions impacted in 2010 would represent between 1% and 2% of the more than 16,000 financial institutions in the country, and much less than the 3% average decline in the number of financial institutions seen over the last 20 years or so prior to 2009. Overall, we are down slightly in terms of wins and losses since the beginning of the regulatory actions in 2008, and we still expect to be about neutral over time. 
On balance, we expect to lose far fewer clients to regulatory action than many thought possible at the start of the banking crisis. Although capital is still tight within the financial institution landscape, there does appear to be a loosening of discretionary spending. And although this will be more prevalent in those institutions that are healthier, there is a broad realization that some level of discretionary spending is required for any institution to be able to move forward. 
In addition, there are early-stage conversations happening in the industry around organic or non-resolution acquisition by institutions who want to quickly capitalize on market opportunity instead of waiting to see what may be available via the resolution channel. We believe our wide range of market-leading solutions, along with the portfolio of new product investments we are making, have us extremely well positioned to accelerate revenue growth as the financial industry moves closer to a new normal. 
As I mentioned upfront, our 2010 expectations remain unchanged from the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. We continue to expect 2010 adjusted internal revenue growth to be in a range of 1% to 3%, which should include stronger growth in the Payment segment. And as we have said several times, revenue growth will be stronger in the second half of the year. 
We expect 2010 adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% to 11%, and that full year free cash flow will increase between 5% and 8% to over $700 million. Lastly, we anticipate that adjusted operating margin for the company will expand by at least 50 basis points for the full year. 
Although the market has not returned to its pre-crisis level, there are some early signs of improvement. We continue to make the strategic moves necessary to position Fiserv to deliver client and shareholder value. We would not be where we are today if it were not for the tireless efforts of our nearly 20,000 associates around the world. I continue to be impressed by the quality of our people and their commitment to delivering superior service and value to our clients. 
With that, Carlisle, let's open the line for questions."

As we've talked about, historically, and I think, I know you're aware of this, Bryan, the license revenue for the company is a about, typically, an average about 5%. And each quarter, that can vary from anywhere from 4% to 6%. Clearly in 2009, we had a very strong fourth quarter, which is at the higher end of that particular range. In the first quarter of last year, our license revenues were about 5% of total revenues, and they were down, as I indicated, roughly about 15% to about 4% of total revenues in the first quarter. And some of that had to do with, clearly, we had a strong Q4. And clearly, this year, as we indicated, as our pipelines for billing and demand, we anticipate that those license fees will continue to accelerate as we go through the year. Regarding the professional services, to the second part of your question, really, the professional services revenue was pretty solid in the first quarter. We do have a Specialty Consulting business that we talked about, and that's a revenue-enhancement Consulting business and we have really transformed that business over the last six to nine months to really focus on the new financial regulation, Reg E, and have retooled that for our clients. And that's been a lot of investment dollars in that in rebuilding our pipeline over the last six to nine months.

That business probably won't generate any material business until the second half of the year. So we basically have had to retool that business because it used to be based significantly on optimizing fee revenue for financial institutions into a new consulting operating, which is catching a lot of steam on -- now looking for different ways and institutions to make up for the fee revenue that there no longer going to have. And so, we wouldn't see that generating any material revenue into the second half of the year. So that's, for an example. I think the other caveat that, unfortunately, I think every one of us in the industry right now has put on this is sales cycles are just not predictable. And some of the sales, like license revenue, they just happen once in a quarter or it doesn't happen in a quarter. And the challenge that we have, Dave, as you know is, we've been pretty disciplined about not managing the business on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And so, we really look at things on a full year basis. And so, we're quite comfortable on the 1% to 3% per full year basis. But it's difficult for me to say, will it be two weeks quarter?

What we began to see in the first quarter, perhaps a continuation of what we saw in the fourth quarter is more early preliminary buying signs coming from the institution. So I think that for the majority of the community-based institutions out there right now, it's relatively clear who the survivors are going to be, and that group is certainly looking to ramp up their level of spend. I do believe that people have already internalized the fact that there's going to be a significant financial regulation, and so they have been thinking about it. And to the point we were making earlier around the Specialty Consulting, we have a lot of different products that we are bundling together to deliver a deposit-transformation solution, which is our basically, our nomenclature for filling the hole that's going to be created by some of the interchange oriented and fee-oriented issues. So we do see a lot of interest on that front for institutions to look for ways to fill that hole. And there is no question that EFT and some of the other payment solutions are going to play an important role in that, especially given where we talked about where our clients are on the general maturity curve relative to others. So I do think that, that will continue, that discretionary spending will continue to loosen up over the next couple of years. I don't think we're going to get to a normal level for a while. But I think it will slowly move up as people have to take actions against some of the negatives that will obviously be included in the financial regulation. Now who knows what that regulation will finally end up looking like? So there may be things in there that could offset some of that desire clients have to fill those holes and close those gaps. But for now we think that will actually be net positive. As far as is there anything in there that could impact us? For the most part -- not for the most part, we don't actually have revenue-tied fees. We don't have revenue tied to interchange. So the extent that consumers continue to act generally as they have, I think that should not have any material impact on us. I suspect that depending on how some of the card legislation is impacted, if it ends up changing how consumers transact, that could be something that affects everyone in the Card business. And given where our process are, there could be something there. But for right now at least on the surface, we don't see anything that will have a material impact on our business model."

So if you think about the Check Processing business, that business, which is also known as Item Processing, is literally the processing of paper. And so today, there are, in theory, less checks being written. We know that. And there's also the conversion of paper to electronic. And So that item itself no longer has to clear. So we have technologies like Source Capture that are in the middle of that. We have our Source Capture suite. We have, obviously, bill pay and debit and other products. So we are benefiting from that. The challenge is that even though we're getting benefit on one side, we have the loss coming on the other side, on the Item Processing business itself. And while the team has, frankly, done a yeoman's job in realigning our cost structure against that, it just takes time for that to happen.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Joining me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Hirsch. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We will make forward-looking statements about, among other matters, adjusted internal revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating margins, free cash flow, sales pipelines and our strategic initiative Fiserv 2.0.  Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release which can be found on our website at fiserv.com for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our earnings release for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call and for a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. 
We had solid performance in the second quarter across each of our key measures and are gaining momentum going into the second half of the year. We are seeing the ramp in 2010 performance that was anticipated within our guidance and we remain right on track to achieve our full-year outlook. 
Internal revenue growth in the quarter was 2%. Adjusted operating margin of 29.6% expanded 70 basis points on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased 11% to $1 compared to $0.90 last year. Free cash flow increased 12% in the quarter, contributing to a strong 14% increase in free cash flow for the first half of the year to $353 million. 
In our last call, we shared that we had been working a number of important sales opportunities and that we expected two of them to close in the second quarter. In fact, one deal had already closed prior to our first quarter announcement, and the other, a potentially a ground breaking channel transformation, was announced earlier today. 
During the quarter, we expanded our relationship with The WestPac Group, the second largest bank in Australia. The WestPac Group, through a very competitive process, chose our solutions to transform their online banking presence. The WestPac Group serves more than 2 million active online customers and expects this channel to continue to grow. We will establish a technology center of excellence in Sydney that will house senior product strategists and developers to enable the WestPac Group initiative along with other growth in the region. We believe this could be the start of a significant cycle of online banking renewal around the world. 
Customers are demanding more online access to services with varied preferences on how and when they want it. Meeting this need will require financial institutions to enhance their digital capabilities, which we believe could create material opportunities for our market-leading global online banking technology and digital solutions. We couldn't be happier to partner with an organization as progressive as The WestPac Group, which continues to embrace this important change. 
Let me now update you on our three key enterprise priorities for 2010. First, to deliver positive adjusted internal revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments. Next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to improved enterprise win rates and a higher share of our strategic products. And third, to provide innovative solutions that increase differentiation and enhance results for our clients. 
As I mentioned up front, we delivered 2% internal revenue growth in the quarter and adjusted earnings per share increased 11%. Our quality of earnings remains strong as evidenced by the continuing margin expansion even in the face of planned incremental investments, as well as the exceptional conversion of earnings to free cash flow. We are on track to achieve our full-year adjusted internal revenue growth and earnings per share targets. Although it is listed as our second priority for the year, our top transformational focus is to fully center the Fiserv culture on growth. We consider growth in terms of clients, wallet share and innovation, all bundled together with a wrapper of superior client service. We believe that winning formula will deliver exceptional value for our clients, associates and you, our shareholders. 
The creation of our single sales organization has bolstered performance and is contributing to building a stronger pipeline. We had strong sales results in the quarter, signing a number of new clients as well as expanding relationships across a broad continuum of products, including account processing. 
Sales quota attainment in the quarter was 102%. As another proof point, the second quarter's result included a record level of payment wins with 215 new sales in the quarter, a 34% increase over last year's Q2. This included 157 new bill payment sales and 58 in debit processing. Market momentum is strong. 
Delivering meaningful innovation, our third key priority, is an area where we are truly differentiating ourselves in terms of new products and services. We are investing across multiple fronts, which should allow us to better serve the needs of a dynamic market and extend our leadership position for many years to come. Interest continues to grow in Acumen, our next generation account processing platform for large credit unions. In the quarter, we announced that Consumer's Credit Union of Waukegan, Illinois became the second U.S.-based credit union to choose our state-of-the-art, fully integrated solution. We expect to see additional Acumen wins in the second half of 2010 as the sales pipeline continues to grow, and even more success over the next several years. 
We also went live with ZashPay, our new person-to-person payments or P2P solution in the quarter. As of June 30, we had signed over 160 institutions, an increase of 120 signings in the second quarter alone. We expect to add clients at a strong clip as demand grows. Importantly, our P2P service can be accessed here through a participating financial institution via our bill payment technology or consumers can go direct at ZashPay.com, which helps expand our network even faster. 
We are processing transactions and already have 250,000 registered users. We are seeing a wide range in transaction amounts, as low as a few dollars and as high as $8,000. Research has told us that consumers want digital payments to be fast and easy. Our service allows consumers to send transactions in one to three days directly to any bank account in the U.S. faster than any other P2P service using only an e-mail address or a mobile phone number. 
Because ZashPay provides tangible value to consumers, financial institutions can charge for this service which produces valuable fee revenue. Although it's early, we can already see numerous ways that Zashing money becomes a standard for person-to-person payments. You can learn more and even sign up for this service at ZashPay.com. Now let me turn the call over to Tom for more detail on the results."
128209,108916047,69775,"Fiserv, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-27-2010",2010-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Throughout my discussion, I will refer to the supplemental information included in the slide presentation which is available on our website. As shown on Slide 3, adjusted revenue increased by 2% organically to",1292,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Throughout my discussion, I will refer to the supplemental information included in the slide presentation which is available on our website. 
As shown on Slide 3, adjusted revenue increased by 2% organically to $970 million in the quarter, a solid acceleration over the negative 1% in the first quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted revenue was roughly flat at $1.9 billion, in line with our expectations. Revenue growth in the quarter was broad-based, led by steady growth from our key recurring revenue payments businesses such as electronic banking and debit processing, which together represent approximately 70% of our Payments segment. 
We also saw a similar strong performance in our account processing businesses, which represent about 70% of the Financial segment revenue. This strength was partially offset by softness in item processing, lending and Output Solutions, which continued to negatively impact our revenue growth rate in the quarter and year-to-date. 
Contract termination fees increased $8 million in the quarter to $12 million and have increased $9 million for the year to $14 million. The increase in termination fees in the quarter was due primarily to an item processing client acquired by another institution. We expect termination fees to return to more normalized levels as market activity accelerates over time. 
License fees, which represent only about 5% of consolidated revenue, declined by $5 million in the quarter and are down $11 million for the first six months of the year. We continue to expect choppiness in license revenue between quarters. However, we still expect buying patterns to be relatively stable on a year-over-year basis. 
Adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter increased 11% to $1 compared with the prior-year. Year-to-date adjusted earnings per share was up 8% to $1.95 versus $1.80 last year. Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 29.6%, an increase of 70 basis points over the second quarter of 2009. The increase in margin was positively impacted by continuing operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses, cost efficiencies and termination fees. These positive factors were offset by continued increased investments and lower license revenue. 
Adjusted operating margin through June 30 was 29.2%, an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year's level and 50 basis points higher than the margin for all of 2009. Now I will move on to the segment results. 
Payments segment adjusted revenue was $487 million in the quarter and $973 million year-to-date, net of postage reimbursements in Output Solutions. As shown on Slide 5, adjusted internal revenue growth in the Payments segment was 3% in the quarter and 1% year-to-date. Payments revenue growth in the quarter was driven primarily by electronic banking, card services and Investment Services, partially offset by a slight decrease in Output Solutions. These results include the negative impact of a large client bringing ATM management in-house at the beginning of 2010, which negatively impacts segment revenue growth by about one percentage point each quarter and for the full year. 
[ph] Flow (19:18) income in the quarter continued to be virtually nonexistent as interest rates remained at historically low levels. Bill payment transaction volume increased 9% in the quarter and was up 3% sequentially. As in the first quarter, this data excludes the volume from a large bank remittance-only client that was acquired in 2008 and migrated off our platform in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
During the second quarter, the majority of our bill payment clients experienced mid-teens average transaction growth rates versus the prior year. And importantly, each of our 10 largest bill payment clients showed sequential bill payment improvement in the quarter. 
Card services revenue growth was driven primarily by a 22% increase in transaction volumes from our core debit products. We continue to benefit from both the consumer adoption of debit and adding new debit clients. Even in the face of regulatory change, we believe that debit transactions will remain a favored vehicle for consumers, which should continue to bolster transaction growth over the foreseeable future. 
Turning to Slide 6, operating income for the Payments segment was $151 million in the quarter and $299 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin of 31% in the quarter was flat compared to the prior year. Through June 30, adjusted operating margin was down 60 basis points to 30.8%. The strong margin fall-through in our recurring revenue businesses was offset by higher product development expenses, integration investments and weakness in Output Solutions. We also had incremental CheckFree integration costs in the segment, including severance related to a call center consolidation of approximately $2 million in the quarter and $5 million year-to-date. 
The Financial segment generated revenue of $487 million in the quarter and $959 million year-to-date. As shown on Slide 5, adjusted internal revenue growth in the segment was 1% in the quarter and down 1% year-to-date. Growth in the second quarter was driven by mid-single digit growth in our account processing businesses and an increase in termination fee revenue. This was partially offset by lower license revenue, continued reductions in check processing volumes and softness in our lending solutions businesses. 
Operating income for the Financial segment was $151 million in the second quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 30.9%, an increase of 100 basis points over the prior-year period. Operating income through June 30 was $287 million and adjusted operating margin was up 30 basis points to 29.9% compared with the prior year. The increase in operating margin for the quarter and year-to-date were driven by growth in account processing recurring revenue and the increase in termination fees. This performance was partially offset by a decline in license fees and incremental investments in areas such as Acumen, our new hosted PEP+ ACH solution, and innovative transformation solutions designed to help financial institutions deal with the impact of financial regulation. 
Adjusted operating loss in our Corporate and Other segment was $15 million in the quarter and $24 million year-to-date. The $6 million sequential increase in the second quarter loss over the $9 million loss in the first quarter was due primarily to the building gain recorded in the first quarter. 
As Jeff highlighted up front, the quality of our earnings is in part evidenced by our strong conversion of earnings to free cash flow. Free cash flow for the first half of the year has grown 14% over the prior-year, to $353 million. Free cash flow per share increased 16% to $2.30 compared with $1.99 in 2009. We used our strong free cash flow in the quarter to repurchase 2.8 million shares for $135 million. 
As of June 30, we have repurchased 4.2 million shares at a total cost of $202 million, and have about 3 million shares remaining in our outstanding repurchase authorization. We also repaid $76 million of debt in the quarter. We have repaid $202 million in the first half of the year and have $58 million of required debt repayment remaining in 2010. 
As of June 30, our total debt of approximately $3.4 billion results in a trailing 12-month debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.6x. We also completed a small acquisition towards the very end of the quarter, AdviceAmerica, which is a best in class provider of integrated advisor desktop solutions, which extends our Investment Services capabilities into front office applications. 
Net interest expense was $46 million in the quarter as compared to $55 million in the second quarter of 2009. The decline resulted from lower debt balances and the positive impact of interest rate hedges that rolled off at the end of 2009. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter and year-to-date is approximately 38%, which includes the negative impact of the R&D tax credit, which has not yet been authorized in 2010. Now I will turn the call back over to Jeff."

As I mentioned in my opening comments, sales in the second quarter were strong, achieving 102% of quota. Year-to-date quota attainment is 92% as compared to 90% through the first half of 2009. As noted in our last call, we increased the 2010",970,"Thanks, Tom. As I mentioned in my opening comments, sales in the second quarter were strong, achieving 102% of quota. Year-to-date quota attainment is 92% as compared to 90% through the first half of 2009. As noted in our last call, we increased the 2010 sales quota over the level of 2009. Although year-to-date quota attainment is down a bit to target, our actual sales results through June 30 are up 8% versus the prior year. 
New client wins and sales to existing clients were solid across most segments. Sales cycles remain longer than normal, as financial institutions monitor economic conditions and begin to sort out the impacts of financial reform. Our sales pipeline, in terms of both size and quality, remains strong. We are optimistic that we will attain our full-year sales goal. 
Integrated sales were $30 million in the second quarter and $53 million through the first half of the year. Year-to-date integrated sales are 13% ahead of last year's level, and we remain on track to meet our target of $105 million for the full year. The leading areas of integrated sales continue to be in the areas of Payments, efficiency-based products and channel solutions. 
We've signed over 350 new bill payment and debit clients in the first six months of 2010 alone, and the percentage of competitive takeaways is increasing. The breadth and depth of our Account Processing business continues to serve as an important distribution opportunity for our industry-leading payment solutions. 
Our operational effectiveness initiatives generated $15 million of cost saves in the second quarter and $34 million in the first half of the year, roughly 85% of our 2010 target. Our plan called for the majority of our cost saves to occur in the first half of the year and we remain on-track to achieve our operational effectiveness target for 2010. 
While we are pleased that we should achieve our $250 million cost savings result a full one year ahead of schedule, we're not stopping there. We see a number of interesting opportunities to be more efficient and effective within our business model, which we will discuss in more detail at Investor Day. 
Before we take questions, let me update you on our view of the environment and guidance for the full year. As we expected, the number of regulatory actions continues to rise. There have been 114 actions through July 23, 43 more than in the prior year and in line with our forecast. We continue to expect the number of regulatory actions to peak in 2010, and absent a material step-down in the economy, begin to tail off in 2011. 
Overall, as was the case last year, we still expect the negative impact of regulatory actions to be less onerous than the approximately 3% per year historical decline of banks, thrifts and credit unions due to market consolidation. We're seeing a slight pickup in the level of voluntary or non-regulatory assisted, M&A activity, which we view as a positive sign for the banking industry. We're encouraged by the client conversations and technology spending patterns that we have observed throughout the first half of the year. 
Financial institutions are increasingly focused on technology solutions that can help them win and retain customers, generate more revenue and enhance their operating efficiency. Although we expect that to generally continue, we do not expect a full return to normalized IT spending until the economy is on a firmer footing and the ramifications of the broad financial industry legislation are better understood. 
Regulatory change is front and center as the industry grapples with the complexities of what has passed and what's still to come. New legislation, such as the Dodd-Frank Bill, which includes the Durbin Amendment, will require the drafting of hundreds of new regulations to support the bill over the course of the next 12 months. It's simply too early and the legislation too complex to determine how, where and when various industry participants will be impacted. 
In addition, we fully expect innovation to prevail and that new opportunities will emerge that are not in play today. That said, our initial and quite preliminary view is that the risks and opportunities of the new legislation on Fiserv are generally balanced. We intend to have a seat at the table working with our broad range of clients to design solutions that will allow Fiserv to capitalize on the opportunities that will emerge in this new world. 
As I mentioned earlier, our 2010 guidance remains unchanged. We continue to expect 2010 adjusted internal revenue growth to be in a range of 1% to 3%, including stronger growth in our Payments segment. We still expect 2010 adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% to 11% and full-year free cash flow to grow 5% to 8% to over $700 million. We anticipate the company-adjusted operating margin will expand by at least 50 basis points for the year. 
And finally on guidance, we believe that given the environment, any perceived overperformance in the quarter should be viewed as de-risking our full-year outlook. As I mentioned, we're pleased with our results for the quarter and are on track for the full year. The strength of our business model and the quality of our nearly 20,000 associates have coalesced to deliver meaningful value to our clients and to generate strong financial performance in one of the most difficult environments ever seen. We are winning in the markets where it matters most, account processing, payments and channel solutions, and we are well-positioned to lead as digital transformation reshapes the financial industry.

And based on, again, the conversations that we're having with market participants, we believe that the issue is not around capital. It's about the regulatory structure allowing people to set up, whether it's De Novos or other kind of institutions to acquire. And I believe that we probably won't see much of this year on that front, but certainly, as the regulators get the larger mass of institutions redirected that need to be redirected and they can open themselves up to focus on the approval process, we'll see that. And if you look back in history, you can see that after any significant wave of closings you see a big boost in De Novo, and we fully expect that will happen again."

So clearly, the margins in that business are lower overall because it requires more labor, and that's really what you're seeing as I highlight earlier in my commentary to John. You can kind of see the revenue increasing and kind of the margins in that cost to processing and services because the lower margin is turning into over higher-margin electronic form of transactions. And so overall, we clearly lose some on the revenue per transaction, but it's built in and we're building margins and scale and so overall from that standpoint, it's good.

And to the extent there's good news, and there is. The level of opt-in rates, by which was the big driver of the original fee structure conversations, has been substantially higher than were originally anticipated. And therefore, some of the more, call it, draconian pricing strategies that were being considered are not going to need to be used. And we've heard people talk about having very little changes to their pricing, and then we've seen things like what we all saw in the paper, I think, what Bank of America did on their statements and things like that. There is not a one-size-fits-all answer. But it is on things like some service charges of accounts. I've heard things like charging for people to use a debit card, a variety of different piecemeal kind of going from a fixed price to an a la carte menu pricing. I do think it's too early to look at this. I think we need to get through the opt-in cycle, see what that looks like, get through the kind of the Durban [ph] (1:04:50) elements of the dog bill and see what that looks like. But clearly, there is a significant amount of energy around what will the pricing look like. And my point around innovation in our prepared comments were these are some really, really smart people that are going to figure out how to use the system to make sure that all of those earnings go away. And there will be some new product innovation like ZashPay, which allows people the opportunity -- allows institutions the opportunity to charge a consumer a relatively nominal amount for a very highly valued service. So I think we'll see more of that and it'll play out over the next, I think, three to six months."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. Joining me today is our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Hirsch. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We will make forward-looking statements about, among other matters, adjusted internal revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating margins, free cash flow, sales pipelines and our strategic initiative Fiserv 2.0.  Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release which can be found on our website at fiserv.com for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our earnings release for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call and for a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. 
We had solid performance in the second quarter across each of our key measures and are gaining momentum going into the second half of the year. We are seeing the ramp in 2010 performance that was anticipated within our guidance and we remain right on track to achieve our full-year outlook. 
Internal revenue growth in the quarter was 2%. Adjusted operating margin of 29.6% expanded 70 basis points on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased 11% to $1 compared to $0.90 last year. Free cash flow increased 12% in the quarter, contributing to a strong 14% increase in free cash flow for the first half of the year to $353 million. 
In our last call, we shared that we had been working a number of important sales opportunities and that we expected two of them to close in the second quarter. In fact, one deal had already closed prior to our first quarter announcement, and the other, a potentially a ground breaking channel transformation, was announced earlier today. 
During the quarter, we expanded our relationship with The WestPac Group, the second largest bank in Australia. The WestPac Group, through a very competitive process, chose our solutions to transform their online banking presence. The WestPac Group serves more than 2 million active online customers and expects this channel to continue to grow. We will establish a technology center of excellence in Sydney that will house senior product strategists and developers to enable the WestPac Group initiative along with other growth in the region. We believe this could be the start of a significant cycle of online banking renewal around the world. 
Customers are demanding more online access to services with varied preferences on how and when they want it. Meeting this need will require financial institutions to enhance their digital capabilities, which we believe could create material opportunities for our market-leading global online banking technology and digital solutions. We couldn't be happier to partner with an organization as progressive as The WestPac Group, which continues to embrace this important change. 
Let me now update you on our three key enterprise priorities for 2010. First, to deliver positive adjusted internal revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments. Next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to improved enterprise win rates and a higher share of our strategic products. And third, to provide innovative solutions that increase differentiation and enhance results for our clients. 
As I mentioned up front, we delivered 2% internal revenue growth in the quarter and adjusted earnings per share increased 11%. Our quality of earnings remains strong as evidenced by the continuing margin expansion even in the face of planned incremental investments, as well as the exceptional conversion of earnings to free cash flow. We are on track to achieve our full-year adjusted internal revenue growth and earnings per share targets. Although it is listed as our second priority for the year, our top transformational focus is to fully center the Fiserv culture on growth. We consider growth in terms of clients, wallet share and innovation, all bundled together with a wrapper of superior client service. We believe that winning formula will deliver exceptional value for our clients, associates and you, our shareholders. 
The creation of our single sales organization has bolstered performance and is contributing to building a stronger pipeline. We had strong sales results in the quarter, signing a number of new clients as well as expanding relationships across a broad continuum of products, including account processing. 
Sales quota attainment in the quarter was 102%. As another proof point, the second quarter's result included a record level of payment wins with 215 new sales in the quarter, a 34% increase over last year's Q2. This included 157 new bill payment sales and 58 in debit processing. Market momentum is strong. 
Delivering meaningful innovation, our third key priority, is an area where we are truly differentiating ourselves in terms of new products and services. We are investing across multiple fronts, which should allow us to better serve the needs of a dynamic market and extend our leadership position for many years to come. Interest continues to grow in Acumen, our next generation account processing platform for large credit unions. In the quarter, we announced that Consumer's Credit Union of Waukegan, Illinois became the second U.S.-based credit union to choose our state-of-the-art, fully integrated solution. We expect to see additional Acumen wins in the second half of 2010 as the sales pipeline continues to grow, and even more success over the next several years. 
We also went live with ZashPay, our new person-to-person payments or P2P solution in the quarter. As of June 30, we had signed over 160 institutions, an increase of 120 signings in the second quarter alone. We expect to add clients at a strong clip as demand grows. Importantly, our P2P service can be accessed here through a participating financial institution via our bill payment technology or consumers can go direct at ZashPay.com, which helps expand our network even faster. 
We are processing transactions and already have 250,000 registered users. We are seeing a wide range in transaction amounts, as low as a few dollars and as high as $8,000. Research has told us that consumers want digital payments to be fast and easy. Our service allows consumers to send transactions in one to three days directly to any bank account in the U.S. faster than any other P2P service using only an e-mail address or a mobile phone number. 
Because ZashPay provides tangible value to consumers, financial institutions can charge for this service which produces valuable fee revenue. Although it's early, we can already see numerous ways that Zashing money becomes a standard for person-to-person payments. You can learn more and even sign up for this service at ZashPay.com. 
Now let me turn the call over to Tom for more detail on the results."
128209,108916047,71996,"Fiserv, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-27-2010",2010-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Throughout my discussion, I will refer to the supplemental information included in the slide presentation, which is available on our website. As shown on Slide 3, adjusted revenue increased by 2% organically t",1292,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Throughout my discussion, I will refer to the supplemental information included in the slide presentation, which is available on our website. 
As shown on Slide 3, adjusted revenue increased by 2% organically to $970 million in the quarter, a solid acceleration over the negative 1% in the first quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted revenue was roughly flat at $1.9 billion, in line with our expectations. Revenue growth in the quarter was broad-based, led by steady growth from our key recurring revenue payments businesses such as electronic banking and debit processing, which together represent approximately 70% of our Payments segment. 
We also saw a similar strong performance in our account processing businesses, which represent about 70% of the Financial segment revenue. This strength was partially offset by softness in item processing, lending and Output Solutions, which continued to negatively impact our revenue growth rate in the quarter and year-to-date. 
Contract termination fees increased $8 million in the quarter to $12 million and have increased $9 million for the year to $14 million. The increase in termination fees in the quarter was due primarily to an item processing client acquired by another institution. We expect termination fees to return to more normalized levels as market activity accelerates over time. 
License fees, which represent only about 5% of consolidated revenue, declined by $5 million in the quarter and are down $11 million for the first six months of the year. We continue to expect choppiness in license revenue between quarters. However, we still expect buying patterns to be relatively stable on a year-over-year basis. 
Adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter increased 11% to $1 compared with the prior year. Year-to-date adjusted earnings per share was up 8% to $1.95 versus $1.80 last year. Adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 29.6%, an increase of 70 basis points over the second quarter of 2009. The increase in margin was positively impacted by continuing operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses, cost efficiencies and termination fees. These positive factors were offset by continued increased investments and lower license revenue. 
Adjusted operating margin through June 30 was 29.2%, an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year's level and 50 basis points higher than the margin for all of 2009. 
Now I will move on to the segment results. Payments segment adjusted revenue was $487 million in the quarter and $973 million year-to-date, net of postage reimbursements in Output Solutions. 
As shown on Slide 5, adjusted internal revenue growth in the Payments segment was 3% in the quarter and 1% year-to-date. Payments revenue growth in the quarter was driven primarily by electronic banking, card services and Investment Services, partially offset by a slight decrease in Output Solutions. These results include the negative impact of a large client bringing ATM management in-house at the beginning of 2010, which negatively impacts segment revenue growth by about one percentage point each quarter and for the full year. 
Flow of income in the quarter continued to be virtually nonexistent as interest rates remained at historically low levels. Bill payment transaction volume increased 9% in the quarter and was up 3% sequentially. As in the first quarter, this data excludes the volume from a large bank remittance-only client that was acquired in 2008 and migrated off our platform in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
During the second quarter, the majority of our bill payment clients experienced mid-teens average transaction growth rates versus the prior year. And importantly, each of our 10 largest bill payment clients showed sequential bill payment improvement in the quarter. 
Card services revenue growth was driven primarily by a 22% increase in transaction volumes from our core debit products. We continue to benefit from both the consumer adoption of debit and adding new debit clients. Even in the face of regulatory change, we believe that debit transactions will remain a favored vehicle for consumers, which should continue to bolster transaction growth over the foreseeable future. 
Turning to Slide 6, operating income for the Payments segment was $151 million in the quarter and $299 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin of 31% in the quarter was flat compared to the prior year. Through June 30, adjusted operating margin was down 60 basis points to 30.8%. The strong margin fall-through in our recurring revenue businesses was offset by higher product development expenses, integration investments and weakness in Output Solutions. We also had incremental CheckFree integration costs in the segment, including severance related to a call center consolidation of approximately $2 million in the quarter and $5 million year-to-date. 
The Financial segment generated revenue of $487 million in the quarter and $959 million year-to-date. As shown on Slide 5, adjusted internal revenue growth in the segment was 1% in the quarter and down 1% year-to-date. Growth in the second quarter was driven by mid-single digit growth in our account processing businesses and an increase in termination fee revenue. This was partially offset by lower license revenue, continued reductions in check processing volumes and softness in our lending solutions businesses. 
Operating income for the Financial segment was $151 million in the second quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 30.9%, an increase of 100 basis points over the prior-year period. Operating income through June 30 was $287 million and adjusted operating margin was up 30 basis points to 29.9% compared with the prior year. The increase in operating margin for the quarter and year-to-date were driven by growth in account processing recurring revenue and the increase in termination fees. This performance was partially offset by a decline in license fees and incremental investments in areas such as Acumen, our new hosted PEP+ ACH solution, and innovative transformation solutions designed to help financial institutions deal with the impact of financial regulation. 
Adjusted operating loss in our Corporate and Other segment was $15 million in the quarter and $24 million year-to-date. The $6 million sequential increase in the second quarter loss over the $9 million loss in the first quarter was due primarily to the building gain recorded in the first quarter. 
As Jeff highlighted up front, the quality of our earnings is in part evidenced by our strong conversion of earnings to free cash flow. Free cash flow for the first half of the year has grown 14% over the prior-year, to $353 million. Free cash flow per share increased 16% to $2.30 compared with $1.99 in 2009. We used our strong free cash flow in the quarter to repurchase 2.8 million shares for $135 million. 
As of June 30, we have repurchased 4.2 million shares at a total cost of $202 million, and have about 3 million shares remaining in our outstanding repurchase authorization. We also repaid $76 million of debt in the quarter. We have repaid $202 million in the first half of the year and have $58 million of required debt repayment remaining in 2010. 
As of June 30, our total debt of approximately $3.4 billion results in a trailing 12-month debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.6x. We also completed a small acquisition towards the very end of the quarter, AdviceAmerica, which is a best in class provider of integrated advisor desktop solutions, which extends our Investment Services capabilities into front office applications. 
Net interest expense was $46 million in the quarter as compared to $55 million in the second quarter of 2009. The decline resulted from lower debt balances and the positive impact of interest rate hedges that rolled off at the end of 2009. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter and year-to-date is approximately 38%, which includes the negative impact of the R&D tax credit, which has not yet been authorized in 2010. Now I will turn the call back over to Jeff."

Year-to-date quota attainment is 92% as compared to 90% through the first half of 2009. As noted in our last call, we increased the 2010 sales quota over the level of 2009. Although year-to-date quota attainment is down a bit to target, our actual sales results through June 30 are up 8% versus the prior year. 
New client wins and sales to existing clients were solid across most segments. Sales cycles remain longer than normal, as financial institutions monitor economic conditions and begin to sort out the impacts of financial reform. Our sales pipeline, in terms of both size and quality, remains strong. We are optimistic that we will attain our full-year sales goal. 
Integrated sales were $30 million in the second quarter and $53 million through the first half of the year. Year-to-date integrated sales are 13% ahead of last year's level, and we remain on track to meet our target of $105 million for the full year. The leading areas of integrated sales continue to be in the areas of Payments, efficiency-based products and channel solutions. 
We've signed over 350 new bill payment and debit clients in the first six months of 2010 alone, and the percentage of competitive takeaways is increasing. The breadth and depth of our Account Processing business continues to serve as an important distribution opportunity for our industry-leading payment solutions. 
Our operational effectiveness initiatives generated $15 million of cost saves in the second quarter and $34 million in the first half of the year, roughly 85% of our 2010 target. Our plan called for the majority of our cost saves to occur in the first half of the year and we remain on-track to achieve our operational effectiveness target for 2010. 
While we are pleased that we should achieve our $250 million cost savings result a full one year ahead of schedule, we're not stopping there. We see a number of interesting opportunities to be more efficient and effective within our business model, which we will discuss in more detail at Investor Day. 
Before we take questions, let me update you on our view of the environment and guidance for the full year. As we expected, the number of regulatory actions continues to rise. There have been 114 actions through July 23, 43 more than in the prior year and in line with our forecast. We continue to expect the number of regulatory actions to peak in 2010, and absent a material step-down in the economy, begin to tail off in 2011. 
Overall, as was the case last year, we still expect the negative impact of regulatory actions to be less onerous than the approximately 3% per year historical decline of banks, thrifts and credit unions due to market consolidation. We're seeing a slight pickup in the level of voluntary or non-regulatory assisted, M&A activity, which we view as a positive sign for the banking industry. We're encouraged by the client conversations and technology spending patterns that we have observed throughout the first half of the year. 
Financial institutions are increasingly focused on technology solutions that can help them win and retain customers, generate more revenue and enhance their operating efficiency. Although we expect that to generally continue, we do not expect a full return to normalized IT spending until the economy is on a firmer footing and the ramifications of the broad financial industry legislation are better understood. 
Regulatory change is front and center as the industry grapples with the complexities of what has passed and what's still to come. New legislation, such as the Dodd-Frank Bill, which includes the Durbin Amendment, will require the drafting of hundreds of new regulations to support the bill over the course of the next 12 months. It's simply too early and the legislation too complex to determine how, where and when various industry participants will be impacted. 
In addition, we fully expect innovation to prevail and that new opportunities will emerge that are not in play today. That said, our initial and quite preliminary view is that the risks and opportunities of the new legislation on Fiserv are generally balanced. We intend to have a seat at the table working with our broad range of clients to design solutions that will allow Fiserv to capitalize on the opportunities that will emerge in this new world. 
As I mentioned earlier, our 2010 guidance remains unchanged. We continue to expect 2010 adjusted internal revenue growth to be in a range of 1% to 3%, including stronger growth in our Payments segment. We still expect 2010 adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% to 11% and full-year free cash flow to grow 5% to 8% to over $700 million. We anticipate the company-adjusted operating margin will expand by at least 50 basis points for the year. 
And finally on guidance, we believe that given the environment, any perceived overperformance in the quarter should be viewed as de-risking our full year outlook. As I mentioned, we're pleased with our results for the quarter and are on track for the full year. The strength of our business model and the quality of our nearly 20,000 associates have coalesced to deliver meaningful value to our clients and to generate strong financial performance in one of the most difficult environments ever seen. We are winning in the markets where it matters most, account processing, payments and channel solutions, and we are well positioned to lead as digital transformation reshapes the financial industry. 
Lastly, let me remind you that we are holding our annual Investor Day on October 5 in New York City. If you're interested in receiving details on the conference, please contact our Investor Relations department. 
With that, let's open the line for questions."

And again, most of those are competitive takeaways so we feel great about that. On the account processing side, we have actually won more -- we've had more wins for the first six months of the year this year than we did last year. So we feel like we're making great progress. We don't win them all, but we win more than our fair share. And then secondly, I would say that along the lines of account processing, we actually are seeing a few more people making decisions to change, and that's a good thing from our perspective, as well as -- I suspect others could jump onto that bandwagon. But that's good news. And then lastly, as the trend outsourcing continues and given our very large presence as an outsourcer, we think that's very good news.

And based on, again, the conversations that we're having with market participants, we believe that the issue is not around capital. It's about the regulatory structure allowing people to set up, whether it's de novos or other kind of institutions to acquire. And I believe that we probably won't see much of this year on that front, but certainly, as the regulators get the larger mass of institutions redirected that need to be redirected and they can open themselves up to focus on the approval process, we'll see that. And if you look back in history, you can see that after any significant wave of closings you see a big boost in de novo, and we fully expect that will happen again."

So it's not a big factor from a growth standpoint, but clearly, we anticipate that the second half will get better and they typically have a fairly strong Q4 as far as just from a business model standpoint.

So clearly, the margins in that business are lower overall because it requires more labor, and that's really what you're seeing as I highlight earlier in my commentary to John. You can kind of see the revenue increasing and kind of the margins in that cost to processing and services because the lower margin is turning into over higher-margin electronic form of transactions. And so overall, we clearly lose some on the revenue per transaction, but it's built in and we're building margins and scale and so overall from that standpoint, it's good.

There is not a one-size-fits-all answer. But it is on things like some service charges of accounts. I've heard things like charging for people to use a debit card, a variety of different piecemeal kind of going from a fixed price to an a la carte menu pricing.

With me today is Tom Hirsch, our Chief Financial Officer.
Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We will make forward-looking statements about, among other matters, adjusted internal revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating margin, free cash flow, sales pipelines and our strategic initiative, Fiserv 2.0. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release which can be found on our website at fiserv.com for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our earnings release for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call and for a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods.
Before I get to the results, thanks again to each of you who attended our annual investor conference a few weeks ago. We shared our views of how we intend to create value through a focused set of market strategies that should accelerate revenue growth and enhance our franchise over the next several years. We also shared our next wave of Fiserv 2.0 targets, including nearly $1 billion of integrated sales and an operational effectiveness objective of $250 million, both of which will be important parts of our focus over the next five years. And to provide finer clarity, we updated the long-term performance expectations for the company. We're excited about our plans and the impact we believe they will have on the market. We will talk more about this when we give our 2011 guidance in February. 
With that said, let me say we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter. The organization came together and delivered strong growth results in revenue, earnings and sales. Our year-to-date financial performance has been consistent with the expectations we shared at the beginning of the year. The growth trend we are on should create solid momentum going into 2011. As you will recall, we have three key enterprise priorities, which we believe should be used to keep score in 2010, as well as measure our strategic progress. Those priorities are: First, to deliver positive adjusted internal revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments; next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to improved enterprise win rates and a higher share of our strategic products; and third, to provide innovative solutions that increase differentiation and enhance results for our clients. 
Adjusted internal revenue growth has accelerated, as expected, over the course of the year from negative 1% in the first quarter to over 3% in the current quarter. This quarter's 3% internal growth is the highest since the second quarter of 2008. Importantly, we continue to build our recurring revenue across the company. Internal revenue growth for the year-to-date is 1%.  Adjusted earnings per share grew 13% to a record level of $1.04 in the quarter, and are up 10% for the year-to-date. The earnings growth is even more impressive considering the increased investments we are making to further enhance our long-term growth profile. Free cash flow through September 30 has increased 5% to $532 million. The timing of working capital changes, including increased tax payments, impacted free cash flow as we expected in the quarter compared to the prior year.
Adjusted operating margin continued to expand, increasing 50 basis points in the quarter and is up 40 basis points on a year-to-date basis. We are clearly on track to achieve our full year financial goals. Our strong sales performance, both in the quarter and year to date, is evidence of the progress we are making against our second priority, to center the Fiserv culture squarely on growth. Sales results in the quarter were just shy of the record level we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2009 and quota attainment is now over 100% for the first nine months of the year. 
Last quarter, we announced that the Westpac Group, the second-largest bank in Australia, selected our solutions to transform its online banking presence. This quarter, we announced an expansion of our relationship with U.S. Bank, the fifth largest commercial bank in the U.S. Already a bill payment client, U.S. Bank chose Corillian Online to enable the delivery of integrated banking, bill payment and personal financial management tools to retail banking customers through the online channel. This is another proof point supporting what we believe is the early stage of a global renewal of the online banking channel. Our industry-leading solutions position us well to benefit from this trend.
The third priority is to provide meaningful innovation that differentiates our solutions and enhances results for our clients. We have a number of innovation-based solutions now in market which are building momentum. Acumen, our next generation account processing platform for large credit unions, signed another two clients in the quarter, including Patelco Credit Union, a $3.5 billion institution with 280,000 members. Importantly, these account processing relationships often include significant other services, including our payments-related solutions. Our newest payment innovation, ZashPay, continues to gain acceptance. Financial institutions can see how the ease and convenience of this P2P solution could have a material impact on how consumers move money and drive their fee revenue at the same time. 272 financial institutions signed up for ZashPay in the third quarter, more than doubling sequentially. As of September 30, more than 400 institutions have committed to ZashPay and that number is growing almost daily. With thousands of potential financial institution clients such as Navy Federal Credit Union, which signed on to ZashPay and has 3.5 million members, and tens of millions of consumers using our online banking or bill payment technology, we believe Fiserv is extremely well positioned to be the leader in this emerging market. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'm proud to say that for the sixth time in seven years, Fiserv was again ranked number 1 on the FinTech 100, an annual listing of the top global providers of financial technology, published by American Banker, Bank Technology News and IDC Financial Insights. A commitment to clients by our high quality associates has enabled us to be the consistent industry leader. 
Now, let me hand the discussion over to Tom to provide more detail on the financial results."
128209,114113639,81959,"Fiserv, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone.

Revenue growth accelerated in the quarter as adjusted revenue increased 3% to $978 million. Virtually all of the growth was internal, with only $1 million of acquired revenue in the quarter and year-to-date from a single small acquisition. Adjusted internal revenue growth through September 30 was 1%. Our Payments segment grew 5% over the prior year, the strongest quarterly internal growth in the last 10 quarters. The Financial segment also generated solid revenue growth, increasing 2% despite a continuing secular decline in our Item Processing business. License fees were up modestly, increasing $4 million in the year-over-year quarter. The FA remained down $7 million for the first nine months of 2010 compared with 2009. Contract termination fees were about $4 million in the quarter, down from $12 million in the second quarter and still at historically low levels. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter increased 13% to $1.04. Year-to-date results are up 10% to $2.99 per share, compared with $2.72 in 2009. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 29.4%, an increase of 50 basis points over the third quarter of 2009. Year-to-date adjusted operating margin was up 40 basis points to 29.3%, which is 60 basis points higher than the margin for the full year 2009.
Free cash flow for the first nine months of the year has increased 5% to $532 million. As we anticipated, our third quarter free cash flow was negatively impacted by an increase in accounts receivable as a result of stronger revenue growth and significantly higher estimated tax payments. Free cash flow per share increased 7% to $3.49 year to date. Our strong free cash flow continues to be on track and consistent with our expectations.
Now I will turn to the segment results. Payments segment adjusted revenue was $501 million in the quarter and $1.5 billion year to date, net of postage reimbursements in our Output Solutions business. Adjusted internal revenue growth in the Payments segment was 5% in the quarter and 3% year to date. Each major business in the Payments segment generated positive revenue growth in the quarter. Internal revenue growth has progressed, from flat in the first quarter to 5% growth in the current quarter. Flow income continues to be at historically low levels. Bill payment transaction volume increased 8% in both the quarter and year to date. As we have previously indicated, this data excludes the volume from a large, remittance-only client that was acquired in 2008 and migrated off our platform in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
During 2010, we have continued to add an average of 125 new bill payment clients each quarter, which have an attractive favorable impact on transactions, revenue growth and operating margin. Debit transaction volume increased 21% in the third quarter and is up 22% year to date. Our Debit business continues to benefit from a combination of a secular shift towards debit and a steady pace of our new debit clients wins, which have averaged over 50 wins per quarter in 2010. We believe that provisions in the Durbin Amendment that excludes smaller debit card issuers from limits on interchange fees and that require multiple debit networks on each card, have the potential to further enhance our debit business. We will all know more as the regulations are finalized. 
Operating income for the Payments segment was $159 million in the quarter and $458 million year to date. Adjusted operating margin of 31.7% in the quarter was flat compared with the prior year. We have experienced solid, sequential margin improvement this year as revenue growth has accelerated in this segment. For the year to date, segment adjusted operating margin was 31.1%, a decrease of 40 basis points compared to 2009, due primarily to increased investments in multiple areas such as mobile and ZashPay, along with incremental CheckFree integration costs associated with the call center consolidation that have been expensed in this segment.
The Financial segment generated revenue of $486 million in the quarter and $1.4 billion year to date. Adjusted internal revenue growth in the segment was 2% in the quarter and is now flat year to date. Revenue growth in the quarter improved five percentage points over the first quarter's level as we continue to build momentum in this segment. Revenue growth was driven by mid-single digit growth in our Account Processing businesses, which was partially offset by the continued weakness in Check Processing volumes and softness in our Lending businesses. Operating income for the Financial segment was $143 million in the quarter. Operating margin in the quarter was 29.5%, a slight decrease of 10 basis points over the prior-year period. Operating income through September 30 was $430 million and operating margin was up 20 basis points to 29.8% compared with the prior year, due primarily to business model leverage and cost management. Adjusted operating loss in our Corporate and Other segment was $14 million in the quarter versus $19 million in the prior year and $15 million in the second quarter. The $5 million decrease in the year-over-year quarter and the $1 million decrease on a sequential basis were primarily due to lower corporate expenses.
We completed the $750 million debt refinancing in September that extended our debt maturities at historically low rates. The average term of the new debt is eight years and the weighted average interest rate is approximately 4%. We used the proceeds to pay down $480 million of near-term maturities at our term loan facility and also to fund a tender for the purchase of $250 million of our outstanding 6% senior notes due in November 2012. Because the tender did not close until October, the end of the quarter balance sheet includes an offsetting increase of $250 million in cash and current maturities of long-term debt. We also replaced our revolving credit facility which was set to expire in early 2011 with a new four-year, $1 billion credit facility priced at LIBOR plus 145 basis points. Our next mandatory debt repayment is in November of 2012.
Net interest expense was $49 million in the quarter which increased $3 million sequentially. The combination of duplicate interest costs on the refinance and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the term loan prepayment had an approximate $0.01 negative impact on adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was slightly lower than the prior year, due primarily to a favorable tax settlement, which positively impacted adjusted EPS in the quarter by approximately $0.02 per share. In addition, our year-to-date adjusted EPS has been negatively impacted compared with 2009 by approximately $0.02 per share as a result of the research and development credit not yet being renewed in 2010. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter should approximate 38%.
We repurchased 1 million shares of stock in the quarter for $52 million. As of September 30, we had repurchased a total of 5.2 million shares at a cost of $254 million and have about 1.9 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authorization. Lastly, subsequent to quarter end, we received a $90 million payment, which is a combination cash dividend and early loan repayment from our 49% equity investment in Stone River, our insurance joint venture. This payment will not be included in our calculation of free cash flow for the full year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

Third quarter sales were a very strong 128% of quota, which increased year-to-date attainment to 104%. This compares favorably to the 86% attainment achieved through the first nine months of 2009. As you saw in our earnings press release, sal",757,"Thanks, Tom. Third quarter sales were a very strong 128% of quota, which increased year-to-date attainment to 104%. This compares favorably to the 86% attainment achieved through the first nine months of 2009. As you saw in our earnings press release, sales wins were strong in areas where we are strategically focused, areas such as digital, payments and account processing. Even with strong sales, our pipeline remains healthy as new opportunities continue to be added. Sales cycles do remain elongated due to the combination of a slow economic recovery and a complex regulatory environment. Integrated sales were $35 million in the quarter and $88 million through September 30. In addition to payments, efficiency-based products, channel and risk solutions were solid in the quarter. 
Year to date, integrated sales are 17% ahead of last year and we are on track to meet our $105 million full year target. As of September 30, total program integrated sales were $321 million versus our originally stated goal of $360 million by 2012. Through the first nine months of 2010 alone, we have signed more than 370 new bill payment clients and over 160 new debit clients, an increase of 17% over last year. Importantly, even with these strong sales results, we still see significant opportunities to continue to expand.
As of September 30, we have also achieved $48 million of annual cost savings, which now exceeds our 2010 full year operational effectiveness target. Since the beginning of 2007, we have delivered over $260 million in annual cost savings, surpassing our $250 million target more than one year early.
Before I address current year guidance, let me update you quickly on the environment, which is generally consistent with our investor conference commentary. Through October 22, there have been 160 regulatory actions, 39 more than the prior year and in line with our estimate of 200 to 250 actions for the full year. The number of actions peaked at 57 in the third quarter of 2009 and since that point, have averaged about 50 per quarter. We anticipate that the number of regulatory actions in 2011 will be comparable with that of 2010. Since the beginning of 2008, our net client losses have been less than one half of 1% of our total Account Processing client base, and likely far less than we would've lost in the face of normalized M&A activity. 
While the market environment continues to be choppy, our financial results and sales successes do reflect gradual improvements in financial institutions spending patterns. We also continue to believe that the risks and opportunities of the new legislation on our business are generally balanced, recognizing that the true impact of the significant regulatory change is not fully understood. We are working on ways in which we can help our clients adapt their business models, turn information into action, gain efficiency, and very importantly, generate new sources of revenue. 
As noted in our earnings release, our 2010 guidance remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year adjusted internal revenue growth to be in the range of 1% to 3%, led by stronger growth in the Payments segment. Given we currently sit at 1% revenue growth for the first nine months of the year and the very strong revenue performance in last year's fourth quarter, we now believe our full year internal revenue growth rate will likely be at or below the midpoint of the guidance range. We feel very good about our high-quality revenue growth and the acceleration we've experienced throughout the year, which we believe should carry into 2011. We still expect 2010 adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% to 11% and now anticipate our full year results to be at or above the midpoint of our guidance range of $3.96 to $4.07 per share.  We continue to expect full year free cash flow growth to be 5% to 8% to over $700 million and that company adjusted operating margin will expand by at least 50 basis points for the full year. 
Although there is still uncertainty in the market, our momentum continues to build. We believe that the strong execution of the strategies we shared at Investor Day will further enhance our revenue growth and produce even better results for our clients, and you, our shareholders, over the next several years. We have a clear mission, targeted strategies and market-leading solutions. Those, combined with the dedication and commitment of our nearly 20,000 associates around the world, is truly a winning combination. With that, Carol, let's open the line for questions."

And those revenues come on -- typically the sales are done before the contract, the existing contract when the prospects expire. So they tend to come on anywhere over a period of six to 12 months. And then they sometimes ramp up after that. So we don't typically expect to see the full revenue on contracts like that for over a year. But the things that we were selling in the last half of last year are those clients that are going live, such as American Savings Bank, that we sold well over a year ago that went live in the middle of this year, just picking one up as an example."

It's going to come from those segments. We just made much more investments in there. And I think if you look at our margin progression, clearly, in the first quarter in the segments, our Payments segment was about 30.5%, third quarter it's 31.7%. That's up sequentially 120 basis points. Financial is 28.8%, third quarter 29.5%, up as a revenue growth in the investment levels kind of level off.

But we really have two factors that are coming together that we're benefiting from. And not necessarily in order, but number one is we've done a fantastic job of distributing bill payment through our system in general. So I think with over 370 new bill payment clients in this year alone, up 17% that and debit combined over the past year. So that's a cumulative effect, we've done a really nice job since we acquired CheckFree. And so we're getting a lot of boost from that because similar to what we see on the debit side, that group tends to be far less mature in their utilization of bill pay. So that's number one. Number two, is we are seeing some nice growth across a wide variety of our clients, but there still are some clients and potentially larger clients not really contributing to the growth in the way that we would like. So the underlying metrics that we can see in the bill pay business are strong, and we still are seeing very good growth in makers and we think that -- so we have opportunity in terms of makers as we move up to, hopefully, what will be a 40%, 50% level of ultimate adoption in this area, but also we think that e-bill represents a very important opportunity and we're not getting any real benefit from e-bill this year as you can see on our numbers. And you can expect us to put more focus on that moving forward. So those factors combined, help us to be pretty confident that we're going to continue good, solid bill payment  growth and largely because of the sophistication and differentiation of our solution and the size of our client base."

So we really are benefiting from a few things. First of all, I would say we're benefiting from the consolidation and I don't mean that in terms of luster, but bringing our sales force together and creating a single sales organization. That's helping us to be focused on where we need to be focused, and good successes across the enterprise client base. And we're also getting some really great success in delivering what I would call our broader, more differentiated solutions through our Account Processing network by bringing together our different solutions. So bundling together large buckets of value, whether it be Account Processing with Payments, risk, teller, analytics, those kinds of products that we have historically just not brought together as well as we probably should have. And that has shown up, as you know, in the increase in our win rates over the last couple of years. So it's really a combination of focus and delivering the right products to the market and then lastly, the focus that we've had on bill payment and debit and now ZashPay, those are highly valued and differentiated solutions that clients really want. And if you take something like ZashPay, which is going to be an interesting revenue opportunity for financial institutions at a time when they need it most, we think we're going to have a lot there.

I think as we look into '11, we have a couple of hundred million dollars of our fixed rate debt that will be moving from fixed to variable and that will roll off at the end of this year as we go into 2011."

We have organic margin expansion, really, from three different sources. So number one is the types of revenue that we build tends to be that of recurring nature, and so revenue, where the incremental margins tend to be higher than the average margins. We sometimes refer to that as network economics. So that's the first element. The second element is that we also tend to have a little bit of a lower cost structure because we are leveraging single account managers to be able to distribute many different products into a different client. So we think we have a sales and distribution advantage as well as a relationship advantage. And then third, we really have, as you know, we have put together a pretty good methodology for continuing to make ourselves more efficient. So today, I think we report on an operational effectiveness measure where we're now over $260 million over the last four years. So the combination of high-quality revenues, business mix, distribution advantage and cost effectiveness are the areas that we think will drive organic margin enhancement over the next several years. Now that, of course, is going to be offset by the amount of investment that we're willing to make into different products, solutions and other areas. But those are the big drivers of margin. I think from a guidance perspective, we've said we expect to be able to grow margins organically like 50 to 100 basis points over the next several years. So I would  say that's where we see things over the medium term."

And the banks will make determinations on their own as to how they believe that they should best price that. I will tell you that John will talk, I think, in far more detail next year on the pricing strategies around these products because as we deliver incremental feature function, we think that there's a very intriguing pricing strategy that we'll be able to put on to these products that will allow financial institutions to actually better optimize their revenue there. So we see ZashPay as to clearly being an area where institutions will be able to charge and collect fees. At least the research that we've done, there's very little consumer resistance to reasonable pricing on these products. As it relates to mobile and other ancillary products, I've not seen an institution charging for that at this point. So I can't really comment on that. I think it'll be difficult for institutions to do that. We have seen institutions who are charging for some of the discrete elements of a relationship. I think we all know that Bank of America announced they're charging for statements. We've seen -- I've seen some clients who have said they're going to charge for monthly fees for DDAs if there isn't a certain level of debit activity. And obviously, we think that's a reasonably good approach from our perspective. But I think there's a lot of creativity out there. We've got a group called revenue enhancement that works with these financial institutions, but it's early. But the best news is, John, that the majority of the banks, as I'm sure you know, ended up losing far less than they anticipated on the NSF/OD side and that's really almost put back into flux how will the revenue, how will the pricing look because it's not nearly as egregious as I thought and there's always this fear of disenfranchising the customers of the institution. So -- but I do think we'll see some of that. I don't think John, mobile is going to be one of them, but I think time will tell."

I mean, our technology is obviously the by far the market-leading outsourced Internet banking solution and we've been working on some pretty interesting integrated functionality that resides in Corillian Online that brings together all these payments vehicles in one place. That said, it is at least a fairly well known fact that the largest institutions in the U.S., a number of them, are focused on kind of reupgrading their online experience. There are a number of institutions around the world who are doing the same thing. We announced obviously Westpac, we've now announced U.S. Bank. So there is a lot of activity and largely because, if you think about when the online banking investments were made, they were made in the late 1999s into the early 2000s and it's just about time to remodel that experience given everything that's going on today.

If they're outside that institution, they have to register. And so that's the multiplier effect that I see. I would say that it's very early, and that's the most important thing I can stress at this point. We've had over 400 institutions sign up. But as we were talking earlier, there's an installation queue and we queue people up. And every week, we're adding a number of institutions and a number of users and we don't expect to really benefit from that volume itself for a while. But what we do expect it to do is train consumers of the financial institutions to be loyal to this product.

With me today is Tom Hirsch, our Chief Financial Officer.
Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We will make forward-looking statements about, among other matters, adjusted internal revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating margin, free cash flow, sales pipelines and our strategic initiative, Fiserv 2.0. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release which can be found on our website at fiserv.com for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our earnings release for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call and for a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods.
Before I get to the results, thanks again to each of you who attended our annual investor conference a few weeks ago. We shared our views of how we intend to create value through a focused set of market strategies that should accelerate revenue growth and enhance our franchise over the next several years. We also shared our next wave of Fiserv 2.0 targets, including nearly $1 billion of integrated sales and an operational effectiveness objective of $250 million, both of which will be important parts of our focus over the next five years. And to provide finer clarity, we updated the long-term performance expectations for the company. We're excited about our plans and the impact we believe they will have on the market. We will talk more about this when we give our 2011 guidance in February. 
With that said, let me say we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter. The organization came together and delivered strong growth results in revenue, earnings and sales. Our year-to-date financial performance has been consistent with the expectations we shared at the beginning of the year. The growth trend we are on should create solid momentum going into 2011. As you will recall, we have three key enterprise priorities, which we believe should be used to keep score in 2010, as well as measure our strategic progress. Those priorities are: First, to deliver positive adjusted internal revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments; next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to improved enterprise win rates and a higher share of our strategic products; and third, to provide innovative solutions that increase differentiation and enhance results for our clients. 
Adjusted internal revenue growth has accelerated, as expected, over the course of the year from negative 1% in the first quarter to over 3% in the current quarter. This quarter's 3% internal growth is the highest since the second quarter of 2008. Importantly, we continue to build our recurring revenue across the company. Internal revenue growth for the year-to-date is 1%.  Adjusted earnings per share grew 13% to a record level of $1.04 in the quarter, and are up 10% for the year-to-date. The earnings growth is even more impressive considering the increased investments we are making to further enhance our long-term growth profile. Free cash flow through September 30 has increased 5% to $532 million. The timing of working capital changes, including increased tax payments, impacted free cash flow as we expected in the quarter compared to the prior year.
Adjusted operating margin continued to expand, increasing 50 basis points in the quarter and is up 40 basis points on a year-to-date basis. We are clearly on track to achieve our full year financial goals. Our strong sales performance, both in the quarter and year to date, is evidence of the progress we are making against our second priority, to center the Fiserv culture squarely on growth. Sales results in the quarter were just shy of the record level we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2009 and quota attainment is now over 100% for the first nine months of the year. 
Last quarter, we announced that the Westpac Group, the second-largest bank in Australia, selected our solutions to transform its online banking presence. This quarter, we announced an expansion of our relationship with U.S. Bank, the fifth largest commercial bank in the U.S. Already a bill payment client, U.S. Bank chose Corillian Online to enable the delivery of integrated banking, bill payment and personal financial management tools to retail banking customers through the online channel. This is another proof point supporting what we believe is the early stage of a global renewal of the online banking channel. Our industry-leading solutions position us well to benefit from this trend.
The third priority is to provide meaningful innovation that differentiates our solutions and enhances results for our clients. We have a number of innovation-based solutions now in market which are building momentum. Acumen, our next generation account processing platform for large credit unions, signed another two clients in the quarter, including Patelco Credit Union, a $3.5 billion institution with 280,000 members. Importantly, these account processing relationships often include significant other services, including our payments-related solutions. Our newest payment innovation, ZashPay, continues to gain acceptance. Financial institutions can see how the ease and convenience of this P2P solution could have a material impact on how consumers move money and drive their fee revenue at the same time. 272 financial institutions signed up for ZashPay in the third quarter, more than doubling sequentially. As of September 30, more than 400 institutions have committed to ZashPay and that number is growing almost daily. With thousands of potential financial institution clients such as Navy Federal Credit Union, which signed on to ZashPay and has 3.5 million members, and tens of millions of consumers using our online banking or bill payment technology, we believe Fiserv is extremely well positioned to be the leader in this emerging market. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'm proud to say that for the sixth time in seven years, Fiserv was again ranked number 1 on the FinTech 100, an annual listing of the top global providers of financial technology, published by American Banker, Bank Technology News and IDC Financial Insights. A commitment to clients by our high quality associates has enabled us to be the consistent industry leader. 
Now, let me hand the discussion over to Tom to provide more detail on the financial results.

Revenue growth accelerated in the quarter as adjusted revenue increased 3% to $978 million. Virtually all of the growth was internal, with only $1 million of acquired revenue in the quarter and year-to-date from a single small acquisition. Adjusted internal revenue growth through September 30 was 1%. Our Payments segment grew 5% over the prior year, the strongest quarterly internal growth in the last 10 quarters. The Financial segment also generated solid revenue growth, increasing 2% despite a continuing secular decline in our Item Processing business. License fees were up modestly, increasing $4 million in the year-over-year quarter. The FA remained down $7 million for the first nine months of 2010 compared with 2009. Contract termination fees were about $4 million in the quarter, down from $12 million in the second quarter and still at historically low levels. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter increased 13% to $1.04. Year-to-date results are up 10% to $2.99 per share, compared with $2.72 in 2009. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 29.4%, an increase of 50 basis points over the third quarter of 2009. Year-to-date adjusted operating margin was up 40 basis points to 29.3%, which is 60 basis points higher than the margin for the full year 2009.
Free cash flow for the first nine months of the year has increased 5% to $532 million. As we anticipated, our third quarter free cash flow was negatively impacted by an increase in accounts receivable as a result of stronger revenue growth and significantly higher estimated tax payments. Free cash flow per share increased 7% to $3.49 year to date. Our strong free cash flow continues to be on track and consistent with our expectations.
Now I will turn to the segment results. Payments segment adjusted revenue was $501 million in the quarter and $1.5 billion year to date, net of postage reimbursements in our Output Solutions business. Adjusted internal revenue growth in the Payments segment was 5% in the quarter and 3% year to date. Each major business in the Payments segment generated positive revenue growth in the quarter. Internal revenue growth has progressed, from flat in the first quarter to 5% growth in the current quarter. Flow income continues to be at historically low levels. Bill payment transaction volume increased 8% in both the quarter and year to date. As we have previously indicated, this data excludes the volume from a large, remittance-only client that was acquired in 2008 and migrated off our platform in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
During 2010, we have continued to add an average of 125 new bill payment clients each quarter, which have an attractive favorable impact on transactions, revenue growth and operating margin. Debit transaction volume increased 21% in the third quarter and is up 22% year to date. Our Debit business continues to benefit from a combination of a secular shift towards debit and a steady pace of our new debit clients wins, which have averaged over 50 wins per quarter in 2010. We believe that provisions in the Durbin Amendment that excludes smaller debit card issuers from limits on interchange fees and that require multiple debit networks on each card, have the potential to further enhance our debit business. We will all know more as the regulations are finalized. 
Operating income for the Payments segment was $159 million in the quarter and $458 million year to date. Adjusted operating margin of 31.7% in the quarter was flat compared with the prior year. We have experienced solid, sequential margin improvement this year as revenue growth has accelerated in this segment. For the year to date, segment adjusted operating margin was 31.1%, a decrease of 40 basis points compared to 2009, due primarily to increased investments in multiple areas such as mobile and ZashPay, along with incremental CheckFree integration costs associated with the call center consolidation that have been expensed in this segment.
The Financial segment generated revenue of $486 million in the quarter and $1.4 billion year to date. Adjusted internal revenue growth in the segment was 2% in the quarter and is now flat year to date. Revenue growth in the quarter improved five percentage points over the first quarter's level as we continue to build momentum in this segment. Revenue growth was driven by mid-single digit growth in our Account Processing businesses, which was partially offset by the continued weakness in Check Processing volumes and softness in our Lending businesses. Operating income for the Financial segment was $143 million in the quarter. Operating margin in the quarter was 29.5%, a slight decrease of 10 basis points over the prior-year period. Operating income through September 30 was $430 million and operating margin was up 20 basis points to 29.8% compared with the prior year, due primarily to business model leverage and cost management. Adjusted operating loss in our Corporate and Other segment was $14 million in the quarter versus $19 million in the prior year and $15 million in the second quarter. The $5 million decrease in the year-over-year quarter and the $1 million decrease on a sequential basis were primarily due to lower corporate expenses.
We completed the $750 million debt refinancing in September that extended our debt maturities at historically low rates. The average term of the new debt is eight years and the weighted average interest rate is approximately 4%. We used the proceeds to pay down $480 million of near-term maturities at our term loan facility and also to fund a tender for the purchase of $250 million of our outstanding 6% senior notes due in November 2012. Because the tender did not close until October, the end of the quarter balance sheet includes an offsetting increase of $250 million in cash and current maturities of long-term debt. We also replaced our revolving credit facility which was set to expire in early 2011 with a new four-year, $1 billion credit facility priced at LIBOR plus 145 basis points. Our next mandatory debt repayment is in November of 2012.
Net interest expense was $49 million in the quarter which increased $3 million sequentially. The combination of duplicate interest costs on the refinance and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the term loan prepayment had an approximate $0.01 negative impact on adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was slightly lower than the prior year, due primarily to a favorable tax settlement, which positively impacted adjusted EPS in the quarter by approximately $0.02 per share. In addition, our year-to-date adjusted EPS has been negatively impacted compared with 2009 by approximately $0.02 per share as a result of the research and development credit not yet being renewed in 2010. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter should approximate 38%.
We repurchased 1 million shares of stock in the quarter for $52 million. As of September 30, we had repurchased a total of 5.2 million shares at a cost of $254 million and have about 1.9 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authorization. Lastly, subsequent to quarter end, we received a $90 million payment, which is a combination cash dividend and early loan repayment from our 49% equity investment in Stone River, our insurance joint venture. This payment will not be included in our calculation of free cash flow for the full year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.

This compares favorably to the 86% attainment achieved through the first nine months of 2009. As you saw in our earnings press release, sales wins were strong in areas where we are strategically focused, areas such as digital, payments and account processing. Even with strong sales, our pipeline remains healthy as new opportunities continue to be added. Sales cycles do remain elongated due to the combination of a slow economic recovery and a complex regulatory environment. Integrated sales were $35 million in the quarter and $88 million through September 30. In addition to payments, efficiency-based products, channel and risk solutions were solid in the quarter. 
Year to date, integrated sales are 17% ahead of last year and we are on track to meet our $105 million full year target. As of September 30, total program integrated sales were $321 million versus our originally stated goal of $360 million by 2012. Through the first nine months of 2010 alone, we have signed more than 370 new bill payment clients and over 160 new debit clients, an increase of 17% over last year. Importantly, even with these strong sales results, we still see significant opportunities to continue to expand.
As of September 30, we have also achieved $48 million of annual cost savings, which now exceeds our 2010 full year operational effectiveness target. Since the beginning of 2007, we have delivered over $260 million in annual cost savings, surpassing our $250 million target more than one year early.
Before I address current year guidance, let me update you quickly on the environment, which is generally consistent with our investor conference commentary. Through October 22, there have been 160 regulatory actions, 39 more than the prior year and in line with our estimate of 200 to 250 actions for the full year. The number of actions peaked at 57 in the third quarter of 2009 and since that point, have averaged about 50 per quarter. We anticipate that the number of regulatory actions in 2011 will be comparable with that of 2010. Since the beginning of 2008, our net client losses have been less than one half of 1% of our total Account Processing client base, and likely far less than we would've lost in the face of normalized M&A activity. 
While the market environment continues to be choppy, our financial results and sales successes do reflect gradual improvements in financial institutions spending patterns. We also continue to believe that the risks and opportunities of the new legislation on our business are generally balanced, recognizing that the true impact of the significant regulatory change is not fully understood. We are working on ways in which we can help our clients adapt their business models, turn information into action, gain efficiency, and very importantly, generate new sources of revenue. 
As noted in our earnings release, our 2010 guidance remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year adjusted internal revenue growth to be in the range of 1% to 3%, led by stronger growth in the Payments segment. Given we currently sit at 1% revenue growth for the first nine months of the year and the very strong revenue performance in last year's fourth quarter, we now believe our full year internal revenue growth rate will likely be at or below the midpoint of the guidance range. We feel very good about our high-quality revenue growth and the acceleration we've experienced throughout the year, which we believe should carry into 2011. We still expect 2010 adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% to 11% and now anticipate our full year results to be at or above the midpoint of our guidance range of $3.96 to $4.07 per share.  We continue to expect full year free cash flow growth to be 5% to 8% to over $700 million and that company adjusted operating margin will expand by at least 50 basis points for the full year. 
Although there is still uncertainty in the market, our momentum continues to build. We believe that the strong execution of the strategies we shared at Investor Day will further enhance our revenue growth and produce even better results for our clients, and you, our shareholders, over the next several years. We have a clear mission, targeted strategies and market-leading solutions. Those, combined with the dedication and commitment of our nearly 20,000 associates around the world, is truly a winning combination. With that, Carol, let's open the line for questions.

And those revenues come on -- typically the sales are done before the contract, the existing contract when the prospects expire. So they tend to come on anywhere over a period of six to 12 months. And then they sometimes ramp up after that. So we don't typically expect to see the full revenue on contracts like that for over a year. But the things that we were selling in the last half of last year are those clients that are going live, such as American Savings Bank, that we sold well over a year ago that went live in the middle of this year, just picking one up as an example.

So clearly, in most transactions, we don't anticipate a significant increase in working capital just given the nature of the transactions. Because these are domestic transactions, we typically get paid monthly on our Account Processing type revenue and it's very consistent. We did have higher income tax payments to China in the current quarter, which negatively impacted our cash flow in the quarter. But clearly, that's just timing.

But going forward, as we look into '11 and all 12, margin expansion is not going to come from that, clearly. It's more pretty clean from a run rate standpoint in the current year. It's going to come from those segments. We just made much more investments in there. And I think if you look at our margin progression, clearly, in the first quarter in the segments, our Payments segment was about 30.5%, third quarter it's 31.7%. That's up sequentially 120 basis points. Financial is 28.8%, third quarter 29.5%, up as a revenue growth in the investment levels kind of level off. So clearly, through our cost-saving initiatives that we announced on Investor Day. And really the quality of revenue of where we're focused on building that revenue, we're focused on building that quality in Payments where we have scale transaction volume and also on Account Processing. And we are going to continue to make sure that business mix is where it is and so I anticipate that over time, it's going to come out of those segments.

But we really have two factors that are coming together that we're benefiting from. And not necessarily in order, but number one is we've done a fantastic job of distributing bill payment through our system in general. So I think with over 370 new bill payment clients in this year alone, up 17% that and debit combined over the past year. So that's a cumulative effect, we've done a really nice job since we acquired CheckFree. And so we're getting a lot of boost from that because similar to what we see on the debit side, that group tends to be far less mature in their utilization of bill pay. So that's number one. Number two, is we are seeing some nice growth across a wide variety of our clients, but there still are some clients and potentially larger clients not really contributing to the growth in the way that we would like. So the underlying metrics that we can see in the bill pay business are strong, and we still are seeing very good growth in makers and we think that -- so we have opportunity in terms of makers as we move up to, hopefully, what will be a 40%, 50% level of ultimate adoption in this area, but also we think that e-bill represents a very important opportunity and we're not getting any real benefit from e-bill this year as you can see on our numbers. And you can expect us to put more focus on that moving forward. So those factors combined, help us to be pretty confident that we're going to continue good, solid bill payment  growth and largely because of the sophistication and differentiation of our solution and the size of our client base.

But for the extraordinary December we had, it's been a stellar quarter and it's been quite a while since we've been above 100% in the third quarter that we haven't had to rely solely on the fourth quarter to take us up above that level. So we really are benefiting from a few things. First of all, I would say we're benefiting from the consolidation and I don't mean that in terms of luster, but bringing our sales force together and creating a single sales organization. That's helping us to be focused on where we need to be focused, and good successes across the enterprise client base. And we're also getting some really great success in delivering what I would call our broader, more differentiated solutions through our Account Processing network by bringing together our different solutions. So bundling together large buckets of value, whether it be Account Processing with Payments, risk, teller, analytics, those kinds of products that we have historically just not brought together as well as we probably should have. And that has shown up, as you know, in the increase in our win rates over the last couple of years. So it's really a combination of focus and delivering the right products to the market and then lastly, the focus that we've had on bill payment and debit and now ZashPay, those are highly valued and differentiated solutions that clients really want. And if you take something like ZashPay, which is going to be an interesting revenue opportunity for financial institutions at a time when they need it most, we think we're going to have a lot there. And all of that brings some very good recurring revenue, high quality, nice network business, higher margin revenue that really is a nice repayment for any investments that we've made.

We have organic margin expansion, really, from three different sources. So number one is the types of revenue that we build tends to be that of recurring nature, and so revenue, where the incremental margins tend to be higher than the average margins. We sometimes refer to that as network economics. So that's the first element. The second element is that we also tend to have a little bit of a lower cost structure because we are leveraging single account managers to be able to distribute many different products into a different client. So we think we have a sales and distribution advantage as well as a relationship advantage. And then third, we really have, as you know, we have put together a pretty good methodology for continuing to make ourselves more efficient. So today, I think we report on an operational effectiveness measure where we're now over $260 million over the last four years. So the combination of high-quality revenues, business mix, distribution advantage and cost effectiveness are the areas that we think will drive organic margin enhancement over the next several years. Now that, of course, is going to be offset by the amount of investment that we're willing to make into different products, solutions and other areas. But those are the big drivers of margin. I think from a guidance perspective, we've said we expect to be able to grow margins organically like 50 to 100 basis points over the next several years. So I would  say that's where we see things over the medium term.

And the banks will make determinations on their own as to how they believe that they should best price that. I will tell you that John will talk, I think, in far more detail next year on the pricing strategies around these products because as we deliver incremental feature function, we think that there's a very intriguing pricing strategy that we'll be able to put on to these products that will allow financial institutions to actually better optimize their revenue there. So we see ZashPay as to clearly being an area where institutions will be able to charge and collect fees. At least the research that we've done, there's very little consumer resistance to reasonable pricing on these products. As it relates to mobile and other ancillary products, I've not seen an institution charging for that at this point. So I can't really comment on that. I think it'll be difficult for institutions to do that. We have seen institutions who are charging for some of the discrete elements of a relationship. I think we all know that Bank of America announced they're charging for statements. We've seen -- I've seen some clients who have said they're going to charge for monthly fees for DDAs if there isn't a certain level of debit activity. And obviously, we think that's a reasonably good approach from our perspective. But I think there's a lot of creativity out there. We've got a group called revenue enhancement that works with these financial institutions, but it's early. But the best news is, John, that the majority of the banks, as I'm sure you know, ended up losing far less than they anticipated on the NSF/OD side and that's really almost put back into flux how will the revenue, how will the pricing look because it's not nearly as egregious as I thought and there's always this fear of disenfranchising the customers of the institution. So -- but I do think we'll see some of that. I don't think John, mobile is going to be one of them, but I think time will tell.

I mean, our technology is obviously the by far the market-leading outsourced Internet banking solution and we've been working on some pretty interesting integrated functionality that resides in Corillian Online that brings together all these payments vehicles in one place. That said, it is at least a fairly well known fact that the largest institutions in the U.S., a number of them, are focused on kind of reupgrading their online experience. There are a number of institutions around the world who are doing the same thing. We announced obviously Westpac, we've now announced U.S. Bank. So there is a lot of activity and largely because, if you think about when the online banking investments were made, they were made in the late 1999s into the early 2000s and it's just about time to remodel that experience given everything that's going on today. And the efficiency gains that will be driven by moving customers there as opposed to some of the more expensive ways of interacting with clients or the customers of the financial institution.

If they're outside that institution, they have to register. And so that's the multiplier effect that I see. I would say that it's very early, and that's the most important thing I can stress at this point. We've had over 400 institutions sign up. But as we were talking earlier, there's an installation queue and we queue people up. And every week, we're adding a number of institutions and a number of users and we don't expect to really benefit from that volume itself for a while. But what we do expect it to do is train consumers of the financial institutions to be loyal to this product. That's a very important part of our strategy because it's yet another way of capturing the universal money movement opportunities that are out there. And so we'll talk about that a fair amount next year when we give guidance. It's an important part of our strategy.

I just wonder what kind of boost that could be over the next couple of years to your revenue growth?

With me today is Tom Hirsch, our Chief Financial Officer.
Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We will make forward-looking statements about, among other matters, adjusted internal revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating margin, free cash flow, sales pipeline and our strategic initiative, Fiserv 2.0. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release which can be found on our website at fiserv.com for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our earnings release for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call and for our reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods.
Before I get to the results, thanks again to each of you who attended our annual investor conference a few weeks ago. We shared our views of how we intend to create value through a focused set of market strategies that should accelerate revenue growth and enhance our franchise over the next several years. We also shared our next wave of Fiserv 2.0 targets, including nearly $1 billion of integrated sales and an operational effectiveness objective of $250 million, both of which will be important parts of our focus over the next five years. And to provide finer clarity, we updated the long-term performance expectations for the company. We're excited about our plans and the impact we believe they will have on the market. We will talk more about this when we give our 2011 guidance in February. 
With that said, let me say we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter. The organization came together and delivered strong growth results in revenue, earnings and sales. Our year-to-date financial performance has been consistent with the expectations we shared at the beginning of the year. The growth trend we are on should create solid momentum going into 2011. As you will recall, we have three key enterprise priorities, which we believe should be used to keep score in 2010, as well as measure our strategic progress. Those priorities are: First, to deliver positive adjusted internal revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments; next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to improved enterprise win rates and a higher share of our strategic products; and third, to provide innovative solutions that increase differentiation and enhance results for our clients. 
Adjusted internal revenue growth has accelerated, as expected, over the course of the year from negative 1% in the first quarter to over 3% in the current quarter. This quarter's 3% internal growth is the highest since the second quarter of 2008. Importantly, we continue to build our recurring revenue across the company. Internal revenue growth for the year-to-date is 1%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 13% to a record level of $1.04 in the quarter, and are up 10% for the year-to-date. The earnings growth is even more impressive considering the increased investments we are making to further enhance our long-term growth profile. Free cash flow through September 30 has increased 5% to $532 million. The timing of working capital changes, including increased tax payments, impacted free cash flow as we expected in the quarter compared to the prior year.
Adjusted operating margin continued to expand, increasing 50 basis points in the quarter and is up 40 basis points on a year-to-date basis. We are clearly on track to achieve our full year financial goals. Our strong sales performance, both in the quarter and year-to-date, is evidence of the progress we are making against our second priority, to center the Fiserv culture squarely on growth. Sales results in the quarter were just shy of the record level we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2009 and quota attainment is now over 100% for the first nine months of the year. 
Last quarter, we announced that the Westpac Group, the second-largest bank in Australia, selected our solutions to transform its online banking presence. This quarter, we announced an expansion of our relationship with U.S. Bank, the fifth-largest commercial bank in the U.S. Already a bill payment client, U.S. Bank chose Corillian Online to enable the delivery of integrated banking, bill payment and personal financial management tools to retail banking customers through the online channel. This is another proof point supporting what we believe is the early stage of a global renewal of the online banking channel. Our industry-leading solutions position us well to benefit from this trend.
The third priority is to provide meaningful innovation that differentiates our solutions and enhances results for our clients. We have a number of innovation-based solutions now in market which are building momentum. Acumen, our next generation account processing platform for large credit unions, signed another two clients in the quarter, including Patelco Credit Union, a $3.5 billion institution with 280,000 members. Importantly, these account processing relationships often include significant other services, including our payments-related solutions. Our newest payment innovation, ZashPay, continues to gain acceptance. Financial institutions can see how the ease and convenience of this P2P solution could have a material impact on how consumers move money and drive their fee revenue at the same time. 272 financial institutions signed up for ZashPay in the third quarter, more than doubling sequentially. As of September 30, more than 400 institutions have committed to ZashPay and that number is growing almost daily. With thousands of potential financial institution clients such as Navy Federal Credit Union, which signed on to ZashPay and has 3.5 million members, and tens of millions of consumers using our online banking or bill payment technology, we believe Fiserv is extremely well-positioned to be the leader in this emerging market. 
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'm proud to say that for the sixth time in seven years, Fiserv was again ranked number 1 on the FinTech 100, an annual listing of the top global providers of financial technology, published by American Banker, Bank Technology News and IDC Financial Insights. A commitment to clients by our high quality associates has enabled us to be the consistent industry leader. 
Now, let me hand the discussion over to Tom to provide more detail on the financial results."

Revenue growth accelerated in the quarter as adjusted revenue increased 3% to $978 million. Virtually all of the growth was internal, with only $1 million of acquired revenue in the quarter and year-to-date from a single small acquisition. Adjusted internal revenue growth through September 30 was 1%. Our Payments segment grew 5% over the prior year, the strongest quarterly internal growth in the last 10 quarters. The Financial segment also generated solid revenue growth, increasing 2% despite a continuing secular decline in our Item Processing business. License fees were up modestly, increasing $4 million in the year-over-year quarter. The FA remained down $7 million for the first nine months of 2010 compared with 2009. Contract termination fees were about $4 million in the quarter, down from $12 million in the second quarter and still at historically low levels. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter increased 13% to $1.04. Year-to-date results are up 10% to $2.99 per share, compared with $2.72 in 2009. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 29.4%, an increase of 50 basis points over the third quarter of 2009. Year-to-date adjusted operating margin was up 40 basis points to 29.3%, which is 60 basis points higher than the margin for the full year 2009.
Free cash flow for the first nine months of the year has increased 5% to $532 million. As we anticipated, our third quarter free cash flow was negatively impacted by an increase in accounts receivable as a result of stronger revenue growth and significantly higher estimated tax payments. Free cash flow per share increased 7% to $3.49 year-to-date. Our strong free cash flow continues to be on track and consistent with our expectations.
Now I will turn to the segment results. Payments segment adjusted revenue was $501 million in the quarter and $1.5 billion year-to-date, net of postage reimbursements in our Output Solutions business. Adjusted internal revenue growth in the Payments segment was 5% in the quarter and 3% year-to-date. Each major business in the Payments segment generated positive revenue growth in the quarter. Internal revenue growth has progressed, from flat in the first quarter to 5% growth in the current quarter. Flow income continues to be at historically low levels. Bill payment transaction volume increased 8% in both the quarter and year-to-date. As we have previously indicated, this data excludes the volume from a large, remittance-only client that was acquired in 2008 and migrated off our platform in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
During 2010, we have continued to add an average of 125 new bill payment clients each quarter, which have an attractive favorable impact on transactions, revenue growth and operating margin. Debit transaction volume increased 21% in the third quarter and is up 22% year to date. Our Debit business continues to benefit from a combination of a secular shift towards debit and a steady pace of our new debit client wins, which has averaged over 50 wins per quarter in 2010. We believe that provisions in the Durbin Amendment that excludes smaller debit card issuers from limits on interchange fees and that require multiple debit networks on each card, have the potential to further enhance our debit business. We will all know more as the regulations are finalized. 
Operating income for the Payments segment was $159 million in the quarter and $458 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin of 31.7% in the quarter was flat compared with the prior year. We have experienced solid, sequential margin improvement this year as revenue growth has accelerated in this segment. For the year-to-date, segment adjusted operating margin was 31.1%, a decrease of 40 basis points compared to 2009, due primarily to increased investments in multiple areas such as mobile and ZashPay, along with incremental CheckFree integration costs associated with the call center consolidation that have been expensed in this segment.
The Financial segment generated revenue of $486 million in the quarter and $1.4 billion year-to-date. Adjusted internal revenue growth in the segment was 2% in the quarter and is now flat year-to-date. Revenue growth in the quarter improved five percentage points over the first quarter's level as we continue to build momentum in this segment. Revenue growth was driven by mid-single digit growth in our Account Processing businesses, which was partially offset by the continued weakness in Check Processing volumes and softness in our Lending businesses. Operating income for the Financial segment was $143 million in the quarter. Operating margin in the quarter was 29.5%, a slight decrease of 10 basis points over the prior-year period. Operating income through September 30 was $430 million and operating margin was up 20 basis points to 29.8% compared with the prior year, due primarily to business model leverage and cost management. Adjusted operating loss in our Corporate and Other segment was $14 million in the quarter versus $19 million in the prior year and $15 million in the second quarter. The $5 million decrease in the year-over-year quarter and the $1 million decrease on a sequential basis were primarily due to lower corporate expenses.
We completed a $750 million debt refinancing in September that extended our debt maturities at historically low rates. The average term of the new debt is eight years, and the weighted average interest rate is approximately 4%. We used the proceeds to pay down $480 million of near-term maturities at our term loan facility and also to fund a tender for the purchase of $250 million of our outstanding 6% senior notes due in November 2012. Because the tender did not close until October, the end of the quarter balance sheet includes an offsetting increase of $250 million in cash and current maturities of long-term debt. We also replaced our revolving credit facility, which was set to expire in early 2011 with a new four-year, $1 billion credit facility priced at LIBOR plus 145 basis points. Our next mandatory debt repayment is in November of 2012.
Net interest expense was $49 million in the quarter which increased $3 million sequentially. The combination of duplicate interest costs on the refinance and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the term loan prepayment had an approximate $0.01 negative impact on adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was slightly lower than the prior year, due primarily to a favorable tax settlement, which positively impacted adjusted EPS in the quarter by approximately $0.02 per share. In addition, our year-to-date adjusted EPS has been negatively impacted compared with 2009 by approximately $0.02 per share as a result of the research and development credit not yet being renewed in 2010. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter should approximate 38%.
We repurchased 1 million shares of stock in the quarter for $52 million. As of September 30, we had repurchased a total of 5.2 million shares at a cost of $254 million and have about 1.9 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authorization. Lastly, subsequent to quarter end, we received a $90 million payment, which is a combination cash dividend and early loan repayment from our 49% equity investment in Stone River, our insurance joint venture. This payment will not be included in our calculation of free cash flow for the full year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff."

Third quarter sales were a very strong 128% of quota, which increased year-to-date attainment to 104%. This compares favorably to the 86% attainment achieved through the first nine months of 2009. As you saw in our earnings press release, sal",750,"Thanks, Tom. Third quarter sales were a very strong 128% of quota, which increased year-to-date attainment to 104%. This compares favorably to the 86% attainment achieved through the first nine months of 2009. As you saw in our earnings press release, sales wins were strong in areas where we are strategically focused, areas such as digital, payments and account processing. Even with strong sales, our pipeline remains healthy as new opportunities continue to be added. Sales cycles do remain elongated due to the combination of a slow economic recovery and a complex regulatory environment. Integrated sales were $35 million in the quarter and $88 million through September 30. In addition to payments, efficiency-based products, channel and risk solutions were solid in the quarter. 
Year-to-date, integrated sales are 17% ahead of last year and we are on track to meet our $105 million full year target. As of September 30, total program integrated sales were $321 million versus our originally stated goal of $360 million by 2012. Through the first nine months of 2010 alone, we have signed more than 370 new bill payment clients and over 160 new debit clients, an increase of 17% over last year. Importantly, even with these strong sales results, we still see significant opportunities to continue to expand.
As of September 30, we have also achieved $48 million in annual cost savings, which now exceeds our 2010 full-year operational effectiveness target. Since the beginning of 2007, we have delivered over $260 million in annual cost savings, surpassing our $250 million target more than one year early.
Before I address current year guidance, let me update you quickly on the environment, which is generally consistent with our investor conference commentary. Through October 22, there have been 160 regulatory actions, 39 more than the prior year and in line with our estimate of 200 to 250 actions for the full year. The number of actions peaked at 57 in the third quarter of 2009 and since that point, have averaged about 50 per quarter. We anticipate that the number of regulatory actions in 2011 will be comparable with that of 2010. Since the beginning of 2008, our net client losses have been less than one half of 1% of our total Account Processing client base, and likely far less than we would've lost in the face of normalized M&A activity. 
While the market environment continues to be choppy, our financial results and sales successes do reflect gradual improvements in financial institution spending patterns. We also continue to believe that the risks and opportunities of the new legislation on our business are generally balanced, recognizing that the true impact of the significant regulatory change is not fully understood. We are working on ways in which we can help our clients adapt their business models, turn information into action, gain efficiency, and very importantly, generate new sources of revenue. 
As noted in our earnings release, our 2010 guidance remains unchanged. We continue to expect full-year adjusted internal revenue growth to be in a range of 1% to 3%, led by stronger growth in the Payments segment. Given we currently sit at 1% revenue growth for the first nine months of the year and the very strong revenue performance in last year's fourth quarter, we now believe our full-year internal revenue growth rate will likely be at or below the midpoint of the guidance range. We feel very good about our high-quality revenue growth and the acceleration we've experienced throughout the year, which we believe should carry into 2011. We still expect 2010 adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% to 11% and now anticipate our full-year results to be at or above the midpoint of our guidance range of $3.96 to $4.07 per share.  We continue to expect full-year free cash flow growth to be 5% to 8% to over $700 million and that company adjusted operating margin will expand by at least 50 basis points for the full year. 
Although there is still uncertainty in the market, our momentum continues to build. We believe that the strong execution of the strategies we shared at Investor Day will further enhance our revenue growth and produce even better results for our clients, and you, our shareholders, over the next several years. We have a clear mission, targeted strategies and market-leading solutions. Those, combined with the dedication and commitment of our nearly 20,000 associates around the world, is truly a winning combination. With that, Carol, let's open the line for questions."

And those revenues come on -- typically the sales are done before the existing contract with the prospects expire. So they tend to come on anywhere over a period of six to 12 months. And then they sometimes ramp up after that. So we don't typically expect to see the full revenue on contracts like that for over a year. But the things that we were selling in the last half of last year are those clients that are going live, such as American Savings Bank, that we sold well over a year ago that went live in the middle of this year, just picking one up as an example."

It's going to come from those segments. We just made much more investments in there. And I think if you look at our margin progression, clearly, in the first quarter in the segments, our Payments segment was about 30.5%, third quarter it's 31.7%. That's up sequentially 120 basis points. Financial is 28.8%, third quarter 29.5%, up as a revenue growth in the investment levels kind of level off.

But we really have two factors that are coming together that we're benefiting from. And not necessarily in order, but number one is we've done a fantastic job of distributing bill payment through our system in general. So I think we’re at over 370 new bill payment clients in this year alone, up 17%, that and debit combined over the past year. So that cumulative effect, we've done a really nice job since we acquired CheckFree. And so we're getting a lot of boost from that because similar to what we see on the debit side, that group tends to be far less mature in their utilization of bill pay. So that's number one. Number two, is we are seeing some nice growth across a wide variety of our clients, but there still are some clients and potentially larger clients not really contributing to the growth in the way that we would like. So the underlying metrics that we can see in the bill pay business are strong, and we still are seeing very good growth in makers and we think that -- so we have opportunity in terms of makers as we move up to, hopefully, what will be a 40%, 50% level of ultimate adoption in this area, but also we think that e-bill represents a very important opportunity, and we're not getting any real benefit from e-bill this year as you can see on our numbers. And you can expect us to put more focus on that moving forward. So those factors combined, have us be pretty confident that we're going to continue to see good, solid bill payment growth and largely because of the sophistication and differentiation of our solution and the size of our client base."

So we really are benefiting from a few things. First of all, I would say we're benefiting from the consolidation, and I don't mean that in terms of luster, but bringing our sales force together and creating a single sales organization. That's helping us to be focused on where we need to be focused, and good successes across the enterprise client base. And we're also getting some really great success in delivering what I would call our broader, more differentiated solutions through our Account Processing network by bringing together our different solutions. So bundling together large buckets of value, whether it be Account Processing with Payments, risk, teller, analytics, those kinds of products that we have historically just not brought together as well as we probably should have. And that has shown up, as you know, in the increase in our win rates over the last couple of years. So it's really a combination of focus and delivering the right products to the market and then lastly, the focus that we've had on bill payment and debit and now ZashPay, those are highly valued and differentiated solutions that clients really want. And if you take something like ZashPay, which is going to be an interesting revenue opportunity for financial institutions at a time when they need it most, we think we're going to have a lot there.

We have organic margin expansion, really, from three different sources. So number one is the types of revenue that we build tends to be that of recurring nature, and so revenue, where the incremental margins tend to be higher than the average margins. We sometimes refer to that as network economics. So that's the first element. The second element is that we also tend to have a little bit of a lower cost structure because we are leveraging single account managers to be able to distribute many different products into a different client. So we think we have a sales and distribution advantage as well as a relationship advantage. And then third, we really have, as you know, we have put together a pretty good methodology for continuing to make ourselves more efficient. So today, I think we report on a operational effectiveness measure where we're now over $260 million over the last four years. So the combination of high-quality revenues, business mix, distribution advantage and cost effectiveness are the areas that we think will drive organic margin enhancement over the next several years. Now that, of course, is going to be offset by the amount of investment that we're willing to make into different products, solutions and other areas. But those are the big drivers of margin. I think from a guidance perspective, we've said we expect to be able to grow margins organically like 50 to 100 basis points over the next several years. So I would say that's where we see things over the medium term."

And the banks will make determinations on their own as to how they believe that they should best price that. I will tell you that John will talk, I think, in far more detail next year on the pricing strategies around these products because as we deliver incremental feature function, we think that there's a very intriguing pricing strategy that we'll be able to put on to these products that will allow financial institutions to actually better optimize their revenue there. So we see ZashPay as to clearly being an area where institutions will be able to charge and collect fees. We see, at least the research that we've done, there's very little consumer resistance to reasonable pricing on these products. As it relates to mobile and other ancillary products, I've not seen an institution charging for that at this point. So I can't really comment on that. I think it'll be difficult for institutions to do that. We have seen institutions who are charging for some of the discrete elements of a relationship. I think we all know that Bank of America announced they're charging for statements. We've seen -- I've seen some clients who have said they're going to charge for monthly fees for DDAs if there isn't a certain level of debit activity. And obviously, we think that's a reasonably good approach from our perspective. But I think there's a lot of creativity out there. We've got a group called Revenue Enhancement that works with these financial institutions, but it's early. But the best news is, John, that the majority of the banks, as I'm sure you know, ended up losing far less than they anticipated on the NSF/OD side and that's really almost put back into flux how will the revenue, how will the pricing look because it's not nearly as egregious as they thought and there's always this fear of disenfranchising the customers of the institution. So -- but I do think we'll see some of that. I don't think, John, mobile is going to be one of them, but I think time will tell."

That said, it is at least a fairly well-known fact that the largest institutions in the U.S., a number of them, are focused on kind of reupgrading their online experience. There are a number of institutions around the world who are doing the same thing. We announced obviously Westpac, we've now announced U.S. Bank. So there is a lot of activity and largely because, if you think about when the online banking investments were made, they were made in the late 1999s into the early 2000s and it's just about time to remodel that experience given everything that's going on today.

If they're outside that institution, they have to register. And so that's the multiplier effect that I see. I would say that it's very early, and that's the most important thing I can stress at this point. We've had over 400 institutions sign up. But as we were talking earlier, there's an installation queue and we queue people up. And every week, we're adding a number of institutions and a number of users and we don't expect to really benefit from that volume itself for a while. But what we do expect to do is train consumers of the financial institutions to be loyal to this product.

Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Lit",1098," Good afternoon, and thanks everyone for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. With me today is Tom Hirsch, our Chief Financial Officer.
 Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We will make forward-looking statements about, among other matters, adjusted internal revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating margin, free cash flow, sales pipelines and our strategic initiative, Fiserv 2.0. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release which can be found on our website at fiserv.com for a discussion of these risk factors. You should also refer to our earnings release for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this conference call and for a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results, and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods.
 Before I get to the results, thanks again to each of you who attended our annual investor conference a few weeks ago. We shared our views of how we intend to create value through a focused set of market strategies that should accelerate revenue growth and enhance our franchise over the next several years. We also shared our next wave of Fiserv 2.0 targets, including nearly $1 billion of integrated sales and an operational effectiveness objective of $250 million, both of which will be important parts of our focus over the next five years. And to provide finer clarity, we updated the long-term performance expectations for the company. We're excited about our plans and the impact we believe they will have on the market. We will talk more about this when we give our 2011 guidance in February.
 With that said, let me say we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter. The organization came together and delivered strong growth results in revenue, earnings and sales. Our year-to-date financial performance has been consistent with the expectations we shared at the beginning of the year. The growth trend we are on should create solid momentum going into 2011. As you will recall, we have three key enterprise priorities, which we believe should be used to keep score in 2010, as well as measure our strategic progress. Those priorities are: First, to deliver positive adjusted internal revenue growth and meet our earnings commitments; next, to center the Fiserv culture on growth, leading to improved enterprise win rates and a higher share of our strategic products; and third, to provide innovative solutions that increase differentiation and enhance results for our clients.
 Adjusted internal revenue growth has accelerated, as expected, over the course of the year from negative 1% in the first quarter to over 3% in the current quarter. This quarter's 3% internal growth is the highest since the second quarter of 2008. Importantly, we continue to build our recurring revenue across the company. Internal revenue growth for the year-to-date is 1%.  Adjusted earnings per share grew 13% to a record level of $1.04 in the quarter, and are up 10% for the year-to-date. The earnings growth is even more impressive considering the increased investments we are making to further enhance our long-term growth profile. Free cash flow through September 30 has increased 5% to $532 million. The timing of working capital changes, including increased tax payments, impacted free cash flow as we expected in the quarter compared to the prior year.
 Adjusted operating margin continued to expand, increasing 50 basis points in the quarter and is up 40 basis points on a year-to-date basis. We are clearly on track to achieve our full year financial goals. Our strong sales performance, both in the quarter and year to date, is evidence of the progress we are making against our second priority, to center the Fiserv culture squarely on growth. Sales results in the quarter were just shy of the record level we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2009 and quota attainment is now over 100% for the first nine months of the year.
 Last quarter, we announced that the Westpac Group, the second-largest bank in Australia, selected our solutions to transform its online banking presence. This quarter, we announced an expansion of our relationship with U.S. Bank, the fifth largest commercial bank in the U.S. Already a bill payment client, U.S. Bank chose Corillian Online to enable the delivery of integrated banking, bill payment and personal financial management tools to retail banking customers through the online channel. This is another proof point supporting what we believe is the early stage of a global renewal of the online banking channel. Our industry-leading solutions position us well to benefit from this trend.
 The third priority is to provide meaningful innovation that differentiates our solutions and enhances results for our clients. We have a number of innovation-based solutions now in market which are building momentum. Acumen, our next generation account processing platform for large credit unions, signed another two clients in the quarter, including Patelco Credit Union, a $3.5 billion institution with 280,000 members. Importantly, these account processing relationships often include significant other services, including our payments-related solutions. Our newest payment innovation, ZashPay, continues to gain acceptance. Financial institutions can see how the ease and convenience of this P2P solution could have a material impact on how consumers move money and drive their fee revenue at the same time. 272 financial institutions signed up for ZashPay in the third quarter, more than doubling sequentially. As of September 30, more than 400 institutions have committed to ZashPay and that number is growing almost daily. With thousands of potential financial institution clients such as Navy Federal Credit Union, which signed on to ZashPay and has 3.5 million members, and tens of millions of consumers using our online banking or bill payment technology, we believe Fiserv is extremely well positioned to be the leader in this emerging market.
 Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'm proud to say that for the sixth time in seven years, Fiserv was again ranked number 1 on the FinTech 100, an annual listing of the top global providers of financial technology, published by American Banker, Bank Technology News and IDC Financial Insights. A commitment to clients by our high quality associates has enabled us to be the consistent industry leader.
 Now, let me hand the discussion over to Tom to provide more detail on the financial results.

Revenue growth accelerated in the quarter as adjusted revenue increased 3% to $978 million. Virtually all of the growth was internal, with only $1 million of acquired revenue in the quarter and year-to-date from a single small acquisition. Adjusted internal revenue growth through September 30 was 1%. Our Payments segment grew 5% over the prior year, the strongest quarterly internal growth in the last 10 quarters. The Financial segment also generated solid revenue growth, increasing 2% despite a continuing secular decline in our Item Processing business. License fees were up modestly, increasing $4 million in the year-over-year quarter. The FA remained down $7 million for the first nine months of 2010 compared with 2009. Contract termination fees were about $4 million in the quarter, down from $12 million in the second quarter and still at historically low levels. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter increased 13% to $1.04. Year-to-date results are up 10% to $2.99 per share, compared with $2.72 in 2009. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 29.4%, an increase of 50 basis points over the third quarter of 2009. Year-to-date adjusted operating margin was up 40 basis points to 29.3%, which is 60 basis points higher than the margin for the full year 2009.
 Free cash flow for the first nine months of the year has increased 5% to $532 million. As we anticipated, our third quarter free cash flow was negatively impacted by an increase in accounts receivable as a result of stronger revenue growth and significantly higher estimated tax payments. Free cash flow per share increased 7% to $3.49 year to date. Our strong free cash flow continues to be on track and consistent with our expectations.
 Now I will turn to the segment results. Payments segment adjusted revenue was $501 million in the quarter and $1.5 billion year to date, net of postage reimbursements in our Output Solutions business. Adjusted internal revenue growth in the Payments segment was 5% in the quarter and 3% year to date. Each major business in the Payments segment generated positive revenue growth in the quarter. Internal revenue growth has progressed, from flat in the first quarter to 5% growth in the current quarter. Flow income continues to be at historically low levels. Bill payment transaction volume increased 8% in both the quarter and year to date. As we have previously indicated, this data excludes the volume from a large, remittance-only client that was acquired in 2008 and migrated off our platform in the fourth quarter of 2009.
 During 2010, we have continued to add an average of 125 new bill payment clients each quarter, which have an attractive favorable impact on transactions, revenue growth and operating margin. Debit transaction volume increased 21% in the third quarter and is up 22% year to date. Our Debit business continues to benefit from a combination of a secular shift towards debit and a steady pace of our new debit clients wins, which have averaged over 50 wins per quarter in 2010. We believe that provisions in the Durbin Amendment that excludes smaller debit card issuers from limits on interchange fees and that require multiple debit networks on each card, have the potential to further enhance our debit business. We will all know more as the regulations are finalized.
 Operating income for the Payments segment was $159 million in the quarter and $458 million year to date. Adjusted operating margin of 31.7% in the quarter was flat compared with the prior year. We have experienced solid, sequential margin improvement this year as revenue growth has accelerated in this segment. For the year to date, segment adjusted operating margin was 31.1%, a decrease of 40 basis points compared to 2009, due primarily to increased investments in multiple areas such as mobile and ZashPay, along with incremental CheckFree integration costs associated with the call center consolidation that have been expensed in this segment.
 The Financial segment generated revenue of $486 million in the quarter and $1.4 billion year to date. Adjusted internal revenue growth in the segment was 2% in the quarter and is now flat year to date. Revenue growth in the quarter improved five percentage points over the first quarter's level as we continue to build momentum in this segment. Revenue growth was driven by mid-single digit growth in our Account Processing businesses, which was partially offset by the continued weakness in Check Processing volumes and softness in our Lending businesses. Operating income for the Financial segment was $143 million in the quarter. Operating margin in the quarter was 29.5%, a slight decrease of 10 basis points over the prior-year period. Operating income through September 30 was $430 million and operating margin was up 20 basis points to 29.8% compared with the prior year, due primarily to business model leverage and cost management. Adjusted operating loss in our Corporate and Other segment was $14 million in the quarter versus $19 million in the prior year and $15 million in the second quarter. The $5 million decrease in the year-over-year quarter and the $1 million decrease on a sequential basis were primarily due to lower corporate expenses.
 We completed the $750 million debt refinancing in September that extended our debt maturities at historically low rates. The average term of the new debt is eight years and the weighted average interest rate is approximately 4%. We used the proceeds to pay down $480 million of near-term maturities at our term loan facility and also to fund a tender for the purchase of $250 million of our outstanding 6% senior notes due in November 2012. Because the tender did not close until October, the end of the quarter balance sheet includes an offsetting increase of $250 million in cash and current maturities of long-term debt. We also replaced our revolving credit facility which was set to expire in early 2011 with a new four-year, $1 billion credit facility priced at LIBOR plus 145 basis points. Our next mandatory debt repayment is in November of 2012.
 Net interest expense was $49 million in the quarter which increased $3 million sequentially. The combination of duplicate interest costs on the refinance and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the term loan prepayment had an approximate $0.01 negative impact on adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was slightly lower than the prior year, due primarily to a favorable tax settlement, which positively impacted adjusted EPS in the quarter by approximately $0.02 per share. In addition, our year-to-date adjusted EPS has been negatively impacted compared with 2009 by approximately $0.02 per share as a result of the research and development credit not yet being renewed in 2010. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter should approximate 38%.
 We repurchased 1 million shares of stock in the quarter for $52 million. As of September 30, we had repurchased a total of 5.2 million shares at a cost of $254 million and have about 1.9 million shares remaining on our existing repurchase authorization. Lastly, subsequent to quarter end, we received a $90 million payment, which is a combination cash dividend and early loan repayment from our 49% equity investment in Stone River, our insurance joint venture. This payment will not be included in our calculation of free cash flow for the full year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.

128209,114113639,86665,"Fiserv, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Fiserv, Inc.","Executives"," Thanks, Tom. Third quarter sales were a very strong 128% of quota, which increased year-to-date attainment to 104%. This compares favorably to the 86% attainment achieved through the first nine months of 2009. As you saw in our earnings press release, sa",757," Thanks, Tom. Third quarter sales were a very strong 128% of quota, which increased year-to-date attainment to 104%. This compares favorably to the 86% attainment achieved through the first nine months of 2009. As you saw in our earnings press release, sales wins were strong in areas where we are strategically focused, areas such as digital, payments and account processing. Even with strong sales, our pipeline remains healthy as new opportunities continue to be added. Sales cycles do remain elongated due to the combination of a slow economic recovery and a complex regulatory environment. Integrated sales were $35 million in the quarter and $88 million through September 30. In addition to payments, efficiency-based products, channel and risk solutions were solid in the quarter.
 Year to date, integrated sales are 17% ahead of last year and we are on track to meet our $105 million full year target. As of September 30, total program integrated sales were $321 million versus our originally stated goal of $360 million by 2012. Through the first nine months of 2010 alone, we have signed more than 370 new bill payment clients and over 160 new debit clients, an increase of 17% over last year. Importantly, even with these strong sales results, we still see significant opportunities to continue to expand.
 As of September 30, we have also achieved $48 million of annual cost savings, which now exceeds our 2010 full year operational effectiveness target. Since the beginning of 2007, we have delivered over $260 million in annual cost savings, surpassing our $250 million target more than one year early.
 Before I address current year guidance, let me update you quickly on the environment, which is generally consistent with our investor conference commentary. Through October 22, there have been 160 regulatory actions, 39 more than the prior year and in line with our estimate of 200 to 250 actions for the full year. The number of actions peaked at 57 in the third quarter of 2009 and since that point, have averaged about 50 per quarter. We anticipate that the number of regulatory actions in 2011 will be comparable with that of 2010. Since the beginning of 2008, our net client losses have been less than one half of 1% of our total Account Processing client base, and likely far less than we would've lost in the face of normalized M&A activity.
 While the market environment continues to be choppy, our financial results and sales successes do reflect gradual improvements in financial institutions spending patterns. We also continue to believe that the risks and opportunities of the new legislation on our business are generally balanced, recognizing that the true impact of the significant regulatory change is not fully understood. We are working on ways in which we can help our clients adapt their business models, turn information into action, gain efficiency, and very importantly, generate new sources of revenue.
 As noted in our earnings release, our 2010 guidance remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year adjusted internal revenue growth to be in the range of 1% to 3%, led by stronger growth in the Payments segment. Given we currently sit at 1% revenue growth for the first nine months of the year and the very strong revenue performance in last year's fourth quarter, we now believe our full year internal revenue growth rate will likely be at or below the midpoint of the guidance range. We feel very good about our high-quality revenue growth and the acceleration we've experienced throughout the year, which we believe should carry into 2011. We still expect 2010 adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% to 11% and now anticipate our full year results to be at or above the midpoint of our guidance range of $3.96 to $4.07 per share.  We continue to expect full year free cash flow growth to be 5% to 8% to over $700 million and that company adjusted operating margin will expand by at least 50 basis points for the full year.
 Although there is still uncertainty in the market, our momentum continues to build. We believe that the strong execution of the strategies we shared at Investor Day will further enhance our revenue growth and produce even better results for our clients, and you, our shareholders, over the next several years. We have a clear mission, targeted strategies and market-leading solutions. Those, combined with the dedication and commitment of our nearly 20,000 associates around the world, is truly a winning combination. With that, Carol, let's open the line for questions.

The substantial majority of the signings that we've had in the last couple of quarters and, really, for the last year or so have been heavily biased to recurring revenue, those revenues that tend to leverage the networks that we have in place, whether they be Account Processing or Payments-related products. And those revenues come on -- typically the sales are done before the contract, the existing contract when the prospects expire. So they tend to come on anywhere over a period of six to 12 months. And then they sometimes ramp up after that. So we don't typically expect to see the full revenue on contracts like that for over a year. But the things that we were selling in the last half of last year are those clients that are going live, such as American Savings Bank, that we sold well over a year ago that went live in the middle of this year, just picking one up as an example.

So clearly, in most transactions, we don't anticipate a significant increase in working capital just given the nature of the transactions. Because these are domestic transactions, we typically get paid monthly on our Account Processing type revenue and it's very consistent.

Last year, we had a number of items associated with our branding; a few other corporate related items like that, that did not recur this year. But going forward, as we look into '11 and all 12, margin expansion is not going to come from that, clearly. It's more pretty clean from a run rate standpoint in the current year. It's going to come from those segments. We just made much more investments in there. And I think if you look at our margin progression, clearly, in the first quarter in the segments, our Payments segment was about 30.5%, third quarter it's 31.7%. That's up sequentially 120 basis points. Financial is 28.8%, third quarter 29.5%, up as a revenue growth in the investment levels kind of level off. So clearly, through our cost-saving initiatives that we announced on Investor Day. And really the quality of revenue of where we're focused on building that revenue, we're focused on building that quality in Payments where we have scale transaction volume and also on Account Processing. And we are going to continue to make sure that business mix is where it is and so I anticipate that over time, it's going to come out of those segments.

But we really have two factors that are coming together that we're benefiting from. And not necessarily in order, but number one is we've done a fantastic job of distributing bill payment through our system in general. So I think with over 370 new bill payment clients in this year alone, up 17% that and debit combined over the past year. So that's a cumulative effect, we've done a really nice job since we acquired CheckFree. And so we're getting a lot of boost from that because similar to what we see on the debit side, that group tends to be far less mature in their utilization of bill pay. So that's number one. Number two, is we are seeing some nice growth across a wide variety of our clients, but there still are some clients and potentially larger clients not really contributing to the growth in the way that we would like. So the underlying metrics that we can see in the bill pay business are strong, and we still are seeing very good growth in makers and we think that -- so we have opportunity in terms of makers as we move up to, hopefully, what will be a 40%, 50% level of ultimate adoption in this area, but also we think that e-bill represents a very important opportunity and we're not getting any real benefit from e-bill this year as you can see on our numbers. And you can expect us to put more focus on that moving forward. So those factors combined, help us to be pretty confident that we're going to continue good, solid bill payment  growth and largely because of the sophistication and differentiation of our solution and the size of our client base.

But for the extraordinary December we had, it's been a stellar quarter and it's been quite a while since we've been above 100% in the third quarter that we haven't had to rely solely on the fourth quarter to take us up above that level. So we really are benefiting from a few things. First of all, I would say we're benefiting from the consolidation and I don't mean that in terms of luster, but bringing our sales force together and creating a single sales organization. That's helping us to be focused on where we need to be focused, and good successes across the enterprise client base. And we're also getting some really great success in delivering what I would call our broader, more differentiated solutions through our Account Processing network by bringing together our different solutions. So bundling together large buckets of value, whether it be Account Processing with Payments, risk, teller, analytics, those kinds of products that we have historically just not brought together as well as we probably should have. And that has shown up, as you know, in the increase in our win rates over the last couple of years. So it's really a combination of focus and delivering the right products to the market and then lastly, the focus that we've had on bill payment and debit and now ZashPay, those are highly valued and differentiated solutions that clients really want. And if you take something like ZashPay, which is going to be an interesting revenue opportunity for financial institutions at a time when they need it most, we think we're going to have a lot there. And all of that brings some very good recurring revenue, high quality, nice network business, higher margin revenue that really is a nice repayment for any investments that we've made.

And that's really our focus.

We have organic margin expansion, really, from three different sources. So number one is the types of revenue that we build tends to be that of recurring nature, and so revenue, where the incremental margins tend to be higher than the average margins. We sometimes refer to that as network economics. So that's the first element. The second element is that we also tend to have a little bit of a lower cost structure because we are leveraging single account managers to be able to distribute many different products into a different client. So we think we have a sales and distribution advantage as well as a relationship advantage. And then third, we really have, as you know, we have put together a pretty good methodology for continuing to make ourselves more efficient. So today, I think we report on an operational effectiveness measure where we're now over $260 million over the last four years. So the combination of high-quality revenues, business mix, distribution advantage and cost effectiveness are the areas that we think will drive organic margin enhancement over the next several years. Now that, of course, is going to be offset by the amount of investment that we're willing to make into different products, solutions and other areas. But those are the big drivers of margin. I think from a guidance perspective, we've said we expect to be able to grow margins organically like 50 to 100 basis points over the next several years. So I would  say that's where we see things over the medium term.

And the banks will make determinations on their own as to how they believe that they should best price that. I will tell you that John will talk, I think, in far more detail next year on the pricing strategies around these products because as we deliver incremental feature function, we think that there's a very intriguing pricing strategy that we'll be able to put on to these products that will allow financial institutions to actually better optimize their revenue there. So we see ZashPay as to clearly being an area where institutions will be able to charge and collect fees. At least the research that we've done, there's very little consumer resistance to reasonable pricing on these products. As it relates to mobile and other ancillary products, I've not seen an institution charging for that at this point. So I can't really comment on that. I think it'll be difficult for institutions to do that. We have seen institutions who are charging for some of the discrete elements of a relationship. I think we all know that Bank of America announced they're charging for statements. We've seen -- I've seen some clients who have said they're going to charge for monthly fees for DDAs if there isn't a certain level of debit activity. And obviously, we think that's a reasonably good approach from our perspective. But I think there's a lot of creativity out there. We've got a group called revenue enhancement that works with these financial institutions, but it's early. But the best news is, John, that the majority of the banks, as I'm sure you know, ended up losing far less than they anticipated on the NSF/OD side and that's really almost put back into flux how will the revenue, how will the pricing look because it's not nearly as egregious as I thought and there's always this fear of disenfranchising the customers of the institution. So -- but I do think we'll see some of that. I don't think John, mobile is going to be one of them, but I think time will tell.

I mean, our technology is obviously the by far the market-leading outsourced Internet banking solution and we've been working on some pretty interesting integrated functionality that resides in Corillian Online that brings together all these payments vehicles in one place. That said, it is at least a fairly well known fact that the largest institutions in the U.S., a number of them, are focused on kind of reupgrading their online experience. There are a number of institutions around the world who are doing the same thing. We announced obviously Westpac, we've now announced U.S. Bank. So there is a lot of activity and largely because, if you think about when the online banking investments were made, they were made in the late 1999s into the early 2000s and it's just about time to remodel that experience given everything that's going on today. And the efficiency gains that will be driven by moving customers there as opposed to some of the more expensive ways of interacting with clients or the customers of the financial institution.

One of the big benefits of our technology is its a pay-anyone technology. So there are a number of other technologies where you have to pay within the financial institution. For us, you're merely limited to paying anyone in the banking system. So we think that is a great advantage for us. And the nice thing is when you pay someone, they have to then register. If they're outside that institution, they have to register. And so that's the multiplier effect that I see. I would say that it's very early, and that's the most important thing I can stress at this point. We've had over 400 institutions sign up. But as we were talking earlier, there's an installation queue and we queue people up. And every week, we're adding a number of institutions and a number of users and we don't expect to really benefit from that volume itself for a while. But what we do expect it to do is train consumers of the financial institutions to be loyal to this product. That's a very important part of our strategy because it's yet another way of capturing the universal money movement opportunities that are out there. And so we'll talk about that a fair amount next year when we give guidance. It's an important part of our strategy.
