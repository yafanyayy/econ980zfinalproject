Earlier today, we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2009 fourth quarter and full year results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmintl.com. During our call today, we will be talking about results in the fourth quarter or the full year 2009 and comparing them with the same period in 2008 unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are for PMI shipments, industry volume and the market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions, and net revenue data excludes excise taxes. You will find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues and operating companies income or OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, and adjustments to earnings per share as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.

It's a pleasure to review our fourth quarter and full year results with you and share our outlook for the coming year. Our performance in the fourth quarter was strong across all financial metrics",2011,"Thank you, Nick, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It's a pleasure to review our fourth quarter and full year results with you and share our outlook for the coming year. Our performance in the fourth quarter was strong across all financial metrics and helped us to achieve a full year financial performance that met or exceeded our mid- to long-term targets. These results were accomplished despite the challenges we faced in numerous markets that bore the brunt of the global economic downturn, and a testament to the vigor and breadth of our brand portfolio, the geographic diversity of our earnings and the inherently favorable characteristics of the industry, in which we are privileged to participate, and most notably, the pricing power that we enjoy relative to the broader consumer packaged-goods sector.Our volume performance in the fourth quarter was solid, in part, reflecting the reversal of the timing issues that dampened our third quarter numbers that has caused such unnecessary anguish at that time. Full year cigarette volume fell marginally below the 2008 level, and on an organic basis, was just 1.5% lower while any volume erosion, even if modest, tends to garner disproportionate attention. In this instance, I would venture to say that our performance was in fact, quite solid. The combination of stubbornly high unemployment levels, lower discretionary incomes and tax-induced pricing took their toll on volumes. Most notably, in Spain, Ukraine, the Baltics, Romania, Serbia and Colombia, which all suffered extraordinary double-digit contractions. Indeed, absent those six markets, and we are the market leader in four of them, we would have posted a marginally positive organic volume growth number for the full year. Our market share performance was one of the key highlights of the year with 70% of our top 30 income markets registering a stable or growing trend. Those few markets have incurred market share erosion, positive [ph] (11:59) to varying degrees from either consumer down-trading or competitors seeking to bolster their share by fully or partially absorbing excise tax increases for several weeks or months. The widespread nature of our solid share performance is underscored by our momentum in both OECD and non-OECD markets, which reflects the impact of our product innovation and enhanced consumer engagement activities, as the year unfolded and the gradual elimination of the price advantage enjoyed by some competitors.A much discussed concern over the last few quarters has been the fate of the industry's premium segment, and whether or not consumers would slowly abandon it and seek lower-priced products. The evidence clearly suggests that such a phenomenon has been relatively restricted and that the potential for widespread contamination did not materialize as some may have feared. While the Premium segment suffered significant erosion in several markets, and most notably in Spain, Russia and Germany, it held up remarkably well in markets as varied as Turkey and Ukraine. And in the quarter, actually sustained its growth momentum in markets such as Argentina, Indonesia, Korea, Poland and Greece.The disciplined rollout of Marlboro's new brand architecture continued to pace as the year unfolded. While the brand's overall volume performance suffered from the market contractions that occurred primarily in the European Union and in Eastern Europe, it fared remarkably well in numerous markets. Volume growth of 4.3% in Asia was particularly noteworthy with solid market share performances in Japan, Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines.The admittedly early signs of the brand's new architecture are positive, and our efforts to enhance the brand's vibrancy are starting to bear fruit. The brand's demographic profile has responded as intended and it is gaining share in both developed markets such as Italy, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, Portugal and Greece and developing markets such as Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, the Philippines, Romania, Algeria, Morocco and Poland.While much remains to be done, we believe that we are on the right track and that the brand's consumer appeal will become ever stronger going forward. I would be remiss if I did not highlight L&M's performance in 2009 particularly, in the fourth quarter. The brand exemplifies the strength of our portfolio and the key strategic role that it and others play in our operating model. In the European Union, L&M's volume grew by close to 9% in 2009 and was up over 17% in the fourth quarter. Its performance was such that it more than offset Marlboro's volume erosion in the European Union during the quarter. Also of note, the long hoped-for stabilization of the brand, historical stronghold in Eastern Europe, appears to have now materialized as evidenced by the fact that L&M's volume was flat for the quarter in this important region despite continued share erosion in Russia.Net revenues of $25 billion rose 7.5% for the year, excluding an adverse currency hit of $2.6 billion and were up 5.3% for the full year excluding currency and acquisitions. In the fourth quarter, currency turned in our favor, and net revenues were up a sharp 9.7% or 7.2%, excluding the favorable impact of currency and acquisitions. Adjusted Operating Companies income increased by 8.7% for the year and 8.9% for the quarter, both excluding currency and acquisitions. For the full year, our adjusted OCI margin rose the full 1.4 percentage points to reach a level of 42.8%, again, on a constant currency basis, with each region contributing to this strong performance.Pricing across the vast majority of markets was the key driver of our strong constant currency operating companies income growth, contributing nearly $2 billion to the full year and just under $500 million for the fourth quarter. This was partially offset by an adverse volume mix variance of $570 million for the full year, and a more modest $90 million for the quarter. Of particular relevance is that the price variance offset the adverse volume mix variance by a ratio of 3.5:1 for the year and 5.2:1 for the quarter. Those ratios will hopefully put to bed the endless debate on the appropriate balance between volume and income. Adjusted diluted EPS for the full year increased by $0.51 or 15.4% on a currency-neutral basis. The principal contributors to this strong constant currency performance were operations growth of $0.47 and the impact of share repurchases of $0.19, partially offset by an increase in interest cost of $0.17. For the quarter, adjusted diluted EPS rose $0.11 or 15.5%, excluding a marginal unfavorable currency variance of $0.01 due to adverse currency on the interest and tax line, more than offsetting the modest benefit on the operating line. Operations growth contributed $0.09 and share repurchases $0.06, partially offset by higher interest costs of $0.04. Discretionary cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, ultimately, the most important metric, increased by 4.9% or $333 million, to reach slightly more than $7.1 billion in 2009 despite an estimated adverse currency impact of $1.5 billion. Absent currency, discretionary cash flow would thus have increased by 26%, in part, due to our tight management of working capital and the favorable results of our determined efforts to seek stricter forestalling rules.Our strong cash flow performance enabled us to continue to reward shareholders. We increased our dividend by 7.4% to an annualized rate of $2.32 per share in September, and by year-end, had deployed $5.5 billion to repurchase close to 130 million shares or 6.5% of shares outstanding at the beginning of 2009. All in all, 2009 proves to be a very solid year, especially within the context of the global economic downturn, with which we all had to contend. And I'm particularly pleased that we achieved most of what we had set out to do this year.The fragility of the economic recovery and its geographic disparity, coupled with its uncertain impact on employment levels and potential currency volatility, naturally warrants a cautious outlook for 2010. Given our momentum, however, we remain optimistic that while our organic volume performance is likely to parallel that of 2009, reflecting further market contractions, we will again post strong financial result this year. As announced in our release, we project reported diluted EPS of between $3.75 to $3.85 in 2010, reflecting a growth rate of some 16% to 19% of our 2009 EPS of $3.24. At prevailing exchange rates, we will benefit from a modest tailwind and accordingly, our guidance assumes the constant currency reported diluted EPS growth rate of some 12% to 15%. Compared to our 2009 adjusted diluted EPS of $3.29, this new guidance projects a growth rate of approximately 14% to 17%, or 11% to 14% excluding currency. The key driver of our earnings growth will continue to be pricing. Of note is that we have already secured from 2/3 of the pricing that is embedded in our guidance and remain confident that the remaining third will be secured. The potential for disrupted excise tax increases is always a risk. So far this year, we have witnessed abnormal increases in Greece, Turkey and Romania, which will undoubtedly affect industry volumes there. More important than the increases per se however, especially over the longer term, are potential changes in the structure of excise taxes, and on this front, we continue to witness a rational and virtually universal approach. Greece is a notable exception. There the government increased the excise tax incidence in January from 57.5% 63%, an increase of 5.5 percentage points while actually reducing the minimum excise tax burden. In our humble opinion, such an action will stimulate significant down-trading and revenues will fall substantially short of the government's expectations. In Japan, the government has called for a JPY 70 per pack of 20 cigarettes or 40% excise tax increase effective October 2010, and parliamentary approval is expected to be secured by the end of March. The pass-on, taking into account sales taxes and current trade margin levels, implies a minimum price increase of JPY 82 per pack of 20 cigarettes to remain revenue neutral on a per-stick basis. Even such a minimum increase in a notoriously price sensitive Japanese market, will frankly, put us in the uncharted territory. But and inevitable consequence will be that industry volumes will fall severely in the fourth quarter and in 2011. The precise extent of the damage remains to be seen. However, this heavy toll may ultimately prove to be beneficial over time if the industry simultaneously secures the pricing freedom that has eluded it in the past. We remain cautiously optimistic that such freedom will be granted.As was the case in 2009, we believe that the Premium segment in select markets will continue to be under pressure, especially if unemployment remains an intractable issue. But we do not believe that such adverse forces will be either pervasive or particularly disruptive. Indeed, we anticipate continued widespread share growth, as we further deploy our product innovations and continue to perfect our adult consumer engagement activities, equity enhancing promotions, point-of-sale presence and distribution infrastructure. On the cost front, we anticipate productivity savings of some $500 million, essentially in line with the level achieved in 2009. And we also project continued improvement in the management of our working capital, as we optimize inventory levels across our entire supply chain.As previously announced, we believe that our discretionary cash flow growth rate will outpace that of our earnings this year. Our optimism regarding the future is underscored by our announcement this morning of a new three-year 12 billion share repurchase program, which will run as of May, upon the full completion of our previous 13 billion two-year program. We anticipate that our total 2010 share repurchases will be in the $4 billion range. We believe that this new program strikes an optimal balance between our relentless desire to continue to reward shareholders, while retaining the financial flexibility that a strong balance sheet and credit rating entails.All in all, we delivered very solid results in 2009 despite a challenging economic environment. We met or exceeded our principal financial targets and we did so in a high quality manner. We entered 2010 with significant momentum and a potential currency tailwind. Thank you. Hermann and I will now be pleased to field any questions you may have."

I would say that the speech was cautious in terms of such an action, and for the very first time, the Minister recognized the potential ramifications in terms of intellectual property and the trading or free trade arrangements that they have. So I think people are beginning to recognize there were significant issues, the main one being that there is no evidence whatsoever, to suggest that generic packaging would affect total consumption of cigarettes. In fact, certain governments and particularly Sweden and New Zealand, have declined proposals to look into generic packaging, specifically for that reason, that there is no evidence to suggest that it helps in terms of total consumption, which ultimately is the objective of that measure. So I do not believe that it is something that others will follow. It remains a risk. But I think the industry has some very pertinent and powerful arguments against generic packaging, not least of which is the unintended consequence in terms of counterfeit and contraband."

The fourth quarter volume was up double digits in Indonesia and it was principally driven by the timing of Ramadan, which held our third quarter as Hermann has told you at the time. Share continues to be relatively strong, particularly behind A Mild and Marlboro. As we've said in the past, shares somewhat is a bit volatile based on the stick prices and when those stick prices go the certain thresholds. Total industry shipments in Indonesia were up 5%, which is a pretty attractive number and we would anticipate that that is consumption levels which continued. The economy of Indonesia is doing well. There has been excise tax reform which I believe will be favorable going forward. Today, we are seeing quite a lot of growth in the low price segment and if you recall, there is an excise tax benefit for manufacturers that -- manufacturer of cigarettes below a certain threshold. And I think over the time, that loophole will be closed and that will be a benefit for us and the bigger players. Let's not forget there are more than 700 manufacturers, small manufacturers of products that enjoy these excise tax benefits. Which clearly, potentially help employment but damage government revenues. And I think the trend that we've seen in terms of the surge in the volume of that segment will attenuate as the excise tax reforms take place."

For example, people are downtrading in the EU to L&M take the German example or in fact Spain as well, which has been driving a lot of L&M's growth. What you have to understand is L&M's average marginal contribution in the European Union is equal to or even higher than Marlboro's marginal contribution in Asia, in Latin America and in the EMEA region.

I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong financial performance in the first quarter. With all our financial results in line with our constant currency, mid-to-long-term annual growth targets despite",2408,"Thank you, Nick and welcome ladies and gentlemen. I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong financial performance in the first quarter. With all our financial results in line with our constant currency, mid-to-long-term annual growth targets despite some unwelcome developments on the excise tax front.
Cigarette volume in the quarter increased by 0.7% to 240.7 billion units, including 6.1 billion additional units resulting from our business combination with Fortune Tobacco in the Philippines. On an organic basis, volume declined by 2.3%, a very satisfactory result in what is still a difficult economic environment in many parts of the world and we remain confident that we can achieve our full cost, 1.5% decline in organic volume for 2010 as a whole. Overall, volume developments in Japan are obviously the biggest unknown element contained in this forecast.
There are four main factors that impact our volume, the economic environment, consumer behavior, excise taxation and our competitiveness in the marketplace. Emerging economies in Asia are continuing to grow and we are seeing an improved outlook in Latin America, particularly Brazil and Mexico.
We have commodity prices recovering, there are also signs of stabilization in Eastern Europe though this has yet to translate into higher employment levels and improved purchasing power. Across the EU, however, economic conditions remain difficult.
Premium volume is growing in several emerging markets such as Algeria, Argentina, Indonesia and Mexico. Consumer down trading is moderating in Russia and we are cautiously optimistic that the market will stabilize towards the end of the year. However, price sensitivity remains high across the EU, putting pressure on the premium segment in these markets.
On a global basis, improvements in employment levels will be the key for consumer trading to resume. The other element of adult consumer behavior that is impacting industry volume is illicit trade. While stricter laws and better enforcement have had a positive impact in Canada where a duty paid industry volume was up over 10% in the first quarter, illicit trade remains a significant issue across the wide range of geographies particularly those which has been subject to large tax driven price increases.
Excise taxation is, of course, a key factor influencing industry volume. Most governments are continuing to pursue a policy of reasonable increases as they recognize that this optimizes their long-term revenues and avoids the unintended negative consequences of increased illicit trade and consumer down trading.
Meanwhile, excise tax structures continue to improve on a global basis. The latest very important example of this is the new EU excise tax directive which is premised on gradual tax increases, includes three important structural improvements and provides visibility through 2018.
The increase in the maximum specific total tax ratio from 55% to 76.5% will allow governments to introduce excise tax systems with a very high specific element. A gradual reduction in the difference in taxes between fine cut and cigarettes will over time lessen the tax advantage of roll your own and make your own products.
Finally, the removal of the previous cap on minimum excise taxes provides governments with a much stronger fiscal mechanism to limit down trading, which is important in the context of the recent decision of the European Code of Justice not to allow the continuation of the current minimum reference price systems in Austria, France and Ireland.
Nevertheless, there continue to be a few countries which, from time to time, implement unreasonable disruptive increases. In 2009, we had Brazil and Ukraine. This year, we have Romania and Turkey where taxes increased by over 30% in general.
Under such circumstances, it is hardly surprising that industry volume in these two markets was down by double digits in the first quarter as consumers turn to cheaper contraband and counterfeit products. PMI estimates that illicit supplies have doubled to 36% of cigarette consumption in Romania and has recently increased substantially in the eastern part of Turkey.
The Greek government, meanwhile, defied logic by decreasing the minimum excise tax at the same time as it increased the abnormal excise tax rate. We anticipate this will result in consumer down trading as price gaps widen. Old price product was still extensively available in the first quarter. Therefore, the main impact is expected to be felt starting in the second quarter.
Due to such unintended consequences, there appears to be a strong likelihood that government revenue targets in these countries will not be met and we hope that, going forward, these governments will take a more appropriate approach to excise taxation.
Finally, we have Japan, where the Parliament has approved the government's proposal to increase excise taxes by an unprecedented 70 yen per pack in October of this year. As I said earlier, it is very difficult to predict what the impact will be on industry volume. PMI has obtained permission to increase prices by 20 yen per pack this June. However, we have now decided not to implement this price move.
The fourth element impacting our volume is, of course, our competitiveness, which remains as strong as ever. We continue to gain share across many key developed and emerging markets, driven by a superior brand portfolio and consumer relevant innovation. Boding well for the future, our smoker shared among legal age minimum 18-24 years old is at least five points higher than our smoker share among legal age 64 year old in a wide selection of markets.
Marlboro had a strong performance in the first quarter. With total volume down just 4.6% and up by 1.4% excluding Romania and Turkey. Asia continues to be the key driver for Marlboro. Thanks notably to Japan, Korea and the Philippines. The brand also performed very well in the Latin America and Canada region with volume and share increases in Argentina and Mexico, only partly offset by the impact of industry volume softness in Brazil.
Marlboro volume increased significantly in North Africa and we saw an improvement in duty free sales. Nevertheless, volume was down 1.2% in the EEMA region as a whole, due to the aforementioned tax driven price increases. Price sensitivity in Germany and a very difficult economic situation in Spain and the overall industry volume decline negatively impacted Marlboro shipments in the EU region which were down 6.2%.
It should be highlighted that today over 60% of the brand's volume is in fact generated outside the EU region. The strong performance of Marlboro has been driven by the rollout of the new architecture and successful innovative line extensions. Marlboro Filter Plus in the red line notably achieved a 2.8% market share in Kuwait.
Marlboro Gold Touch in the gold line had a 1.4% share in Italy. Finally, Marlboro Black Menthol in the fresh line achieved a 1.3% market share in Japan. Our success with consumer relevant innovations has provided us with incremental volume and has reinforced the equity of the overall Marlboro franchise.
Marlboro has been complemented by a broad portfolio of leading international and local brands. In these difficult economic times, our international low price brands has been performing particularly well. With strong volume growth for Bond Street, Next and Red & White, as well as local brands, such as Delicados in Mexico and Optima in Russia.
So let me now look at our performance on a geographic basis. In the EU region that a premium segment continues to be under pressure from the difficult economic environment and high unemployment, PMI obtained an estimated 38.4% market share, down just 0.2 share points whereas Marlboro share declined 0.3 points to 18.3%. L&M share grew by 0.5 points to a record level of 5.7%.
Our strategy of establishing a strong brand at the lower end of the market invest in Europe as we have done successfully elsewhere around the world is clearly working well. In Japan, our market share grew by 0.3 points in the quarter to 24.2%, thanks to the condition strong growth of Marlboro and the much improved performance of Lark, both driven by the success of our products innovation strategy.
In Korea, our strong momentum continued with a market share gain of 3.6 points, led by Marlboro and Parliament. In the very important Russian market, we achieved a further market share gain of 0.5 percentage points to reach 25.6%, driven by the excellent performance of Bond Street, which is the fastest growing brand in Russia and has captured a disproportionately large share of consumer down trading during the recession.
The market share of above premium Parliament is stable and the share of mid priced Chesterfield increased during the quarter, an early sign that the down trading trend in Russia is abating. These developments auger well for the time when Russian consumers are more confident and start to trade up again.
We have also reinforced our industry leadership in several other emerging markets. Our market share in Ukraine was up 0.4 percentage points to 36.2%. In Turkey, in spite of the unfavorable impact on the premium segment of the large excise tax driven price increases in general this year, our share resisted well, being down 1.5 points at 14.9%.
In Indonesia, our volume grew by 5.7% as a mild continued to show tremendous momentum and our overall share remains stable. In the Philippines, the recently completed transaction with Fortune Tobacco provided us with a combined market share of approximately 90% in March. And the integration of the two companies is proceeding very smoothly.
We had a very strong quarter also in the Latin America in Canada region with share gains notably in Argentina and Mexico. Higher prices in nearly all key markets across the world enabled us to obtain strong revenue growth, despite the lower organic volume.
In the first quarter, we achieved the favorable pricing variance of $449 million, including inventory windfalls resulting from the sale of old tax product at new prices in the EEMA region. Net revenues, reach $6.5 billion. This represents an increase of 16. 1%, compared to last year in the very robust increase of 6.1%, excluding currency and acquisitions.
Adjusted OCI was $2.8 billion, up 17% over the previous year and 8.6% higher, excluding currency and acquisitions. Our adjusted OCI margin, excluding the impact of currency grew by 0.4 points in the quarter to 42.7% with increases in the EU, EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions. The reduction in the OCI margin in the Asia region reflects the inclusion in the quarter of $6.1 billion units in the Philippines resulting from our business combination with FTC which were consolidated and resold with no additional margin.
Going forward on adjusted OCI margins, will be impacted by the delusion effect of this and surprisingly emerging market OCI margins tend to be lower initially than the PMI average. However, over time, such transactions enhance the volume and profitability growth potential of PMI.
Our improved adjusted OCI margins take into account higher tobacco leaf costs, which this year are expected to amount to $200 million. This increase will be largely offset by productivity savings and manufacturing and overall, we are on track to realize our planned $500 million in productivity and cost savings in 2010 and our three-year cumulative savings of $1.5 million.
Adjusted diluted EPS reached $0.90 in the first quarter, a significant increase of 21.6% over 2009 and up by a very robust 13.5%, excluding currency. Our strong business results have fueled a further increase in our operating cash flow, which was 38.3% higher at $2 billion.
Excluding currency, operating cash flow was up by 29.2%. The growth in our cash flow was driven mainly by higher net earnings, stricter forestalling regulations most notably in Poland and the initial positive impact on inventory durations of our $750 million to $1 billion three-year working capital improvement program.
We have further leveraged our operating cash flow growth through tight controls on capital expenditures. As a result, free cash flow increased at the faster rate of 42.3% to $1.8 billion and by 33.2%, excluding currency.
We have also been active on the financing front. We issued a $1 billion 10 year bond with a 4.5% coupon in March and established a new $2.5 billion bank revolver to replace two facilities that were maturing later this year. Since the spin, we have issued over $14 billion in well-laddered bonds in three currencies with an attractive average cost of 5.5%.
Our total available bank revolver credit now stands at $5.2 billion. And these facilities remain undrawn. Our profitability growth momentum, very solid balance sheet and tremendous cash flow have enabled us to establish strong A2 and A long-term credit ratings, which we intend to maintain, thus insuring condition access to the tier 1 commercial paper market.
Our financial strength has enabled us to continue to reward our shareholders well. During the first quarter, we spent $1.8 billion to purchase an additional $36.1 million shares and had just $257 million left on our current program, which will be completed on schedule by the end of this month.
We have announced a new three year $12 billion program that will start in May. Our dividend of $2.32 per share on an analyzed basis represented an attractive yield of 4.5% on April 19.
So let me summarize the first quarter. We achieved very strong financial results, pricing power remains intact, our superior brand portfolio and successful innovation drove market share gains across a wide range of geographies and we grew our cash flow at a rapid pace. There were nevertheless some road bumps from excise taxation in a few markets, though the global economic environment is showing signs of recovery.
As a consequence, our overall business outlook is also expected to improve during the second half of the year, which should enable us to build further on our good momentum, though the impact of the October Japanese tax increase remains uncertain.
Finally, I'm very pleased to reaffirm today our reported diluted EPS guidance of $3.75 to $3.85 for the full year 2010, reflecting a growth rate of some 16% to 19% off our 2009 EPS of $3.24.
Exchange rates today are more favorable than they were in February. However, we have decided to maintain our guidance at this stage in the year, reflecting a more cautious stance on Japan in light of recent developments. Accordingly, our guidance on a constant currency basis represents a reported diluted EPS growth rate of some 10% to 13%.
Thank you. I will now be pleased to answer any questions you may have.

I think that tells you everything. It just went beyond. The government took it too far and that is what we are faced by now. That will of course not meet the revenue targets. I hope that it will come to a more normal situation, but I don't give you a short-term hope for that.

Then if you really looked into where we have share declines, then there are specific reasons. Germany is really a very price sensitive market that you can recognize that from the growth of trade brands renewed of growth of trade brands in the market. What did we do about it? Well, we have established now L&M at the low end of the market. And it's doing extremely well and almost compensating the losses there. So that's why you can do in such an environment, or you go to France, there actually we have a second premium brand, which is almost picking up the share losses that we make for Marlboro which is Philip Morris Filter Kings.
And then you have two others with Greece and Spain, where the declines are simply linked to the economic situation. So there are specific problems here and there. But if you take it all together, I see many more positive signs around the world than problems. And with the problems you have to deal.

I see a high mid priced brand Chesterfield that is picking up share of 0.3% to 3.3% of the market. So these are good signs, there that things begin to improve.

On India, really the thing is, I mean, you have seen that there are further restrictions actually on foreign investment that have come up in India very recently. These actually should not have an impact on our business. We have established last year a new business structure in India that has laid the foundation for organic volume growth in that market.
So we have an entity we control, which is the - is holding the license for the international brands, then the manufacturing. And the distribution is happening let’s got the Philips, so we don’t manufacture in India to start this so we are not hit by that new regulation.

6569181,98000262,57185,"Philip Morris International, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2010",2010-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Philip Morris International Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong financial performance in the first quarter, with all our financial results in line with or above our constant currency mid- to long-term and year growth ta",2404,"Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong financial performance in the first quarter, with all our financial results in line with or above our constant currency mid- to long-term and year growth targets despite some unwelcome developments on the excise tax front.
Segment volume in the quarter increased by 0.7% to 204.7 billion units, including 6.1 billion additional units resulting from our business combination with Fortune Tobacco in the Philippines. On an organic basis, volume declined by 2.3%, a very satisfactory result in what is still a difficult economic environment in many parts of the world. And we remain confident that we can achieve our full cost 100% decline in organic volume for 2010 as a whole.  Overall, volume developments in Japan are obviously the biggest unknown element contained in this forecast. 
There are four main factors that impact our volume: The economic environment, consumer behavior, excise taxation and our competitiveness in the marketplace. Emerging economies in Asia are continuing to grow, and we are seeing an improved outlook in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Mexico. With commodity prices recovering, there are also signs of stabilization in Eastern Europe, though this has yet to translate into higher employment levels and improved purchasing power.  Across the EU however, the economic conditions remain difficult. 
Premium volume is growing in several emerging markets such as Algeria, Argentina, Indonesia and Mexico. Consumer downtrading is moderating in Russia, and we are cautiously optimistic that the market will stabilize towards the end of the year. However, price sensitivity remains high across the EU, putting pressure on the Premium segment in these markets. On a global basis, improvements in employment levels will be the key for consumer uptaking to resume.
The other element of a dull consumer behavior that  is impacting industry volume is illicit trade. While stricter laws and better enforcement have had a positive impact in Canada, that the duty-paid industry volume was up over 10% in the first quarter, illicit trade remains a significant issue across a wide range of geographies, particularly those which have been subject to large tax-driven price increases.
Excise taxation is of course a key factor influencing industry volume. Most governments are continuing to pursue a policy of reasonable increases, as they recognize that this optimizes their long-term revenues and avoids the unintended negative consequences of increased illicit trade and consumer downtrading. Meanwhile, excise tax structures continue to improve on a global basis. The latest very important example of this is the new EU excise tax directive, which is premised on gradual tax increases, includes three important structural improvements and provides visibility through 2018.  The increase in the maximum specific to total tax ratio from 55% to 76.5% will allow governments to introduce excise tax systems with a very high specific element. A gradual reduction in the difference in taxes between fine carbon cigarettes will over time lessen the tax advantage of roll-your-own and make-your-own products.  Finally, the removal of the previous cap on minimum excise taxes provides governments with a much stronger fiscal mechanism to limit down trading, which is important in the context of the recent decision of the European Court of Justice not to allow the continuation of the current minimum reference price systems in Austria, France and Ireland.  
Nevertheless, there continue to be a few countries which from time to time implement unreasonable disruptive increases. In 2009, we had Brazil and Ukraine. This year, we have Romania and Turkey, where taxes increased by over 30% in January. Under such circumstances, it is hardly surprising that industry volume in these two markets was down by double digits in the first quarter, as consumers turn to cheaper contraband and counterfeit products.
PMI estimates that illicit supplies have doubled to 36% of cigarette consumption in Romania, and has recently increased substantially in the eastern part of Turkey. The Greek government, meanwhile, defied logic by decreasing the minimum excise tax, at the same time, hasn't increased the ad valorem excess tax rate. We anticipate this will result in consumer downtrading as price gets right. Old-priced product was still extensively available in the first quarter. Therefore, the main impact is expected to be felt starting in the second quarter.  Due to such unintended consequences, there appears to be a strong likelihood that government revenue targets in these countries will not be met, and we hope that going forward, these governments will take a more appropriate approach to excise taxation. 
Finally, we have Japan, where the parliament has approved the government's proposal to increase excise taxes by an unprecedented 70 yen per pack in October this year.  As I said earlier, it is very difficult to predict what the impact will be on industry volume. PMI had obtained permission to increase prices by 20 yen per pack this June. However, we have now decided not to implement this price move.
The fourth element impacting our volume is of course our competitiveness, which remains as strong as ever. We continue to gain share across many key developed and emerging markets, driven by our superior brand portfolio and consumer element innovation. Boding well for the future, our smoker share among legal age, minimum 18 to 24 year old, is at least five points higher than our smoker share  among legal age to 64 year olds in a wide selection of markets.
Marlboro had a strong performance in the first quarter, as total volume down just 0.6% and up by 1.4%, excluding Romania and Turkey. Asia continues to be the key driver for Marlboro, thanks notably to Japan, Korea and the Philippines. The brand also performed very well in the Latin America and Canada region, with volume and share increases in Argentina and Mexico, only partly offset by the impact of industry volume softness in Brazil. Marlboro volume increased significantly in North Africa, and we saw an improvement in duty-free sales. Nevertheless, volume was down 1.2% in the EEMA region as a whole, due to the aforementioned tax-driven price increases.  Price sensitivity in Germany, the very difficult economic situation in Spain and the overall industry volume decline negatively impacted Marlboro shipments in the EU region, which were down 6.2%. It should be highlighted that today, over 60% of the brand's volume is in fact generated outside the EU region.
The strong performance of Marlboro has been driven by the rollout of the new architecture and successful innovative line extensions. Marlboro Filter Plus and the Red line notably achieved a 2.8% market share in the first quarter in Kuwait. Marlboro Gold Touch in the Gold line had a 1.4% share in Italy. Finally, Marlboro Black Menthol in the Fresh line achieved a 1.3% market share in Japan.
Our success, with consumer element innovations, has provided us with incremental volume, and has reinforced the equity of the overall Marlboro franchise. Marlboro has been complemented by a broad portfolio of leading international and local brands. In these difficult economic times, our international low-priced brands have been performing particularly well. The strong volume growth for Bond Street, Next and Red and White, as well as local brands such as Delicados in Mexico and Optima in Russia.
So let me now look at our performance on a geographic basis. In the EU region, where the Premium segment continues to be under pressure from the difficult economic environment and high unemployment, PMI obtained an estimated 38.4% market share, down just 0.2 share points. While Marlboro share declined by 0.3 points to 18%, L&M share grew by 0.5 points to a record level of 5.7%. Our strategy of establishing a strong brand at the lower end of the market in Western Europe, as we have done successfully elsewhere around the world, is clearly working well.
In Japan, our market share grew by 0.3 points in the quarter to 24.2%. Thanks to the continued strong growth of Marlboro and the much improved performance of Lark, both driven by the success of our product innovation strategy. In Korea, our strong momentum continued, with a market share gain of 3.6 points, led by Marlboro and Parliament.
In the very important Russian market, we achieved a further market share gain of 0.5 percentage points to reach 25.6%, driven by the excellent performance of Bond Street, which is the fastest growing brand in Russia, and has captured a disproportionately large share of consumer downtrading during the recession. The market share of above premium Parliament is stable, and the share of mid-priced Chesterfield increased during the quarter, an early sign that the downtrading trend in Russia is abating.  These developments all go well for the time when Russian consumers are more confident and start to trade up again. 
We have also reinforced our industry leadership in several other emerging markets. Our market share in Ukraine was up 0.4 percentage points to 36.2%. In Turkey, in spite of the unfavorable impact on the Premium segment of the large excise tax-driven price increases in January this year, our share resisted well, being down 1.5 points at 40.9%.
In Indonesia, our volume grew by 5.7% as A Mild continued to show tremendous momentum, and our overall share remain stable. In the Philippines, the recently completed transaction with Fortune Tobacco provided us with a combined market share of approximately 90% in March. And the integration of the two companies is proceeding very smoothly.
We had a very strong quarter also in the Latin America and Canada region, with further share gains notably in Argentina and Mexico. Higher prices in nearly all key markets across the world enabled us to obtain strong revenue growth despite the lower organic volume. In the first quarter, we achieved a favorable pricing variance of $449 million, including inventory windfalls resulting from the sale of whole-taxed product at new prices in the EEMA region.
Net revenues reached $6.5 billion. This represents an increase of 16.1% compared to last year, and a very robust increase of 6.1%, excluding currency and acquisitions. Adjusted OCI was $2.8 billion, up 17% over the previous year and 8.6% higher, excluding currency and acquisitions. Our adjusted OCI margin, excluding the impact of currency, grew by 0.4 points in the quarter to 42.7%, with increases in the EU, EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions. The reduction in the adjusted OCI margin in the Asia region reflects the inclusion in the quarter of 6.1 billion units in the Philippines, resulting from our business combination with FTC [Fortune Tobacco Corporation], which were consolidated and resold with no additional margin.
Going forward, our adjusted OCI margins will be impacted by the dilution effect of this transaction. Unsurprisingly, emerging-market OCI margins tend to be lower initially than the PMI average. However, over time, such transactions enhance the volume and profitability growth potential of PMI. Our improved adjusted OCI margins take into account higher tobacco leaf costs, which this year are expected to amount to $200 million.  This increase will be largely offset by productivity savings in manufacturing. And overall, we are on track to realize our planned $500 million in productivity and cost savings in 2010, and our three-year cumulative savings of $1.5 billion.
Adjusted diluted EPS reached $0.90 in the first quarter, a significant increase of 21.6% over 2009, and up by a very robust 13.5%, excluding currency. 
Our strong business results have fueled a further increase in our operating cash flow, which was 38.3% higher at $2 billion. Excluding currency, operating cash flow was up by 29.2%.  The growth in our cash flow was driven mainly by higher net earnings, stricter forestalling regulations, most notably in Poland, and the initial positive impact on inventory durations of our $750 million to $1 billion three-year working capital improvement program.
We have further leveraged our operating cash flow growth through tight controls on capital expenditures. As a result, free cash flow increased at the faster rate of 42.3% to $1.8 billion, and by 33.2%, excluding currency. 
We have also been active on the financing front. We issued a $1 billion 10-year bond with 4.5% coupon in March, and established a new $2.5 billion bank revolver to replace two facilities that were maturing later this year. Since the spin, we have issued over $14 billion in well-laddered bonds in three currencies with an advantage average cost of 5.5%. Our total available bank revolver credit now stands at $5.2 billion, and these facilities remain undrawn.
Our profitability growth momentum, very solid balance sheet and tremendous cash flow have enabled us to establish strong AA and A long-term credit ratings which we intend to maintain, thus ensuring continuous access to the Tier 1 commercial paper market.
Our financial strength has enabled us to continue to report our shareholders well. During the first quarter, we spent $1.8 billion to purchase an additional 36.1 million shares. And had just $257 million left on our current program, which will be completed on schedule by the end of this month.  We have announced a new three-year, $12 billion program that will start in May. Our dividend of $2.32 per share on an annualized basis represented an attractive yield of 4.5% on April 19. 
So let me summarize the first quarter: We achieved very strong financial results; pricing power remains intact, our superior brand portfolio and successful innovation drove market share gains across a wide range of geographies; and we grew our cash flow at a rapid pace.  Nevertheless, some road bumps from excise taxation in a few markets, though the global economic environment is showing signs of recovery. As a consequence, our overall business outlook is also expected to improve during the second half of the year, which should enable us to build further on our good momentum, though the impact of the October Japanese tax increase remains uncertain.
Finally, I'm very pleased to reaffirm today our reported diluted EPS guidance of $3.75 to $3.85 for the full year 2010, reflecting a growth rate of some 16% to 19% of our 2009 EPS of $3.24. Exchange rates today are more favorable than they were in February. However, we have decided to maintain our guidance at this stage in the year, reflecting a more cautious stance on Japan in light of all the recent developments.  Accordingly, our guidance on a constant currency basis represents a reported diluted EPS growth rate of some 10% to 13%. 
Thank you. I will now be pleased to answer any questions you may have."

And at this point in time, there are kind of only two things that we really know, and more things that we actually don't know at this point in time. So what we know is, yes there will be this excise increase on October 1, and the rollover on the margin neutral basis is at 82 yen per pack. That we know. The second thing we really know is that we have decided not to implement the previously approved 20 yen per pack price increase in June, but what we don't know is then the consumer reaction that we will see in the market, the price elasticity.

Just the magnitude of the decline, particularly in Romania, just seem very large. Can you just talk about maybe the illicit trade? And sort of when can we see that trend improving? Or is the government really looking to crack down more aggressively? What are you guys doing to sort of mitigate that issue?

I mean, there were several price increases, tax increases already in the market. April, September of last year, again, January this year. Now illicit trade has literally exploded, doubled from before, 18% to 36% now. To crack down on this is much more difficult than to take a reasonable decision before hand. So of course, we try to help. But the real help would be there to come back on decisions, which rarely happens in markets, I must say. So yes, it has driven prices in Romania to a point there. I mean, the average in Romania lately, the average net income in Romania is anything between RON 1,400 to RON 1,500. And the pack of cigarettes is in the range of RON 10. I think that tells you everything. That it just went beyond. The government took it too far. And that's what we are faced by now. They will, of course, not meet their revenue targets. I hope that we will come to more normal situation, but I don't give you a short-term hope for that."

So therefore, in that environment, I think the Marlboro performance is a very, very good performance. And there are so many examples around the world. We talked about it in the script before, in Asia, in Latin America, where the growth is. Actually, even if you then look a little closer into Europe, this is not an EU problem either, because there are a number of important markets in the EU that Marlboro is doing pretty well as well, with substantial increases in share, like Italy, Portugal, Poland, or also, the Netherlands, would be good examples. Then if you really look and into where we have share declines, then there are specific reasons. I mean, Germany is a really, a very price-sensitive market. You can recognize that from the growth of trade brands, renewed growth of trade brands in the market. What did we do about it? Well, we have established now, L&M, at the low end of the market, and it's doing extremely well and almost compensating the losses there. So that's what you can do in such an environment or you go to France. There actually, we have a second premium brand, which is almost picking up the share losses that we make on Marlboro, which is Philip Morris Filter Kings. And then, you have two others with Greece and Spain, where the declines are simply linked to the economic situation. So there are specific problems here and there. But if you take it all together, I see many more positive signs around the world than problems, and the problems you have to deal."

6569181,98000285,68561,"Philip Morris International, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Philip Morris International Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter, with results in line with the business expectations that we shared with you during our Investor Day last month. At that time, we announced a repo",1973,"Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter, with results in line with the business expectations that we shared with you during our Investor Day last month. At that time, we announced a reported diluted EPS guidance for 2010 of $3.70 to $3.80 based on the same prevailing exchange rate. Since then, concerning surrounding the future of the eurozone have calmed somewhat, and the euro has therefore strengthened against the U.S. dollar. Based on the currently prevailing exchange rates, we expect to achieve a reported diluted EPS for 2010 of $3.75 to $3.85.
This guidance represents a strong growth rate of 16% to 19% compared to $3.24 in 2009 and approximately 14% to 17% excluding currency. Let me now turn to a brief review of our quarterly results.
Cigarette volume in the quarter was 241 billion units, up by 8% on a reported basis and by 0.3% excluding the additional 17.2 billion units generated by our business combination with Fortune Tobacco Corporation in the Philippines. Our shipments in the quarter were also boosted by the buildup of stocks at our distributor in Japan. At the end of June, the inventories at our distributor in Japan were approximately 3.4 billion units higher than at the same time last year.
We expect these stock levels to be sufficient to meet the forecasted higher demand from retailers and consumers ahead of the October tax and price increases. The depletion of these stocks will result in a significant reduction in shipments to Japan in the second half of this year. Finally, we expect the revaluation of inventory sales by our distributor to benefit our income during the fourth quarter of 2010.
Our volume performance in the quarter was achieved thanks to our superior and broad brand portfolio. The volume of our top ten international brands increased by 3.6% helped, of course, by Japan. Not surprisingly, in the current economic environment, our low-priced brands have performed particularly well. In addition, our key premium and mid-priced brands are also performing solidly. Parliament achieved a volume growth of 2.3% in the quarter, with Japan, Korea and Russia more than offsetting the impact of tax-driven consumer down trading in Turkey. Marlboro volume declined by just 0.5%, as higher volumes in North Africa, the Middle East, Japan, Korea and the Philippines largely offset a decline in the EU region, attributable to a continued challenging environment for premium brands.
Chesterfield's vibrancy is confirmed by a 6.2% volume growth in the quarter, despite continued down trading in Spain, one of its key markets. Finally, L&M achieved a favorable volume overall, thanks to growth in Nigeria, Egypt, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Thailand, which compensated for volume declines in Eastern Europe and Turkey. 
Our competitiveness is confirmed by our continued favorable share trends in both OECD and non-OECD markets. I would like, in particular, to highlight our strong performance in Russia. Our market share grew by a further 0.2 share point to 25.5% in the second quarter, thanks mainly to the growth of mid-priced Chesterfield and low-priced Bond Street, as well as the resilient performance from above-premium priced Parliament, the volume of which was up in the quarter. It should be noted that Bond Street is now mostly gaining shares from competitive brands in the same pricing.
Overall, in the second quarter, our volume increased by 4.9%, indicating that the total market is stabilizing. Consumer down trading continues to moderate in Russia, as evidenced by the fact that this year's second quarter 3.3% decline in the sales to the trade of PMI premium brands was the lowest in the last 18 months. 
During the second quarter, we were able to grow our premium volume in several emerging markets, such as Algeria and Indonesia. These economies are generally emerging faster from the economic downturn than those in Europe, where price sensitivity remains high. Increased employment levels remain key to a global resumption of consumer up trading. We are also concerned about the growth of illicit trade in markets that have recently implemented significant excise tax increases, such as Greece, Pakistan, Romania and Turkey. Higher prices in nearly all key markets enabled us to achieve a favorable pricing variance of $341 million in the second quarter. Furthermore, we have just implemented a two-for-three ruble price increase in Russia. 
We learned from the media last Friday that the Ministry of Finance in Japan has approved Japan Tobacco’s application to amend its retail prices this coming October. The new price list represents increases of between JPY 100 and JPY 140 per pack for Japan Tobacco’s key brands, well above the excise tax pass-on of JPY 82 per pack.  PMI’s distributor has also submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for an increase on PMI brands effective in October and awaits their response. 
We were more than able to offset the recent large excise tax in Australia and the higher VAT rate in Spain through higher prices. We are pleased that the Italian government has introduced through a decree a reinforced minimum excise tax system.
In Greece, if we had fully passed on the tax increases, the price gap between Marlboro and the lowest-priced brands would have expanded from EUR 1.20 to EUR 2.45. This would have rendered the brand completely uncompetitive, and therefore, we were forced to partially absorb these tax increases.
Marlboro has nevertheless been under pressure after significantly increasing prices in a difficult economic environment has resulted in consumer down trading and a sharp market contraction.
We have, however, been able to largely offset share losses on Marlboro through the relaunch of L&M, which grew to a market share of 6.1% in June. The unfavorable price volume mix variance in Greece was a considerable drag on the EU region's OCI in the quarter.
PMI's net revenues reached $7.1 billion in the quarter, an increase of 15.1% compared to last year, and a very robust increase of 5.3% excluding currency and acquisitions. Our exit cost management and productivity saving programs are being used to offset the previously communicated increases in leaf and direct material costs. During the second quarter, we were able to grow adjusted OCI by 7.4% excluding currency and acquisitions.
Let me now briefly review our results on a regional basis, starting with the EU region. The net revenues and OCI were down slightly excluding currency. More than 3/4 of our 6.2% volume decline in the EU region is attributable to lower total markets, in particular in Spain, where the market continued to decline at a double-digit rate.
Our year-to-date June cigarette share in Germany of 35.6% is 1.8 share points below the previous year's level but is showing a sequential improvement, and L&M remain the fastest-growing brand on the market.
In the EU region, excluding Greece, our favorable pricing variance in the second quarter was 1.2x our unfavorable volume mix variance. During this period, the share of Marlboro grew notably in Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Slovakia, while L&M increased its share notably in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. 
The EEMA region is expected to be a source of renewed strength for PMI going forward. It had a tremendous second quarter, with volume up 1.6%, net revenues increasing by 8.2%, excluding currency and acquisitions, and OCI, 16.9% higher on the same basis.
As mentioned previously, our business is very strong in Russia, where our profitability in the second half of the year is expected to be enhanced by the recent price increase. We have strong business momentum in North Africa behind both Marlboro and L&M. In Egypt, there has been an important structural improvement in excise taxes, though tax and price levels are now significantly higher than originally expected, which will have an unfavorable near-term impact on market demand. 
The one market of concern is Turkey, where very large excise tax-driven price increases have resulted in a significant market contraction and consumer down trading. However, our market share now appears to have stabilized around 41%, the level prevalent as recently as 2008. And Lark is the fastest-growing brand in Turkey. 
In Asia, volume was 5.2% ahead of last year, excluding acquisition, and essentially stable after taking into account the inventory buildup in Japan. Net revenues were 11.5% higher, and OCI was up by 14.7%, excluding currency and acquisition. We achieved higher prices in unit margins across several markets, in particular, Australia, Indonesia and Pakistan. Our business momentum in Korea continued, with volume growing by 15.9% and market share up by a further three share points to 16.6%.
In Indonesia, our volume decreased slightly, as price increases have slowed the overall market growth, while volume was lower in Pakistan, where the duty-paid market has declined significantly due to tax-driven price increases and the growth of illicit trade.
Asia is the growth engine for Marlboro. The brand gained volume in many markets, including Indonesia, Japan, Korea and the Philippines, and was supported by our Marlboro Fresh initiative, such as Marlboro Black Menthol and Marlboro Ice Blast. 
Volume in Latin America and Canada increased by 0.9%, driven primarily by an increase in the size of the legitimate market in Canada, following more rigorous provincial legislation and most importantly, the improved enforcement. We achieved a slow market share performance with continued gains in Argentina and Mexico. Net revenues increased by 6.1% excluding currency, while adjusted OCI excluding currency was 0.5% higher, as we increased volume and higher prices were partly offset by higher leaf and manufacturing costs.
Adjusted diluted EPS reached $1.00 in the second quarter, a significant increase of 20.5% over 2009 and up by a very robust 16.9% excluding currency. As previously announced in June, reported diluted EPS of $1.07 was boosted in the quarter by a favorable onetime tax item of $0.07 for the reversing of provision, largely due to the completion of U.S. tax audits. 
Our strong business results have fueled a further increase in our operating cash flow, which was 10.1% higher at $3.5 billion. Excluding currency, operating cash flow was up by 6.3%. Free cash flow increased at a slightly faster rate of 11.1%, and by 7.4% excluding currency.
Our financial strength has enabled us to continue to reward our shareholders. In April, we completed our $13 billion share repurchase program on time, and in May, we started a new $12 billion three-year program. In the quarter, we spent $1 billion to purchase an additional 21.7 million shares. Our dividend of $2.32 per share on an annualized basis represented a yield of 4.6% on July 20.
So let me summarize. We again achieved strong financial results this quarter, thanks to an improved volume performance, intact pricing power, driven by our superior brands and broad portfolio and productivity savings that have enabled us to absorb the foreseen increase in leaf cost. These results were achieved despite some additional challenges with regards to excise taxes and VAT. Our improved volume performance is based on our unmatched brand portfolio, though please keep in mind that our quarterly shipments in the second half are expected to be unfavorably impacted by this quarter's inventory buildup at our distributor in Japan.
The new architecture and consumer-relevant product innovation are strengthening the Marlboro franchise. During the second quarter, Marlboro's market share was sequentially up or stable in 21 of our top 30 OCI markets. Since we established our 2010 EPS guidance in June, the euro has strengthened against the U.S. dollar. Consequently, at currently prevailing exchange rates, our positive business momentum should enable us to achieve a reported diluted EPS in 2010 of $3.75 to $3.85.
Compared to 2009, this represents a strong growth rate of 16% to 19%, and approximately 14% to 17% excluding currency. Thank you. I will now be pleased to answer questions you may have."

So therefore, I mean, essentially, it’s at least the $3.4 billion cigarettes numbers to take into account. You will see quite a bit of inventory de-loads because of additional consumer demand but also, of course, also of additional retailer purchases in the third quarter. And then in the fourth quarter will, of course, come also the overall market reaction of consumers, then, to those new prices and that's the harder impact to predict. Essentially, I must say, they’re not really new insights to when we discussed a month ago. The negative remains the high percentage retail price increase. And the positive remains that even in the JPY 400 price range, prices in Japan will still be very affordable, given the purchasing power of the Japanese consumer."

Then more broadly, your Marlboro question I thought was Japan, but your question is broader. I will go to other markets there as well. I mean, in Japan, Marlboro is doing well. It is up 0.2% a share to 10.8%. It has about double the young-adults smokers share than its actual market share. But it's not the only place where we see nice improvements in share increases of Marlboro. Give you a couple of examples: Korea would be up 1.2% share points to 6.8%; Poland would be up 0.7% to 10.2%; the Netherlands is up 0.8% to 34.7%; Italy is up 0.3% to 23%; Argentina, to go into Latin America as well, is up at 0.3% to 23.4%. So there is really good trends in many different places around the world. And we, of course, still also have a couple of places in the world where we have to continue on our work and with the good work that has been done there. The ones where Marlboro is really down is first of all those markets which were really hit by the economy, like Turkey, Greece and Spain. Turkey is down 2.5 share points to 8.1; Greece down 3.7 to 19.3; and Spain is down 0.6 to 14.8. So that is really the economy that drives the down trading in those markets. And then there is Germany, where we now are down to a share of 21.6, which is, however, sequentially stable over the last couple of months. That is not the economy. That is simply an overall price-sensitive market overall, where it’s really a bit more difficult to act. On the other hand, if you are being very successful in that market with L&M, which is our answer to the market situation there."

Then on the Philippines, well, on the volume, this is, of course -- we will separate that out until the year has left and that then this becomes part of the organic and underlying business.

Marlboro is going strong in the market, benefiting from improved distribution, so -- it has a share of market of 21% there. The integration is going really well.

During our call today, we will be talking about results in the second quarter of 2010 and comparing them with the same period in 2009, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are for PMI shipments, industry volume and market shares on the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Net revenue data excludes excise taxes. Acquisitions for the purposes of this presentation also include our business combination with Fortune Tobacco Corporation in the Philippines. 
You'll find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues and operating companies income, or OCI, for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment and exit costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustment to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. 
Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.

I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter, with results in line with the business expectations that we shared with you during our Investor Day last month. At that time, we announced a repo",1973,"Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter, with results in line with the business expectations that we shared with you during our Investor Day last month. At that time, we announced a reported diluted EPS guidance for 2010 of $3.70 to $3.80 based on the same prevailing exchange rate. Since then, concerning surrounding the future of the eurozone have calmed somewhat, and the euro has therefore strengthened against the U.S. dollar. Based on the currently prevailing exchange rates, we expect to achieve a reported diluted EPS for 2010 of $3.75 to $3.85.
This guidance represents a strong growth rate of 16% to 19% compared to $3.24 in 2009 and approximately 14% to 17% excluding currency. Let me now turn to a brief review of our quarterly results.
Cigarette volume in the quarter was 241 billion units, up by 8% on a reported basis and by 0.3% excluding the additional 17.2 billion units generated by our business combination with Fortune Tobacco Corporation in the Philippines. Our shipments in the quarter were also boosted by the buildup of stocks at our distributor in Japan. At the end of June, the inventories at our distributor in Japan were approximately 3.4 billion units higher than at the same time last year.
We expect these stock levels to be sufficient to meet the forecasted higher demand from retailers and consumers ahead of the October tax and price increases. The depletion of these stocks will result in a significant reduction in shipments to Japan in the second half of this year. Finally, we expect the revaluation of inventory sales by our distributor to benefit our income during the fourth quarter of 2010.
Our volume performance in the quarter was achieved thanks to our superior and broad brand portfolio. The volume of our top ten international brands increased by 3.6% helped, of course, by Japan. Not surprisingly, in the current economic environment, our low-priced brands have performed particularly well. In addition, our key premium and mid-priced brands are also performing solidly. Parliament achieved a volume growth of 2.3% in the quarter, with Japan, Korea and Russia more than offsetting the impact of tax-driven consumer down trading in Turkey. Marlboro volume declined by just 0.5%, as higher volumes in North Africa, the Middle East, Japan, Korea and the Philippines largely offset a decline in the EU region, attributable to a continued challenging environment for premium brands.
Chesterfield's vibrancy is confirmed by a 6.2% volume growth in the quarter, despite continued down trading in Spain, one of its key markets. Finally, L&M achieved a favorable volume overall, thanks to growth in Nigeria, Egypt, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Thailand, which compensated for volume declines in Eastern Europe and Turkey. 
Our competitiveness is confirmed by our continued favorable share trends in both OECD and non-OECD markets. I would like, in particular, to highlight our strong performance in Russia. Our market share grew by a further 0.2 share point to 25.5% in the second quarter, thanks mainly to the growth of mid-priced Chesterfield and low-priced Bond Street, as well as the resilient performance from above-premium priced Parliament, the volume of which was up in the quarter. It should be noted that Bond Street is now mostly gaining shares from competitive brands in the same pricing.
Overall, in the second quarter, our volume increased by 4.9%, indicating that the total market is stabilizing. Consumer down trading continues to moderate in Russia, as evidenced by the fact that this year's second quarter 3.3% decline in the sales to the trade of PMI premium brands was the lowest in the last 18 months. 
During the second quarter, we were able to grow our premium volume in several emerging markets, such as Algeria and Indonesia. These economies are generally emerging faster from the economic downturn than those in Europe, where price sensitivity remains high. Increased employment levels remain key to a global resumption of consumer up trading. We are also concerned about the growth of illicit trade in markets that have recently implemented significant excise tax increases, such as Greece, Pakistan, Romania and Turkey. Higher prices in nearly all key markets enabled us to achieve a favorable pricing variance of $341 million in the second quarter. Furthermore, we have just implemented a two-for-three ruble price increase in Russia. 
We learned from the media last Friday that the Ministry of Finance in Japan has approved Japan Tobacco’s application to amend its retail prices this coming October. The new price list represents increases of between JPY 100 and JPY 140 per pack for Japan Tobacco’s key brands, well above the excise tax pass-on of JPY 82 per pack.  PMI’s distributor has also submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for an increase on PMI brands effective in October and awaits their response. 
We were more than able to offset the recent large excise tax in Australia and the higher VAT rate in Spain through higher prices. We are pleased that the Italian government has introduced through a decree a reinforced minimum excise tax system.
In Greece, if we had fully passed on the tax increases, the price gap between Marlboro and the lowest-priced brands would have expanded from EUR 1.20 to EUR 2.45. This would have rendered the brand completely uncompetitive, and therefore, we were forced to partially absorb these tax increases.
Marlboro has nevertheless been under pressure after significantly increasing prices in a difficult economic environment has resulted in consumer down trading and a sharp market contraction.
We have, however, been able to largely offset share losses on Marlboro through the relaunch of L&M, which grew to a market share of 6.1% in June. The unfavorable price volume mix variance in Greece was a considerable drag on the EU region's OCI in the quarter.
PMI's net revenues reached $7.1 billion in the quarter, an increase of 15.1% compared to last year, and a very robust increase of 5.3% excluding currency and acquisitions. Our exit cost management and productivity saving programs are being used to offset the previously communicated increases in leaf and direct material costs. During the second quarter, we were able to grow adjusted OCI by 7.4% excluding currency and acquisitions.
Let me now briefly review our results on a regional basis, starting with the EU region. The net revenues and OCI were down slightly excluding currency. More than 3/4 of our 6.2% volume decline in the EU region is attributable to lower total markets, in particular in Spain, where the market continued to decline at a double-digit rate.
Our year-to-date June cigarette share in Germany of 35.6% is 1.8 share points below the previous year's level but is showing a sequential improvement, and L&M remain the fastest-growing brand on the market.
In the EU region, excluding Greece, our favorable pricing variance in the second quarter was 1.2x our unfavorable volume mix variance. During this period, the share of Marlboro grew notably in Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Slovakia, while L&M increased its share notably in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. 
The EEMA region is expected to be a source of renewed strength for PMI going forward. It had a tremendous second quarter, with volume up 1.6%, net revenues increasing by 8.2%, excluding currency and acquisitions, and OCI, 16.9% higher on the same basis.
As mentioned previously, our business is very strong in Russia, where our profitability in the second half of the year is expected to be enhanced by the recent price increase. We have strong business momentum in North Africa behind both Marlboro and L&M. In Egypt, there has been an important structural improvement in excise taxes, though tax and price levels are now significantly higher than originally expected, which will have an unfavorable near-term impact on market demand. 
The one market of concern is Turkey, where very large excise tax-driven price increases have resulted in a significant market contraction and consumer down trading. However, our market share now appears to have stabilized around 41%, the level prevalent as recently as 2008. And Lark is the fastest-growing brand in Turkey. 
In Asia, volume was 5.2% ahead of last year, excluding acquisition, and essentially stable after taking into account the inventory buildup in Japan. Net revenues were 11.5% higher, and OCI was up by 14.7%, excluding currency and acquisition. We achieved higher prices in unit margins across several markets, in particular, Australia, Indonesia and Pakistan. Our business momentum in Korea continued, with volume growing by 15.9% and market share up by a further three share points to 16.6%.
In Indonesia, our volume decreased slightly, as price increases have slowed the overall market growth, while volume was lower in Pakistan, where the duty-paid market has declined significantly due to tax-driven price increases and the growth of illicit trade.
Asia is the growth engine for Marlboro. The brand gained volume in many markets, including Indonesia, Japan, Korea and the Philippines, and was supported by our Marlboro Fresh initiative, such as Marlboro Black Menthol and Marlboro Ice Blast. 
Volume in Latin America and Canada increased by 0.9%, driven primarily by an increase in the size of the legitimate market in Canada, following more rigorous provincial legislation and most importantly, the improved enforcement. We achieved a slow market share performance with continued gains in Argentina and Mexico. Net revenues increased by 6.1% excluding currency, while adjusted OCI excluding currency was 0.5% higher, as we increased volume and higher prices were partly offset by higher leaf and manufacturing costs.
Adjusted diluted EPS reached $1.00 in the second quarter, a significant increase of 20.5% over 2009 and up by a very robust 16.9% excluding currency. As previously announced in June, reported diluted EPS of $1.07 was boosted in the quarter by a favorable onetime tax item of $0.07 for the reversing of provision, largely due to the completion of U.S. tax audits. 
Our strong business results have fueled a further increase in our operating cash flow, which was 10.1% higher at $3.5 billion. Excluding currency, operating cash flow was up by 6.3%. Free cash flow increased at a slightly faster rate of 11.1%, and by 7.4% excluding currency.
Our financial strength has enabled us to continue to reward our shareholders. In April, we completed our $13 billion share repurchase program on time, and in May, we started a new $12 billion three-year program. In the quarter, we spent $1 billion to purchase an additional 21.7 million shares. Our dividend of $2.32 per share on an annualized basis represented a yield of 4.6% on July 20.
So let me summarize. We again achieved strong financial results this quarter, thanks to an improved volume performance, intact pricing power, driven by our superior brands and broad portfolio and productivity savings that have enabled us to absorb the foreseen increase in leaf cost. These results were achieved despite some additional challenges with regards to excise taxes and VAT. Our improved volume performance is based on our unmatched brand portfolio, though please keep in mind that our quarterly shipments in the second half are expected to be unfavorably impacted by this quarter's inventory buildup at our distributor in Japan.
The new architecture and consumer-relevant product innovation are strengthening the Marlboro franchise. During the second quarter, Marlboro's market share was sequentially up or stable in 21 of our top 30 OCI markets. Since we established our 2010 EPS guidance in June, the euro has strengthened against the U.S. dollar. Consequently, at currently prevailing exchange rates, our positive business momentum should enable us to achieve a reported diluted EPS in 2010 of $3.75 to $3.85.
Compared to 2009, this represents a strong growth rate of 16% to 19%, and approximately 14% to 17% excluding currency. Thank you. I will now be pleased to answer questions you may have.

Turkey is down 2.5 share points to 8.1; Greece down 3.7 to 19.3; and Spain is down 0.6 to 14.8. So that is really the economy that drives the down trading in those markets. And then there is Germany, where we now are down to a share of 21.6, which is, however, sequentially stable over the last couple of months. That is not the economy. That is simply an overall price-sensitive market overall, where it’s really a bit more difficult to act. On the other hand, if you are being very successful in that market with L&M, which is our answer to the market situation there.

I think, together, if enforcement that I, of course, dearly hope will continue to increase, increases should be possible further. It will not be forever 15%, though. Then on the Philippines, well, on the volume, this is, of course -- we will separate that out until the year has left and that then this becomes part of the organic and underlying business. So it will continue until then. For the Philippines itself, maybe let me add a word there. It’s going really well. The market is growing, expected to grow 8% to 10% for the full year. Marlboro is going strong in the market, benefiting from improved distribution, so -- it has a share of market of 21% there. The integration is going really well.

6569181,98000285,68613,"Philip Morris International, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Philip Morris International Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter, with results in line with the business expectations that we shared with you during our Investor Day last month. At that time, we announced a repo",1975,"Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter, with results in line with the business expectations that we shared with you during our Investor Day last month. At that time, we announced a reported diluted EPS guidance for 2010 of $3.70 to $3.80 based on the same prevailing exchange rate. Since then, concerning surrounding the future of the eurozone have calmed somewhat, and the euro has therefore strengthened against the U.S. dollar. Based on the currently prevailing exchange rates, we expect to achieve a reported diluted EPS for 2010 of $3.75 to $3.85.
This guidance represents a strong growth rate of 16% to 19% compared to $3.24 in 2009 and approximately 14% to 17% excluding currency. Let me now turn to a brief review of our quarterly results.
Cigarette volume in the quarter was 241 billion units, up by 8% on a reported basis and by 0.3% excluding the additional 17.2 billion units generated by our business combination with Fortune Tobacco Corporation in the Philippines. Our shipments in the quarter were also boosted by the buildup of stocks at our distributor in Japan. At the end of June, the inventories at our distributor in Japan were approximately 3.4 billion units higher than at the same time last year.
We expect these stock levels to be sufficient to meet the forecasted higher demand from retailers and consumers ahead of the October tax and price increases. The depletion of these stocks will result in a significant reduction in shipments to Japan in the second half of this year. Finally, we expect the revaluation of inventory sales by our distributor to benefit our income during the fourth quarter of 2010.
Our volume performance in the quarter was achieved thanks to our superior and broad brand portfolio. The volume of our top ten international brands increased by 3.6% helped, of course, by Japan. Not surprisingly, in the current economic environment, our low-priced brands have performed particularly well. In addition, our key premium and mid-priced brands are also performing solidly. Parliament achieved a volume growth of 2.3% in the quarter, with Japan, Korea and Russia more than offsetting the impact of tax-driven consumer down trading in Turkey. 
Marlboro volume declined by just 0.5%, as higher volumes in North Africa, the Middle East, Japan, Korea and the Philippines largely offset a decline in the EU region, attributable to a continued challenging environment for premium brands.  Chesterfield's vibrancy is confirmed by a 6.2% volume growth in the quarter, despite continued down trading in Spain, one of its key markets. Finally, L&M achieved a favorable volume overall, thanks to growth in Nigeria, Egypt, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Thailand, which compensated for volume declines in Eastern Europe and Turkey.
Our competitiveness is confirmed by our continued favorable share trends in both OECD and non-OECD markets. I would like, in particular, to highlight our strong performance in Russia. Our market share grew by a further 0.2 share point to 25.5% in the second quarter, thanks mainly to the growth of mid-priced Chesterfield and low-priced Bond Street, as well as the resilient performance from above-premium priced Parliament, the volume of which was up in the quarter. It should be noted that Bond Street is now mostly gaining shares from competitive brands in the same pricing.
Overall, in the second quarter, our volume increased by 4.9%, indicating that the total market is stabilizing. Consumer down trading continues to moderate in Russia, as evidenced by the fact that this year's second quarter 3.3% decline in the sales to the trade of PMI premium brands was the lowest in the last 18 months.
During the second quarter, we were able to grow our premium volume in several emerging markets, such as Algeria and Indonesia. These economies are generally emerging faster from the economic downturn than those in Europe, where price sensitivity remains high. Increased employment levels remain key to a global resumption of consumer up trading. We are also concerned about the growth of illicit trade in markets that have recently implemented significant excise tax increases, such as Greece, Pakistan, Romania and Turkey. Higher prices in nearly all key markets enabled us to achieve a favorable pricing variance of $341 million in the second quarter. Furthermore, we have just implemented a 2 to 3 ruble price increase in Russia.
We learned from the media last Friday that the Ministry of Finance in Japan has approved Japan Tobacco’s application to amend its retail prices this coming October. The new price list represents increases of between JPY 100 and JPY 140 per pack for Japan Tobacco’s key brands, well above the excise tax pass-on of JPY 82 per pack.  PMI’s distributor has also submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for an increase on PMI brands effective in October and awaits their response.
We were more than able to offset the recent large excise tax in Australia and the higher VAT rate in Spain through higher prices. We are pleased that the Italian government has introduced through a decree a reinforced minimum excise tax system.
In Greece, if we had fully passed on the tax increases, the price gap between Marlboro and the lowest-priced brands would have expanded from EUR 1.20 to EUR 2.45. This would have rendered the brand completely uncompetitive, and therefore, we were forced to partially absorb these tax increases.
Marlboro has nevertheless been under pressure after significantly increasing prices in a difficult economic environment has resulted in consumer down trading and a sharp market contraction. We have, however, been able to largely offset share losses on Marlboro through the relaunch of L&M, which grew to a market share of 6.1% in June. The unfavorable price volume mix variance in Greece was a considerable drag on the EU region's OCI in the quarter.
PMI's net revenues reached $7.1 billion in the quarter, an increase of 15.1% compared to last year, and a very robust increase of 5.3% excluding currency and acquisitions. Our exit cost management and productivity saving programs are being used to offset the previously communicated increases in leaf and direct material costs. During the second quarter, we were able to grow adjusted OCI by 7.4% excluding currency and acquisitions.
Let me now briefly review our results on a regional basis, starting with the EU region. The net revenues and OCI were down slightly excluding currency. More than 3/4 of our 6.2% volume decline in the EU region is attributable to lower total markets, in particular in Spain, where the market continued to decline at a double-digit rate.
Our year-to-date June cigarette share in Germany of 35.6% is 1.8 share points below the previous year's level but is showing a sequential improvement, and L&M remain the fastest-growing brand on the market.
In the EU region, excluding Greece, our favorable pricing variance in the second quarter was 1.2x our unfavorable volume mix variance. During this period, the share of Marlboro grew notably in Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Slovakia, while L&M increased its share notably in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
The EEMA region is expected to be a source of renewed strength for PMI going forward. It had a tremendous second quarter, with volume up 1.6%, net revenues increasing by 8.2%, excluding currency and acquisitions, and OCI, 16.9% higher on the same basis.
As mentioned previously, our business is very strong in Russia, where our profitability in the second half of the year is expected to be enhanced by the recent price increase. We have strong business momentum in North Africa behind both Marlboro and L&M. In Egypt, there has been an important structural improvement in excise taxes, though tax and price levels are now significantly higher than originally expected, which will have an unfavorable near-term impact on market demand.
The one market of concern is Turkey, where very large excise tax-driven price increases have resulted in a significant market contraction and consumer down trading. However, our market share now appears to have stabilized around 41%, the level prevalent as recently as 2008. And Lark is the fastest-growing brand in Turkey.
In Asia, volume was 5.2% ahead of last year, excluding acquisition, and essentially stable after taking into account the inventory buildup in Japan. Net revenues were 11.5% higher, and OCI was up by 14.7%, excluding currency and acquisition. We achieved higher prices in unit margins across several markets, in particular, Australia, Indonesia and Pakistan. Our business momentum in Korea continued, with volume growing by 15.9% and market share up by a further three share points to 16.6%.
In Indonesia, our volume decreased slightly, as price increases have slowed the overall market growth, while volume was lower in Pakistan, where the duty-paid market has declined significantly due to tax-driven price increases and the growth of illicit trade.
Asia is the growth engine for Marlboro. The brand gained volume in many markets, including Indonesia, Japan, Korea and the Philippines, and was supported by our Marlboro Fresh initiative, such as Marlboro Black Menthol and Marlboro Ice Blast.
Volume in Latin America and Canada increased by 0.9%, driven primarily by an increase in the size of the legitimate market in Canada, following more rigorous provincial legislation and most importantly, the improved enforcement. We achieved a slow market share performance with continued gains in Argentina and Mexico. Net revenues increased by 6.1% excluding currency, while adjusted OCI excluding currency was 0.5% higher, as we increased volume and higher prices were partly offset by higher leaf and manufacturing costs.
Adjusted diluted EPS reached $1.00 in the second quarter, a significant increase of 20.5% over 2009 and up by a very robust 16.9% excluding currency. As previously announced in June, reported diluted EPS of $1.07 was boosted in the quarter by a favorable onetime tax item of $0.07 for the reversing of provision, largely due to the completion of U.S. tax audits.
Our strong business results have fueled a further increase in our operating cash flow, which was 10.1% higher at $3.5 billion. Excluding currency, operating cash flow was up by 6.3%. Free cash flow increased at a slightly faster rate of 11.1%, and by 7.4% excluding currency.
Our financial strength has enabled us to continue to reward our shareholders. In April, we completed our $13 billion share repurchase program on time, and in May, we started a new $12 billion three-year program. In the quarter, we spent $1 billion to purchase an additional 21.7 million shares. Our dividend of $2.32 per share on an annualized basis represented a yield of 4.6% on July 20.
So let me summarize. We again achieved strong financial results this quarter, thanks to an improved volume performance, intact pricing power, driven by our superior brands and broad portfolio and productivity savings that have enabled us to absorb the foreseen increase in leaf cost. These results were achieved despite some additional challenges with regards to excise taxes and VAT. Our improved volume performance is based on our unmatched brand portfolio, though please keep in mind that our quarterly shipments in the second half are expected to be unfavorably impacted by this quarter's inventory buildup at our distributor in Japan.
The new architecture and consumer-relevant product innovation are strengthening the Marlboro franchise. During the second quarter, Marlboro's market share was sequentially up or stable in 21 of our top 30 OCI markets. Since we established our 2010 EPS guidance in June, the euro has strengthened against the U.S. dollar. Consequently, at currently prevailing exchange rates, our positive business momentum should enable us to achieve a reported diluted EPS in 2010 of $3.75 to $3.85. Compared to 2009, this represents a strong growth rate of 16% to 19%, and approximately 14% to 17% excluding currency.

So that is a clear, clear sequential improvement. Let's see how it shakes out going forward. Overall, measured unemployment in Russia is down to 7.3%. It's the last May year-to-date number I have seen. That was 8.4% before. So it's substantial improvement.

Then more broadly, your Marlboro question I thought was Japan, but your question is broader. I will go to other markets there as well. I mean, in Japan, Marlboro is doing well. It is up 0.2% a share to 10.8%. It has about double the young-adults smokers share than its actual market share. But it's not the only place where we see nice improvements in share increases of Marlboro. Give you a couple of examples: Korea would be up 1.2% share points to 6.8%; Poland would be up 0.7% to 10.2%; the Netherlands is up 0.8% to 34.7%; Italy is up 0.3% to 23%; Argentina, to go into Latin America as well, is up at 0.3% to 23.4%. So there is really good trends in many different places around the world. And we, of course, still also have a couple of places in the world where we have to continue on our work and with the good work that has been done there. The ones where Marlboro is really down is first of all those markets which were really hit by the economy, like Turkey, Greece and Spain. Turkey is down 2.5 share points to 8.1; Greece down 3.7 to 19.3; and Spain is down 0.6 to 14.8. So that is really the economy that drives the down trading in those markets. And then there is Germany, where we now are down to a share of 21.6, which is, however, sequentially stable over the last couple of months. That is not the economy. That is simply an overall price-sensitive market overall, where it’s really a bit more difficult to act. On the other hand, if you are being very successful in that market with L&M, which is our answer to the market situation there."

Marlboro is going strong in the market, benefiting from improved distribution, so -- it has a share of market of 21% there. The integration is going really well.

As anticipated, our third quarter results were adversely impacted by various timing issues, in particular, relating to Japan. More than half of our organic volume decline in the quarter was attributable",2551,"Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. As anticipated, our third quarter results were adversely impacted by various timing issues, in particular, relating to Japan. More than half of our organic volume decline in the quarter was attributable to the payback for the previously disclosed 3.4 billion unit build up of stocks at our distributor in Japan during the second quarter this year. The lower sales to Japan also drove an unfavorable geographic mix in the quarter. We do, however, remain very competitive in this important market. The Marlboro is growing share behind innovative plan extensions such as Marlboro Black Menthol and Marlboro Ice Blast, which reached the combined market share of 2% in the quarter. 
We continue to face a difficult environment in both Greece and Turkey, resulting from the significant tax increases that occurred earlier this year. Industry volume in these markets was down by 8% and 6% respectively in the third quarter. And dividing of price [ph] has led to consumer down trading and an unfavorable product mix. 
These three issues masked and underwrites strong underlying business performance. I would like to mention in particular the good results of Marlboro, driven by the new architecture and innovative line extensions. The market share of Marlboro was higher or stable in the third quarter across all four of our regions. 
A notable highlight of the quarter was our continued strong cash flow performance, with operating cash flow increasing by more than 30% in the quarter. This allowed us to accelerate the implementation of our share repurchase program and to increase our dividend by 10.3% in September.
Indeed, the strength of our underlying business along with more favorable exchange rates and the lower tax rate has led us to raise and narrow our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2010 to a range of $3.90 to $3.95. This represents our reported diluted EPS growth rate of approximately 20% to 22% compared to the $3.24 achieved last year. Excluding currency, the growth rate in our guidance is now approximately 16% to 18% compared to 14% to 17%, projected previously.
Our cigarette volume in the quarter increased by 4.5% to 229.2 billion units, driven by a successful business combination with Fortune Tobacco in the Philippines. Excluding acquisitions, our volume declines by 2.9% or 6.3 billion units. In addition to Japan, Ukraine contributed 2.6 billion units to this decline, reflecting both the timing of shipments and market contraction, following a series of tax-driven price increases. Our volume was also unfavorably influenced by lower industry volumes in such markets as Greece, Poland, Spain and Turkey. 
On a year-to-date basis, our organic volume was down by 1.6% or 10.5 billion units. The decline was driven in particular by Turkey and Ukraine, whose combined volume was down 10.1 billion units, as well as by Greece and Spain. Our volume in number of important emerging markets, including Algeria, Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico and Russia has, however, increased this year. 
Our net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions were down slightly in the quarter, impacted in particular by the timing of shipments to Japan, the need to partially absorb Texas and lower volumes in Greece, lower volumes and an unfavorable mix in Turkey and the netting [ph] of last year's price increase in Germany.  On a year-to-date basis, our net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, are up 3.6%. 
Our OCI in the third quarter was unfavorably impacted by two timing effects and difficult comparisons, namely, the aforementioned timing of Japanese shipments and pricing, as well as the tax-driven industry volume declines and unfavorable mix in Greece and Turkey and lower industry volumes in Spain and Ukraine. 
During the third quarter last year, we achieved a record pricing variance of $590 million. Our pricing variance in the third quarter this year was $292 million, as we notably lapped price increases in Germany and Turkey and were obliged to partially absorb higher taxes in Greece. Consequently, we were not able to fully offset the lower volume and unfavorable geographic mix in this quarter and adjusted OCI declined by 1.7%, excluding currency and acquisition, while adjusted diluted EPS grew at a slower rate of 5.4% excluding currency. 
On a year-to-date basis, adjusted OCI increased by 4.5%, excluding currency and acquisitions. These results were impacted by lower volumes, the skew of our pricing variance this year towards the fourth quarter and higher costs, which we were able to partially offset throughout productivity program. 
As previously disclosed, tobacco leaf prices increases are expected to have an impact of around $215 million for the full year 2010. In addition, we have increased our investments in marketing, sales, R&D and infrastructure. Going forward, we expect tobacco leaf prices increases to be broadly in line with inflation, and we will continue our rigorous focus on cost controls and productivity gains.  
Our adjusted diluted EPS for this year was 12.5%, excluding currency. The underlying strength of our business and favorable pricing prospects are the basis for our confidence in our full year guidance. 
We expect to reap the benefits in the fourth quarter of recently implemented price increases in Argentina, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Russia and the U.K. In addition, we have announced a price increase of EUR 0.30 across our portfolio in France, higher prices as of next month in Poland and have filed for a price increase with the customs authorities in Portugal. 
Furthermore, we build benefits substantially in the fourth quarter from the revaluation of the inventories at our distributor in Japan. This represents the increased margin on our future sales to the trade, but from an accounting perspective, was taken in October in one go due to our import structure in this market. We therefore expect our pricing variance in the fourth quarter this year to be significantly higher than in the third quarter. 
Our underlying business performed strongly in the third quarter with share gain for the company and for Marlboro in the EU region and good share momentum across all regions. PMI achieved year-on-year or sequential share growth notably in Nigeria, Argentina, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, The Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Spain and Turkey.
A key driver of our improved business momentum has been the successful rollout of the new Marlboro architecture. In the third quarter, the share of Marlboro increased, almost stable, in all four of our regions. The market share of Marlboro in the EU region grew by over two points in the third quarter to 18.4%. The solid performance is notably in Belgium, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland and Spain. In the highly price-sensitive German market, Marlboro's recovery is being hampered by a revenue of price gaps. In Greece, consumers have been down-trading due to steep price increases and in large price gaps in a difficult economic environments.
L&M is the second best selling cigarette brand in the EU region after Marlboro. It's strong momentum continued in the third quarter. There's market share growth notably in Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Slovakia. For the region as a whole, L&M grew 0.6 share points to 6.3%. 
Outside the EU region, Marlboro is performing very strongly, with market share gains across a wide range of different geographies. Marlboro volume increased by 9.8% in Asia, excluding Japan, was up 0.8% in the Latin America and Canada region and was down only marginally in the region. 
Let me now turn to our momentum in key markets, starting with the EU region. In the third quarter, total industry volume was down 5.5%, driven primarily by the recession-related, double-digit decline of the Spanish market. The combination of price elasticity this year and trade purchase patents last year in the Polish market and the impact of higher prices and the economic crisis in Greece. Our total market share in the EU region increased by 0.2 points in the third quarter to 39.1% behind an overall solid performance across our main markets. 
In Greece, our market share is increasing sequentially as the growth of L&M has more than offset the decline in Marlboro. To maintain the competitiveness of Marlboro, we were obliged to partially absorb tax increases that occurred earlier this year. We expect that the Greek markets will continue to act as a drag on our regional profitability growth into the beginning of next year while discussions on structural changes to the excise tax system continue.
We increased our shipment volume in the very important Russian market by 1.4% in the third quarter to a record level of 25.4 billion units. The strong performance was driven by above premium parliament, mid-priced Chesterfield and low-priced Bond Street and mixed. PMI implemented price increases of two to three rubles per pack in July. The market is stabilizing overall and consumer down-trading continues to slow. 
Industry volumes during the third quarter in Ukraine is estimated to have been down about 15%, reflecting the size of trade purchases in June, ahead of the latest tax increases, and a market contraction, resulting from continuous price increases over the last two years. Our volume declined by 2.6 billion units or about one quarter. Premium Marlboro and mid-priced Chesterfield gain share, but we shed share at the low end of the markets. The improved mix and higher prices enabled us to strongly increase our profitability in Ukraine during the third quarter.
While the decline slowed in the third quarter, industry volume in Turkey was still down by about 6% year-over-year. As consumers have switched to contraband cigarettes and loose tobacco, following the very large tax-driven price increases earlier this year. Though our volume and product mix remains unfavorable compared to last year, our market share in Turkey is starting to improve sequentially, which makes us optimistic that the outlook will be better next year after a difficult 2010. 
While our shipments to Japan in the third quarter were 3.5 billion units below the prior year, sales by our distributor to the trade rose by 4 billion units or 27.3%. We estimate that the retail trade build up about 10 days of additional stock and consumers purchased some three weeks of stock ahead of the October, 2010 retail price increases. Consequently, retail sales this month have been very limited, and we will only be able to see the consumers' reaction to the higher prices towards the end of the quarter and during the first part of next year. 
Let me remind you that the retails and implants for cigarettes grew very significantly this month with a 37.5 increase for Marlboro. While the price increases are unprecedented in their magnitude and take place in a deflationary environment, cigarettes remain relatively affordable, and therefore, we are optimistic that our profitability will be enhanced going forward. 
Industry volume in Indonesia grew by a further 3.9% in the quarter, broadly in line with the annual trends. Our shipments were up 3.1% in the third quarter despite the temporarily unfavorable impact on A Mild, as the leading brand in Indonesia of costing through the 10,000 rupiah per pack price point. Our overall market share was down 0.2 points, while our profitability in Indonesia grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter, thanks to higher prices and the current volumes.
In Korea, PMI volume increased by 9.7% in the third quarter and our market share grew by 2.4 points to 17%, thanks in particular to Marlboro and Parliament, whose growth in recent quarters in Korea has been nothing less than spectacular. Meanwhile, as sales fair in the world [ph], PMI continues to have looked at the adoption of a system of regular, moderate excise tax increases. 
In the Latin America and Canada region, overall industry volume in key markets was essentially stable in the quarter. The Canadian market grew by 4.2% a slower pace that reflects the fact that we have left the period last year, when the provincial authorities in Québec and Ontario started to increase their enforcement against contraband sales. The markets in Argentina and Mexico were down slightly. Our strong growth, share growth, continued in the quarter in the key markets of Argentina and Mexico. In the latter, Marlboro continued to grow share and has now captured nearly half the market, helped by the rollout of the new architecture. 
Excluding currency and acquisitions, OCI in the quarter was up 2.2%, driven by higher pricing that was partially offset by lower volumes and an unfavorable mix in Canada. The low-priced brands have become more prominent, following the decline in the elicit trade. In the fourth quarter, profitability will be enhanced by the recently announced retail price increase of peso in Argentina. 
Our working capital reduction program is reinforcing our tremendous cash flow generation. In the third quarter this year, our operating cash flow was 30.9% higher at $2.4 billion. Excluding currency, operating cash flow was up by 43.6%. Free cash flow increased at a slightly faster rate or 33.6% and 47.4%, excluding currency. 
On a year-to-date basis, our operating cash flow has reached $7.9 billion for a cumulative total of $23.7 billion since the beginning of 2008. With one quarter to go, we have already surpassed the $27 billion cumulative three-year operating cash flow target that we established at the spin by nearly 10%.
Our financial strength enables us to generously reward our shareholders. Thanks to the continued strong growth of our cash flow, we have increased our allocations for share repurchases for the full year to $5 billion, accelerating the rate of purchases this year under our previously approved program by $1 billion more than originally foreseen. 
In the third quarter we spent $1.1 billion to purchase an additional 20.7 million shares and has spent $3.9 billion in all so far this year to buy 78.5 million shares.  In September, we increased our quarterly dividend by 10.3% to $0.64 a share, an annualized rate of $2.56. In fact, since the March 2008 spin, we have raised our dividend by 39% and our dividend yield stands at 4.5%.
So let me now summarize. By the belief, we continue to be an attractive investment opportunity. We have strong business momentum going into the fourth quarter, and we'll benefit from higher margins to Japan as well as price increases in Argentina, France, Indonesia, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Russia and the UK. We also have a more favorable currency tailwind and previously factored into our forecast and a lower tax rate. 
Consequently, we are raising in net earnings. Our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2010 to a range of $3.90 to $3.95. Compared to 2009, this represents a strong growth rate of approximately 20% to 22%. 
We have market leadership and are growing volume and overall share in emerging markets. Marlboro is performing well behind its new brand architecture and innovative plan extensions, with overall share up in EU regions in the third quarter and either increasing or stable in our three other regions. 
Our pricing power remains strong due to our brand leadership and broad portfolio. The outlook for costs going forward is improving. Our growing cash flow has enabled us to accelerate our share repurchase program this year to a total spending target of $5 billion. And we raised our dividend by 10.3% in September, thus providing effective returns to our shareholders. Thank you. I will now be pleased to answer any questions you may have."

I mean, the first one, adjusted growth rates. So, let's put it this way. Japan alone is about a four percentage points drag in PMI's results in the quarter, and Greece and Turkey together would add another two percentage points. But actually, maybe an even better way to answer your question is really to look at OCI margins, because in the third quarter, the overall PMI ex currency and acquisition is negative. There are so many distortions in there that I would rather say why don't you look at September year-to-date. There are only, actually, Asia, then would still show a negative OCI example currency development of minus 2.9%. In Asia then, you have two things in there which is of course, first, the Philippines, which is what I call a welcome dilution effect of the margin, because the Philippines is of course, a new basis for future growth. So if you then take that one out, then Asia ex currency and next acquisition would be down minus 15 3 and would be the only region that you have negative OCI margin developments. Well, now as we were just talking, we found new margins based on revaluation effect in the fourth quarter. Also Asia is going to turn positive by year end, and all four regions, in my opinion, will show positive OCI margin increases even excluding currency and acquisitions. So that is another way of looking at it and is another way of demonstrating that the fundamentals are in very good shape."

The government is now studying that situation, and we remain confident that they will recognize and then eventually legal exposure and finally listen to the common sense arguments there that the combination of high prices, product display packaging will do nothing else but facilitate illicit business of criminals, so much on Australia. then on more general pricing question. It always is the situation that we really taken the market-by-market basis. Our price increases in Russia would have been clearly above inflation. In Indonesia, we've just been slightly above inflation. So it is, like always, there is really no general answer. I can't give a generalized answer. It is on the market-by-market basis depending on what is the competitive situation, what is the purchasing power, what are the unemployment into the market, what else is happening, what is the consumer confidence level in the markets. So these are all elements that go into it. So I only can give you examples for the past four key markets like Indonesia and Russia."

As anticipated, our third quarter results were adversely impacted by various timing issues, in particular relating to Japan. More than half our organic volume decline in the quarter was attributable to the payback for the previously disclosed 3.4 billion unit build-up of stocks at our distributor in Japan during the second quarter this year. The lower sales to Japan also drove an unfavorable geographic mix in the quarter.
We do, however, remain very competitive in this important market, where Marlboro is growing share behind innovative line extensions, such as Marlboro Black Menthol and Marlboro Ice Blast, which reached a combined market share of 2% in the quarter.
We continued to face a difficult environment in both Greece and Turkey, resulting from the significant tax increases that occurred earlier this year. Industry volume in these markets was down by 8% and 6%, respectively, in the third quarter, and the widening of price gaps has led to consumer downtrading and an unfavorable product mix.
These three issues masked an otherwise strong underlying business performance. I would like to mention in particular the good results of Marlboro, driven by the new architecture and innovative line extensions. The market share of Marlboro was higher or stable in the third quarter across all four of our regions.
A notable highlight of the quarter was our continued strong cash flow performance, with operating cash flow increasing by more than 30% in the third quarter. This allowed us to accelerate the implementation of our share repurchase program and to increase our dividend by 10.3% in September.
Indeed the strength of our underlying business, along with more favorable exchange rates and a lower tax rate, has led us to raise and narrow our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2010 to a range of $3.90 to $3.95. This represents a reported diluted EPS growth rate of approximately 20% to 22%, compared to the $3.24 achieved last year. Excluding currency, the growth rate in our guidance is now approximately 16% to 18% compared to 14% to 17% projected previously.
Our cigarette volume in the quarter increased by 4.5% to 229.2 billion units, driven by our successful business combination with Fortune Tobacco in the Philippines. Excluding acquisitions, our volume declined by 2.9%, or 6.3 billion units.
In addition to Japan, Ukraine contributed 2.6 billion units to this decline, reflecting both the timing of shipments and market contraction following a series of tax-driven price increases. Our volume was also unfavorably influenced by lower industry volumes in such markets as Greece, Poland, Spain, and Turkey.
On a year-to-date basis, our organic volume was down by 1.6% or 10.5 billion units. The decline was driven in particular by Turkey and Ukraine, whose combined volume was down 10.1 billion units, as well as by Greece and Spain. Our volume in a number of important emerging markets, including Algeria, Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, and Russia has, however, increased this year.
Our net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, were down slightly in the quarter, impacted in particular by the timing of shipments to Japan, the need to partially absorb taxes and lower volumes in Greece, lower volumes and an unfavorable mix in Turkey, and the lapping of last year’s price increase in Germany. On a year-to-date basis, our net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, are up 3.6%.
Our OCI in the third quarter was unfavorably impacted by two timing effects and difficult comparisons, namely the aforementioned timing of Japanese shipments and pricing, as well as the tax-driven industry volume declines and unfavorable mix in Greece and Turkey, and lower industry volumes in Spain and Ukraine.
During the third quarter last year, we achieved a record pricing variance of $590 million. Our pricing variance in the third quarter this year was $292 million, as we notably lapped price increases in Germany and Turkey, and were obliged to partially absorb higher taxes in Greece. Consequently, we were not able to fully offset the lower volume and unfavorable geographic mix in this quarter, and adjusted OCI declined by 1.7%, excluding currency and acquisitions, while adjusted diluted EPS grew at the slower rate of 5.4%, excluding currency.
On a year-to-date basis, adjusted OCI increased by 4.5%, excluding currency and acquisitions. These results were impacted by lower volumes, the skew of our pricing variance this year towards the fourth quarter, and higher costs, which we were able to partially offset through our productivity program.
As previously disclosed, tobacco leaf price increases are expected to have an impact of around $215 million for the full year 2010. In addition, we have increased our investments in marketing, sales, R&D and infrastructure. Going forward, we expect tobacco leaf price increases to be broadly in line with inflation and we will continue our rigorous focus on cost controls and productivity gains. Our adjusted diluted EPS growth so far this year was 12.5%, excluding currency.
The underlying strength of our business and favorable pricing prospects are the basis for our confidence in our full year guidance.
We expect to reap the benefit in the fourth quarter of recently implemented price increases in Argentina, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Russia and the U.K. In addition, we have announced a price increase of EUR0.30 across our portfolio in France, higher prices as of next month in Poland, and have filed for a price increase with the customs authorities in Portugal.
Furthermore, we will benefit substantially in the fourth quarter from the revaluation of the inventories at our distributor in Japan. This represents the increased margin on our future sales to the trade, but from an accounting perspective was taken in October in one go due to our import structure in this market. We therefore expect our pricing variance in the fourth quarter this year to be significantly higher than in the third quarter.
Our underlying business performed strongly in the third quarter, with a share gain for the company and for Marlboro in the EU region, and good share momentum across all regions. PMI achieved year-on-year or sequential share growth notably in Algeria, Argentina, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Spain, and Turkey.
A key driver of our improved business momentum has been the successful rollout of the new Marlboro architecture. In the third quarter, the share of Marlboro increased or was stable in all four of our regions.
The market share of Marlboro in the EU region grew by 0.2 points in the third quarter to 18.4%, with solid performances notably in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain. In the highly price-sensitive German market, Marlboro’s recovery is being hampered by a widening of price gaps. In Greece, consumers have been downtrading due to steep price increases and enlarged price gaps in a difficult economic environment.
L&M is the second best selling cigarette brand in the EU region after Marlboro. Its strong momentum continued in the third quarter, with market share growth notably in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, and Slovakia. For the region as a whole, L&M grew by 0.6 share points to 6.3%.
Outside the EU region, Marlboro is performing very strongly, with market share gains across a wide range of different geographies. Marlboro volume increased by 9.8% in Asia, excluding Japan, was up 0.8% in the Latin America and Canada region, and was down only marginally in the EEMA region.
Let me now turn to our momentum in key markets, starting with the EU region. In the third quarter, total industry volume was down 5.5%, driven primarily by the recession-related double-digit decline of the Spanish market, the combination of price elasticity this year and trade purchase patterns last year in the Polish market, and the impact of higher prices and the economic crisis in Greece. Our total market share in the EU region increased by 0.2 points in the third quarter to 39.1%, behind an overall solid performance across our main markets.
In Greece, our market share is increasing sequentially, as the growth of L&M has more than offset the decline in Marlboro. To maintain the competitiveness of Marlboro, we were obliged to partially absorb tax increases that occurred earlier this year. We expect that the Greek market will continue to act as a drag on our regional profitability growth into the beginning of next year, while discussions on structural changes to the excise tax system continue.
We increased our shipment volume in the very important Russian market by 1.4% in the third quarter to a record level of 25.4 billion units. This strong performance was driven by above premium Parliament, mid-price Chesterfield and low-price Bond Street and Next. PMI implemented price increases of 2 to 3 Rubles per pack in July. The market is stabilizing overall and consumer downtrading continues to slow.
Industry volume during the third quarter in Ukraine is estimated to have been down about 15%, reflecting the size of trade purchases in June ahead of the latest tax increases, and a market contraction resulting from continuous price increases over the last two years. Our volume declined by 2.6 billion units, or about one quarter. Premium Marlboro and mid-price Chesterfield gained share, but we shed share at the low end of the market. The improved mix and higher prices enabled us to strongly increase our profitability in Ukraine during the third quarter.
While the decline slowed in the third quarter, industry volume in Turkey was still down by about 6% year-on-year, as consumers have switched to contraband cigarettes and loose tobacco, following the very large tax-driven price increases earlier this year. Though our volume and product mix remains unfavorable compared to last year, our market share in Turkey is starting to improve sequentially, which makes us optimistic that the outlook will be better next year after a difficult 2010.
While our shipments to Japan in the third quarter were 3.5 billion units below the prior year, sales by our distributor to the trade rose by 4 billion units, or 27.3%. We estimate that the retail trade built up about 10 days of additional stock and consumers purchased some three weeks of stock ahead of the October 2010 retail price increase. Consequently, retail sales this month have been very limited and we will only be able to see the consumers’ reaction to the higher prices towards the end of the quarter and during the first part of next year.
Let me remind you that the retail selling price for cigarettes grew very significantly this month, with a 37.5% increase for Marlboro. While the price increases are unprecedented in their magnitude and take place in a deflationary environment, cigarettes remain relatively affordable and, therefore, we are optimistic that our profitability will be enhanced going forward.
Industry volume in Indonesia grew by a further 3.9% in the quarter, broadly in line with the annual trend. Our shipments were up 3.1% in the third quarter, despite the temporarily unfavorable impact on A Mild, the leading brand in Indonesia, of passing through the 10,000 Rupiah per pack price point. Our overall market share was down 0.2 points, while our profitability in Indonesia grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter, thanks to higher prices and the growing volumes.
In Korea, PMI volume increased by 9.7% in the third quarter, and our market share grew by 2.4 points to 17%, thanks in particular to Marlboro and Parliament, whose growth in recent quarters in Korea has been nothing less than spectacular. Meanwhile, as elsewhere in the world, PMI continues to advocate for the adoption of a system of regular, moderate excise tax increases.
In the Latin America and Canada region, overall industry volume in key markets was essentially stable in the quarter. The Canadian market grew by 4.2%, a slower pace that reflects the fact that we have lapped the period last year when the provincial authorities in Quebec and Ontario started to increase their enforcement against contraband sales. The markets in Argentina and Mexico were down slightly. Our strong share growth continued in the quarter in the key markets of Argentina and Mexico. In the latter, Marlboro continued to grow share and has now captured nearly half the market, helped by the rollout of the new architecture.
Excluding currency and acquisitions, OCI in the quarter was up 2.2%, driven by higher pricing that was partly offset by lower volumes and an unfavorable mix in Canada, where low-price brands have become more prominent following the decline in the illicit trade. In the fourth quarter, profitability will be enhanced by the recently announced retail price increase of 0.5 Peso in Argentina.
Our working capital reduction program is reinforcing our tremendous cash flow generation. In the third quarter this year, our operating cash flow was 30.9% higher at $2.4 billion. Excluding currency, operating cash flow was up by 43.6%. Free cash flow increased at the slightly faster rates of 33.6%, and 47.4% excluding currency.
On a year-to-date basis, our operating cash flow has reached $7.9 billion, for a cumulative total of $23.7 billion since the beginning of 2008. With one quarter to go, we have already surpassed the $21.7 billion cumulative three-year operating cash flow target that we established at the spin by nearly 10%.
Our financial strength enables us to generously reward our shareholders. Thanks to the continued strong growth of our cash flow, we have increased our allocation for share repurchases for the full year to $5 billion, accelerating the rate of purchases this year under our previously approved program by $1 billion more than originally foreseen. In the third quarter, we spent $1.1 billion to purchase an additional 20.7 million shares and have spent $3.9 billion in all so far this year to buy 78.5 million shares.
In September, we increased our quarterly dividend by 10.3% to $0.64 a share, an annualized rate of $2.56. In fact, since the March 2008 spin, we have raised our dividend by 39% and our dividend yield stands at 4.5%.
So let me now summarize why we believe we continue to be an attractive investment opportunity.
We have strong business momentum going into the fourth quarter, and will benefit from higher margins in Japan, as well as price increases in Argentina, France, Indonesia, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Russia, and the U.K. We also have a more favorable currency tailwind than previously factored into our forecast and a lower tax rate. Consequently, we are raising and narrowing our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2010 to a range of $3.90 to $3.95. Compared to 2009, this represents a strong growth rate of approximately 20% to 22%.
We have market leadership and are growing volume and overall share in emerging markets. Marlboro is performing well behind its new brand architecture and innovative line extensions, with overall share up in the EU region in the third quarter, and either increasing or stable in our three other regions.
Our pricing power remains strong due to our brand leadership and broad portfolio. The outlook for costs going forward is improving. Our growing cash flow has enabled us to accelerate our share repurchase program this year to a total spending target of $5 billion, and we raised our dividend by 10.3% in September, thus providing attractive returns to our shareholders.
Thank you. I will now be pleased to answer any questions you may have.

So, now what's coming in now is really the additional margin on the stock at the distributor which we have. That additional margin that is made on the inventories at the retail stays with the retailer. That's the only thing there.

Japan alone is about a 4 percentage point drag on PMI's results in the quarter. And Greece and Turkey together would add another 2 percentage points.
But actually - maybe an even better way to answer your question is really to look at OCI margins, because in the third quarter there is the overall PMI ex currency and acquisition is negative. There are so many distortions in there that I would rather say, why don't we look at September year-to-date.
There on the - actually Asia, and then would still show a negative OCI ex currency development of minus 2.9%. In Asia, then you have two things in there, which is of course first, the Philippines which is what I call a welcome dilution effect of the margin, because the Philippines is of course a new basis for future growth. So if you then take that one out, then Asia ex currency and ex acquisition would be down minus 1.3% and would be the only region where you have negative OCI margin developments.
Well, now, as we were just talking, we found new margins and we use the revaluation effect in the fourth quarter. Also, Asia is going to turn positive by year-end and all four regions, in my opinion, will show positive OCI margin increases even excluding currency and acquisitions. So that is another way of looking at it and is another way of demonstrating that the fundamentals are in very good shape.

We are doing well in there, you know that we had a couple of tack-on acquisitions of some brands there. We are doing all right, we keep on growing.
On the hand, the focus certainly always should be cigarettes, because the margins are higher in cigarettes and very often this is a question of taxation of roll-your-own, make-your-own. And so remember that's why you had a steep increase a year ago in Spain until the taxation there was correct and since then things are back to normal. Yes, we are an active player in the market and things are going okay, I would say.

Firstly on Turkey, it looks like sequentially Turkey is getting a little bit easier in terms of volume. Is that just the consumer getting used to the new price points from January or is anything else going on there that means that those volumes seem to stabilizing a little bit?
And then just in terms of Russia, clearly better trends again. I just wondered whether the - just through the course, whether you can talk about whether those trends were getting better through the period, whether there was any negative impact? Obviously, there was fires and heat waves, it was a bit disrupted during the period in Russia.
And then just also whether there is an update on what's going on with tax increases moving forward.

First Turkey then, well, it is simply - I mean, you see Turkey, take it as a country first. The macros are really excellent, GDP is up 10%, purchasing power is up, unemployment is down, inflation is at fairly low levels for Turkey standards, 6.5%. So consumer confidence is up. All that together, I think we see that consumers have adjusted a little bit to the prices. That being said, prices are extremely high and we see negative mix in that market because price gaps are also high. I believe that's about the story about Turkey.
And moving over to Russia, there are two things here. I mean, really the downtrading which we see phasing out, I mean there are clearly clear and hard numbers here. If I look at our distributor sales, then premium sales in Q3 - premium is down minus 3.5%. In Q1, this was down 12.2%, you can see a huge improvement. Mid, down 6.3% in Q3 versus 11% in Q1; and low, increasing 8% versus 11% in Q1. Our brands, same thing. Q3, Parliament, up 2.7%; Chesterfield, 6.7% up; Bond Street, 20% up; and Optima, 1% up. So you clearly can see downtrading is phasing out in that market.
When it comes to excise tax, well, the present proposal has gone through the first reading at the Duma. That proposal means roughly a rollover need of 3 rubles per pack. So that's an increase above inflation, but I wouldn't call it disruptive. The legislative process, however, is not yet over. But for now, things look reasonable.

When it comes to profitability, we have a solid single-digit OCI growth in that market. So there is real increase in profitability still in Australia. So from that sense, it's good.
By the way, there is no really new news on plain packaging in that market. The government is now studying the situation and we remain confident that they will recognize there eventually the exposure and finally listen to the common sense arguments there that the combination of high prices, product display ban, and plain packaging would do nothing else but facilitate illicit business of criminals. So much on Australia.
Then on your more general pricing question, well, it always is a situation that we really take on a market-by-market basis. Our price increases in Russia would have been clearly above inflation. In Indonesia, it would have been above inflation.
So it is - like always, it is really there is no general answer, I'm sorry. I can't give a generalized answer. It is on a market-by-market basis, depending what is the competitive situation, what is the purchasing power, what are the unemployment trends in the market, what else is happening, what is the consumer confidence level in the markets.

Earlier today, we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2010 third quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com.
During our call today, we'll be talking about results in the third quarter of 2010 and comparing them with the same period in 2009, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are for PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Net revenue data excludes excise taxes. Acquisitions, for the purposes of this presentation, also include our business combination with Fortune Tobacco Corporation in the Philippines. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions.
You'll find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues and operating companies income, or OCI, for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.
Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. It is now my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer. Hermann?"

As anticipated, our third quarter results were adversely impacted by various timing issues, in particular, relating to Japan. More than half our organic volume decline in the quarter was attributable to",2550,"Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. As anticipated, our third quarter results were adversely impacted by various timing issues, in particular, relating to Japan. More than half our organic volume decline in the quarter was attributable to the payback for the previously disclosed 3.4 billion unit build up of stocks at our distributor in Japan during the second quarter this year. The lower sales to Japan also drove an unfavorable geographic mix in the quarter. We do, however, remain very competitive in this important market. The Marlboro is growing share behind innovative line extensions such as Marlboro Black Menthol and Marlboro Ice Blast, which reached the combined market share of 2% in the quarter. 
We continue to face a difficult environment in both Greece and Turkey, resulting from the significant tax increases that occurred earlier this year. Industry volume in these markets was down by 8% and 6% respectively in the third quarter. And dividing of price caps has led to consumer down trading and an unfavorable product mix. 
These three issues masked and underwrites strong underlying business performance. I would like to mention in particular the good results of Marlboro, driven by the new architecture and innovative line extensions. The market share of Marlboro was higher or stable in the third quarter across all four of our regions. 
A notable highlight of the quarter was our continued strong cash flow performance, with operating cash flow increasing by more than 30% in the quarter. This allowed us to accelerate the implementation of our share repurchase program and to increase our dividend by 10.3% in September.
Indeed, the strength of our underlying business along with more favorable exchange rates and the lower tax rate has led us to raise and narrow our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2010 to a range of $3.90 to $3.95. This represents our reported diluted EPS growth rate of approximately 20% to 22% compared to the $3.24 achieved last year. Excluding currency, the growth rate in our guidance is now approximately 16% to 18% compared to 14% to 17%, projected previously.
Our cigarette volume in the quarter increased by 4.5% to 229.2 billion units, driven by our successful business combination with Fortune Tobacco in the Philippines. Excluding acquisitions, our volume declined by 2.9% or 6.3 billion units. In addition to Japan, Ukraine contributed 2.6 billion units to this decline, reflecting both the timing of shipments and market contraction, following a series of tax-driven price increases. Our volume was also unfavorably influenced by lower industry volumes in such markets as Greece, Poland, Spain and Turkey. 
On a year-to-date basis, our organic volume was down by 1.6% or 10.5 billion units. The decline was driven in particular by Turkey and Ukraine, whose combined volume was down 10.1 billion units, as well as by Greece and Spain. Our volume in a number of important emerging markets, including Algeria, Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico and Russia has, however, increased this year. 
Our net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions were down slightly in the quarter, impacted in particular by the timing of shipments to Japan, the need to partially absorb taxes and lower volumes in Greece, lower volumes and an unfavorable mix in Turkey and the netting of last year's price increase in Germany. On a year-to-date basis, our net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, are up 3.6%. 
Our OCI in the third quarter was unfavorably impacted by two timing effects and difficult comparisons, namely, the aforementioned timing of Japanese shipments and pricing, as well as the tax-driven industry volume declines and unfavorable mix in Greece and Turkey and lower industry volumes in Spain and Ukraine. 
During the third quarter last year, we achieved a record pricing variance of $590 million. Our pricing variance in the third quarter this year was $292 million, as we notably lapped price increases in Germany and Turkey and were obliged to partially absorb higher taxes in Greece. Consequently, we were not able to fully offset the lower volume and unfavorable geographic mix in this quarter and adjusted OCI declined by 1.7%, excluding currency and acquisition, while adjusted diluted EPS grew at a slower rate of 5.4% excluding currency. 
On a year-to-date basis, adjusted OCI increased by 4.5%, excluding currency and acquisitions. These results were impacted by lower volumes, the skew of our pricing variance this year towards the fourth quarter and higher costs, which we were able to partially offset through our productivity program. 
As previously disclosed, tobacco leaf prices increases are expected to have an impact of around $215 million for the full year 2010. In addition, we have increased our investments in marketing, sales, R&D and infrastructure. Going forward, we expect tobacco leaf prices increases to be broadly in line with inflation, and we will continue our rigorous focus on cost controls and productivity gains.  
Our adjusted diluted EPS for this year was 12.5%, excluding currency. The underlying strength of our business and favorable pricing prospects are the basis for our confidence in our full year guidance. 
We expect to reap the benefits in the fourth quarter of recently implemented price increases in Argentina, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Russia and the U.K. In addition, we have announced a price increase of EUR 0.30 across our portfolio in France, higher prices as of next month in Poland and have filed for a price increase with the customs authorities in Portugal. 
Furthermore, we build benefits substantially in the fourth quarter from the revaluation of the inventories at our distributor in Japan. This represents the increased margin on our future sales to the trade, but from an accounting perspective, was taken in October in one go due to our import structure in this market. We therefore expect our pricing variance in the fourth quarter this year to be significantly higher than in the third quarter. 
Our underlying business performed strongly in the third quarter with a share gain for the company and for Marlboro in the EU region and good share momentum across all regions. PMI achieved year-on-year or sequential share growth notably in Nigeria, Argentina, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, The Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Spain and Turkey.
A key driver of our improved business momentum has been the successful rollout of the new Marlboro architecture. In the third quarter, the share of Marlboro increased, or was stable, in all four of our regions. The market share of Marlboro in the EU region grew by 0.2 points in the third quarter to 18.4%. The solid performance is notably in Belgium, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland and Spain. In the highly price-sensitive German market, Marlboro's recovery is being hampered by a widening of price gaps. In Greece, consumers have been down-trading due to steep price increases and in large price gaps in a difficult economic environments.
L&M is the second best selling cigarette brand in the EU region after Marlboro. It's strong momentum continued in the third quarter. With market share growth notably in Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Slovakia. For the region as a whole, L&M grew 0.6 share points to 6.3%. 
Outside the EU region, Marlboro is performing very strongly, with market share gains across a wide range of different geographies. Marlboro volume increased by 9.8% in Asia, excluding Japan, was up 0.8% in the Latin America and Canada region and was down only marginally in the region. 
Let me now turn to our momentum in key markets, starting with the EU region. In the third quarter, total industry volume was down 5.5%, driven primarily by the recession-related, double-digit decline of the Spanish market. The combination of price elasticity this year and trade purchase patents last year in the Polish market and the impact of higher prices in the economic crisis in Greece. Our total market share in the EU region increased by 0.2 points in the third quarter to 39.1% behind an overall solid performance across our main markets. 
In Greece, our market share is increasing sequentially as the growth of L&M has more than offset the decline in Marlboro. To maintain the competitiveness of Marlboro, we were obliged to partially absorb tax increases that occurred earlier this year. We expect that the Greek market will continue to act as a drag on our regional profitability growth into the beginning of next year while discussions on structural changes to the excise tax system continue.
We increased our shipment volume in the very important Russian market by 1.4% in the third quarter to a record level of 25.4 billion units. This strong performance was driven by above premium parliament, mid-priced Chesterfield and low-priced Bond Street and mixed. PMI implemented price increases of two to three rubles per pack in July. The market is stabilizing overall and consumer down-trading continues to slow. 
Industry volumes during the third quarter in Ukraine is estimated to have been down about 15%, reflecting the size of trade purchases in June, ahead of the latest tax increases, and a market contraction, resulting from continuous price increases over the last two years. Our volume declined by 2.6 billion units or about one quarter. Premium Marlboro and mid-priced Chesterfield gained share, but we shed share at the low end of the markets. The improved mix and higher prices enabled us to strongly increase our profitability in Ukraine during the third quarter.
While the decline slowed in the third quarter, industry volume in Turkey was still down by about 6% year-on-year. As consumers have switched to contraband cigarettes and loose tobacco, following the very large tax-driven price increases earlier this year. Though our volume and product mix remains unfavorable compared to last year, our market share in Turkey is starting to improve sequentially, which makes us optimistic that the outlook will be better next year after a difficult 2010. 
While our shipments to Japan in the third quarter were 3.5 billion units below the prior year, sales by our distributor to the trade rose by 4 billion units or 27.3%. We estimate that the retail trade built up about 10 days of additional stock and consumers purchased some three weeks of stock ahead of the October, 2010 retail price increases. Consequently, retail sales this month have been very limited, and we will only be able to see the consumers' reaction to the higher prices towards the end of the quarter and during the first part of next year. 
Let me remind you that the retail selling price for cigarettes grew very significantly this month with a 37.5 increase for Marlboro. While the price increases are unprecedented in their magnitude and take place in a deflationary environment, cigarettes remain relatively affordable, and therefore, we are optimistic that our profitability will be enhanced going forward. 
Industry volume in Indonesia grew by a further 3.9% in the quarter, broadly in line with the annual trends. Our shipments were up 3.1% in the third quarter despite the temporarily unfavorable impact on A Mild, as the leading brand in Indonesia of costing through the 10,000 rupiah per pack price point. Our overall market share was down 0.2 points, while our profitability in Indonesia grew at a double-digit rate in the quarter, thanks to higher prices and the growing volumes.
In Korea, PMI volume increased by 9.7% in the third quarter and our market share grew by 2.4 points to 17%, thanks in particular to Marlboro and Parliament, whose growth in recent quarters in Korea has been nothing less than spectacular. Meanwhile, as elsewhere in the world, PMI continues to advocate for the adoption of a system of regular, moderate excise tax increases. 
In the Latin America and Canada region, overall industry volume in key markets was essentially stable in the quarter. The Canadian market grew by 4.2% a slower pace that reflects the fact that we have left the period last year, when the provincial authorities in Québec and Ontario started to increase their enforcement against contraband sales. The markets in Argentina and Mexico were down slightly. Our strong growth, share growth, continued in the quarter in the key markets of Argentina and Mexico. In the latter, Marlboro continued to grow share and has now captured nearly half the market, helped by the rollout of the new architecture. 
Excluding currency and acquisitions, OCI in the quarter was up 2.2%, driven by higher pricing that was partially offset by lower volumes and an unfavorable mix in Canada. The low-priced brands have become more prominent, following the decline in the illicit trade. In the fourth quarter, profitability will be enhanced by the recently announced retail price increase of half a peso in Argentina. 
Our working capital reduction program is reinforcing our tremendous cash flow generation. In the third quarter this year, our operating cash flow was 30.9% higher at $2.4 billion. Excluding currency, operating cash flow was up by 43.6%. Free cash flow increased at a slightly faster rate of 33.6% and 47.4%, excluding currency. 
On a year-to-date basis, our operating cash flow has reached $7.9 billion for a cumulative total of $23.7 billion since the beginning of 2008. With one quarter to go, we have already surpassed the $27 billion cumulative three-year operating cash flow target that we established at the spin by nearly 10%.
Our financial strength enables us to generously reward our shareholders. Thanks to the continued strong growth of our cash flow, we have increased our allocations for share repurchases for the full year to $5 billion, accelerating the rate of purchases this year under our previously approved program by $1 billion more than originally foreseen. 
In the third quarter we spent $1.1 billion to purchase an additional 20.7 million shares and have spent $3.9 billion in all so far this year to buy 78.5 million shares. In September, we increased our quarterly dividend by 10.3% to $0.64 a share, an annualized rate of $2.56. In fact, since the March 2008 spin, we have raised our dividend by 39% and our dividend yield stands at 4.5%.
So let me now summarize. By the belief, we continue to be an attractive investment opportunity. We have strong business momentum going into the fourth quarter, and we'll benefit from higher margins in Japan as well as price increases in Argentina, France, Indonesia, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Russia and the UK. We also have a more favorable currency tailwind than previously factored into our forecast and a lower tax rate. 
Consequently, we are raising and narrowing our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2010 to a range of $3.90 to $3.95. Compared to 2009, this represents a strong growth rate of approximately 20% to 22%. 
We have market leadership and are growing volume and overall share in emerging markets. Marlboro is performing well behind its new brand architecture and innovative line extensions, with overall share up in EU regions in the third quarter and either increasing or stable in our three other regions. 
Our pricing power remains strong due to our brand leadership and broad portfolio. The outlook for costs going forward is improving. Our growing cash flow has enabled us to accelerate our share repurchase program this year to a total spending target of $5 billion. And we raised our dividend by 10.3% in September, thus providing effective returns to our shareholders. Thank you. I will now be pleased to answer any questions you may have."

Japan alone is about a four percentage points drag in PMI's results in the quarter, and Greece and Turkey together would add another two percentage points. But actually, maybe an even better way to answer your question is really to look at OCI margins, because in the third quarter, the overall PMI ex currency and acquisition is negative. There are so many distortions in there that I would rather say why don't you look at September year-to-date. There are only, actually, Asia, then would still show a negative OCI ex currency development of minus 2.9%. In Asia then, you have two things in there which is of course, first, the Philippines, which is what I call a welcome dilution effect of the margin, because the Philippines is of course, a new basis for future growth. So if you then take that one out, then Asia ex currency and ex acquisition would be down minus 1.3 and would be the only region that you have negative OCI margin developments. Well, now as we were just talking, we found new margins based on revaluation effect in the fourth quarter. Also Asia is going to turn positive by year end, and all four regions, in my opinion, will show positive OCI margin increases even excluding currency and acquisitions. So that is another way of looking at it and is another way of demonstrating that the fundamentals are in very good shape."

Is that just the consumer getting used to the new price points from January, or is there anything else going on there that means that those volumes seems to be stabilizing a little bit? And then just in terms of Russia, played [ph] by the trends again, just through the quarter, whether you can talk about whether those trends are getting better through the period, whether there's any negative impacts? Obviously, there were fires and heat waves, that disrupted during the period in Russia. And then just also -- whether there's an update on what's going on with tax increases moving forward. I know there's meant to be good visibility on that, but there seems to be news [indiscernible] (55:36) coming out that, that may change slightly. So I wonder what your position is on that tax risk in Russia moving forward."

Inflation is at fairly low levels for Turkish standards, 6.5% [ph] (56:04). So consumer confidence is up, all there together, I think, we see that consumers have adjusted a little bit to the prices. That being said, prices are extremely high and we see negative mix in that market, because price gaps are also high. I believe that's about the story about Turkey. Moving over to Russia, there are two things here. I mean, really the down trading which we see phasing out, I mean there are clear and hard numbers here. If I look at our distributor sales then premium sales in Q3. Premium is down minus 3.5%. In Q1, this was down 12.2%, you can see a huge improvement. Mid down 6.3% in Q3 versus 11% in Q1 and low increasing 8% versus 11% in Q1. Our brands, same thing. Q3, Parliament, up 2.7%; Chesterfield, 6.7% up; Bond Street, 20% up; and Optima, 1% up. So you clearly can see down-trading is phasing out in that market. When it comes to excise tax, while the present proposal has gone through the first reading at the Dumark [ph] (57:40) that proposal means roughly a rollover need of RUB 3 per pack. So that's an increase above inflation, but I wouldn't call it disruptive. The legislative process, however, is not yet over. But for now things look reasonable."

From there, we would look at our capital expenditure requirements we have, mid and long term over multi-year average would be that it should about equal at max depreciation and amortization, then you would look at your multi-year average of what you might need for tack-on acquisitions, take a multiyear average of $1 billion or so for the tack-ons. Then you would kind of put the framework around that our credit rating are A credit rating gives us. We like our credit-rating. We want to keep that credit rating, because it gives us all the flexibility in the world. So within those ratings, then you get to your dividends. Our dividend payout ratio is 65%. You know that. You also have seen our last dividend increase in there. And from there, you get to the share repurchases, which kind of is the remainder of that whole calculation."

By the way, there is no really new news in packaging in that market. The government is now studying the situation, and we remain confident that they will recognize and then eventually exposure and finally listen to the common sense arguments there that the combination of high prices, product display ban and plain packaging will do nothing else but facilitate illicit business of criminals. So much on Australia. Then on more general pricing question. It always is a situation that we really take on a market-by-market basis. Our price increases in Russia would have been clearly above inflation. In Indonesia, it would've been slightly above inflation. So it is, like always, there is really no general answer. I can't give a generalized answer. It is on a market-by-market basis depending on what is the competitive situation, what is the purchasing power, what are the unemployment trends in the market, what else is happening, what is the consumer confidence level in the markets. So these are all elements that go into it. So I only can give you examples for the past four key markets like Indonesia and Russia."
