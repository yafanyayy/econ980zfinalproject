While the year-on-year comparison of our 2009 reflects the weak",1170,"Thank you, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone. As Robin outlined, I'll begin today's call with a review of the financial results for both the fourth quarter of 2009 and the 2009 fiscal year. While the year-on-year comparison of our 2009 reflects the weak economic global condition that began in late 2008 and persisted through most of 2009, the quarterly improvements in orders, shipments and earnings, which began in the second quarter, continued through the fourth quarter. This was driven by a return to a steady and continued investment by our IDM, foundry and DRAM customers. Here are the results. Net bookings for the fourth quarter of 2009 came in at $257.6 million, up 50.2% over quarter three and at the high end of our revised guidance range of up 40% to 55%. Net orders for the fiscal year 2009 were $618.1 million, which was down 24.4% from fiscal year 2008 as a result of the weak macroeconomic conditions we experienced throughout the year. Fourth quarter shipments were $244.5 million, up 47.8% from quarter three and also at the high end of our revised guidance range of $225 million to $245 million. Shipments for the fiscal year 2009 were $622 million, a decrease of 35.1% over fiscal year 2008, consistent with the reduction in bookings experienced throughout the year. Fourth quarter revenues were $244.2 million, up 38.1% from the September quarter and also at the high end of our revised guidance range of $225 million to $245 million. Revenues for the fiscal year were $639.2 million, a decrease of 36.8% over fiscal year 2008. Our fourth quarter revenues by geographic region are as follows: United States, 21%; Greater China, 48%; Korea, 18%; Japan, 5%; and Europe, 8%. Our year-end backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $184.3 million, modestly lower than the 2008 fiscal year-end backlog of $188.3 million. Throughout the rest of my remarks related to the P&L, I will be distinguishing between GAAP results and results that exclude certain other charges and benefits. I'd like to preface my remarks with the description of these other charges and benefits and we'll refer to them collectively, going forward, as other items. Please note that a detailed breakout of these items by type and geography is in today's press release. Other items totaled $3.5 million for the fourth quarter and $42.9 million for the 2009 fiscal year. Other items for the year included severance charges related to reductions in force, restructuring and other charges, consolidation of our manufacturing operation in Oregon, impairment of inventory and evaluation systems, write-down of certain R&D assets and various tax-related items. Fourth quarter GAAP gross margin was 46.5%, which includes $1.9 million of other items. Excluding these other items, quarter four gross margin was 47.3%, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range of 45% to 47%, and up from 40.6% in the third quarter. The increase in Q4's gross margin was due primarily to improved absorption of fixed costs, as shipment volumes increased, and change in mix. For fiscal year 2009, GAAP gross margin was 37.7% compared to 43.1% in 2008. Excluding other items, fiscal year 2009 non-GAAP gross margin was 39.4% compared to 44.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower shipment volumes compared to the previous year. Total GAAP operating expense for the quarter was $75.6 million. Excluding other items, ongoing operating expense was $74.0 million, up slightly from $72.2 million in the September quarter, which included our nonrecurring bad debt recovery. Over the last year, we've realigned our ongoing cost structure and reduced our operating expenses to $303 million, a decrease of 29.3% compared to 2008. As we stated before, improving business trends forecast in 2010 will return the company to a more normal operating model, and we will see certain increases on OpEx as we eliminate incremental factory shutdowns and reinstate salaries, merit increases and variable compensation. Fourth quarter GAAP operating income was $38.1 million. Excluding other items, operating income was $41.6 million. Our GAAP operating loss for the fiscal year 2009 was $76 million. And excluding other items, we incurred an operating loss of $51.5 million. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 13.3% versus an effective negative rate in the third quarter. The tax rate differed between the two quarters because we generated income in non-U.S. jurisdictions in the fourth quarter versus generating losses in those jurisdictions in the third quarter. For the year end, December 31, 2009, our effective tax rate was negative 22.9% due, again, primarily to the fact that we generated losses in non-U.S. jurisdictions. As projected, business levels have improved. We expect that our tax rate will return to more normalized levels in 2010. We are currently expecting a tax rate in the range of 25% to 30% for fiscal year 2010. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $35.2 million, or $0.36 per share on a fully-diluted basis. Fourth quarter net income, excluding other items, was $38.2 million or $0.39 per fully-diluted share, which was on the high end of our revised guidance range of $0.25 to $0.40 per share. For the full year 2009, GAAP net loss was $85.2 million or an $0.88 loss per fully-diluted share, compared to the 2008 net loss of $115.7 million or $1.18 loss per fully-diluted share. Excluding other items, fiscal 2009 net loss was $49.1 million or $0.51 loss per fully-diluted share compared to fiscal 2008 net income of $7.1 million or $0.07 per fully-diluted share. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the year with $713.2 million of short- and long-term cash and investments, including $133.1 million of restricted cash. Total cash increased by $31 million for the year, net of $23 million used in the repurchase of our stock. We generated $38.3 million in cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter and $63.3 million for fiscal year 2009 despite a very difficult business environment. In the fourth quarter, we bought back 631,000 shares of our stock for $13.1 million at an all-in cost per share of $20.76. For the year, we purchased 1.1 million shares for $23.1 million at an all-in cost of $20.79. The stock repurchase program remains active and there was approximately $804 million left under the authorization until October 2011. Net accounts receivable at the end of Q4 totaled $150.6 million, up $39.3 million from $111.3 million at the end of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, our DSOs declined to 56 days from 57 days at the end of Q3 and from 69 days at the end of 2008, due to our continued focus on cash and our effective collection practices. Quarter-end inventories increased by $12.3 million or 8.2% over quarter three while supporting a 47.8% increase in shipments. We expect to continue to tightly manage our operational inventory as we head into a rising shipment environment in 2010. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rick to provide an update on the state of our business and to provide guidance for the first quarter of 2010."

Thank you for joining our 2009 fourth quarter and our year-end conference call. Now needless to say, 2009 was a year of extremes: Extreme depression in January of 2009 followed by, what I'll call, opulent optimism today in 2010. Now while 2009 was a terrible year by any standard, Novellus maintained its tradition of positive cash flow, generating $63 million in operations for the year. I'd like to review some of the things that both the good news and the bad news for 2009. On the bad side of the ledger, of course, is the fact that our bookings declined from $817 million in 2008 to $618 million in 2009, down 24.4%.  Our shipments tracked that going from $959 million in 2008, down to $622 million, down 35%. Revenues, likewise, tracked, down 37% from $1.11 billion, down to $639 million. On a positive note, we made tremendous progress in our operating expenses, seeing them go from $429 million in 2008, down to $303 million in 2009. Unfortunately, we ended up with a loss but, however, we did have positive cash flows. At Novellus, we're cautiously optimistic about the future. For the first time since the late 90s, I see fundamental worldwide demand, generating the needs for semiconductors, once again, at an unprecedented rate. Before I get into that detail of those drivers, let me focus on quarter four a little. In quarter four, we had net sales of $244 million. That was up 148% over the low of $98 million in quarter one of 2009. Now while that's a terrific rebound, let me point out that this revenue level is only 54% of our previous quarterly peak revenues in Q3 of 2006. This is a very important fact when judging the sustainability of this current up cycle, which I do believe to be sustainable. On the bright side for Novellus, in the third of 2006, our profit after-tax was 15.8% on $444 million. On the $244 million in quarter four of 2009, our profit after-tax was 14.4%, indicating tremendous expense control plus strong operating leverage going forward. Now while $244 million is 54% of peak, that business is coming from only a handful of customers. Let me characterize demand as Japan is very, very weak; Europe is very, very weak; the U.S. is weak; Korea is strengthening very quickly; Taiwan is strong; and the rest of Asia, frankly, is somewhat weak. So what will sustain the business cycle? So let me give you a perspective having lived through the 90s, 2000 through 2007 and the bust we saw last year. If I look at those periods, the 1995, 1993 through 2000 period, was driven by robust demand for semiconductor growth that was driven by building infrastructure, namely the Internet network. It was driven by a demand for semiconductors due to fear, uncertainty and doubt. That fear, uncertainty and doubt was Y2K, the fear of planes falling out of the sky and cars stopping on the streets at the end of the year, and finally, by the consumerization of the personal computer. We saw a big bust in 2001, followed by robust demand for semiconductor equipment that was driven for an entirely different reason. It was a supply-side-driven growth in capital equipment and in supply-side of memory, which drove down prices and ultimately became a bust at the end of 2008 and through 2009. So what's different today? I think what we're seeing is, number one, there's been a tremendous restructuring worldwide of corporations to become more efficient. Now in order to become more efficient, we have to have increased focus on productivity and information technology. And today, with Microsoft's successful introduction of Windows 7, the first real product introduction from Microsoft since the late 90s. We see IT departments, including our own, coming with very credible proposals for investment in IT technology to improve overall corporate productivity. And we, like many of our counterparts throughout the world, are beginning to invest again more heavily into IT. In addition, the move from wired to wireless is also increasing demands on infrastructure builds, not only in the United States today, but throughout the world. So that first leg of the triangle is very similar to the mid-90s. Now the question is, one leg of the triangle doesn't make a great market, but it makes a reasonable market. So what's the fear, uncertainty and doubt in the 2010 to 2015 period? Again, the fear, uncertainty and doubt is planes falling out of the sky. The fear of terrorism, the fear of security throughout the world, is driving an unprecedented government investment in cyber technology, which includes interconnected networks, it includes advanced storage systems in order to interconnect worldwide. Now this isn't a trend that just happened on Christmas Day with the advent of the fruit of kaboom underwear. This is a trend that's been going on over the last couple, probably, six to eight quarters, and we've seen it in the performance of some of the biggest corporations in the United States as IBM, as HP and at Intel. What was the fundamental driver? So this fear, uncertainty and doubt is going to accelerate investment by governments throughout the world and provide the second leg of the triangle. Now the question is, what picks up for the consumerization of the personal computer? Most recently, we did a study, looking at overall consumer demand. And one of the things that was mostly illuminating to us is the fact that if you look at the percentage of disposable income that is used to buy electronic equipment by emerging economies versus developed economies, you find that they purchase about twice as much as from a percentage point of their disposable income. At the same time, the population of those people are three times as much. And as a result, we see that there's over six times the demand in the developing world for electronic products today than there are in the developed world. And I proper to you today, that China is no longer an emerging economy but, in fact, has emerged. Now I know there's some fear and speculation on China's recent raising of interest rates, but I would contend to you that that's a prudent move by the Chinese government to stave off a real estate bust, something that we obviously have, at least halfway lived through, over the last year. And so I believe the third leg of that triangle, going forward, is, in fact, the consumerization of China. And I believe that more and more consumer spending within China and India will continue to sustain the economic growth and the use of semiconductors throughout the world over the next five years as a minimum. So that is why I'm optimistic. Now what could happen to derail this fundamental demand? Well, another credit crisis is certainly a possibility. And as we all know, there's a significant lump going through the bullet constrictor of our loan defaults that peak in June of '11. The next thing that could derail it, of course, is protectionism on the part of the United States, something we have to avoid with a passion, and finally, massive government spending on social programs rather than economic stimulus for the private sector. I believe China is very knowledgeable of this as they shed their philosophy of an iron rice bowl for all of their citizens and move more and more to a truly capitalistic environment. We sure hope the U.S. will not try to move in the opposite direction. So to reiterate, we think there's still strong growth in this business throughout the year. We, in fact, believe that CapEx will be up between 60% and 75% over 2009 in the semiconductor capital equipment area. So with that, I'd like to give you what our outlook is for quarter one. We believe we'll see bookings up from 10% to 25% in the first quarter. Our shipments will be between $255 million to $285 million, and revenues will track to between $245 million to $270 million. We'll see our gross margins between 47% to 49%, and we're expecting our earnings per share to be between $0.35 and $0.42, as we absorb the additional cost of bonuses and profit share that come to pass as your quarters become more profitable. So with that, I'd like to open it up for any questions you might have."

But obviously, we don't need the full development team for it. We moved them and reallocated them on to other programs.

For a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release and our Form 8-K furnished to the SEC today.

While the year-on-year comparison of our 2009 reflects the weak",1170,"Thank you, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone. As Robin outlined, I'll begin today's call with a review of the financial results for both the fourth quarter of 2009 and the 2009 fiscal year. While the year-on-year comparison of our 2009 reflects the weak economic global condition that began in late 2008 and persisted through most of 2009, the quarterly improvements in orders, shipments and earnings which began in the second quarter, continued through the fourth quarter. This was driven by a return to a steady and continued investment by our IDM, foundry and DRAM customers. Here are the results. Net bookings for the fourth quarter of 2009 came in at $257.6 million, up 50.2% over quarter three and at the high end of our revised guidance range of up 40% to 55%. Net orders for the fiscal year 2009 were $618.1 million, which was down 24.4% from fiscal year 2008 as a result of the weak macroeconomic conditions we experienced throughout the year. Fourth quarter shipments were $244.5 million, up 47.8% from quarter three and also at the high end of our revised guidance range of $225 million to $245 million. Shipments for the fiscal year 2009 were $622 million, a decrease of 35.1% over fiscal year 2008, consistent with the reduction in bookings experienced throughout the year. Fourth quarter revenues were $244.2 million, up 38.1% from the September quarter and also at the high end of our revised guidance range of $225 million to $245 million. Revenues for the fiscal year were $639.2 million, a decrease of 36.8% over fiscal year 2008. Our fourth quarter revenues by geographic region are as follows: United States, 21%; Greater China, 48%; Korea, 18%; Japan, 5%; and Europe, 8%. Our year-end backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $184.3 million, modestly lower than the 2008 fiscal year-end backlog of $188.3 million. Throughout the rest of my remarks related to the P&L, I will be distinguishing between GAAP results and results that exclude certain other charges and benefits. I'd like to preface my remarks with a description of these other charges and benefits and will refer to them collectively going forward as other items. Please note that a detailed breakout of these items by type and geography is in today's press release. Other items totaled $3.5 million for the fourth quarter and $42.9 million for the 2009 fiscal year. Other items for the year included severance charges related to reductions in force, restructuring and other charges, consolidation of our manufacturing operation in Oregon, impairment of inventory and evaluation systems, write-down of certain R&D assets and various tax-related items. Fourth quarter GAAP gross margin was 46.5%, which includes $1.9 million of other items. Excluding these other items, quarter four gross margin was 47.3%, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range of 45% to 47%, and up from 40.6% in the third quarter. The increase in Q4's gross margin was due primarily to improved absorption of fixed cost as shipment volumes increased, and change in mix. For fiscal year 2009, GAAP gross margin was 37.7% compared to 43.1% in 2008. Excluding other items, fiscal year 2009 non-GAAP gross margin was 39.4% compared to 44.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower shipment volumes compared to the previous year. Total GAAP operating expense for the quarter was $75.6 million. Excluding other items, ongoing operating expense was $74.0 million, up slightly from $72.2 million in the September quarter, which included our nonrecurring bad debt recovery. Over the last year, we've realigned our ongoing cost structure and reduced our operating expenses to $303 million, a decrease of 29.3% compared to 2008. As we stated before, improving business trends forecast in 2010 will return the company to a more normal operating model, and we will see certain increases on OpEx as we eliminate incremental factory shutdowns and reinstate salaries, merit increases and variable compensation. Fourth quarter GAAP operating income was $38.1 million. Excluding other items, operating income was $41.6 million. Our GAAP operating loss for the fiscal year 2009 was $76 million. And excluding other items, we incurred an operating loss of $51.5 million. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 13.3% versus an effective negative rate in the third quarter. The tax rate differed between the two quarters because we generated income in non-U.S. jurisdictions in the fourth quarter versus generating losses in those jurisdictions in the third quarter. For the year end, December 31, 2009, our effective tax rate was negative 22.9% due, again, primarily to the fact that we generated losses in non-U.S. jurisdictions. As projected, business levels have improved. We expect that our tax rate will return to more normalized levels in 2010. We are currently expecting a tax rate in the range of 25% to 30% for fiscal year 2010. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $35.2 million, or $0.36 per share on a fully-diluted basis. Fourth quarter net income, excluding other items, was $38.2 million or $0.39 per fully-diluted share, which was on the high end of our revised guidance range of $0.25 to $0.40 per share. For the full year 2009, GAAP net loss was $85.2 million or an $0.88 loss per fully-diluted share, compared to the 2008 net loss of $115.7 million or $1.18 loss per fully-diluted share. Excluding other items, fiscal 2009 net loss was $49.1 million or $0.51 loss per fully-diluted share compared to fiscal 2008 net income of $7.1 million or $0.07 per fully-diluted share. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the year with $713.2 million of short- and long-term cash and investments, including $133.1 million of restricted cash. Total cash increased by $31 million for the year, net of $23 million used in the repurchase of our stock. We generated $38.3 million in cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter and $63.3 million for fiscal year 2009 despite a very difficult business environment. In the fourth quarter, we bought back 631,000 shares of our stock for $13.1 million at an all-in cost per share of $20.76. For the year, we purchased 1.1 million shares for $23.1 million at an all-in cost of $20.79. The stock repurchase program remains active and there was approximately $804 million left under the authorization until October 2011. Net accounts receivable at the end of Q4 totaled $150.6 million, up $39.3 million from $111.3 million at the end of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, our DSOs declined to 56 days from 57 days at the end of Q3 and from 69 days at the end of 2008, due to our continued focus on cash and our effective collection practices. Quarter-end inventories increased by $12.3 million or 8.2% over quarter three while supporting a 47.8% increase in shipments. We expect to continue to tightly manage our operational inventory as we head into a rising shipment environment in 2010. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rick to provide an update on the state of our business and to provide guidance for the first quarter of 2010."

Thank you for joining our 2009 fourth quarter and our year-end conference call. Now needless to say, 2009 was a year of extremes: Extreme depression in January of 2009 followed by, what I'll call,",1414,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining our 2009 fourth quarter and our year-end conference call. Now needless to say, 2009 was a year of extremes: Extreme depression in January of 2009 followed by, what I'll call, opulent optimism today in 2010. Now while 2009 was a terrible year by any standard, Novellus maintained its tradition of positive cash flow, generating $63 million in operations for the year. Now I'd like to review some of the things that -- both the good news and the bad news for 2009. On the bad side of the ledger, of course, is the fact that bookings declined from $817 million in 2008 to $618 million in 2009, down 24.4%.  Our shipments tracked that going from $959 million in 2008, down to $622 million, down 35%. Revenues, likewise tracked down 37% from $1.11 billion, down to $639 million. On a positive note, we made tremendous progress in our operating expenses, seeing them go from $429 million in 2008, down to $303 million in 2009. Unfortunately, we ended up with a loss, but however we did have positive cash flows. At Novellus, we're cautiously optimistic about the future. For the first time since the late ‘90s, I see fundamental worldwide demand generating the needs for semiconductors, once again at an unprecedented rate. Before I get into that detail of those drivers, let me focus on quarter four a little. In quarter four, we had net sales of $244 million. That was up 148% over the low of $98 million in quarter one of 2009. Now while that's a terrific rebound, let me point out that this revenue level is only 54% of our previous quarterly peak revenues in Q3 of 2006. This is a very important fact when judging the sustainability of this current up cycle, which I do believe to be sustainable. On the bright side for Novellus, in the third of 2006, our profit after tax was 15.8% on $444 million. On the $244 million in quarter four of 2009, our profit after tax was 14.4%, indicating tremendous expense control plus strong operating leverage going forward. Now while $244 million is 54% of peak, that business is coming from only a handful of customers. Let me characterize demand as Japan is very, very weak; Europe is very, very weak; the U.S. is weak; Korea is strengthening very quickly; Taiwan is strong; and the rest of Asia, frankly, is somewhat weak. So what will sustain the business cycle? So let me give you a perspective having lived through the 90s, 2000 through 2007 and the bust we saw last year. If I look at those periods, the 1995, 1993 through 2000 period, was driven by robust demand for semiconductor growth that was driven by building infrastructure, namely the Internet network. It was driven by a demand for semiconductors due to fear, uncertainty and doubt. That fear, uncertainty and doubt was Y2K, the fear of planes falling out of the sky and cars stopping on the streets at the end of the year, and finally, by the consumerization of the personal computer. We saw a big bust in 2001, followed by robust demand for semiconductor equipment that was driven for an entirely different reason. It was a supply-side-driven growth in capital equipment and in supply-side of memory, which drove down prices and ultimately became a bust at the end of 2008 and through 2009. So what's different today? I think what we're seeing is, number one, there's been a tremendous restructuring worldwide of corporations to become more efficient. Now in order to become more efficient, we have to have increased focus on productivity and information technology. And today, with Microsoft's successful introduction of Windows 7, the first real product introduction from Microsoft since the late ‘90s, we see IT departments, including our own, coming with very credible proposals for investment in IT technology to improve overall corporate productivity. And we, like many of our counterparts throughout the world, are beginning to invest again more heavily into IT. In addition, the move from wired to wireless is also increasing demands on infrastructure builds, not only in the United States today, but throughout the world. So that first leg of the triangle is very similar to the mid-‘90s. Now the question is, one leg of the triangle doesn't make a great market, but it makes a reasonable market. So what's the fear, uncertainty and doubt in the 2010 to 2015 period? Again, the fear, uncertainty and doubt is planes falling out of the sky. The fear of terrorism, the fear of security throughout the world, is driving an unprecedented government investment in cyber technology, which includes interconnected networks, it includes advanced storage systems in order to interconnect worldwide. Now this isn't a trend that just happened on Christmas Day with the advent of the Fruit of Kaboom underwear. This is a trend that's been going on over the last couple, probably six to eight quarters, and we've seen it in the performance of some of the biggest corporations in the United States as IBM, as HP and at Intel. What was the fundamental driver? So this fear, uncertainty and doubt is going to accelerate investment by governments throughout the world and provide the second leg of the triangle. Now the question is, what picks up for the consumerization of the personal computer? Most recently, we did a study, looking at overall consumer demand. And one of the things that was mostly illuminating to us is the fact that if you look at the percentage of disposable income that is used to buy electronic equipment by emerging economies versus developed economies, you find that they purchase about twice as much as from a percentage point of their disposable income. At the same time, the population of those people are three times as much. And as a result, we see that there's over six times the demand in the developing world for electronic products today than there are in the developed world. And I proper to you today, that China is no longer an emerging economy but, in fact, has emerged. Now I know there's some fear and speculation on China's recent raising of interest rates, but I would contend to you that that's a prudent move by the Chinese government to stave off a real estate bust, something that we obviously have, at least halfway lived through, over the last year. And so I believe the third leg of that triangle, going forward, is, in fact, the consumerization of China. And I believe that more and more consumer spending within China and India will continue to sustain the economic growth and the use of semiconductors throughout the world over the next five years as a minimum. So that is why I'm optimistic. Now what could happen to derail this fundamental demand? Well, another credit crisis is certainly a possibility. And as we all know, there's a significant lump going through the bullet constrictor of our loan defaults that peak in June of '11. The next thing that could derail it, of course, is protectionism on the part of the United States, something we have to avoid with a passion, and finally, massive government spending on social programs rather than economic stimulus for the private sector. I believe China is very knowledgeable of this as they shed their philosophy of an iron rice bowl for all of their citizens and move more and more to a truly capitalistic environment. We sure hope the U.S. will not try to move in the opposite direction. So to reiterate, we think there's still strong growth in this business throughout the year. We, in fact, believe that CapEx will be up between 60% and 75% over 2009 in the semiconductor capital equipment area. So with that, I'd like to give you what our outlook is for quarter one. We believe we'll see bookings up from 10% to 25% in the first quarter. Our shipments will be between $255 million to $285 million, and revenues will track to between $245 million to $270 million. We'll see our gross margins between 47% to 49%, and we're expecting our earnings per share to be between $0.35 and $0.42, as we absorb the additional cost of bonuses and profit share that come to pass as your quarters become more profitable. So with that, I'd like to open it up for any questions you might have."

But obviously, we don't need the full development team for it. We moved them and reallocated them on to other programs.

Financial results for our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2009 were released by PR Newswire shortly after 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time. You can obtain a copy of the news released in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.novellus.com. Today's earnings call contains forward-looking statements about Novellus's business outlook, the future performance of Novellus and our products and forecasts of key metrics for the first quarter of 2010. Specific forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, our belief that our increased operating leverage will enable the company to drive for greater profitability cycle to cycle; our belief that the continued momentum behind the recovery in the semiconductor industry is sustainable; our expectations and beliefs as to various factors that are contributing to and fueling continued growth and increased demand in semiconductors and capital equipment; our belief that the application of semiconductors will continually drive the improvement in the quality of life around the globe; our progress in securing bookings with leading semiconductor manufacturers; the demand for, and competitiveness of, our products; our expectations that we will continue to maintain our position or grow market share; the forecasted bookings and shipment volumes, revenue, gross margin, operating expense; and earnings per share target for the first quarter of 2010; and our tax rate for both the first quarter and fiscal year 2010; and any other unanticipated future events.We caution you that forward-looking statements are projections and expectations regarding future events. They involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated, including an inaccurate basis for our financial forecasts. Information concerning risks that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in today's press release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K for fiscal 2008 and our Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed during fiscal year 2009. Forward-looking statements are based on information as of today, and we assume no obligation to update these statements.During our call today, we will make references to non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain charges, benefits and other items, which are detailed in our earnings release. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release and our Form 8-K furnished to the SEC today.

While the year-on-year comparison of our 2009 reflects the weak",1170,"Thank you, Robin, and good afternoon, everyone. As Robin outlined, I'll begin today's call with a review of the financial results for both the fourth quarter of 2009 and the 2009 fiscal year. While the year-on-year comparison of our 2009 reflects the weak economic global condition that began in late 2008 and persisted through most of 2009, the quarterly improvements in orders, shipments and earnings which began in the second quarter, continued through the fourth quarter. This was driven by a return to a steady and continued investment by our IDM, foundry and DRAM customers. Here are the results. Net bookings for the fourth quarter of 2009 came in at $257.6 million, up 50.2% over quarter three and at the high end of our revised guidance range of up 40% to 55%. Net orders for the fiscal year 2009 were $618.1 million, which was down 24.4% from fiscal year 2008 as a result of the weak macroeconomic conditions we experienced throughout the year. Fourth quarter shipments were $244.5 million, up 47.8% from quarter three and also at the high end of our revised guidance range of $225 million to $245 million. Shipments for the fiscal year 2009 were $622 million, a decrease of 35.1% over fiscal year 2008, consistent with the reduction in bookings experienced throughout the year. Fourth quarter revenues were $244.2 million, up 38.1% from the September quarter and also at the high end of our revised guidance range of $225 million to $245 million. Revenues for the fiscal year were $639.2 million, a decrease of 36.8% over fiscal year 2008. Our fourth quarter revenues by geographic region are as follows: United States, 21%; Greater China, 48%; Korea, 18%; Japan, 5%; and Europe, 8%. Our year-end backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $184.3 million, modestly lower than the 2008 fiscal year-end backlog of $188.3 million. Throughout the rest of my remarks related to the P&L, I will be distinguishing between GAAP results and results that exclude certain other charges and benefits. I'd like to preface my remarks with a description of these other charges and benefits and will refer to them collectively going forward as other items. Please note that a detailed breakout of these items by type and geography is in today's press release. Other items totaled $3.5 million for the fourth quarter and $42.9 million for the 2009 fiscal year. Other items for the year included severance charges related to reductions in force, restructuring and other charges, consolidation of our manufacturing operation in Oregon, impairment of inventory and evaluation systems, write-down of certain R&D assets and various tax-related items. Fourth quarter GAAP gross margin was 46.5%, which includes $1.9 million of other items. Excluding these other items, quarter four gross margin was 47.3%, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range of 45% to 47%, and up from 40.6% in the third quarter. The increase in Q4's gross margin was due primarily to improved absorption of fixed cost as shipment volumes increased, and change in mix. For fiscal year 2009, GAAP gross margin was 37.7% compared to 43.1% in 2008. Excluding other items, fiscal year 2009 non-GAAP gross margin was 39.4% compared to 44.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower shipment volumes compared to the previous year. Total GAAP operating expense for the quarter was $75.6 million. Excluding other items, ongoing operating expense was $74.0 million, up slightly from $72.2 million in the September quarter, which included our nonrecurring bad debt recovery. Over the last year, we've realigned our ongoing cost structure and reduced our operating expenses to $303 million, a decrease of 29.3% compared to 2008. As we stated before, improving business trends forecast in 2010 will return the company to a more normal operating model, and we will see certain increases on OpEx as we eliminate incremental factory shutdowns and reinstate salaries, merit increases and variable compensation. Fourth quarter GAAP operating income was $38.1 million. Excluding other items, operating income was $41.6 million. Our GAAP operating loss for the fiscal year 2009 was $76 million. And excluding other items, we incurred an operating loss of $51.5 million. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 13.3% versus an effective negative rate in the third quarter. The tax rate differed between the two quarters because we generated income in non-U.S. jurisdictions in the fourth quarter versus generating losses in those jurisdictions in the third quarter. For the year end, December 31, 2009, our effective tax rate was negative 22.9% due, again, primarily to the fact that we generated losses in non-U.S. jurisdictions. As projected, business levels have improved. We expect that our tax rate will return to more normalized levels in 2010. We are currently expecting a tax rate in the range of 25% to 30% for fiscal year 2010. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $35.2 million, or $0.36 per share on a fully-diluted basis. Fourth quarter net income, excluding other items, was $38.2 million or $0.39 per fully-diluted share, which was on the high end of our revised guidance range of $0.25 to $0.40 per share. For the full year 2009, GAAP net loss was $85.2 million or an $0.88 loss per fully-diluted share, compared to the 2008 net loss of $115.7 million or $1.18 loss per fully-diluted share. Excluding other items, fiscal 2009 net loss was $49.1 million or $0.51 loss per fully-diluted share compared to fiscal 2008 net income of $7.1 million or $0.07 per fully-diluted share. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the year with $713.2 million of short- and long-term cash and investments, including $133.1 million of restricted cash. Total cash increased by $31 million for the year, net of $23 million used in the repurchase of our stock. We generated $38.3 million in cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter and $63.3 million for fiscal year 2009 despite a very difficult business environment. In the fourth quarter, we bought back 631,000 shares of our stock for $13.1 million at an all-in cost per share of $20.76. For the year, we purchased 1.1 million shares for $23.1 million at an all-in cost of $20.79. The stock repurchase program remains active and there was approximately $804 million left under the authorization until October 2011. Net accounts receivable at the end of Q4 totaled $150.6 million, up $39.3 million from $111.3 million at the end of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, our DSOs declined to 56 days from 57 days at the end of Q3 and from 69 days at the end of 2008, due to our continued focus on cash and our effective collection practices. Quarter-end inventories increased by $12.3 million or 8.2% over quarter three while supporting a 47.8% increase in shipments. We expect to continue to tightly manage our operational inventory as we head into a rising shipment environment in 2010. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Rick to provide an update on the state of our business and to provide guidance for the first quarter of 2010."

Thank you for joining our 2009 fourth quarter and our year-end conference call. Now needless to say, 2009 was a year of extremes: Extreme depression in January of 2009 followed by, what I'll call,",1414,"Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining our 2009 fourth quarter and our year-end conference call. Now needless to say, 2009 was a year of extremes: Extreme depression in January of 2009 followed by, what I'll call, opulent optimism today in 2010. Now while 2009 was a terrible year by any standard, Novellus maintained its tradition of positive cash flow, generating $63 million in operations for the year. Now I'd like to review some of the things that -- both the good news and the bad news for 2009. On the bad side of the ledger, of course, is the fact that bookings declined from $817 million in 2008 to $618 million in 2009, down 24.4%.  Our shipments tracked that going from $959 million in 2008, down to $622 million, down 35%. Revenues, likewise tracked down 37% from $1.11 billion, down to $639 million. On a positive note, we made tremendous progress in our operating expenses, seeing them go from $429 million in 2008, down to $303 million in 2009. Unfortunately, we ended up with a loss, but however we did have positive cash flows. At Novellus, we're cautiously optimistic about the future. For the first time since the late ‘90s, I see fundamental worldwide demand generating the needs for semiconductors, once again at an unprecedented rate. Before I get into that detail of those drivers, let me focus on quarter four a little. In quarter four, we had net sales of $244 million. That was up 148% over the low of $98 million in quarter one of 2009. Now while that's a terrific rebound, let me point out that this revenue level is only 54% of our previous quarterly peak revenues in Q3 of 2006. This is a very important fact when judging the sustainability of this current up cycle, which I do believe to be sustainable. On the bright side for Novellus, in the third of 2006, our profit after tax was 15.8% on $444 million. On the $244 million in quarter four of 2009, our profit after tax was 14.4%, indicating tremendous expense control plus strong operating leverage going forward. Now while $244 million is 54% of peak, that business is coming from only a handful of customers. Let me characterize demand as Japan is very, very weak; Europe is very, very weak; the U.S. is weak; Korea is strengthening very quickly; Taiwan is strong; and the rest of Asia, frankly, is somewhat weak. So what will sustain the business cycle? So let me give you a perspective having lived through the 90s, 2000 through 2007 and the bust we saw last year. If I look at those periods, the 1995, 1993 through 2000 period, was driven by robust demand for semiconductor growth that was driven by building infrastructure, namely the Internet network. It was driven by a demand for semiconductors due to fear, uncertainty and doubt. That fear, uncertainty and doubt was Y2K, the fear of planes falling out of the sky and cars stopping on the streets at the end of the year, and finally, by the consumerization of the personal computer. We saw a big bust in 2001, followed by robust demand for semiconductor equipment that was driven for an entirely different reason. It was a supply-side-driven growth in capital equipment and in supply-side of memory, which drove down prices and ultimately became a bust at the end of 2008 and through 2009. So what's different today? I think what we're seeing is, number one, there's been a tremendous restructuring worldwide of corporations to become more efficient. Now in order to become more efficient, we have to have increased focus on productivity and information technology. And today, with Microsoft's successful introduction of Windows 7, the first real product introduction from Microsoft since the late ‘90s, we see IT departments, including our own, coming with very credible proposals for investment in IT technology to improve overall corporate productivity. And we, like many of our counterparts throughout the world, are beginning to invest again more heavily into IT. In addition, the move from wired to wireless is also increasing demands on infrastructure builds, not only in the United States today, but throughout the world. So that first leg of the triangle is very similar to the mid-‘90s. Now the question is, one leg of the triangle doesn't make a great market, but it makes a reasonable market. So what's the fear, uncertainty and doubt in the 2010 to 2015 period? Again, the fear, uncertainty and doubt is planes falling out of the sky. The fear of terrorism, the fear of security throughout the world, is driving an unprecedented government investment in cyber technology, which includes interconnected networks, it includes advanced storage systems in order to interconnect worldwide. Now this isn't a trend that just happened on Christmas Day with the advent of the Fruit of Kaboom underwear. This is a trend that's been going on over the last couple, probably six to eight quarters, and we've seen it in the performance of some of the biggest corporations in the United States as IBM, as HP and at Intel. What was the fundamental driver? So this fear, uncertainty and doubt is going to accelerate investment by governments throughout the world and provide the second leg of the triangle. Now the question is, what picks up for the consumerization of the personal computer? Most recently, we did a study, looking at overall consumer demand. And one of the things that was mostly illuminating to us is the fact that if you look at the percentage of disposable income that is used to buy electronic equipment by emerging economies versus developed economies, you find that they purchase about twice as much as from a percentage point of their disposable income. At the same time, the population of those people are three times as much. And as a result, we see that there's over six times the demand in the developing world for electronic products today than there are in the developed world. And I proper to you today, that China is no longer an emerging economy but, in fact, has emerged. Now I know there's some fear and speculation on China's recent raising of interest rates, but I would contend to you that that's a prudent move by the Chinese government to stave off a real estate bust, something that we obviously have, at least halfway lived through, over the last year. And so I believe the third leg of that triangle, going forward, is, in fact, the consumerization of China. And I believe that more and more consumer spending within China and India will continue to sustain the economic growth and the use of semiconductors throughout the world over the next five years as a minimum. So that is why I'm optimistic. Now what could happen to derail this fundamental demand? Well, another credit crisis is certainly a possibility. And as we all know, there's a significant lump going through the bullet constrictor of our loan defaults that peak in June of '11. The next thing that could derail it, of course, is protectionism on the part of the United States, something we have to avoid with a passion, and finally, massive government spending on social programs rather than economic stimulus for the private sector. I believe China is very knowledgeable of this as they shed their philosophy of an iron rice bowl for all of their citizens and move more and more to a truly capitalistic environment. We sure hope the U.S. will not try to move in the opposite direction. So to reiterate, we think there's still strong growth in this business throughout the year. We, in fact, believe that CapEx will be up between 60% and 75% over 2009 in the semiconductor capital equipment area. So with that, I'd like to give you what our outlook is for quarter one. We believe we'll see bookings up from 10% to 25% in the first quarter. Our shipments will be between $255 million to $285 million, and revenues will track to between $245 million to $270 million. We'll see our gross margins between 47% to 49%, and we're expecting our earnings per share to be between $0.35 and $0.42, as we absorb the additional cost of bonuses and profit share that come to pass as your quarters become more profitable. So with that, I'd like to open it up for any questions you might have."

I tend to think they'll continue to move in an upward direction as fundamental demand for these devices continues to grow, as we see a buildout of infrastructure continue at a very, very rapid rate. And I think that you're going to see the major players continue to spend to expand capacity which will enable them to both gain market share and in addition to that, transition from node to node more quickly than their competitors. You will then also see, I believe, some of the smaller memory players step up in order to create niche businesses in the memory market and you'll see a greater number of companies within the field investing this year. As I had highlighted at the mid-quarter update, I felt that there would be upward pressure on the CapEx expenditures, many of the key players.

Number one, I have explained it multiple times, that the strategy we were using to penetrate customers drove up bad expense to a level that we didn't think we really needed to do. So we adjusted that. And I explained that quarter after quarter on how we were making those cuts. Secondly, I'd like to think of it as, we invested consistently even during the downturns to bring products to market and complete the products. The development of CMP is completed, okay? And as a result, we've reduced the heads on it. But we still have the technology and everything is bundled up. And in fact, we still use the technology. But obviously, we don't need the full development team for it. We've moved them and reallocated them onto other programs. We've continued to pair the organization to make sure we have the strongest people possible. And we think we are investing at the appropriate level for the level of growth. Keep in mind, we're still -- everybody is still at 50%, 60% of peak-type revenues. You can't just keep spending R&D, you have to cut it.

I'll start by reviewing our first quarter 2010 results, which I'm pleased to say were very strong as we began to realize the earnings potential we have built into our leaned operating model.
Our first quarter 2010 net bookings came in at $321.4 million, up 24.7% sequentially from $257.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and at the midpoint of our revised guidance range of up 20% to 30%. First quarter shipments of $282.8 million were up 15.7% from $244.5 million in the fourth quarter and near the high end of our revised guidance range of $265 million to $285 million.
First quarter revenues were $276.2 million, up 13.1% from $244.2 million in the fourth quarter and $6 million above the high end of our revised guidance range of $255 million to $270 million. By geographic region, first quarter revenues are as follows; United States 26%, Greater China 38%, Korea 26%, Japan 4%, and Europe 6%.
Throughout the rest of my remarks related to the P&L, I will be distinguishing between GAAP results and results that exclude certain other charges. I'd like to preface my remarks with a discussion - a description of these other charges and will refer to them collectively going forward as other items. Please note that a detailed breakout of these items by type and geography is included in today's press release.
Other items totaled $6 million in the first quarter. These other items included $4.4 million of legal expenses related to the Linear Technology Corporation trial, which concluded on February 26, 2010 in favor of Novellus; $900,000 in costs related to the completion of the consolidation of our manufacturing facility in Oregon; and $700,000 in charges for reductions in workforce and restructuring.
Moving on to discuss the results, first quarter GAAP gross margin finished at 48.5%. Excluding other items, gross margin was 48.7%, which was at the high end of guidance range of 47% to 49%. Gross margin in Q1 benefitted from product mix and higher absorption of fixed overhead costs as shipment volumes continued to increase throughout the quarter.
First quarter GAAP operating expenses totaled $84.9 million. Excluding other items, operating expenses were $79.5 million, up only 7.4% sequentially while revenues rose 13.1% quarter-over-quarter. I am pleased to announce that we performed to our model and kept our operating expenses below our target even at these revenue levels with the reinstatement of variable compensation accruals, no shutdowns, and the restoration of executive salaries, all of which totaled an incremental $11.3 million expense versus the fourth quarter of 2009.
Quarter one operating income came in at $49 million, up 28.8% sequentially. Excluding other items, operating income was $55 million, up 30.8% sequentially, resulting in an ongoing operating margin of 19.9%, up from 17.2% in the quarter four of 2009.
Our first quarter GAAP tax expense was $9.3 million and our tax rate for the quarter was 18.4%. During the quarter, we analyzed the impact of a recent U.S. tax court opinion, as well as related comments from IRS appeals official and determined that these developments had favorable impact on our U.S. tax position regarding our international operations.
After a detailed review, we determined that our existing tax reserves related to the issue covered by the tax court opinion are sufficient and no further accruals are required. As a result, we now expect our fiscal 2010 tax rate to be 15% to 20%. Assuming similar geographic revenue mix, profitability levels, and no significant changes in U.S. tax law, we would expect to see an effective tax rate in that range going forward.
As discussed in our EPS pre-announcement press release on April 15th, our first quarter 2010 GAAP net income and fully diluted EPS came in at $41.3 million or $0.43, higher than our revised guidance of $0.32 to $0.39. Excluding other items, net income and fully diluted EPS was $45.5 million or $0.47, higher than our revised guidance of $0.37 to $0.44.
While the outperformance to guidance was largely due to the improvement in tax rate, which contributed $0.03 to $0.04 to our earnings per share, we still had an excellent quarter. The higher revenue levels, improved gross margin, and control over operating expenses, all contributed to producing a net income of 14.9% on a GAAP basis and 16.5% excluding other items.
Now, turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $751.6 million of short and long-term cash and investments, including $123.6 million of restricted cash. Total cash increased by $38.4 million sequentially, net of $15.2 million of stock repurchases. We generated $62 million in cash flow from operations in the first quarter. Depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock compensation for the quarter were $11 million and $7.7 million, respectively.
In the first quarter, we brought - bought back 709,000 shares of stock for $15.2 million at an all-in cost per share of $21.50. The stock repurchase program remains active and there is approximately $788 million left under the authorization until October 2011.
Despite improving business conditions, we continue to maintain tight control over our working capital. Net accounts receivable at the end of Q1 totaled $154.7 million, up 2.7% from $150.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter despite a 13.1% rise in revenues. In the first quarter, our DSOs dropped to an all-time historic best of 50 days from 56 days at the end of Q4 due to continued focus and effective collection practices. Inventory levels increased by 9.5% or $15.3 million quarter-over-quarter, while supporting a 15.7% increase in shipments.
That concludes my prepared remarks of the financials. I'd like to turn the call over to Rick to provide an update on the state of the business and guidance for the second quarter of 2010.

We are very happy we are able to bring these financial results to the table today. And as we reported, GAAP earnings of 14.9% after tax, non-GAAP of 16.9% after tax and when we look back historically prior to stock option expensing, the effective after-tax return would be upwards of 17.2%. So we are very pleased with those results.
In addition, we are also happy to report that through the history of our stock option buyback, we bought back approximately 1.75 million [ph], all in, at an average price of about $25.32 and as of today, we are above water on that investment, which also makes us very, very pleased.
Since we last talked at our mid-quarter update on March 10th, the environment has actually gotten incrementally better. The end markets for electronics remain very strong and has been confirmed by third-party forecasters, it's been driven largely by PC unit growth, which is now topping 20% as the corporate refresh cycle continues to gain momentum.
Now, I'd like to also add that a lot of this PC refresh cycle is really utilizing 64-bit machines, which again builds strongly into the growth potential for our business as we believe DRAM demand will continue to grow. This PC growth is augmented by solid growth in mobile phone market and smartphones in particular, which are forecasted to see a nearly 50% growth year-over-year.
In addition, iPads have had a great start out of the gate and both consumers and industrial electronics are poised for growth as the global economy continues to improve. We also discussed in our mid-quarter update on March 10th the third-party forecasted semiconductor revenues. They have increased to 20% from 13.5% as a result of this robust PC refresh cycle in the industrial sector recovery. Now, we believe there is potential upside to this forecast, driven by strength in all three segments, IDMs, memory, and foundry.
Utilization levels are averaging around 93% in Q1. That's approximately 5 points higher than the normal seasonal levels. We've seen DRAM contract prices up 16% sequentially in Q1 and up another 10% in Q2 so far. On the NAND side of the equation, NAND prices, they are down 6% sequentially, which actually reflects normal seasonality. But they are up 5% so far in the second quarter. So we find that to be very encouraging.
Foundry revenues were above normal seasonal levels and that's largely due to the strength in communications. For our semiconductor equipment business, we had increased our forecast CapEx for the industry to be in a growth range of 65% to 85% at our mid-quarter update and our confidence level on this revised range continues to increase as we start to see the recovery in the NAND flash materialize.
Now, I'll provide guidance for the second quarter. We expect bookings to be flat to up 15% and that is dependent upon the timing of certain sizeable orders. Second quarter [ph] shipments are forecasted to be up sequentially and range from $300 million to $330 million. And our revenue is forecasted to be up sequentially in the range of $285 million to $315 million. Our gross margins are forecasted to improve in the range of 48% to 50% and the earnings per share is forecasted to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.60.
Now, that concludes my comments and our guidance for the second quarter. Now, I'd like to open it up to any questions you might have.

Also, our conformal films with our ability to put them down at a very, very cost-effective way is also being very, very well received. We talked already about PVD. We talked as well about tungsten where we've had tremendous success in enabling tungsten in new applications, again performance-driven at 45 nanometers and beyond with low-resistivity tungsten and the ability to fill extremely aggressive aspect ratio features.
And so overall, I believe, today, all of our products not only offer a cost advantage, but a technological advantage. And I can take strip as an example. We believe given its capabilities to remove photoresist, it's an essential element for anyone doing any type of logic whatsoever because of its extremely effective capability of removing photoresist at the transistor level without silicon loss.
And we think that's a strategic advantage that is difficult, if not impossible with existing architectures to do and do it in a cost-effective way so you can still get the kind of technical performance and also get the throughput so you don't drive the cost of that particular step-up and there is a lot of those steps in the process.
So I think both our technology roadmaps and our productivity roadmaps have come together in a way that we are better able to provide the customer with value than ever before in the history of the company. And I couple that with the market opportunity that I've communicated to the industry now here for the last several months that we are seeing a similar confluence of demand that we haven't seen since the mid-90s.
And with the rebuilding of the infrastructure, with the necessity for governments to rebuild their infrastructure in the IT arena both from a standpoint of cyber security and citizen security from a travel standpoint, we are going to see tremendous continued demand for computing capability, as well as mass storage, which is going to continue to drive DRAM, NAND flash, microprocessor technology to solve these problems and we are well positioned to help our customers meet the demands their customers are putting on them in a cost-effective way. And I'd tell you, it's a good industry again. I've been encouraging kids to get into it in college at this juncture.

I wanted to ask you about something that is company-specific.

So I'm wondering was the company - and I think I might have asked this last call too, but was the company that inefficient before or are there products and sort of initiatives that you've scrapped and you are focused on particular verticals of say, PECVD or HVP and you were more broadly playing in those markets before, because it's just such a significant number that I'm wondering where that change is coming from.

Now, about two years ago now, maybe it's three, I lose track of time, it seems to go faster as I get older, we came to you and had announced that we had a plan to bring down our operating expenses and I think you may have been one of the people that says there was no way you could bring them down unless we close businesses. And in fact, we didn’t and we didn’t close businesses nor have we needed to close businesses. We needed to refocus our efforts and make sure we were making the right choices, not buying things in anticipation of demand and not embarking on programs we didn’t think were successful.
And I think we very, very successfully refocused our R&D methodology back to where it was and that's enabled us - so if you go back and you look at the 90s, you'll see that our R&D levels back at these kinds of levels were at this type of investment level. And we think we can churn out new products very, very effectively and if you read the press, you'll see that we continue to churn out technology and I think you will see something in the next six to eight weeks that will also surprise you.
And it is because we are very, very focused and we are very, very determined to be as efficient as possible with R&D and only focus on the things we believe will be successful. And it's that simple, it isn’t cutting businesses, not abandoning product lines, but it’s making sure that we get a return on technology and use the best and brightest minds we have in the company to determine which technologies are unlikely to be successful and not be working on those.
And we have made a lot of those determinations and you know something? In 95% of the cases, we've been absolutely right. I mean, one of the things that people were pouring a lot of money into were cobalt lining layers, okay? We made sure we are not pouring any money into that because we knew it really was not a technology that made any sense. And as a result, we haven't wasted a lot of money on it.
And so we feel very, very good about our technical prowess in the company and our ability to make choices technologically and I think that's what enables us to operate at these levels and we will continue to do that without any loss of new products coming out the door.

There may be periods of time when we see tremendous opportunity for new products because we have some vision that we might spend 16% on R&D.

So I think it all depends upon the situation and the opportunities that are in front of us.

But at that juncture in time, we will be looking at other opportunities, is there something else we could do, and if we have an innovative idea, we won't hesitate to spend the money.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. I’m pleased to announce another outstanding quarter where we met or exceeded our guidance and continue to improve on all key financial metrics such as operating leverage, profitability and cash flow from operations. Before I get into the specifics, I’d like to preface my comments by stating that our Q2 actual and Q1 comparative results will be discussed on a GAAP basis.
So with that, second quarter 2010 bookings were $385 million, up 20%, which was at the midpoint of our mid-quarter update guidance range of up 15% to 25%. The quarter-over-quarter increase on orders was driven primarily by foundry, and we saw continued strength in memory and a broadening of the overall customer base.
Q2 shipments were $332 million, up 17% sequentially, and ended on the higher end of our mid-quarter update guidance range of $315 million to $335 million. Second quarter revenues were $321 million, which was up 16% sequentially, and came in just above the high end of our mid-quarter update guidance range of $300 million to $320 million.
Our second quarter revenues by geographic region are as follows. The United States, 24%; Greater China, 44%; Korea, 21%; Japan, 3%; Europe, 8%. Second quarter gross margin was 48.8%, up from 48.5% in Q1 2010 and at the midpoint of our guidance range of 48% to 50%. Operating expenses in the second quarter totaled $84 million, which was in line with our model, where we expect to apply 7% of every incremental shipment dollar to operating expenses.
Our Q2 effective tax rate was 15.7%, which is on the low end of our guidance of 15% to 20%. We currently expect our effective tax rate for the year to come in at the lower end of that range. Second quarter net income was $63 million or net margin of 19.7%, which resulted in fully diluted earnings per share of $0.66, which exceeded the mid-quarter update guidance range of $0.55 to $0.62. We exceeded guidance due to higher revenue, operating expense control, improved tax rate, and share repurchases.
Moving now to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $743 million in cash, short-term investments, and long-term investments, which included $114 million in restricted cash. That total was down $9 million from $752 million in the prior quarter. We generated $104 million in cash flow from operations in the first quarter, which was 32% of revenue. Net income included non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization of $10 million and stock compensation of $9 million.
Cash flow from operations was offset by stock buybacks, which totaled $107 million in the quarter. We purchased 4.4 million shares of stock for an all-in cost per share of $24.57. $681 million remains authorized for repurchase under our stock repurchase program, which expires in October 2011.
Accounts receivables decreased modestly in the second quarter to $153 million despite a healthy increase in shipment levels resulting in record low DSOs of 43 days, down from 50 days at the end of Q1 and better than our ongoing targeted range of 50 to 60 days. Inventory increased by approximately $20 million on a sequential basis as a result of higher shipment levels forecasted in the third quarter. Inventory turns remained unchanged from Q1 at 3.4 times.
In closing, Q2 was an outstanding quarter from a financial results perspective, as we demonstrated our operating leverage as revenue increased and our cash generation capability. And I look forward to reporting continued improvement in Q3.
That concludes by remarks. Now I’ll turn it over to Rick who will comment on the state of the business followed by third quarter guidance for our key financial metrics.

Obviously, it must have been a good promotion since our financial results are so good. I’d like to also take a moment to acknowledge Jeff Benzing’s retirement after 23 years. He did a great job as a Chief Administrative Officer, and of course, he will be with us through the end of the year as an advisor to me. Jeff has been an integral part of the company and he will be an integral part of the company over the next four years as he phases into his retirement.
Next, I’d like to talk a little bit about the major announcements that we have today. You may have seen earlier today that we announced our new SABRE 3D platform, and there are three launch applications announced today that includes the TSV application for through-silicon vias, a bump application for the packaging environment, and also the redistribution layer. I’m very happy with the productivity of our engineering organization, and I’ll talk about that a little bit more in the Q&A session.
As John outlined in his discussion, we had great overall operating results. We have improved on every key financial metric from operating leverage and profitability to cash flow generation. And we intend to continue our drive for more and more efficiency in the company. In addition, as he reported, we purchased in the quarter 4.4 million shares at an average price of $24.57 and year-to-date have purchased back about 5.1 million shares at an average price of $24.15.
Our headcount ended the quarter at a total of 2,594. That’s through June of 2010. Our inventories, while they were up in absolute dollars due to growing shipments, as a percent of our forward shipments, they continued to improve. DSOs are down due to great work on our field and finance organizations collection process, and our plant equipment is continued to be controlled and assets continued to reduce as we manage CapEx going forward. And our cash flow from operations was an absolute remarkable $104 million for the quarter, which we are very, very pleased with.
Now with that, I will give you an update on the overall business environment. The third party electronics revenue forecast was raised 12%, up from 9% on the heels of very strong demand for PCs, smart phones and consumer electronics. And we currently do not see that slowing at this time. Third party forecasts for semiconductor revenues were increased recently to 27% compared to 20% one quarter ago. And as I mentioned in our mid-quarter update in May, we saw upside to 30%. Based on our own market research, we think the rate for 2010 could be slightly higher rate of 30% to 35%.
Utilization levels for quarter two were 94% and are likely to edge up to about 96% in the third quarter due to increased demand and seasonality, particularly in the foundry activity. Both DRAM and NAND average selling prices held up in the second quarter due to tight supply and third-party forecast for DRAM and NAND prices for the back half of the year remain relatively unchanged with only modest decreases near the end of 2010. I’m not sure we will see those decreases. I, in fact, hope that we don’t, as that will continue to be another more solid sign for continued strong CapEx spending.
Due to the strength across our customer base, our forecast for CapEx growth in fiscal year 2010 is greater than the 83% currently forecast by industry sources. We believe that we will be able to outgrow the industry CapEx growth by our targeted 50% in fiscal year 2010. So overall, business is very good.
With that, here is our guidance for the third quarter. We expect bookings to be flat to up 10%. And you might remember that I forecast good strong bookings on the high side in the second quarter that we would see flat bookings in the third with continued second half growth over the first half. So we still expect the second half growth to be greater than the sum of the first half.
Second, shipments are forecasted to be up sequentially from $345 million to $375 million in the third quarter. Our revenue is forecasted in the third quarter up sequentially in the range of $335 million to $365 million. Our gross margin is forecasted to improve to 50%, plus or minus 1%. And the earnings per share is forecasted to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.90 per share.
Now that concludes my comments on the guidance for the third quarter. Now I’d like to open it up for any questions that you might have.

Can you walk us through what’s going on in terms of particularly gross margins?

So at some point in time, 450 will become a reality. I still think it’s a little ways off. There are some technological hurdles that we need to overcome. And what we don’t want to do is just barge ahead without a lot of forethought. Otherwise we risk taking down the entire industry. And so that’s been our position for quite some time. I know I was quoted in an article here about six months ago where I said there probably will be a time for 450. It’s just still a little ways out. I do believe it. Okay. Next question.

They really hit this next Christmas cycle and the back-to-school cycle that’s going on. And so there is just a slight pause here. But my expectation is when I see what’s lined up on the table, as long as end demand remains strong, which I think it will for the reasons I just defined a couple of seconds ago, you are going to see them come back into the market as they digest the equipment we sold and they are going to be pulling us to try to accelerate deliveries, thereby accelerating orders.

But I’m starting to see a strengthening of the foundry again, as there is another phenomenon going on. 8-inch capacity is being obsoleted left and right. You’ve got company after company who have been operating inefficient 8-inch fabs. And with the downturn, they’ve made decisions, we’re getting out of the fab business, and there is tremendous amount of 8-inch and even 6-inch silicon that’s been being produced and is now going to jettison itself into 300-millimeter granted older technology line within the foundry. But I think that’s a phenomenon you see play out. We see approximately five - the equivalent of 550K wafer start - 300-millimeter wafer start factories needing to be put in over the next five years to absorb all of this what I would call inefficient 300-millimeter silicon, with systems whereby the clock to maintain them is becoming much higher than if people could make the transition in the foundry.
So I think people are starting to see that. It’s gone critical from the standpoint of there is not a critical mass to sustain that equipment and it’s got to move to 300. I think that’s going to help the equipment business over the next five years with a few more extra fabs going in. So I don’t see foundry slowing up. I, in fact, see the NAND coming in along with foundries remaining pretty solid. There are over 40 8-inch fabs that have been decommissioned in the downturn. And if you do a simple math, divide it by 2.25, that’s saying there is a lot of fabs that have to be put in place to pick that capacity up or at least capacity. It’s going to fill excess capacity and they are going to put in some additional capacity for that. Okay. Thank you very much.

We want our model to be profitable, both in the upturns, and as you can tell, it’s become very, very profitable. And we wanted to maintain profitability within the downturn. And as a consequence, we got to make sure that we don’t build in too much fixed cost infrastructure.

So they are cautious. But one of the things in these conversations that we find is that the place that demand is really the strongest and the most surprising is in China and in developing nations. Now, it has its set of problems associated with it because it tends to be on the lower end of technology, but it’s rapidly pushing up into the high end of technology.
And clearly, with this push to strengthen the RMB, that does nothing but help people with high technology, selling high technology into the Chinese market, because by having strengthening RMB, their ability to buy the best technology and have it sealed just like it’s a local cheap technology, they can get better for the same amount of money. And I think that’s a factor that’s playing into what’s going on today. I think as that market matures, like everyone else and everywhere else, people want very, very high quality goods. You know, you see the success Apple is having worldwide. I think that’s happening with another number of companies on a smart phone aspect. I think from the standpoint of personal computer technology, that’s becoming pervasive even in developing countries. I think those are all good fundamental building blocks to strong end demand over the next couple of years.

And I think you will see those being filling over the next 12 months. I think that the key today is density of output. The fact is if you’ve got highly productive dense output machines, that enables customers to really monetize their factory and output more wafers within a given factory. And we are benefiting in some areas particularly well from this. And we think that’s going to continue for a while. But you are going to see new factories building in China. There is a new factory that’s going to go in 300-millimeter in Shanghai with Huali. That’s going to be going in. So I do see Greenfield fabs are starting to come into play. And it’s a matter of at what point do they pull the trigger. And obviously, with construction down in a lot of places, the ability to put a fab up in nine months is the reality today when that used to be a year-and-a-half - a year to a year-and-a-half at some other regions. So my expectation is the next leg up for this, you will see more groundbreaking. And I think that’s what you are looking for.

So one could argue that sort of the transition everyone is talking about this becoming more like a pure cyclical, but the stock is really trading like that right now. So the market is already treating it sort of like a pure cyclical. So if you don’t agree with that, I would think that you would continue to be pretty aggressive on the buybacks. So I guess I’m wondering what your thought is on the buyback going into September and December. Should we expect you to be similarly bullish given some of these valuation numbers?

I’m pleased to announce another outstanding quarter where we met or exceeded our guidance and continue to improve operating leverage and maintain strong cash flow generation.Before I get into the specific",765,"Thank you, Robin, and good afternoon everyone. I’m pleased to announce another outstanding quarter where we met or exceeded our guidance and continue to improve operating leverage and maintain strong cash flow generation.
Before I get into the specifics, I’d like to preface my comments by stating that throughout the rest of my remarks I will be distinguishing between GAAP and non-GAAP results. The non-GAAP results exclude a total of $5.1 million of charges primarily related to the consolidation of the Switzerland [ph] Industrial Applications Group manufacturing facility into Germany. I’ll refer to them collectively going forward as other items. A detailed breakout of these items, by type is included in today’s press release.
So with that, third quarter 2010 bookings came in at $407 million, up 6% compared to the second quarter and slightly above midpoint of the guidance range, which was flat to up 10%.
As a result of increased business levels, third quarter shipments were $363 million, up 9% for the second quarter. Shipments also finished near the midpoint of our revised guidance range at $355 million to $375 million. Third quarter revenues were $367 million, up 14% over the second quarter, which came in just above the high end of our revised guidance range of $345 million to $365 million. Our third quarter revenues by geographic region are as follows. United States 22%, Greater China 36%, Korea 31%, Japan 4%, Europe 7%.
Third quarter gross margin on a GAAP basis was 49.1%, excluding $2.5 million in other items, gross margin came in at 49.8% in line with the midpoint of guidance. Third quarter operating expenses totaled $91 million on a GAAP basis, excluding $2.6 million and other items and non-GAAP operating expense were $88 million for the quarter. Our data model and increased our operating margin from 22.8% to 25.8% quarter-over-quarter. Other came in as an expense of $132,000. We had approximately $1 million of net interest income, which was offset by approximately $1.1 million of net, unrealized foreign exchange losses due to currency fluctuations and impact on the U.S. dollars held offshore.
The third quarter tax rate without other items was approximately 14%. We now expect our fiscal 21 effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, to be approximately 15% and specifically for the fourth quarter, the tax rate expected to be approximately 14%.
Net income for the third quarter on a GAAP basis was $76 million or $0.82 per fully diluted share excluding $5.1 million in other items, net income on a GAAP basis was $81 million or $0.88 per fully diluted share, [Inaudible] high-end of revised guidance range of $0.80 to $0.90.
Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $786 million in cash. Short-term investments, restricted cash and long-term investments, which is up $43 million from the $743 million ending balance in the prior quarter and up from $713 million at the beginning of the year. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $82 million and for fiscal 2010 year-to-date, it is $248 million. Net income for the quarter included non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization of $9 million and stock compensation of $9 million.
Additionally, CapEx for the quarter was $6 million. In the quarter, we use $38 million to repurchase approximately 1.6 million shares of stock on an average price of $24 under our authorized stock repurchase program. Approximately, $643 million remains authorized for repurchases under our stock repurchase program, which expires in October 2011.
Accounts receivable in the third quarter, increased by 30% to $199 million as a result of increased shipment levels. And our DSO came in at 49 days, which is slightly better than our ongoing target range of 50 to 60 days. Inventory increased at modest 1% over Q2 despite the continued growth in shipment levels, this is attributed to improved inventory controls, order management and forecast accuracy. Inventory turns improved quarter-over-quarter and came in at 3.8 times, up from 3.5 times in Q2.
So in summary, Q3 was another outstanding quarter from the financial results perspective. Our operating leverage improved, and cash generation remains robust. Before I turn the call over to Rick, I would like to point out that during the fourth quarter, we modified our equity compensation plan to provide certain retirement benefits. As a result of this modification, we expect to incur approximately $10 million of additional stock compensation expense in the fourth quarter. That concludes my remarks.
Now, I’ll turn it over to Rick who will comment on the state of the business, followed by fourth quarter guidance for our key financial metrics.

It’s nice to report another great quarter of operating results, and as John just outlined in his discussion, we continue to execute on our financial model with increased profitability and strong cash flow generation of $82 million in the quarter. In addition, as he reported, in the quarter we purchased 1.6 million shares at an average price of $24 per share. And that brings our share count down to I believe approximately 91 million shares outstanding. And we leave the quarter with very, very strong cash as we ended the quarter, so we feel very, very good about that.
Now with that, I would like to update you on the business environment and then provide guidance for our fourth quarter. For 2010, we benefited from the PC refresh cycle, also enterprise storage utilizing a solid-state hybrid architecture, which is stimulated demand for NAND flash and a robust smartphone market for growth.
Now according to third party estimates, growth for 2011 is looking to see the same demand drivers, including the introduction of new competitive to the iPad tablet products. Additionally, as we said in the past, we don’t believe the current communications infrastructure is sufficiently robust enough to support the growing demand for mobile graphics and video, both domestically and in the emerging Asian markets and therefore we expect to see the continued gentrification of the worldwide internet infrastructure.
And lastly, the information technology applications were used in defense and intelligence have room for a significant improvement and further proliferation. So we continue to believe the necessary demand drivers to feel growth for our business long-term remain intact. Closer to our capital equipment business as we expected global semiconductor utilization levels through the September quarter remain very high at an average of about 97%. This is largely been due to under investment in the previous years and continued growth in the use of integrated circuits in almost every application, consumers need today.
Quarter four utilization is expected to be in line with seasonal level in the 90 plus percent range, which is a trigger point for continued investment. Now our expectation for annual semiconductor revenue growth of 30% to 35% in CapEx growth of approximately 100 plus percent in 2010 remains unchanged. The current unstable macroeconomics for the general economy and weakening in memory prices could potentially impacts some of our customer’s profitability and potential their forecasted levels of investment in the short-term, but the long-term remains very solid.
With that here is the guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect bookings to be from up 10% to down 14%. This large range is due to the timing of our customers’ projects and an unstable macroeconomic situation along with concerns with tax laws and governmental spending that’s worrying people for private investment. Our shipments are forecasted to be up sequentially, between 5% to 13% to $380 million to $410 million.
Our revenue is forecasted to be flat, up 5% or $367 million to $385 million. This is the result of market share gains and newly won product positions with the customers. As you may have noticed, shipments are forecasted to increase in the quarters. And revenue does not track directly and that is because the timing of acceptances and the required revenue bifurcation under our revenue recognition policy is causing a revenue lag for the new customers. We have the requirement of having two systems accepted in new applications at our customer base. So this is why the revenue and the shipment don’t track directly.
Our growth margin is forecasted to be 50% plus or minus 1%. Our GAAP earnings per share is forecasted to range from $0.73 to $0.88 and on a non-GAAP basis between $0.85 to $1.00.
That concludes my comments and guidance for the fourth quarter. And now I would like to open it up for any questions you may have.

Depending upon what happens from a standpoint of elections and taxes, and how the market holds up through the year. If the market holds up and these tax cuts are made at least temporarily extended, I think that will bode well for end demand.
But if the tax law isn’t extended, these tax breaks are not extended, and we see a great dip in the market as a result, because I do think the market is forecasting that the tax cuts will be extended. That would make people not feel very wealthy and it could adversely affect the potential for 2011. So I think a lot of hinges in the next few weeks, and I think the mid quarter update will get a better feel for our customers on whether they are going to get bullish or remain tentative on their investment levels. But right now I think people are tending to be tentative because there is so much uncertainty, and that’s globally, not just in the United States.

End demand is the function of the confidence of the consumers in the market, and that’s global consumers.
If I had to make a statement right now, I think global consumers are relatively strong. Corporate consumption has been relatively strong, globally now I’m talking about, not just in the United States, obviously, United States it’s been more muted from a consumer standpoint but not very, very weak. And if there is confidence that the markets are stable, I think at these levels people feel as though they have wealth. So to the extent the financial markets can remain stable, I think that we’re going to have a good first and second quarter.
It would be tough, I mean, I couldn’t name all of the bookings at this point in time. I am just giving you how I read the tea leaves when I look at what’s going on macro economically. But having said that, there is a lot of uncertainty and so it’s very, very difficult to project the first and second quarter. But I don’t see it falling off; I don’t see us having a 2009 end of 2008 phenomenon happening unless there is a financial melt up. So that’s the best I can give you on how I am thinking.

And I think the capital markets have become more efficient, the ability to be able to get capital if they don’t think they can succeed is a lot more limited and so that war is against the weaker DRAM players. I think the strong DRAM players have extremely impressive technology and it’s going to be hard for the Tier 2s to catch up although if they can find the available cash, it is possible to do. So I think you will see continued investment in the Tier 1 and you will see selective investments in the Tier 2.
Relative to NAND Flash, my expectation is you will see and again as just trying to look into my crystal ball and looking past tomorrow is hard enough. But I think 2011 is going to bring some pretty significant technological advances in NAND Flash technology that are really going to make its viability as the mainstay of non-volatile memory a reality. And I am excited about the future. That’s not to say that there aren’t technological hurdles, but this industry has a way of always solving them.

There are major decisions that are going to be made between now and the end of the year relative to taxes that are greatly going to influence both the consumer and also corporations on their decisions for investment. 
A huge tax increase at this juncture, I believe is not priced into the market. If there was a huge increase AKA the bush tax cuts expire, then I think that, that will greatly cause people who are tentative to hold back their investment and that is from the consumer standpoint all the way to a corporate standpoint. So I think that uncertainty is what’s giving us the wide birth in the order outlook.

So I probably think that, that sort of plays itself out. I think that as the technology transition happens with NAND flash to new advanced technologies, I think that we will see an ever-increasing share of Novellus products in the majority of NAND flash products. We believe some of our products are clear enablers for advanced technology. So that’s just a general feeling.

I’m just not quite sure how to address your question. So capital intensity we’ve typically always said okay for $1 of investment how much revenue do you get out, right? And so the amount of equipment you need stays pretty constant to increase capacity but as the ASP comes down, even though we try to increase throughputs it’s tougher, you see an increasing capital intensity from that perspective. I think with NAND flash there’s a wider profit margin on NAND flash right now so its capital intensity is perceived as being lower.
I think that what you will find is as the next generation of technology comes out, the cost per bit will be so attractive. You will get a much greater acceleration in the unit demand and therefore, the key to success in this next generation is going to be not only the quality of the films but also the throughput of the films and that’s why I think it’s such a great opportunity for Novellus and I think we’ll rise to the occasion and really help enable that next generation of NAND technology that will make it viable to replace a bigger segment of hard disk drives with solid state memory. 
And so that’s how I look at it. And so the bottom line is, ASPs will come down in NAND flash and that capital intensity will appear to go up but from an actual amount of equipment that’s used, employed to build a NAND, there’s not a huge amount of difference. I hope that helps? I hope I’m answering the question you asked?

It’s a good question, and let me try to clarify. So from a bush cut standpoint that the consumer, okay. You’re going to have a large tax bite despite the way everybody spends it, the amount of disposable income people will have will be dramatically less if those are repealed. So that’s one element of it. 
Going along with those tax changes are recommended tax changes for corporation, then as you highlight it, the Novellus effective tax rate has dropped dramatically over the last few years, and that has been accomplished because for a long time our business has been moving to Asia and more and more of our sales are in Asia. We modified our structure to take advantage of the tax laws that allow us to pay the taxes in the area from where our product is being delivered and as a consequence, our effective tax rate is lower.
Now, part and parcel to what’s being contemplated is to remove all those tax benefits, and I’m sure you’ve heard of all these, I know you’re very in tune with that. And what’s going to happen is if all of those opportunities to really match our revenue in the region we’re in with the tax structures in the region, our tax rates would go up dramatically, and all those would have an adverse effect on investment. And so that’s what I’m talking about. And I just sort of blended them all together. So I apologize for that.
