I am going to pick up on slide four which shows a topics that I would like to discuss today. First, the full-year and fourth quarter results for Pinnacle West as well as a primary variances from 2008's fourth quarter, the outlook for the Arizona economy, our earnings outlook for 2010 and 2011 and an update on our liquidity.
Beginning on slide five, with full-year results to provide an overall context for our financial performance, on a GAAP basis, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $68 million or $0.67 per share for 2009, compared with net income of $242 million or $2.40 per share for 2008.
Consolidated ongoing earnings or non-GAAP measure. For 2009, our ongoing earnings were $236 million or $2.33 per share compared with 238 million or $2.36 per share in 2008, which was in line with our expectation of a reasonable range around $3. A reconciliation of our full-year GAAP EPS to our ongoing EPS is shown on slide six. These amounts exclude results from a real estate segment for both years, because of the major SunCor restructuring we launched in early 2009.
Don will provide an update on SunCor in a few moments. In 2008, ongoing earnings also exclude income tax credits related to prior years, severance costs related to an APS work force reduction and favorable resolution of a tax matter related to the 2005 sale of a power plant.
Focusing on results for the fourth quarter as shown on slide seven. For the fourth quarter of 2009 on a GAAP basis, we reported a consolidated net loss attributable to common shareholders of $30 million or $0.30 per share, compared with a net loss of $39 million or $0.39 per share for the prior year fourth quarter.
From an ongoing perspective, we had consolidated net loss of 16 million or $0.16 per share for the 2009 fourth quarter, compared with a net loss of $9 million or $0.08 per share for the prior year fourth quarter. A reconciliation of our fourth quarter GAAP EPS to our ongoing EPS is shown on slide eight.
I will continue to focus my remarks on our ongoing results, which as I stated earlier exclude results from the real estate segment for both quarters as well as severance cost and a favorable tax matter resolution as I previously mentioned.
Moving to slide nine, in the variances that make up the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share, first, an increase in our regulated electricity segment gross margin added $0.06 per share over the prior year fourth quarter. Several pluses and minuses comprise this net variances and I will cover those variances in more detail on the next slide.
Second, fourth quarter results benefited $0.02 per share from lower costs related to infrastructure investment. The major components of this positive change were lower property taxes, primarily related to lower assessed valuations, which produced an improvement of $0.05 per share. The lower property tax were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense of $0.02 per share and interest expense, net of capitalized financing costs of $0.01 per share.
Third, an increase in O&M costs decreased earnings by $0.10 per share in the quarterly comparison. The higher O&M reflects an increase in generation costs including more planned maintenance as well as customer service and other costs. We had run substantially behind budget throughout the year and the increase in quarter represents a partial catch up of prior year short fall and is not representative of an annual run rate.
I will address costs in more detail in a moment. This change in O&M excludes expense related to the renewable energy standard or RES in our demand side management efficiency efforts because these costs are offset by a respective rate surcharges. To help with the analysis, we have provided the amount of pretax RES and DSM revenues recorded by quarter over the last three years in the appendix to today's slides.
There was no contribution from marketing and trading activities this quarter, which negatively impacted the quarter by $0.05 per share. As we have stated before, this was due to our planned reduction of our unregulated activities. The last two major contracts which were negotiated earlier this decade rolled off in 2008 and were not repaid. Other items net reduced results by $0.01 per share.
Turning to slide 10, in the drivers of the net increase in regulated electricity gross margin, total regulated gross margin was up $0.06 per share compared with last year's fourth quarter. The components of that increase are as follows. Retail rate increases favorably impacted our quarterly results by $0.10 per share. Of this amount, $0.07 per share related to the interim rate increase that became effective at the beginning of January 2009. The remaining $0.03 per share r related to the 2009 transmission of rate increase that went into effect June 1 through our formula rates and August 1 through our retail transmission cost adjustor.
Turning to the volume metric effects related to weather and kilowatt-hour sale, weather variations approved our earnings by a penny a share as both fourth quarters were slightly milder normal. Our quarterly results were negatively impacted by $0.05 per share related to lower weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales after netting the impacts of customer growth and customer usage.
In this year's fourth quarter, APS' customer base grew half of 1% compared with 1% in prior year's fourth quarter. Weather normalized retail sales however were down 2.4% for the year, as a whole. These results mirror the consumer reaction seen in the broader economy, a corresponding increase in customer conservation and the effect of the ACC approved energy efficiency and demand-side management programs. I will provide more color on the state of our common -- economy momentarily.
The non-cash mark-to-market valuation of APS fuel and purchase power hedges, net of SA deferrals was better by $0.05 per share compared with a career ago. This variance was made up entirely of the reversal of a negative mark-to-market from last year's fourth quarter. There was no meaningful mark to market in this year's fourth quarter, primarily reflecting stability and natural gas prices. For your reference, our mark-to-market amounts by quarter for the past three years are also shown on the appendix.
Lastly, the net effect of other miscellaneous factors reduced our gross margin by $0.05 per share. Looking at the Arizona economy in our fundamental growth outlook, we currently expect customer growth to average about 1% annually for 2010 through 2012.
Additionally, we expect our weather-normalized retail sales in kilowatt hours to be relatively flat from 2010 through 2012, because of the impact of the national economy, the housing situation in Arizona and APS energy efficiency programs.
A quarter ago, I mentioned that the Arizona economy still has to deal with substantial excess inventory of homes and apartments. This situation remains true today and is a principle reason for our moderate outlook for near-term growth.
In to last year, the Phoenix metropolitan area continued to add housing supply in excess of demand. At the end of the year, however, supply growth had fallen more in line with demand and 2010 represents the first year we are likely to start within away at the excess housing inventory. We continue to expect economy both nationally and locally to improve as we move into 2010.
Importantly, we expect consumer confidence to improve along with the rising economy which should allow for a modest recovery in residential usage patterns, ignoring weather effects and the impact of the energy efficiency programs. Usage by our commercial industrial customers, on the other hand, is likely to remain flat as office and retail properties struggle with high vacancy rates, we expect a peak in 2010.
Over the longer term, we remain confident of Arizona's fundamentals. We expect customer growth and usage to return to stronger levels as the national state economic environments improve.
Turning to our outlook on slide 11, we expect that our consolidated ongoing earnings for 2010 will be between $2.95 and $3.10 per share. For your reference, the assumptions and key factors underlying our 2010 estimate are listed in the appendix to today's slides and in our earnings release.
In addition, we estimate our 2011 ongoing consolidated earnings will be within the guidance range for 2010 ongoing consolidated earnings with some opportunity for modestly exceeding the range.
On slide 12, I want to talk cost management as it is fundamental to our ability to improve our financial results.
First, I would like to congratulate the employees at APS on their relentless focus on costs in 2009. We came in on or under budget across the board in O&M costs in 2009. Additionally, in terms of capital spending, we were able to defer our canceled projects as well. And as a result, we came in significantly below budget in capital expenditures.
We are keenly focused on managing our costs and identifying efficiencies and savings throughout the organization. Our cost management efforts will help improve our financial results beyond those achievable through the retail regulatory settlement which Don will address shortly.
I believe that 2009 sets the stage for the future. As we look to 2010, we expect operating expenses, less the cost of programs that are recovered through regulatory surcharges, to be comparable to 2009. A major opportunity we have identified for generating significant cost savings while producing effective operating results is enterprise-wide supply chain management. This initiative involves collaboration between our supply chain group and the various business units. This effort has been scoped and we will be implementing this transformation in phases over several years.
Based on the results of our recent efforts, we project annual cost savings of approximately $20 million in 2010 increasing to approximately $30 million to $40 million in the future. Of the annual savings, 40% will be attributable to O&M and 60% will be attributable to capital costs.
Another cost saving opportunity is Palo Verde. Following the plant's return last year to normal scrutiny by the U.S. nuclear regulatory agency, we believe we will be able to lower its annual operating costs, ultimately achieving by 2013 our goal of less than $0.02 per kWh in operating costs.
Although it's too early for me to affix a dollar amount, we do know we must insure that we balance cost savings with safe operations. We are creating a culture focused on cost effectiveness and operational excellence. Management is encouraging innovation and rewarding success. We believe these efforts will continue to produce savings.
Now, I will give you a quick update on our liquidity. As shown on slide 13, we closed on two, new three-year revolvers on February 12th to replace facilities scheduled to mature in December of this year. APS now has a $500 million revolver that replaced a $377 million facility. This new $500 million revolver is in addition to the $489 million facility that matures in 2011.
In addition, the parent company has a new $200 million revolver that replaced a $283 million facility. We don't have any long-term debt maturities outside of SunCor until 2011 and our liquidity remains very good. We will continue to focus on increasing cash flow generation as a way to further reduce our need for external financing.
And before I turn over to Don, I would just like to say, as it relates to equity, the need for us to issue equity in 2010 is quite clear. First and foremost, we will issue to support our credit metrics to maintain the current rating.
Additionally, as you recall, 2010 will be a test year for APS and we need to calibrate the capital structure back to our 53.8% equity component. We will not discuss timing for obvious reasons. However, I would say this. You saw on this liquidity slide, the ample amount of liquidity that APS has.
Additionally, we will be pre-dividend cash flow neutral and with no short-term debt outstanding at APS at year-end, we enter 2010 with a great deal of financial flexibility which gives us a great deal of flexibility as to when we would access the market.
And with that, I would like to turn over to Don.

Jim has already touched on two of the issues that are important to our investors, our growth and the Arizona economy. Although the recession has slowed our growth, Arizona's intrinsic economic strength is an attractive fundamental characteristic for our company.
During the fourth quarter, we made progress in key strategic areas and continued our record of excellence and operations. This morning, I will cover the following four topics. One, APS' retail regulatory settlement and the constructive regulatory frame work provided by that settlement. Two, our strong commitment to strong renewable energy resources, particularly solar. Three, our recent operating performance which demonstrates solid execution. And four, progress on the SunCor restructuring.
Regarding our regulatory settlement and the framework for the future, APS' retail regulatory settlement was approved by the Arizona Corporation Commission in December without material modification of the economics. Approval by the ACC commissioners was essential to allow our customers, investors and other stakeholders the opportunity to realize the diverse benefits intended by all of the settling parties. The settlement terms became effective on January first of this year, with a net increase in APS' retail prices of about 0.5% after reflecting a concurrent reset of the power supply adjuster annual rate.
In addition to the financial provisions, the settlement includes a number of provisions benefiting Arizonans including rate stability for APS customers and expanded renewable energy contribution for APS above the ACC's standard requirements and significantly expanded energy efficiency programs. The settlement demonstrated remarkable cooperation among the commission and the parties to the rate case to achieve the constructive outcome.
Looking ahead, APS and the various stakeholders have agreed to an expedited process for future general rate cases that should significantly reduce regulatory lag by allowing those cases to be processed in 12 months. With the settlement behind us, we will continue working with the commission and various stakeholders to further enhance the regulatory framework and processes to benefit APS customers and all other stake holders.
Now turning to renewable resources and operations, our commitment to renewables remains strong. If you will turn to slide 15, I will review APS's latest major renewable resource initiatives.
In the regulatory settlement, we agreed to acquire an additional 1.7 million megawatt hours of renewable energy resources, to be in service by the end of 2015. With the new additions, we estimate renewable resources will supply about 10% of APS's retail sales by the end of 2015, which is double the amount required of the ACC's renewable energy standard for that year. Clearly, our plans are on track to significantly increase the amount of renewable energy we provide to our customers.
Arizona's solar potential is among the best in the world. And we will remain strongly committed to solar energy and to making our state the solar capital of the world. Last fall, we filed an application with the Arizona Corporation Commission for approval of the AZ Sun Program. As proposed in the plan, APS would invest $500 million to develop and own at least 100 megawatts of Photovoltaic solar plants.
We currently anticipate the solar capacity will be placed into service in the 2011 to 2014 timeframe. However, the ultimate timing will depend on the outcome of current and future procurement processes. Consistent with the provisions of the regulatory settlement, we have asked that the cost of the AZ Sun Program including debt and equity capital costs be recovered through the renewable energy surcharge, until such costs are included in base rates or other recovery mechanism.
On February 10, the ACC staff issued its recommendation that the commission has approved the program as we requested. We currently expect the commission to consider staff's recommended order during its regular open meeting scheduled for March 2 and 3.
On January 27th, APS issued two requests for proposal for renewable resources. These RFPs are part of the process for procuring the additional renewable resources required under the settlement. The first RFP is for utility scale solar photovoltaic project ranging in size between 15 and 50 megawatts.
In total, APS expects to procure 22000 megawatts-hours annually from this solicitation. Assuming ACC approval of the AZ Sun Program, this RFP will serve as the initial procurement step for implementing that program.
The second RFP is for wind projects ranging in size between 15 and 100 megawatts, to be located entirely within the state of Arizona. Proposals under both of the RFPs are due in April, respondents are to provide proposals for long term purchase power agreements and/or “turn-key” agreements under which the projects would be approximate built by the developers and then purchased by APS upon completion. The combination of these efforts with renewable initiatives we already have underway will be important steps toward advancing Arizona's sustainable energy future.
Looking at our operating performance, we are focused on continuing operational excellence. We have been recognized for top tier customer service and fossil plant performance. Further, we continually strive to maintain top quartile performance throughout the organization. And we constantly seek to improve performance in every facet of the company.
Our delivery business again had one of the best years ever from a reliability perspective. Our retail customers experienced the lowest average outage time per customer we have ever recorded. Our 2009 performance ranked well above the industry average. Strong customer satisfaction is critical to our success. Earlier this month, JD Power and Associates released the results of its 2010 business customer survey. APS's rating placed us in the top ten nationally among the 47 large segment electric utilities included in the study.
Turning to power plant operations, in the fourth quarter, we completed a planned Palo Verde Unit 2 refueling and maintenance outage. During the outage, we replaced the unit two reactor vessel head and installed a rapid refueling package which will reduce the time required for future refuelings. Because of the extent of this planned additional work, the outage lasted 60 days which was in line with our schedule. We plan to make similar reactor head replacements and refueling package installations during the Unit 3 and Unit 1 refueling outages in the spring and fall of 2010 respectively.
In 2009, Palo Verde produced a site average capacity factor of 89%. Even with the planned, extended Unit 2 outage, Palo Verde had its second best production year ever, generating 30.7 million megawatt-hours. Palo Verde is the only U.S. generating facility of any type to ever exceed 30 million megawatt spot hours in a single year and it did so last year for the fifth time in its history.
Looking ahead, the Palo Verde team remains focused on achieving safe, sustainable, top quartile performance in all aspects of the plant's operation. We are making solid progress toward our established long-term targeting, including consistently achieving annual site average capacity factors of at least 90%, a goal we recently increased from 88% based on the plants performance successes.
Our other goals include refueling outages averaging 30 days or less, O&M costs excluding fuel $0.02 per kilowatt-hour and top quartile industry safety metrics. Our coal fired plants continued their run of top tier performance. In 2009, our coal fleet posted a capacity factor of 82%, which is well above the most recently available industry average of 73%.
Now I will turn to the SunCor restructuring for a few moments.
The plan announced in early 2009 involves a sale of a substantial majority of SunCor's properties. Execution of that plan made significant progress in 2009. SunCor's long-term debt was reduced to about $100 million as of December 31 from 175 million at the end of the first quarter of 2009.
SunCor continues to pursue the sale of its remaining properties. SunCor's principle credit facility matured at the end of January. SunCor and its lenders are discussing an extension of the maturity to date to allow time for SunCor to continue discussions regarding the potential sale of certain properties.
To wrap it up, 2009 was a year of incredible change and progress at our company. Clearly, our team accomplished a lot and established a solid base for the future. I am excited and optimistic about the prospects for Pinnacle West and APS in the years ahead.
Through focused strategies and sound execution, we will continue to drive this company forward. Additionally, we are committed to improving our earnings and financial metrics and thereby sustaining our credit ratings and common dividends. We are keenly aware of the vital importance of the dividend to our investors and thus to our ability to attract capital to fund Arizona's energy future.
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. At this time we would be pleased to take any questions.

The only other thing I would add on the cost side, on that especially as it relates to '11, Dan, as we have the pension essentially capped under the settlement 2011. And that is one of the big, if we look at the cost side of the equation -- O&M and pension are probably two bigger drivers. And with that capped, it will be our ability to execute on the cost savings and the timing of actually achieving those. I would also add to what Don mentioned, just the fact that shared services, which includes accounting finance, HR, IT, are also -- we will be reviewing their efficiency as we get into 2010.
In terms of drivers, '10 to '11, we are showing no retail sales growth in '11 over '10 or '10 over '09. To the extent the economy comes back a little quicker that would be potentially a positive. And we have zero in there. So it could still go negative and that would be the flip side of that. So I think we are a little optimistic at the -- here at the bottom. I think you mentioned transmission, although I would just caution that if you look at our cost reductions on CapEx beginning in '08. A big piece of that capital was in transmission, as we pushed that out later. And we do have the Qayak [ph] as revenue in 2011 at $25 million from the 23.
Growth could impact that both ways as well. I guess to the extent growth comes back a little earlier, we could see that go up. I think the other key piece and maybe the variable in here, is the timing of Arizona Sun getting into service. We don't have a material contribution from Arizona Sun in our 2011 guidance. And to the extent, we get approval in the RFP process, our ability to put that in service earlier would be a positive contribution as well. And then I will also point out the relentless focus on O&M.

The topics I will discuss today are shown on Slide 4. First I'll review the consolidated quarterly results and discuss the main variances from last year's corresponding quarter. Second, I'll provide a brief update on the economic outlook",1736,"Thank you, Becky. The topics I will discuss today are shown on Slide 4. First I'll review the consolidated quarterly results and discuss the main variances from last year's corresponding quarter. Second, I'll provide a brief update on the economic outlook for Arizona. Then I will discuss our earnings guidance for 2010 and '11 and I'll close with brief comments on our financing activity and liquidity.
Slide 5 summarizes our reported and our ongoing earnings for the quarter. On a GAAP basis, for this year's first quarter we reported a consolidated net loss attributable to common shareholders of $6 million or $0.06 per share, compared with a loss of $157 million or $1.55 per share for the prior year's first quarter.
From an ongoing earnings perspective, first quarter earnings improved significantly over last year. For the 2010 first quarter, we had consolidated ongoing earnings of $7 million or $0.07 per share, versus an ongoing loss of $25 million or $0.25 per share for the comparable quarter a year ago.
A reconciliation of our first quarter GAAP EPS to our ongoing EPS is shown on Slide 6. Both periods exclude results from the real estate segment because of SunCor's major restructuring launched in early 2009. I will provide update on SunCor in a few moments. I will focus my remaining comments on first quarter results on an ongoing basis.
Moving to Slide 7, the variance that makes up the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share; first, an increase in our regulated electricity gross margin added $0.20 per share over the prior year's first quarter. There are several components to this net variance and I will cover those variances in more detail on the next slide.
Second, our effective income tax rate for the year decreased from 38% to 35%, which improved earnings in the quarter by $0.08 per share. We've now cleared all federal tax shares through 2007 and this positive change is the result of adjusting our accruals to reflect such actions.
Third, other income, net of other expense improved $0.05 per share, primarily because of an investment loss in El Dorado in last year's first quarter and, fourth, a net increase in O&M costs decreased earnings by $0.04 in the quarterly comparison. The O&M variance reflects labor expenses which were partially offset by lower generation costs in this year's first quarter, including effects of timing of fossil plant maintenance.
On that note I would like to emphasize that our O&M numbers are in line with expectations and we continue to work towards fairly flat 2010 O&M numbers when compared to 2009. This change in O&M excludes expenses from the renewable energy surcharge or RES, on our demand side, management and energy efficiency efforts because these costs are offset by respective rate surcharges. To help with your analysis, we have provided the amount of pretax RES and DSM revenues recorded by quarter for the last couple of years in the appendix to today's slides. Other miscellaneous items net, improved our results by $0.03 per share.
Turning to Slide 8 and the drivers of the net increase in regulated electricity gross margin, total regulated gross margin was up $0.20 per share compared to 2009's first quarter. The components of that increase are as follows. Retail rate increases favorably impacted our quarterly results by $0.20 per share. Of this amount $0.14 per share related to net base rate increase and $0.03 per share related to line extension fees recorded as revenue.
Both of these items became effective January 1st of this year under APS's retail regulatory settlement. The remaining $0.03 per share related to the 2009 transmission rate increase that went to effect last summer to our FERC formula rates and our retail transmission cost adjuster.
The non-cash mark to market valuation of APS's fuel and purchase power hedges net of PSA deferrals was better by $0.02 per share compared with a year ago. This variance reflects a smaller decline in mark to market than we saw in last year's quarter as forward natural gas prices fell by 15% during this year's first quarter compared with a slightly larger decline a year ago. For your reference, our mark to market amounts by quarter for the past couple of years are shown in the appendix.
Turning to the volumetric effects related to weather and kilowatt-hour sales, weather variations improved our earnings by $0.02 per share as the 2010 first quarter was about normal but last year's first quarter was mild. Our quarterly results were negatively impacted $0.02 per share related to lower weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales compared to 2009, reflecting the impacts of customer growth and customer usage.
In this year's first quarter APS's customer base grew 0.6% compared with 0.8% in the prior year's first quarter. Weather normalized retail sales were down 1.7% in this year's quarter. All this decline came in the C&I segment and of that decline approximately two-thirds can be attributed to the effects of our ACC approved energy efficiency and demand-side management programs while the other one-third reflects the continuing weakening economy in Arizona and in the nation and its impact on the C&I sales category. I'll provide more color on our economy momentarily. Lastly, the net effect of other miscellaneous factors reduced our gross margin by $0.02 per share.
Turning to Slide 9 and looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy, we currently expect the annual customer growth to average about 1% for 2010 through 2012. Additionally we expect our annual weather normalized retail sales and kilowatt-hours to be relatively flat from 2010 through 2012 because of the impacts of the national economy, the housing situation in Arizona and APS's energy efficiency programs.
However, for the full-year 2010, we expect weather normalized retail kilowatt-hour sales to be down slightly, compared with year 2009 primarily because of the first quarter effects I've already discussed. In the first quarter of this year we began to see some signs of stability in the Arizona economy. As shown on Slide 9, housing prices appear to have stabilized as shown on the graph on the left-hand side of the slide.
Additionally as shown on the graph on the right-hand side of the slide, trends in occupied office space are positive again after several quarters of decline. However, occupied retail space is continuing to fall after reaching its peak in early 2008 and it is not showing any similar signs of recovery.
Turning to Slide 10, job growth appears to have stabilized as well, when looking sequentially quarter-over-quarter, although unemployment is still high and the number of jobs is some 4% less than a year ago. Furthermore, the Arizona Department of Commerce is predicting net job losses increasing in 2010, although they predict the rate of decline will slow at approximately 25% of the 2009 level.
Other indicators of local economic activity have improved somewhat, including growth in household earnings as reflected in personal income tax with holdings which showed a modest positive gain in February for the first time since 2007. Taken as a whole, we are cautiously optimistic that the Arizona economy may have found a bottom and that we can begin the long process of recovery. We continue to expect the economy both nationally and locally to improve as we move through 2010.
Importantly, we need to see more robust customer confidence along with the rising economy in order to support a modest recovery in residential usage patterns, ignoring weather effects and the impacts of our energy efficiency programs. Usage by commercial and industrial customers, on the other hand is likely to remain down as office and retail properties struggle with their high vacancy rates. Over the longer term, we remain confident of Arizona's fundamentals. We expect customer growth and usage to return to more normal levels as the national and state economic environments improve, albeit offset somewhat by APS's efficiency efforts.
Just turning to our earnings outlook on Slide 11, we continue to expect that our consolidated ongoing earnings for 2009 will be between $2.95 and $3.10 per share. The key factors and assumptions underlying our 2010 estimate have not changed except for the following two items.
For the year overall, we currently expect weather normalized retail-kilowatt sales volumes to be slightly below 2009 levels, in part due to our energy efficiency initiatives and in part reflecting the weakness in the C&I segment in quarter results and as I have already mentioned, our ongoing effective income tax rate is expected to be about 35%.
For your reference, I would point you to the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 19th, 2010 for the other assumptions and key factors underlying our 2010 outlook. In addition, we continue to estimate our 2011 ongoing consolidated earnings to be within the guidance range for 2010 ongoing consolidated earnings with some opportunity for modestly exceeding the range.
Turning to Slide 12, now I'll just give you a quick update on our liquidity and recent financing. We continue to have ample liquidity, a stable credit profile and access to the capital and bank markets. Amounts shown on this slide include pro forma adjustments to reflect $253 million of proceeds from our issuance of 6.9 million common shares in mid-April including exercise of the over allotment option by the underwriters. We have almost $1.2 billion of available liquidity including the net proceeds from the common stock offering.
With this equity issuance completed, we do not currently intend to issue common stock again until at least 2012, based on our current plan. On that point I want to emphasize what Don said kicking off the equity road show that our offering, although smaller than anticipated by most is sufficient. Additional equity infusions will come from the approximately $80 million in tax benefits generated through the SunCor asset liquidation in the remainder of this year or other sources of proceeds.
We have infused the net equity issuance proceeds as well as other funds into APS to fund its capital expenditures to expand and maintain the electric infrastructure. The sale of the SunCor properties continues to progress albeit at a slower pace in light of the economic and real estate market conditions. SunCor has a forbearance agreement with its banks that ends June 30. We are continuing to actively pursue an orderly wind down that business.
And that concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call over to Don.

We appreciate your time and your interest. Jim's already touched on one of the issues that's important to our investors, our growth in the Arizona economy. Altho",1121,"Thanks, Jim and again, thank you all for taking the time to join us on the call this morning. We appreciate your time and your interest. Jim's already touched on one of the issues that's important to our investors, our growth in the Arizona economy. Although the recession has slowed our growth, Arizona's intrinsic economic strength remains an attractive fundamental characteristic for our company.
During the first quarter we made progress in key strategic areas and continued our record of excellence in operations. I'll update you on the following topics today. One, the Arizona regulatory developments; two, our strong commitment to renewable resources, particularly solar and three, our recent operating performance which demonstrates solid execution.
Looking first at Arizona regulation, given our history over the past several years, it's unusual for me not to be discussing a pending retail rate matter. APS's recent regulatory settlement with a set rate that became effective January 1st, was progressive and contained broad ranging benefits for all parties. With that settlement in place, we are continuing to work with the Arizona Corporation Commission and various stakeholders to further enhance the state's regulatory framework to benefit APS's customers and other stake holders.
The commission has been conducting workshops on several generic policy topics that address topics such, decoupling to enable and encourage utilities to meet energy efficiency goals, feed-in tariffs for renewables, externalities and line extensions; the workshops or inquiries to gather information from various stakeholders about broad policy issues. Although, these workshops are in early stages, we view the Commission's consideration of these issues to be positive steps that can further enhance the regulatory environment in Arizona.
The elections this fall will result in change of the Commission as two of the five seats will be on the ballot. Chairman Mayes is term limited, so her seat will be filled by a new Commissioner. Commissioner Pearce is running for reelection for a second term. In total, there are currently seven candidates for the two seats, three republicans, three democrats and one independent.
The field will be narrowed to two candidates from each party following the primary election in late August with final elections in November. Turning to renewable resources and operations, our commitment to renewables remains strong. Arizona's solar potential is among the best in the world, and we are on track with our plans to significantly increase the amount of renewable energy we provide to our customers.
APS's AZ Sun Program which is outlined on Slide 14 is a recent development of significant interest to the investment community in our customers. Although, we already have entered into sizeable purchase agreements for solar and wind power, and we own several solar plants, AZ Sun will be our first significant step toward owning large utility scale solar facilities. Under the plan, APS will develop and own 100 megawatts of photovoltaic solar plants with an estimated cost of up to $500 million.
We anticipate this solar capacity will be placed into service in 2011 through 2014. The AZ Sun Program was approved by the Corporation Commission on March 3rd, along with constructive rate recovery consistent with the regulatory settlement including a return on both equity and debt capital. As such, when these facilities go into service we will begin to fully recover our costs and earn our full allowed rate of return on equity capital invested in these facilities.
Costs of the first 50 megawatts of AZ Sun will be recovered through the renewable energy surcharge until such costs are included in base rates and or another recovery mechanism. Costs for the remaining 50 megawatts will be recovered through the renewable energy surcharge or another rate adjustment mechanism to be determined in APS's next retail rate case, which is expected to be filed in June of 2011.
In January, APS issued two requests for proposal for renewable resources. These RFPs are part of the process for procuring the additional renewable resources required under the regulatory settlement. Respondents were requested to provide proposals for long-term purchase power agreements and our turnkey agreements under which the projects would be built by the developers and purchased by APS upon completion.
The first RFP was for utility scale solar PV projects ranging in size between 15 and 50 megawatts. In total, APS anticipates procuring 220,000 megawatt hours annually from this solicitation. This RFP serves as the initial procurement process for implementing the AZ Sun Program. The second RFP was for Arizona wind projects ranging in size between 15 and 100 megawatts.
APS received proposals under both of the RFPs in April. The response to those solar RFP was exceptionally strong while there were also a number of win proposals. We are currently evaluating the proposals with a plan to short list viable bidders by the end of this month with a goal of finalizing arrangements with selected bidders by late summer. Any further discussion of the proposals at this time would be premature while we are in the evaluation phase.
In the regulatory settlement, we agreed to acquire an additional 1.7 million megawatt hours of renewable energy resources to be in service by the end of 2015. With the new additions, we estimate renewable resources will supply about 10% of APS's retail sales by the end of 2015, which is double the amount required under the Corporation Commission's renewable energy standard for that year.
The combination of these efforts with renewable initiatives we already have underway will be important steps in advancing Arizona's sustainable energy future. Looking at our operating performance, our baseload nuclear and coal fleet continues to perform very well. In the first quarter, our Palo Verde nuclear plant operated at a 96% capacity factor. Unit 1 is currently in a refueling outage, which began on April 3rd. During this outage, we will replace reactor vessel head and install a rapid refueling package. We completed a similar refueling outage at Unit 2 last fall and plan to perform similar work at Unit 3 this fall.
Looking ahead, the Palo Verde team remains focused on achieving safe sustainable top quartile performance in all aspects of the plant's operations. Our coal-fired plants continue to operate at top tier capacity factors, well above the recently available industry average of 73%.
In the first quarter our coal fleet posted a capacity factor of 80%, which was slightly ahead of our expectations and last year's first quarter results. We are focused on continuing operational excellence and we constantly seek to improve performance in every facet of the company. Through focus strategies and sound execution, I am confident we'll continue to move this company forward.
That concludes our prepared remarks this morning and operator, at this time we would be pleased to take any questions.

I want to also point out any quarter like the first quarter where you're typically zero net income, your tax rates are going to be screwy. But if we look at overall, over the year the impacts it will have for 2010, in the first quarter it was about $0.08. I think for the year that's going to run at a 35% rate, somewhere in the vicinity of about $0.13 - $0.14 over the course of the year just from my lowering of the tax rate, assuming we hit the midpoint of the guidance.

And so we think sales could potentially be weaker than we thought going into the year. That trend continues. And looking at historical regression analysis, sales growth is highly correlated to job growth in Arizona and again, we don't see a big pickup in job growth. In fact, the Department of Commerce sees a loss of jobs in 2010. So I think while we're getting the positive benefit of the lower tax rate, we are seeing the effect on gross margin from that.

We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements.

First, I’ll review the consolidated quarterly results and discuss the main variances from last year’s corresponding quarter. Second, I’ll provide a brief update on the status and outlook for the Arizona economy. Then I’ll discuss our earnings guidance for 2010 and 2011, and finally, I will close with a brief comment on our liquidity and financing.
Slide five summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter. On a GAAP basis for this year’s second quarter, we reported a consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $115 million or $1.07 per share compared with net income of $68 million or $0.68 per share for the prior year’s second quarter.
From an ongoing earnings perspective, results for the quarter increased $0.08 per share compared to the 2009 quarter. Specifically for the 2010 second quarter, we had consolidated ongoing earnings of $90 million or $0.83 per share versus $76 million or $0.75 per share for the comparable quarter a year ago.
A reconciliation of our second quarter GAAP EPS to an ongoing EPS is shown on slide number 6. The amounts for both quarters exclude results related to our discontinued real estate segment and our district cooling operations was sold in the quarter.
On slide number 7, I’ll provide a few details about our discontinued operations. In the second quarter, we made significant progress on SunCor’s major restructuring that was launched in early 2009. With sales of a number of properties closed successfully during the second quarter ended July, SunCor has reduced its outstanding debt to about $6 million.
We currently expect to complete the restructuring within 12 months, so the entire real estate segment is now classified as discontinued operations. As a result of the SunCor restructuring, we estimate the parent will realize approximately $110 million of cash tax benefits by this spring of 2011.
On June 22, APS energy services sold its district cooling business. The sale further signified our strategy to streamline our business and focus on our core utility operations. Financially, the sale resulted in a gain in the quarter of $25 million and produced after tax cash proceeds of about $70 million.
In the remaining second quarter earnings comments, I will focus on our ongoing results. If you move to slide number 8, you will see the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share.
First, an increase in our regulated electric segment gross margin added $0.10 per share compared with the prior second quarter. Several pluses and minuses comprises net variance and I will cover these items in more detail on the next slide.
Second, lower operations and maintenance expenses improved earnings by $0.04 per share reflecting a number of cost effectiveness efforts across the organization. This change in O&M, of course, excludes expenses related to the renewable energy surcharge or RES in our demand-side management and energy efficiency efforts because those costs are offset by respective rate surcharges. We have provided the amounts of the pre-tax RES and DSM revenues that were recorded in the quarter over the last couple of years in the appendix to today’s slides.
Our company-wide emphasis on cost-effectiveness continues to be a major focus. I’d mentioned these efforts in prior calls and I believe we are on track to achieve the amount of savings we were expecting. These initiatives and other efforts should help us achieve our goal to keep operational O&M relatively flat in the near term.
Third, other income, net of other expenses decreased earnings $0.04 per share primarily because of net investments losses related to certain non-qualified benefit plans
Fourth, the increase in shares outstanding resolving from our April equity issuance decreased earnings by $0.04 per share in the quarterly comparison. The net effect of other miscellaneous items improved our results by $0.02 per share.
Turning to slide number 9, in the components of our net increase in regulated electricity gross margin. Total regulated gross margin was up $0.10 per share compared with 2009 second quarter. The components of that increase were as follows; retail rate increases favorably impacted our quarterly results by $0.26.
Of this amount, $0.21 per share related to a net base rate increase and $0.02 per share related to line extension fees recorded as revenue. Both of these items became effective January 1st of this year under APS’s retail regulatory settlement.
The remaining $0.03 per share related to the 2009 transmission rate increase that went into effect last summer through our FERC formula rates and our retail transmission cost adjuster. Don will provide an update in his comments on the 2010 transmission rate changes, which will begin impacting our results in the third quarter.
Higher weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales compared with the second quarter a year ago improved our quarterly results by $0.02 per share. This year-over-year weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales increase is our first quarterly increase since the third quarter of 2008.
In this year’s second quarter, APS’s customer base grew 0.7% year-over-year ago levels. Weather normalized retail sales were up 0.6% in the quarterly comparison, after reflecting the effects of our ACC approved energy efficiency and demand-side management programs. I’ll provide more color on the economy momentarily.
The non-cash mark-to-market valuations of APS fuel and purchase power hedges, net of related PSA deferrals lowered earnings by $0.03 per share compared with a year ago. This variance reflects a small mark-to-market impact in this year’s second quarter and the reversal of the second quarter 2009 favorable mark. For your reference, our mark-to-mark amounts by quarter for the past couple of years are shown in the appendix slides.
The main story in the second quarter comparison was weather. Unusually mild weather, especially in April and May, decreased our earnings by $0.15 per share. This year’s quarter was inordinately mild, while last year’s second quarter weather was relatively normal. In fact this May was the mildest in more than a decade. Residential cooling degrees were 17% lower than in the second quarter a year ago.
Looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy, we currently expect the annual customer growth to average about 1% for 2010 through 2012. Additionally, we expect our annual weather-normalized retail kilowatt-hour sales to be relatively flat from 2010 through 2012 because of the impacts of the national economy, the housing situation in Arizona, and APS’s energy efficiency programs.
However, for the full year 2010 we expect weather-normalized retail kilowatt-hour sales to be down slightly compared with the year 2009 primarily because of the first quarter effects, which I discussed on our last call. In the second quarter of this year, we continue to see signs of stability in the Arizona economy.
As shown on slide number 10, housing prices and commercial building occupancy in the Metro Phoenix area have stabilized over the last couple of quarters. On the commercial side, vacancy rates are expected to peak at very high levels this year, but the trends in demand for both office and retail space are positive again after several quarters of decline.
Turning to slide number 11, Arizona job growth has turned positive when looking sequentially quarter-over-quarter, although unemployment remains very high. Total non-farm payroll is up year-over-year, yet construction remains very weak. Other indicators of the total economic activity have improved somewhat, including growth in household earnings, as reflected by personal income tax withholding trends.
That said there is no change in our outlook from last quarter. Taken as a whole, we continue to be cautiously optimistic the Arizona economy has found a bottom, and we can begin the long process of recovery. We expect the economy, both nationally and locally, to improve gradually as we move through 2010.
Importantly, we need to see more robust consumer confidence in order to support a stronger recovery in the residential usage patterns ignoring weather effects and the impacts of our energy efficiency programs, but we have yet to see this improvement.
Similarly, commercial and industrial customer usage is likely to remain flat as office and retail property struggle with weak demand for the balance of this year. Over the long-term we remain confident of Arizona’s fundamentals, and we expect customer growth and usage to return to stronger levels as the national and state economic environments improve.
Turning to our earnings outlook on slide number 12, we continue to expect our consolidated ongoing earnings for 2010 will be between $2.95 per share and $3.10 per share. Year-to-date we have been able to offset the impacts of weather with the focus on costs. However, we still need third quarter weather to cooperate for us to stay within current guidance. I will point out July on a cooling degree-day basis for residential customers was 10% above normal.
For your reference, a list of assumptions and key factors underlying our 2010 outlook is included in the appendix to today’s slides. In addition, we continue to estimate our 2011 consolidated ongoing earnings will be within the guidance range for 2010 consolidated ongoing earnings, with some opportunity to modestly exceed that range.
Now a quick update on liquidity and financing. We continue to have ample liquidity and access to the capital and bank markets. At June 30, the parent and APS had combined cash positions totaling $45 million and no short-term borrowings outstanding.
We have total about $1.2 billion of available liquidity. Additionally, the cash tax benefits related to the SunCor property sales and the after-tax cash proceeds from the district cooling business sales should reduce our need for future equity issuances.
Lastly, on June 28 Standard & Poor’s changed the outlook to positive on its credit ratings of both APS and the parent company debt. We are pleased S&P recognizes the progress we have made to-date. However, it is imperative that we continue to execute against our operating plan.
This concludes my prepared remarks. I’ll turn the call over to Don.

I know you’ve got a busy day ahead of you and appreciate your time on our call. Jim’s touched on several issues that are important to our investors, including our growth in the Arizona economy. Although i",1502,"Thanks, Jim, and thank you all for joining us. I know you’ve got a busy day ahead of you and appreciate your time on our call. Jim’s touched on several issues that are important to our investors, including our growth in the Arizona economy. Although it is evident that the recession has slowed our growth, Arizona’s intrinsic economic strength remains an attractive, distinguishing characteristic for our company.
During the second quarter we made distinct progress in some key areas and continued our track record of excellence in operations. Accordingly I’ll update you on the following topics this morning; one, regulatory developments; two, our strong commitment to renewable resources; and three, our recent operating performance.
First, looking at regulatory matters, we continue to work with the Arizona Corporation Commission and other various stakeholders to further enhance the state’s regulatory framework to benefit APS’s customers, our shareholders, and other stakeholders.
The Commission has been conducting workshops this year on several generic policy issues affecting Arizona regulation. The workshops addressed topics such as weather and what financial mechanisms are needed to enable Arizona utilities to meet the Commission’s energy efficiency standard with a particular focus on decoupling; transmission planning and the development of renewable transmission lines; feed-in tariffs for renewable resources; externalities and utility line extension policies.
These workshops were intended to gather information from various stakeholders about the topics at hand. We view many of the Commission’s inquiries to signal positive developments in Arizona’s regulatory environment. We anticipate additional progress on many of these issues throughout the remainder of the year.
Along those lines last week the Commission unanimously approved its Energy Efficiency Standard and rules. This rulemaking which still requires certification from the Arizona Attorney General, sets aggressive targets for energy efficiency achievements that step up each year from 2011 through 2020 with cumulative savings equal to 22% of retail sales.
As with other matters, APS participated actively in the ACC’s energy efficiency rulemaking proceedings and advocated for regulatory mechanisms such as decoupling that would minimize the adverse financial impact of meeting aggressive energy efficiency goals.
The new rules require the Commission to firmly address this issue, a requirement that has resulted in a productive series of workshops focused on addressing utilities’ financial disincentives and the potential de-coupling for Arizona utilities as I previously noted.
APS views implementation of an effective de-coupling mechanism or similar device in its next rate case is essential to achieving the Commission’s energy efficiency standard. APS is the leading provider of energy efficiency programs in Arizona.
Through 2010, we expect to achieve cumulative savings of about 3.5% of our retail sales. Both energy efficiency program cost and performance incentives awarded for achieving certain goals were recovered automatically through APS’s demand side management adjustment cost. Our retail regulatory settlement also requires cumulative savings of 3.75% from energy efficiency programs implemented in 2010 through 2012.
Both the settlement and the rules provide APS enhanced performance incentives for achieving these ambitious goals. For 2010 we estimate that APS will earn incentive revenues of about $7 million pre-tax collected through the Adjustor Clause. As reflected in our 2011 energy efficiency implementation plan now pending before the Commission, we expect that amount to grow for 2011.
On the rate front, this summer APS’s FERC formula rate update operated to reduce our annual transmission revenues by $12 million pre-tax. This decrease resulted from lower cost reflected in the normal operation of the FERC formula. $2 million of this amount became effective at the wholesale level on June 1.
Last week the Arizona Corporation Commission approved a related reduction of $10 million annually in Arizona retail rates through APS’s transmission cost adjuster and that change is effective August 1 of this year.
This fall elections will result in change at the Arizona Corporation Commission as two of the five seats will be on the ballet. Chairman Mayes is term limited, so her seat will be filled by a new commissioner, and commissioner peers is running for reelection for a second term.
In total, there were currently nine candidates for the two seats; three republican, three democrats and three write-in candidates. The field will be narrowed to two candidates from each party plus the write-in candidates following the primarily election on August 24 with final elections this November.
Turning to renewable. Our commitment to renewable resources remained strong. We’re on track with plans to significantly increase the amount of renewable energy we provide to our customers. Arizona’s solar potential is among the best in the world making solar energy an obvious choice.
APS’s AZ Sun Program, which is outlined on slide number 14, will be our first significant step toward owning large utility scale solar facility. To recap the AZ Sun Program, APS plans for developing on 100 megawatts of photovoltaic solar plants with a capital investment of up to $500 million.
We currently anticipate this solar capacity will be placed in the service in the years 2011 through 2014. However, the ultimate timing will depend on the outcome of current and future procurement processes.
The AZ Sun program was approved by the Commission on March 3 with very constructive rate recovery, including returns on equity and debt capital. As such, we will now have to wait for a general rate case to begin recovering all our cost, and we’ll be earning a full return on these facilities when they are placed in the service.
As discussed on our last call, we received an exceptionally strong response to our request issued earlier this year for proposals for PV solar projects. We have shortlisted bidders and are in the process of negotiating contracts, which will allow development of a portion of AZ Sun.
We plan to complete contracts in the next several months, because we are currently in final negotiations. Further discussion of the proposals at this time would be premature. Also, earlier this year as part of a commitment made in our regulatory settlement, APS issued a Request for Proposals for Wind Projects to be physically located in Arizona.
All proposals we received were for purchased power agreements. In last month, we executed a 25-year agreement with the developer of a 99 megawatt project to be built in Northern Arizona.
That agreement is subject to approval by the Arizona Corporation Commission to developer plans to have the project in commercial operation in the late 2011 or 2012 timeframe. The combination of these efforts with renewable initiatives we already have underway are important steps in advancing Arizona’s sustainable energy future.
Looking at our operating performance now, our base load nuclear and coal fleet continues to perform admirably. In the second quarter, our Palo Verde nuclear facility operated at an 80% capacity factor comparable with last year second quarter.
Both quarters included plant refueling outages, the most recent quarterly performance reflected the 50-day Unit 1 refueling outage which began on April 3. During the outage, we replaced the reactor vessel head and installed a rapid refueling package.
We completed a similar refueling outage at Unit 2 last fall and plan to complete the work for the third unit, Unit 3, during its plant refueling this fall. Because of the extent of the additional work, each of these outage typically last 50 days to 60 days. Other than the Unit I refueling outage during the second quarter, there was only one outage day at the Palo Verde facility continuing the strong operating performance.
Looking ahead, the Palo Verde team remains focused on achieving safe, sustainable, top-tier performance in all aspects of the plant's operations. On the fossil side of our business, our coal and gas-fired plants have completed their planned spring maintenance outages and are performing well helping meet our customers’ energy needs, particularly during our summer peak months.
Regarding customer service, last month J.D. Power and Associates released results of its 2010 residential customer survey. I’m very pleased with APS’s continuing record of performance excellence and overall customer satisfaction. In seven of the last eight years, APS is ranked by residential or business customers in the Top 10 nationally among all large segment utilities in overall customer satisfaction.
In the most recent J.D. Power results, APS ranked third nationally among 55 large investor-owned electric utilities in the study. More specific to our region, we were rated second among the 10 investor-owned utilities in the west. In addition to the overall Customer Satisfaction Index, APS ranked in the Top 10 nationally on four of the six components of customer satisfaction as defined by J.D. Power.
Not only in customer service but throughout our organization, we continually strive to maintain top-tier performance, and we constantly seek to improve performance in every facet of our company.
As Jim discussed we have sold a number of Pinnacle West non-core assets and our focus looking forward is a strong commitment to maintaining operational excellence and achieving superior financial results by concentrating on our core utility business.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, at this time, we will be pleased to take any questions.

Before I turn the call over to our speakers, I need to cover a few details with you. First, our slides today are available on our investor relations website along with our earnings release, supplemental information on our earnings variances and quarterly operating statistics, the webcast and the Form 8-K we filed this morning.
The slides contain reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial information. Please note that all of our references to per share amounts today, will be after income taxes and based on diluted shares outstanding.
Also, it is my responsibility to advise you that this call and our slides contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. Because actual results may differ materially from expectations, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statements contained in our third quarter 2010 Form 10-Q which was filed with the SEC this morning, as well as the MD&A section which identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements.
A replay of this call will be available on our website www.pinnaclewest.com for the next 30 days. It will also be available by telephone through November 3rd. At this point, I’ll turn the call over to Jim.

As you see on slide four, the topics I will touch upon today are first, a review of the consolidated quarterly results and discuss the main variances from last year’s corresponding quarter. Second, I will provide a brief update on the status and outlook for the Arizona economy. Then I will discuss our earnings guidance for 2010 and 2011. Finally, I will close with some brief comments on financing and liquidity.
Slide five summarizes our reported and ongoing earnings for the quarter. On a GAAP basis, for this year’s third quarter, we reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $234 million, or $2.14 per share compared with net income of $187 million or $1.84 per share for the prior year’s third quarter. Our ongoing earnings increased $0.12 per share. For the 2010 third quarter, we had consolidated ongoing earnings of $227 million, or $2.08 per share versus $198 million or $1.96 per share for the comparable quarter a year ago.
A reconciliation of our third quarter GAAP EPS to our ongoing EPS is shown on slide six. The amounts for both quarters excluding results primarily related to our discontinued real estate operations. In July, Suncor sold land parcels, commercial assets and a master plan home building community and as a result, has reduced its outstanding debt to about $6 million.
As a result of the Suncor restructuring, we estimate the parent will realize approximately $110 million of cash tax benefits. As a result of bonus depreciation being extended into 2010, we now expect those tax benefits will be realized in 2012 as compared to our prior expectation of 2011. And as always, my remaining comments will focus on ongoing results.
Turning your attention to slide seven, you will see the variances that drove the change in quarterly ongoing earnings per share. First, an increase in our regulated electricity segment gross margin, added $0.27 per share compared with the prior year’s third quarter. Some pluses and minuses comprised this net variance and I will cover those items in more detail on the next slide.
Second, an increase in capitalized financing costs, also known as allowance for funds used during construction, or FDEC, improved earnings by $0.06 per share primarily because of increases in the rates used to capitalize such costs.
Third, the net impact of miscellaneous items increased earnings by $0.05 per share. The primary factor affecting this comparison was continuing favorable resolution of tax matters, which we discussed on our first quarter call.
Fourth, the increase in shares outstanding resulting from our April equity issuance, decreased earnings by $0.14 in the quarterly comparison.
Fifth, higher operations and maintenance expenses decreased earnings by $0.09 per share. The expense increase largely reflects higher employee benefit costs and the acceleration of a fossil plant overhaul. This change in O&M excludes expenses related to the renewable energy standard, or RES and our demand side management and energy efficiency efforts because as you know, these costs are offset by respective rate surcharges.
We have provided the amount of pre-tax REF and DSM revenues that were recorded by quarter over the last couple of years in the appendix of today’s slides. Our cost containment initiatives and other efforts continue and we should achieve our goal to keep operational O&M relatively flat in 2010.
Finally, higher infrastructure related costs decreased earnings by $0.03 per share reflecting increases in both property tax and depreciation.
Turning to slide eight and the composition of the net increase in our related electricity gross margin, total regulated gross margin was up $0.27 per share compared with 2009’s third quarter. The components of that increase were as follows; retail rate increases favorably impacted our quarterly results by $0.33 per share.
Of this amount, $0.30 per share related to net base rate increase and $0.03 per share related to the line extension fees recorded as revenue. Both of these items became effective January 1st of this year under APS’s retail regulatory settlement.
Weather improved earnings by $0.02 per share since actual cooling degree days in the quarter were above normal and similar to last year’s third quarter, the favorable variance was mostly attributable to the increase in average humidity of approximately five percent over the same period in 2009.
Lower weather normalized kilowatt hours sales compared with the third quarter a year ago, decreased our quarterly results by $0.05 per share. Weather normalized retail kilowatt sales were down 1.7 percent in the quarterly comparison, largely reflecting the effects of our ACC approved energy efficiency and demand side management programs.
Customer growth of six tenths of one percent over year ago levels, helped offset the decline in sales. I’ll provide more on the state of our Arizona economy momentarily.
The net effects of miscellaneous other gross margin items decreased our results by $0.03 per share.
Looking at our fundamental growth outlook in the Arizona economy; we currently expect annual customer growth to average about one percent for 2010 through 2012. Additionally, we expect our average weather normalized retail sales and kilowatt hours to be relatively flat from 2010 through 2012 because of the impacts of the national economy, the housing situation in Arizona and APS’s energy efficiency programs.
However, for the full year 2010, we expect weather normalized retail kilowatt hour sales to be down compared with the year 2009 as a result of a combination of our energy efficiency programs and weak underlying demand.
In the third quarter of this year, we continued to see signs of stability in the Arizona economy. As shown on slide nine, housing prices and commercial building occupancy in the metropolitan Phoenix area have stabilized over the past couple of quarters.
Excess housing in the Phoenix metro area is starting to be absorbed as the demand for housing continues at low levels, but faster than new supply being added. We expect this situation to continue for at least two to three years.
On the commercial side, vacancy rates are expected to peak at very high levels this year, but the trends in demand for both office and retail space are positive again after several quarters of decline.
Taken as a whole, we continue to be cautiously optimistic the Arizona economy has found a bottom and we can begin the long process of recovery. We expect the economy, both nationally and locally, to improve gradually as we move through 2010.
Importantly, we need to see more robust consumer confidence in order to support our stronger recovery and residential usage patterns, ignoring weather effects and the impact of our energy efficiency programs, but we have yet to see this improvement.
Similarly, commercial and industrial customer’s usage is likely to remain flat as office and retail properties struggle with weak demand for the balance of this year. Over the long term, we remain confident of Arizona’s fundamentals. We expect customer growth and usage to return to stronger levels as the national and state economic environments improve.
Turning to our earnings outlook on slide ten, we continue to expect our consolidated ongoing earnings for 2010 will be between $2.95 and $3.10 per share. For your reference a list of assumptions and key factors underlying our 2010 outlook is included in the appendix to today’s slides.
In addition, we continue to estimate our 2011 consolidated ongoing earnings will be within the guidance range for 2010, with some opportunity for modesty in the range. Our 2011 forecast includes an expected contribution from our Arizona Sun program of about $0.03 to $0.04 per share, and Don will speak about the Arizona Sun program and its progress to date in a few moments.
Now, a quick update on financing and liquidity. Since the beginning of the third quarter, APS changed the interest rate modes on approximately $180 of its (push and troll) bonds from a daily rate mode to term rate modes. The letter of credit supporting each of these bonds were terminated in conjunction with the rate change.
These financing efforts enabled us to take advantage of current attractive interest rate levels, and to reduce bank liquidity utilization. Overall, we continue to have ample liquidity and access to capital and bank markets. We continue to believe we will not need to issue additional equity until at least 2012.
And that concludes my prepared remarks. Let me turn the call over to Don.

I know it’s a particularly busy day for you with all the earnings announcements and we hope to make it worth your while to be on our call. We look forward to seeing you next week at the EI financial conference.
Jim’s touched on several issues important to our investors including our growth in the Arizona economy. Although the recession slowed our historically robust growth patterns, Arizona retain numerous qualities that make it a desirable place to live and do business, and its past record of strong growth remains an attractive distinguishing characteristic for our company.
During the third quarter we made distinct progress in some key areas and continued our track record of operational excellence. Today I’ll update you on the following; first, Arizona regulatory developments, then our strong commitment to renewable energy resources, then our recent operating performance and finally, a regulatory matter related to our Four Corners Power Plant.
Looking first at Arizona regulatory matters, we continue to work with the Arizona Corporation Commission and various stakeholders to further enhance this state’s regulatory framework so as to benefit both our customers and our shareholders.
As I’ve discussed in the past, the commission has been conducting workshops on several generic policy issues affecting Arizona regulation. We view many of the commission’s activities as signaling positive development for Arizona’s regulatory environment and anticipate additional progress on many of these issues through the remainder of this year and well into next year.
At the time of our last earnings conference call, the commission had just approved its energy efficiency rules which await certification by the Arizona Attorney General. From APS’s perspective, the commission must implement an effective decoupling mechanism or similar device in the next APS rate case if APS is to achieve the rigorous energy efficiency standard contained in the rules.
Along those lines, on October 18th, Chairman Mayes issued a draft decoupling policy statement. The draft supports the concept of decoupling, calculated using the revenue per customer model that APS and a number of other parties endorses.
The proposed policy permits any interested utility to file a decoupling plan in its next general rate case. Comments from various stakeholders on the draft statement are due today. Subsequent steps by the commission prior to approving any policy statement will likely depend on the nature and extend of the comments received.
In addition to participating in the ACC’s generic workshops, we have been actively meeting with various stakeholders to identify and discuss matters specifically relevant to APS’s next general rate case which we plan to file in mid 2011. Discussion topics include for example, how to best our resource portfolio to serve the state’s future energy needs while meeting Arizona’s requirements for renewable resources and energy efficiency, and how to improve the efficiency and transparency of rate case proceedings with the goal of processing the rate case within 12 months as agreed upon on the last APS regulatory settlement.
Towards that end, the parties have drafted standard date requests which APS will answer and file at the same time it files the case and have identified other procedural efficiencies that should help accelerate the process.
On a related topic, next Tuesday’s elections will affect the composition of the commission, as two of the five seats are on the ballot. Commissioner Pearce, a Republican is running for re-election for a second term and Chairman Mayes on the other hand, is term limited so her seat will be filled by a new commissioner. There are currently seven candidate’s names on the ballot.
Turning to renewable energy resource additions, we’re on track with plans to significantly increase the amount of renewable energy that we provide to our customers. Slide 12 outlines APS’s AZ Sun program, our current model for developing and owning utility scale solar facilities.
To recap the AZ Sun program, APS plans to develop and own 100 megawatts of photovoltaic’s solar plants with a capital investment of up to $500 million. We expect that those plants will be placed in service in 2011 through 2014 and to date, we have announced projects totaling 33 megawatts with overall estimated capital expenditures of about $150 million.
These projects include one, a 15 megawatt facility to be sited at Luke Air Force Base just west of Phoenix. This project, which we plan to bring online in mid-2011, is expected to be the largest solar facility on U.S. government property, and two, an 18 megawatt plant in Gila Bend, Arizona about 70 miles southwest of Phoenix, which we plan to place in commercial operation in last 2011.
We continue to evaluate new projects and will provide updates as we progress under this important program. From a regulatory perspective, the corporation commission has approved a highly constructive rate recovery for the plants procured through the AZ Sun program.
Looking at our operating performance and a related regulatory matter, our base load nuclear and coal fleet continues to perform admirably. All three units at our Pale Verde nuclear facility operated at full power for the entire third quarter as they did in last year’s third quarter.
Palo Verde unit three is now undergoing a planned refueling outage that began on October 2nd. During this outage, we are replacing the reactor vessel head and installing a rapid refueling package. Work of this extent typically requires an outage to last 50 to 60 days. When finished, the program began in the fourth quarter of last year to install this equipment and all three Palo Verde units will be complete.
Looking ahead, the Pale Verde team remains focused on achieving safe, sustainable top tier performance in all aspects of the plant’s operations.
On the fossil side of our business, our coal fired and gas fired plants continue to meet our customer’s energy needs during our peak summer months. During the quarter, we optimized a forced outage at our (Cholla) unit number two by accelerating an overhaul that had been planned for next spring.
On October 6, the United States Environmental Protection Agency issued its proposed determination for best available retrofit technology or BART as it’s known, requirements for the Four Corners Power Plant. The EPA’s proposed measures are intended to address regional visibility, not health issues.
As proposed, these requirements would require plant participants to install new pollution control equipment on all five of the plant’s units to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulates.
We currently estimate that APS’s total cost for the proposed controls could be up to approximately $422 million nitrogen oxide controls and about $220 million for particulate removal equipment.
We are current completing an evaluation of the impact of the EPA’s proposed rule and intend to submit comments to the agency during the comment period.
On a more positive note, in the recent quarter, several prominent organizations recognized our company’s sustainability efforts. I’m pleased that for the sixth straight year, Pinnacle West was named to the Dow Jones sustainability index for North America and as one of the DAVOS global 100 most sustainable companies in the world.
Pinnacle West was one of only U.S. electric utilities included in the Dow Jones index and was one of only 12 U.S. based companies in any industry to be named to the Global 100. The company also ranked in the top one-third of the newly created, Just Means Global 1,000 sustainable performance leaders.
In summary, our company’s goal is to achieve top tier performance and we constantly work towards that objective in every facet of our business. Going forward, we are committed to maintaining operational excellence and achieving superior financial results by concentrating on our core utility business.
This concludes our prepared remarks and operator, at this time we’d be pleased to take any questions.

If you think about the decoupling mechanism that we had advocated as have most of the people in the open meetings, it’s a mechanism called fixed revenue per customer.
And the benefit for us is, as we continue to grow customer, we will continue to get incremental recovery of costs associated with not only the energy efficiency, but the additional customer growth on the system. So from our perspective, it doesn’t really mean a tradeoff between traditional regulation and decoupling. It’s really additive to the traditional regulation.
